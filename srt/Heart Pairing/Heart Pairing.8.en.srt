1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,370
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,570
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,740
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,140
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,180
- Heart Pairing starts again today.
- All right.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,310
(Heart Pairing begins.)

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,080
After the cast started
contract relationships last week,

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,920
- reactions started pouring in.
- Right.

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,220
Ji Min and Je Yeon,

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,550
(Couple number 1, Ji Min and Je Yeon)

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,950
Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul,

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,220
(Couple number 2, Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul)

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,490
Chang Hwan and Chae Eun,

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,490
(Couple number 3, Chang Hwan and Chae Eun)

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,530
and Woo Jae and Ji Won.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,590
We saw four couples in total.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,530
Which couple was most memorable to you?

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,900
- To me, Ji Min and Je Yeon.
- As expected.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,330
- Ji Min only cares about Je Yeon.
- That's right.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,700
So he doesn't even look at other women.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,070
(Ji Min only thinks about Je Yeon.)

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,970
Since they were in Italy,

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,640
Ji Min made a lot of effort.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,910
- Right.
- After the contract relationship started,

25
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,410
- his love for Je Yeon...
- Yes.

26
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,680
might have pierced through the screen.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,420
He expressed it that much.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,390
As I watched them, Je Yeon...

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,190
didn't look interested in the beginning,

30
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,290
but then she got curious about him.

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,560
She kept asking questions
and listening to his answers,

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
and that impressed me.

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,960
- A man needs to make that much effort...
- Right.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,500
- to win a woman's heart.
- That's right.

35
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,930
When a good-looking guy like Ji Min...

36
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,730
- makes that much effort,
- Exactly.

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,140
all of us need to work hard.

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,610
- Right. We need to work hard.
- We can do it!

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,670
We can do it.

40
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,540
To me, Woo Jae and Ji Won.

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,680
- Same here. Woo Jae and Ji Won.
- Yes.

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,310
Woo Jae and Ji Won's love line,
since the first episode,

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,610
was observed carefully.

44
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,180
Finally, they became a couple.

45
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,350
I give them a big hand.

46
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,150
- I wish they last long.
- We can't say they're a couple yet.

47
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,420
- They're having a good time currently.
- I see.

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,420
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,020
Woo Jae and Ji Won impressed me too.

50
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,960
When Ji Won took his arm,

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,660
(Ji Won suddenly took Woo Jae's arm.)

52
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,730
that scene...

53
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,730
- made a deep impression on me.
- That's right.

54
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,340
She said, "We're a couple."

55
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,010
I thought Woo Jae
and Je Yeon's relationship was solid,

56
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,680
but seeing Woo Jae and Ji Won
getting close so fast,

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,110
- That's true.
- I thought it was hard to predict.

58
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,150
- I can't forget Je Yeon's look.
- I know.

59
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,550
She didn't even know
how to hide her feelings.

60
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,620
That's what I'm saying.

61
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,990
She seemed to think,

62
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,320
- "How can his heart change so quickly?"
- I know.

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,060
Hosting "Heart Signal" and Heart Pairing,

64
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,360
I always feel...

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,670
- that there's someone who loves you,
- Yes.

66
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,730
and someone you're attracted to.

67
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,100
That's difficult.

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,800
- It truly is a difficult matter.
- Yes.

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,370
It really felt like dating.

70
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,840
It didn't feel like a contract.
It felt like a dating relationship.

71
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,550
Back then, it really felt
like I was in a relationship.

72
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,680
Hello.

73
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,050
- Why are you laughing?
- What?

74
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,120
Why are you laughing?

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,750
I haven't.

76
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,990
I haven't met someone
that much considerate towards me.

77
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,290
Hello.

78
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

79
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,320
You surprised me.

80
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,230
It really felt like he was my boyfriend.

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,970
- We're both in brown.
- You're right.

82
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,130
- Why are you copying me?
- I'm glad.

83
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,670
(Our relationship started
with a lot of excitement.)

84
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,570
Wherever we hung out,

85
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,180
You go ahead first.
I'll be holding your bag.

86
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,210
He cared for me saying,
"You go first, Ha Neul."

87
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,350
Here. You go in first.

88
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,380
Go ahead.

89
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,550
- Go.
- Okay.

90
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,520
And when I was with him,
he felt very reliable.

91
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,720
- Are you okay?
- My heels keep getting stuck.

92
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,260
You should watch out. Let's be careful.

93
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's get out.

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,290
If you have a kid in the future,

95
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,030
and if your kid wants to be a doctor,
would you allow it?

96
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,730
Do you think
you can never have three kids?

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,130
Those were jokes a real couple can make.

98
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,140
(Chan Hyeon is getting ready
to go to work.)

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,540
(Cookies he bought with Ha Neul yesterday)

100
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,180
(I had it for breakfast. Thank you.)

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,410
I felt that we'd never argue...

102
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,680
and have a comfortable married life.

103
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,420
I felt that I was
in a real dating relationship.

104
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,760
Before I went to sleep,
I was texting instant messages...

105
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,190
and giggled.

106
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,360
It was a feeling I had after a long time.

107
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,400
It was a fluttering feeling
in a dating relationship,

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
A fluttering feeling
when a dating relationship begins.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,670
We talked about where to go...

110
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,010
and what to eat for our date.

111
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,240
We searched for restaurants
and showed them,

112
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,910
and we went, "I know this place,"

113
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,180
and "I like this place too."

114
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,350
Such conversations went on and on.

115
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,320
They open at 10:30 p.m.

116
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,820
"His taste is very similar to mine."

117
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,760
That was what I felt.

118
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,690
I'm walking too fast, right?
I'll go slowly.

119
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,660
- Okay.
- I'll walk slowly.

120
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,060
It felt like dating an older guy...

121
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,200
that people usually consider ideal.

122
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,800
(He prepared something
for Chae Eun who wasn't feeling well.)

123
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,210
It's read ginseng and dear antlers stick.

124
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,370
This is amazing.

125
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,080
He really cared for me a lot.

126
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,810
What makes you want to marry someone,
as you wrote?

127
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,810
When he is sweet, emotionally stable,

128
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,950
and have an easygoing personality.

129
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,890
The dating course itself...

130
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,220
Boiled ox knee slices.

131
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
I totally agree.

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,760
was decided according to what I wanted.

133
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,760
- It's one of the things I've wanted.
- Really?

134
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,130
- Do you feel cold?
- A bit.

135
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,260
Then I'll increase the heat.

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,230
- Do you want some noodles?
- It should be hot.

137
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,930
- I'm fine.
- Are you?

138
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,540
If I date him,

139
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,240
everything will be safe and sound.

140
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,970
- This is hot. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

141
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,610
He was the man I dreamed of.

142
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,080
(The wedding day of Je Yeon's friend)

143
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,180
That friend of mine
dated someone for a long time...

144
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,850
and got married.

145
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,290
I envied that.

146
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,760
The days of her youth
when she was in her 20s,

147
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,160
all those things are known to someone.

148
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,800
And she'll live the rest of her life
with that person.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,670
It made me envy her.

150
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,700
(Good morning.)

151
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,270
(Good morning.)

152
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,640
(Did you have a good sleep?)

153
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
(Yes, I did.)

154
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
(I'll go pick you up, Je Yeon.)

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,980
(Great.)

156
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,820
(While humming,)

157
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,120
(he's on his way
to pick up his girlfriend.)

158
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,230
Je Yeon is there.

159
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,200
I saw him.

160
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,430
I was in a cafe,

161
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,270
and without knowing I was there,

162
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,570
he stopped his car in front of the place.

163
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,610
I was talking to my friends
and looked outside the window,

164
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,010
and Ji Min was watching me.

165
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,710
I was so surprised.

166
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,180
She's so funny.

167
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,180
My friends saw him too.

168
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,850
They kept asking me what was going on...

169
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,090
and demanded I explain it later.

170
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,090
I liked that.

171
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,200
I even wanted to introduce him
to my friends.

172
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,730
I was happy.

173
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,370
Hi.

174
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,670
(15 hours before
contract relationships end)

175
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,210
I could feel...

176
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,840
that she was a very sweet person.

177
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,680
So I decided to get to know her more.

178
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,480
I guess we learned more about each other.

179
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,020
Good luck with your work.

180
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,820
I'll fight it out with my work.

181
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,220
I guess that's the charm
of a contract relationship.

182
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,260
I guess I relied a lot on you.

183
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,690
It really felt like we were breaking up.

184
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,430
I somehow felt...

185
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,270
very sorry,

186
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,500
but it became a chance
to see how we felt about each other.

187
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,100
You know this pose, right?

188
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,370
Let's take a picture with that.

189
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,010
We never know
what will happen in the future.

190
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,980
So I wanted to leave something
for Je Yeon.

191
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,950
How I tried to play a joke on her...

192
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,950
and how she responded...

193
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,780
are in the pictures.

194
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,650
I still look at those pictures.

195
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,260
I think it was a good thing
that we took the pictures.

196
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,690
(The last night of four couples...)

197
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,400
(grows late.)

198
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,870
(The last day
of the contract relationship)

199
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,640
(Je Yeon is getting ready to go out.)

200
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,540
(Moist)

201
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,480
Do your lips get chapped?

202
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,350
Yes, because the weather is dry.

203
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,580
But it got better after using this.

204
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,120
Shall I try it too?

205
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,050
I'll get one for you later.

206
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,860
- Really? Thank you.
- Welcome.

207
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,730
I feel excited!

208
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,530
I bragged about this.

209
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,330
Have you told them already?

210
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,230
I was going to keep it a top secret.

211
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,330
Everyone is saying it's a secret,

212
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,700
but we boast about it.

213
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,340
- Does everyone talk about it?
- Yes, we talk about it.

214
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,070
We can do better than them.

215
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,910
Can we go to that cafe?

216
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,580
There's a cafe with Woo Jae's painting.

217
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,980
- It's hung on the wall.
- Really?

218
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,050
- Really?
- Yes.

219
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,320
Some people buy my painting
and hang one on the wall,

220
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,960
and for close friends,
I hang my painting myself.

221
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320
I go and change the painting
once in a while.

222
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,960
- You should show us your paintings later.
- Okay.

223
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,060
It's amazing.

224
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,470
Then I need to play to my strengths.

225
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,940
How?

226
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,410
Do you want to board a plane?

227
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,140
- Can you do that?
- Can I do that?

228
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,410
It's not like you really can let us
board a plane.

229
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,550
I can find a way to do that.

230
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,320
- Oh, my.
- He's so attractive.

231
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,520
Is there something like a simulator?

232
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,600
(Searching so hard for Chae Eun)

233
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
So what are you going to do tomorrow?

234
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,770
- What?
- What are you doing tomorrow?

235
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,140
- We'll go to Paju...
- Paju?

236
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,240
Yes.

237
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,770
and have eels.

238
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,240
- You're having eels?
- Yes.

239
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,010
Both yesterday and today.

240
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,480
Is it your rejuvenating day?

241
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,310
- Yes, it's my rejuvenating day.
- I know.

242
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,550
What are you doing tomorrow, Chae Eun?

243
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,850
I'll try the simulator.

244
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,090
I've always liked playing games
in the game arcade.

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,620
- And the airplane...
- Where do you go to play it?

246
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,260
- It's in Gimpo Airport.
- You go to the airport?

247
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,490
Yes, it's a real aviation simulator.

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,300
It's for testing and practice purposes.

249
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,000
So I'm very excited.

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,100
- It should be fun.
- Yes.

251
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
It's going to be fun.
I haven't had a date like this.

252
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,370
It's your occupation.

253
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,340
You might be surprised at first.

254
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,180
When a car starts fast,
your body leans backward.

255
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,510
You will feel that.

256
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,050
Your body leans backward,
and the noise is loud.

257
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,420
(It's a chance to peek
at Chang Hwan's world.)

258
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,490
I'm so excited.

259
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,790
(Excited)

260
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,700
I guess it's here.

261
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,470
It looks the same.

262
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

263
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,540
My friend contacted you.

264
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,770
Thank you.

265
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,780
- They made it so nicely.
- It looks like a real airplane.

266
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,250
Here's a cockpit,
where you control the plane.

267
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,290
I can't believe this.
It's my first time seeing this.

268
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,560
They did a wonderful job of making this.

269
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,890
It looks just the same.

270
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,390
(It looks similar to a real cockpit.)

271
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,660
Since I'm a co-pilot, I sit on the right.

272
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,770
The seat on the left is for the captain.

273
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,270
You'll be the captain today.
I'll sit on the right.

274
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,370
Yes, okay.

275
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,400
(Exclaiming)

276
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,410
- I can understand her.
- I'll sit on the left.

277
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,270
- Watch out for your head.
- Okay.

278
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,140
This is amazing. I'm excited.

279
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,410
Course, speed, heading.

280
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,410
The altitude we need to reach.

281
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,480
(The altitude we need to reach)

282
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,050
This one's for the engine.

283
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,750
- There are so many buttons.
- This one's for the light.

284
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,990
First, shall we take off first?

285
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,790
Shall we take off now?
I'm so excited. This is insane.

286
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,530
I feel so nervous.

287
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,800
When I say "Rotate", pull the lever.

288
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,330
- Pull the lever?
- Yes, pull like this. Go ahead.

289
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,300
- It's pulled together.
- Right.

290
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,400
I didn't know that.

291
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,900
- Look at the front.
- Okay.

292
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
She's so cute.

293
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,510
- No, don't pull it yet.
- Not yet?

294
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,140
- Pull it when I say "Rotate."
- I see. Okay.

295
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
Look, it's a runway.

296
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,210
It looks the same
as the Incheon International Airport.

297
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,780
I got goosebumps.

298
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,080
- We need to go further.
- Okay.

299
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,420
(Focused)

300
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,490
- V1, rotate.
- V1.

301
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,530
- A bit slowly. You're doing a good job.
- Slowly?

302
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,730
Keep doing it. 15 degrees.

303
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,360
(The aircraft goes up.)

304
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,770
All right.

305
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,700
It's just right.

306
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,940
You can see that we're in the air
if you look aside.

307
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,970
Yes.

308
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,510
This is amazing. It's beautiful.

309
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,080
- Are you flying all right?
- Are we going above the sea?

310
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,110
(Chang Hwan and Chae Eun
are flying above the sea.)

311
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,680
For someone intellectual like Chae Eun,

312
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,520
telling something about a field
she's totally ignorant of...

313
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,690
- is a great charm.
- That's right.

314
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,290
I think they picked
the right place for a date.

315
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,290
(We'll give you 100 points
for the date spot.)

316
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,030
Oh, my. This is fun.

317
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,630
You're going all right now.

318
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,800
It looks beautiful at night.

319
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Let's try the nighttime landing first.

320
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,870
Do you see that in the front?

321
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,670
- Goodness.
- The flickering lights look beautiful.

322
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,010
They're so beautiful.

323
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,540
You're doing a great job.

324
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,340
It says 2 red, 2 right, on course.

325
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,650
- Really?
- Yes.

326
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,410
You're doing a good job. There you go.

327
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,680
You got bold now. You're doing well.

328
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,080
Chan Hwan is sensitive.

329
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,290
He's a very sensitive person.

330
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,820
I'll take care of adjusting details,
which is called trim.

331
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,220
He looks awesome.

332
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,230
(Chang Hwan is leading.)

333
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,590
You don't need to do anything.
It will go all right now.

334
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,200
It's 100. It's 100 feet.

335
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,930
Pull the lever a bit. Just a bit.

336
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,530
- It's a bit high, but it's okay.
- A bit high?

337
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,500
It's fine. Just stay still.

338
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,770
Okay. We landed.

339
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,440
She won't forget this date.

340
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,510
- Did I drop the wheels?
- Yes.

341
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,810
- The lights are so beautiful, right?
- Yes.

342
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,550
- It looks like a Christmas tree.
- Right.

343
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,880
- She won't experience it with any other.
- That's what I'm saying.

344
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,480
He'd look so awesome to her.

345
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,950
(Excited)

346
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,490
I can't believe I looked at...

347
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,660
the cockpit inside a plane.

348
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,990
- It's incredible.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?

349
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,900
Yes, it is. It was so much fun.

350
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,460
- Now, when the plane I'm in is landing,
- Right.

351
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,330
- I'll play a simulator in my head.
- That's right.

352
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,940
"It's past V1. Now it's the rotate stage."

353
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
Now you know those things.

354
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,140
- I might be pulling the lever.
- That's right.

355
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,640
- She's cute.
- I was surprised, by the way.

356
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,510
You were doing it so well.

357
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,510
- I'm proud.
- It's not easy to do so in the beginning.

358
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,420
You were doing it more boldly
than I expected.

359
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,720
(Serious)

360
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,390
(Captain Chae Eun wasn't hesitating.)

361
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,420
Come on.
You need to change your occupation.

362
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,560
She's very attractive.

363
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,160
(A cafe in Jongno-gu, Seoul)

364
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,370
- It's a cat.
- There's a cat, your favorite.

365
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,900
(Drowsy)

366
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,770
- You can touch a puppy, right?
- Yes.

367
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,110
I've touched a kitten,
but not a big cat like this.

368
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,140
They won't allow you, though.

369
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,250
Is that so?

370
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,210
They'd run away.

371
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,790
I'm sorry.

372
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,060
Oh, my.

373
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,090
Okay. Eat up.

374
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,490
I see. They're very...

375
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,560
(Byeol's dad is excited.)

376
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,800
- Hey.
- They're running away.

377
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,400
I won't bother you. Go on. Eat.

378
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

379
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,240
The presentation is so beautiful.

380
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,810
It's so beautiful.

381
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,010
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

382
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,350
It looks good.

383
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,420
Isn't it good?

384
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,920
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

385
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,930
I love this place. It's so good.

386
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,100
(Chae Eun's extremely satisfied reaction
makes him smile.)

387
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,670
- He's so cute.
- This is so tasty.

388
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,070
The food tastes so fresh too.

389
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,940
Yes. This is good.

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,170
The smoked salmon is divine.

391
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,240
(This couple is serious
when it comes to food.)

392
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,710
I had this conversation with the guys.

393
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,210
- What conversation?
- What is it?

394
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
Remember what I told you?

395
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,750
Chae Eun, you are...

396
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,150
- quite responsive with everyone.
- Yes.

397
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,790
You're a cheerful person.

398
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,360
I said, "Once you talk to her,
you'll like her."

399
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,790
"You'll start second-guessing."
That's what I said.

400
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,390
When I do something right,
no matter how small,

401
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,600
you're so encouraging.

402
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,970
- "Great job."
- Then I'd think, "Yes, I'm doing well."

403
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,630
I'd get more excited
and look for more things to do.

404
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,200
When I told them
that was the effect you had on me...

405
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Yes.

406
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,740
Chan Hyeong told me that...

407
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,040
he could tell
you were that kind of person.

408
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
I see.

409
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,780
- You were quite sick before.
- Yes.

410
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,910
You were sick.

411
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,850
(Hesitant)

412
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,420
When you got sick,
I kept thinking about you.

413
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,590
The funny thing was that
when you were sick,

414
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,460
I thought it would be fun...

415
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,930
to talk to you
and that you'd be a cheerful person.

416
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,560
I got the feeling that
you would be a bubbly type.

417
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,200
That's what I noticed about you too.

418
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,670
So...

419
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,540
I was curious about you.

420
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,910
Honestly, I thought...

421
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,240
- the owner of the yellow book...
- Yes.

422
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,010
- would be the funniest.
- Yes.

423
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,350
I got the feeling his sense of humor
would match mine the best.

424
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,950
(On the first day of moving in,)

425
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,320
(she chose the yellow book,
Chang Hwan's Pairing Book.)

426
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,620
You left the strongest impression on me
when we first met.

427
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,660
I see.

428
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,190
I did want to talk to you more.

429
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,500
She thought of him in a positive light.

430
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,170
But when it comes to age in dating,

431
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,570
- Right. The age...
- don't you have an age limit in mind?

432
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,340
- Even if you're open-minded...
- But here's the thing.

433
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,280
During the interview,
they asked me about your age.

434
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,810
- Yes.
- I told them it didn't matter that much.

435
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,980
I see.

436
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,950
To me, maintaining your looks...

437
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,050
and staying fit matter more.

438
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,850
Come to think of it,

439
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,660
when I dozed off in your car...

440
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,290
That moment...

441
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,330
You can rest a bit.

442
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,660
- We're 30 minutes away.
- I see.

443
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,630
You can lean back.

444
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,770
No, I'm fine.

445
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,070
You don't seem fine.

446
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,740
- She shut down.
- Gosh.

447
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,770
(She falls asleep not long after.)

448
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,370
She's so adorable.

449
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,580
That felt like a real date moment.

450
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,880
Actually, I was going to mention that too.

451
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,850
When I woke up,

452
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,050
you told me to sleep some more
with the chair pushed back.

453
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,820
- It felt like we were dating for real.
- By the way,

454
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,130
when you were sleeping soundly,
I did feel proud.

455
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,860
- Really?
- Yes.

456
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,830
- So...
- Really?

457
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,070
- when I looked over, you were sleeping.
- Yes.

458
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,630
And that was cute.

459
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,200
That made me smile. I kept driving.

460
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,770
Well,

461
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,910
actually, that's what actual couples do.

462
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,070
- Yes.
- You see that with actual couples.

463
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,980
It made me think that...

464
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,410
if I were to date him,
we would never fight about anything.

465
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,850
He doesn't make it look obvious...

466
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,680
how he's trying to accommodate my needs.

467
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,250
I love olive oil.

468
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,420
I'll bring some from my house.

469
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,890
- So you can taste it.
- Yes, I love it.

470
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,490
"I like what you like."

471
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,200
- That's how he made me feel.
- Thank you for waiting.

472
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,660
This is how it looks.

473
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,830
- I love fresh pasta.
- That's it.

474
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,470
He thought that I might be tired.

475
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,600
So he decided to cook dinner at home.

476
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,610
He told me to rest up a bit
and come out when I was ready.

477
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,910
- You're here.
- Hi.

478
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,510
I've already prepared the appetizer.

479
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,880
Gosh, tomatoes.

480
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,950
(The perfect appetizer for Chae Eun)

481
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,220
Can I have just one for now?

482
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,980
Go ahead. That's why I prepared them.

483
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,020
That's the appetizer.
I know you like tomatoes.

484
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,930
When I come home from work,

485
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,630
I will always be grateful to him.

486
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,730
He would make me feel that way.

487
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,830
Oh, no.

488
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,400
- Bye.
- No.

489
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,140
Who will break up with whom?

490
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,470
(How will they remember the 3 days
they spent together as a couple?)

491
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,570
Do we have to break up?

492
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,640
We're forced to break up.

493
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,710
A forced breakup.

494
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,350
Chang Hwan showed her the charm...

495
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,680
- of being a pilot.
- Yes.

496
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,720
- He was really cool.
- Gosh.

497
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,120
Only Chang Hwan could lead...

498
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,150
- a date like this.
- Totally.

499
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

500
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,750
She had a chance
to take off and land a plane.

501
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

502
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,860
Here's what I noticed. It wasn't a date
he had planned from before.

503
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,630
After hearing what Chae Eun said,

504
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,860
Chang Hwan had to put this together
at the last minute.

505
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,130
- Yes.
- So...

506
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,600
he's more serious about her
than I thought.

507
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
- Yes.
- I realized that he was making an effort.

508
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,270
- Yes.
- Right.

509
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,740
- The weather is great.
- It's not as cold as I thought.

510
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,070
- It's because the house was warm.
- Is that why?

511
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,210
- If we continue to stay out,
- It's because our body is warm.

512
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,280
- Right. We'll say it's cold.
- we'll get cold.

513
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,580
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

514
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,350
I love how the car curves.

515
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,090
The road twists and turns a lot
in this area.

516
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,360
Right. Yes.

517
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,220
- Yes, the road has a lot of sharp bends.
- Right.

518
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,330
- But...
- It's smooth.

519
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,660
- it's so nice.
- Right.

520
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,700
- Yes. That's right.
- We'll arrive without having to stop.

521
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,500
- We're going to the sea.
- Yes.

522
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,770
A drive along the ocean
sounds really nice.

523
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,140
- Let's get there fast.
- Let's get there fast.

524
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,540
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

525
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,080
- Right. The music isn't on.
- Right.

526
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,450
(A sorrowful melody resonates in the car.)

527
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,690
The breakup sea.

528
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,160
Our breakup trip.

529
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,090
Should we be bold and go to the sea?

530
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,530
- For real?
- Yes.

531
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,760
I love it.

532
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,030
"Docks."

533
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,100
It says we'll be there
in 1 hour and 6 minutes.

534
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,100
- This is when it's crowded.
- My gosh. What is it?

535
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,900
The food in the photo looks so good.

536
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,540
(They will go to the sea on their last day
of the contract relationship.)

537
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,240
You can see the sea from here too.

538
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,080
- I love going to the sea in winter.
- Right.

539
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,050
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

540
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,950
(Glancing over)

541
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,420
- Can I ask you why...
- Yes.

542
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,790
you chose internal medicine?

543
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,230
- There are so many departments.
- Internal medicine... Yes, that's right.

544
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,830
Internal medicine is the broadest field.

545
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,300
- Right.
- It's the broadest field.

546
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,370
I see.

547
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,930
Internal medicine patients in the ICU...

548
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,640
- have no place to go...
- I see.

549
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,600
- when their condition worsens.
- Okay.

550
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,070
- I see. Is that the last place?
- That's it.

551
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,340
- This is the end.
- I see.

552
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,410
I have a chance to help them...

553
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,240
with the responsibility
of their last doctor.

554
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,150
Then you're bound
to be under incredible pressure.

555
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,050
- Right.
- If you're their last doctor,

556
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,680
- Right. Other doctors call...
- that must be a lot of pressure.

557
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,350
- to bring me into their case.
- Yes.

558
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,750
But I don't have anyone to call.

559
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,360
- I see that.
- I'm the last line of defense.

560
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,890
- That's what drew me to this occupation.
- I see.

561
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,330
- I see.
- So...

562
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,860
when we have to perform CPR
in the hospital,

563
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,070
every internist...

564
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,470
- runs toward the mentioned ward.
- I see.

565
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,300
The patient gets transferred
to our department immediately.

566
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,370
I see.

567
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,770
- They become your patients.
- Yes, we'd be in charge of them.

568
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,210
So when there's a code blue,
it will be a difficult case.

569
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,340
- It will be difficult.
- Yes.

570
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,350
My gosh.

571
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,220
But the moment I'm helping the patient...

572
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,150
- When I'm in the zone like that,
- Do you like that?

573
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,520
it's quite meaningful.

574
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,820
This is a physically demanding job.

575
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,390
- Whenever I lay down,
- Yes.

576
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,300
I hoped that
everything would be stopped...

577
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,000
because of an external factor.

578
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,130
- I couldn't stop doing my job.
- Right.

579
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,600
- That was my intention when I began.
- I see.

580
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,740
Oh, my.

581
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,210
I feel bad for some reason.

582
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,410
- I really thought I was going to die.
- I see.

583
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,980
- That crossed my mind.
- Is it the lack of sleep?

584
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,550
- Right. I'm sleep deprived.
- Or...

585
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,920
- The job is stressful too.
- Right.

586
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,280
It's breaking my heart.

587
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,590
- Right?
- Yes.

588
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,920
I chose the blue book.

589
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,590
I could tell he loved his job
and gave his all to his career.

590
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,860
I really respected him for that.

591
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,430
I'm an internal medicine specialist.

592
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,700
- What?
- I'm a doctor.

593
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,570
I'm the CEO of a medical IT company.

594
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,540
As I'm juggling between two jobs,

595
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,870
- my days are quite busy.
- Gosh.

596
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,010
You must be tired.

597
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,140
(He gives his 100 percent
to every single day.)

598
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,350
This is impressive. I mean it.

599
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,750
Thinking about his future,

600
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,480
I thought he was really cool.

601
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,660
Here's what I realized.

602
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,520
This won't end in a couple of years.
Or even in five years.

603
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,960
This might continue...

604
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,430
for 10 or 20 years or until we die.

605
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,900
"Will this kind of lifestyle suit me?"

606
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,670
That crossed my mind.

607
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,100
(He doesn't have time or energy...)

608
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,840
(to take care of those around him.)

609
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,810
(Will I just end up on the back burner?)

610
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,080
Take your time.

611
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,480
To be honest, I feel bad.

612
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,680
It's okay.

613
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,150
Because a part of me feels bad for him,

614
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,550
I'm more confused
about what's right for me.

615
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,920
Why don't we leave after a break?

616
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,720
- What?
- Should we leave after a break?

617
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,920
You should rest.

618
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,530
- I'll take a quick break.
- Yes.

619
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,700
It did cross my mind that
he wouldn't be able...

620
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,730
to satisfy both of my desires.

621
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,300
(Her desire to root for his passion)

622
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,500
(Her desire to spend time with him)

623
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,910
It seems she has a lot on her mind.

624
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,980
Well, this is what comes with the job.

625
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,410
- Yes. Right.
- My job had been my life so far.

626
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,580
I bet.

627
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,080
He opened up to her about his struggle...

628
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,520
- of being a doctor.
- Yes.

629
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,190
- But her reaction...
- The way she handled it...

630
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,160
- We did a lot during these three days.
- Right.

631
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,030
- We're even going to the sea.
- Right.

632
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,930
- Seriously.
- At least, they won't have any regret.

633
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,030
I've been smelling the sea
for a while now.

634
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,670
(They finally arrive at the winter sea.)

635
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,740
Do you want to go up there?

636
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,970
Let's see.

637
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,280
- You're tall now.
- Right?

638
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,310
(The uprising of the Baby Princess)

639
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,610
Impressive.

640
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,150
So this is how it feels to look down
as the taller person.

641
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,090
You're so short now.

642
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,390
Drink a lot of milk.

643
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,660
- I'm suddenly feeling the pressure.
- Right?

644
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,390
I'll have to keep you there.

645
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,830
Gosh. This is crazy.

646
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,460
(Their feelings are reflected
over the calm waves.)

647
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,770
- I'm glad to see you have warm shoes on.
- They're so warm.

648
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,300
(A cafe in Jung-gu, Incheon)

649
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,840
Why are you smiling?

650
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,040
What's up with the smile?

651
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,250
This feels surreal. That's all.

652
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,280
Well,

653
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,590
this is the end
of our contract relationship.

654
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,820
- For some reason, it feels strange.
- Do you feel liberated?

655
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,060
No.

656
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,920
- You know that I'm a clingy type.
- Do you feel liberated?

657
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,130
I tend to be clingy.

658
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,260
No.

659
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,700
Gosh, Chan Hyeong.

660
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,000
- It's so beautiful.
- Gosh, yes.

661
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,910
- For Christmas.
- Yes.

662
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,950
(In awe together)

663
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,180
- No way.
- My gosh.

664
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,780
- Gosh.
- Gosh, look.

665
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,120
This is no joke. I mean it. Oh, my.

666
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,390
- It's so beautiful.
- It's so pretty.

667
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,060
This looks gorgeous.

668
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,730
- It feels like we're mythical gurus.
- I know, right?

669
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
I should show this to the group later.

670
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,700
- Right.
- Right?

671
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,200
(Hesitant)

672
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,370
Three days is a short time.

673
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,840
- But these three days were quite intense.
- Really?

674
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Yes.

675
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,280
- Were they intense for you?
- I think so.

676
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,750
Right. Why...

677
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,450
- Why do I feel like...
- Are you crying?

678
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,480
we had a long relationship?

679
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,920
- Is that so?
- It felt long.

680
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,550
- I see. It felt longer than 3 days?
- It felt longer than 3 days. Yes.

681
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,020
- I do feel the same way.
- Yes.

682
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,420
- It felt longer than that.
- Yes.

683
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,830
- The contract relationship felt longer.
- Slightly.

684
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,330
- It felt longer than just three days.
- Yes.

685
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,830
Is it because...

686
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,500
- we went to such memorable places?
- I see.

687
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,640
The Christmas tree from the first day...

688
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,010
- was memorable.
- Yes.

689
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,450
Back then, we thought...

690
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,080
(They confirmed each other's interest
in front of the Christmas tree.)

691
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,320
We tried...

692
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,290
to come up with a nickname for each other.

693
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,190
After that,

694
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:12,660
- I had to work for a bit yesterday.
- Yes.

695
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,300
When I came back home,

696
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,730
- you were there to welcome me back.
- Yes.

697
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,330
- You welcomed me back into the house.
- Yes.

698
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,040
You cooked me eggs.

699
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,370
You waited for me.

700
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,370
You also waited for me when I took a nap.
It was that.

701
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
To be honest,

702
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,110
that was the most touching moment
for me out of the three days.

703
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,020
I felt understood by you.

704
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,680
You understood my situation.

705
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,420
That was Chan Hyeong's favorite moment.

706
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,960
You accommodated my needs a lot.

707
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,790
My goodness.

708
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,030
It appears Ha Neul has a lot on her mind.

709
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,670
I knew we were a good match.

710
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,300
- I knew that we clicked well.
- Yes.

711
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,610
When we talked, I never felt awkward.

712
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,740
We were talking to one another
so smoothly.

713
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,980
- Right.
- It was comfortable.

714
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,050
I always felt that our behavior...

715
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,690
and style of talking were quite similar.

716
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,190
- Yes.
- They're having a mature conversation.

717
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,130
Then was there a part of my personality
you felt wasn't compatible with yours?

718
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,760
- Right.
- She brought that up.

719
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,360
You seem to smile at everyone.

720
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,370
Don't you do the same thing?

721
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,540
It was the moment
we walked into the house...

722
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,840
after our first date
of our contract relationship.

723
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,510
- It felt like I was just like...
- Did you feel I treated them the same?

724
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,910
- everyone else in the house.
- I see.

725
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,250
- Is that so?
- Yes.

726
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,350
So...

727
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,820
the moment we entered the house,

728
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,750
we became friends.

729
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,120
There were Friend 1, Friend 2,
Friend 3, and Friend 4.

730
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,960
I'm only saying that because
you interact with them so genuinely.

731
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,390
I did feel that for a moment.

732
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
I think that's who I am.

733
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,700
I feel comfortable
when I initiate the conversation.

734
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,300
I do think that
it's your considerate personality.

735
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,140
- As for me...
- So now...

736
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,740
- Anything...
- A difference?

737
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,710
(Pondering)

738
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,120
It's the first thing
that comes to your mind.

739
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,320
Yes.

740
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,820
A difference...

741
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,860
I think it's about careers.

742
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,630
The direction...

743
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,570
of our careers is different in my opinion.

744
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,630
In what way?

745
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,240
Given the nature of your job,

746
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,340
the essence of your career is
helping a lot of people.

747
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,470
What you do is helping people.

748
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,610
You want to use your ability
to help people.

749
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,810
So I thought you cared about other people.

750
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,250
But what I do is personal.

751
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,420
If you think about it, I'm doing my job...

752
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,120
for my own sake.

753
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,290
So...

754
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,660
I thought you were amazing.

755
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,090
I don't think I had people like you
around me.

756
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,560
That's what I thought.

757
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,730
So I think because of that,

758
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,430
I thought highly of you.

759
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
But...

760
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,540
- if I have to come up with something...
- Right.

761
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,570
- We don't click well.
- Yes.

762
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,080
Right. She's realistic.

763
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,140
- She's being honest.
- Yes.

764
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,910
Right.

765
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,320
You think... Then...

766
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,420
She's being honest,

767
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,290
and that is enough
for Chan Hyeong to understand her.

768
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,960
It would be easy for Chan Hyeong
to understand her.

769
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,230
- Gosh, this is sad.
- Yes, it's sad.

770
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,030
But I think...

771
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,470
The next two weeks will be another time
to get to know each other more.

772
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,040
Would it be time
to get to know each other? Or...

773
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,040
What?

774
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,050
He's cute.

775
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,230
So, like we said earlier...

776
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,500
There are people
I didn't get to have a conversation yet.

777
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,970
I will be having conversations with them,
and of course...

778
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,340
I'll have some time
to talk to you as well.

779
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,970
As we spend more time together...

780
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,580
I think we will find new sides
of others...

781
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,210
that we like.

782
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,280
He's being gentle until the end.

783
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,150
That's what I think.

784
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,490
And if I tell you about what I feel...

785
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,220
As for Ji Min...

786
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,690
He knew everything.

787
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,760
Of course he did.

788
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,270
You could be reminded of the moment
with tension...

789
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,870
you had with him.

790
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,550
What kind of tension was
between you and him?

791
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,750
The tension you can't forget.

792
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,820
Something like that.

793
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,090
We need to be serious and careful...

794
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,590
to decide that this is the one.

795
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,030
We're not dating like young kids.

796
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,230
So Ms. Ha Neul... I mean Ha Neul...

797
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,070
Are you keeping your distance already?

798
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,170
My BP...

799
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,970
Suddenly calling her nickname
made them feel more distant.

800
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,480
When you do that...

801
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,680
Of course. You'll do that,
and I'll be seeing you.

802
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,920
I'll see you from afar with a smile.

803
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,750
You'll see me with a smile?

804
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,290
(Joking)

805
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,720
- "Did you like it?"
- Right.

806
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,090
I'll ask you one at a time.

807
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,390
- "Did you like it?"
- "Was it fun?"

808
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,060
"You don't remember the time
when you were BP, right?"

809
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,000
I might have so many nicknames later.

810
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,240
So that's what I think.

811
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,610
It feels weird though.

812
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,820
So...

813
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,320
- We got to be together.
- Right.

814
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,260
- We got connected somehow.
- Yes.

815
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,300
Of course. My will did some part of it.

816
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,000
- But there was no reason, right?
- Right.

817
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,800
- What reason?
- Like having a good feeling?

818
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,810
I did have a good feeling about you.
But...

819
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,410
You made me feel comfortable
from the beginning.

820
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,450
- I like people who make me...
- How I treated you?

821
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,510
feel comfortable.

822
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,120
And it didn't feel awkward
when we were together.

823
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,250
- That's true.
- Yes.

824
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,820
- And we had a good conversation.
- Yes.

825
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,460
- I've never seen the sun like this.
- It's so strong.

826
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,760
It's really strong.

827
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,030
I hope you are always the same.

828
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,830
Gosh. It sounds like... What?

829
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,770
I was always the same.

830
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,410
You didn't feel lonely for the three days,
right?

831
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,320
I wasn't lonely at all.

832
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,520
Because we spent time together.

833
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,920
It was a mature breakup.

834
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,290
- That put an end to it.
- Yes.

835
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,760
After the three days
of contract relationship...

836
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,160
He's a doctor,

837
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,630
- and he's a CEO of a startup company.
- Right.

838
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,770
She learned by experience that
his days were really busy.

839
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,540
I think she felt that realistically,

840
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,200
this wasn't going to work.

841
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,710
Ha Neul thinks spending time together
is important when it comes to...

842
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,640
- Right.
- her future husband or boyfriend.

843
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,140
- She was so honest about it.
- Right.

844
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,110
She was being realistic and honest.

845
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,080
I think Ha Neul was right on
when she made her decision.

846
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,950
- He goes to feel rewarded,
- Right.

847
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,620
and he spends his time on it.

848
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,520
- But if she tells him to stay with her...
- You're right.

849
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,990
- That's the tragedy.
- Yes.

850
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,030
It's taking away the thing that
makes him happy.

851
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,660
So I think it was hard for her.

852
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,300
They broke up in a cool manner,
but for Chan Hyeong...

853
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,700
- He'd feel bitter inside.
- Right.

854
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
After the contract relationship.

855
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,600
Since they're considering about
getting married on this show...

856
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,610
(This isn't easy.)

857
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,340
They'd be more careful
and serious about it.

858
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,810
(They have to be careful about
getting in a relationship.)

859
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,180
(Woo Jae and Ji Won
open the door and enter.)

860
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

861
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,720
(A flower workshop in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

862
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,350
- Flower baskets?
- Hello.

863
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,720
We know each other.

864
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,760
(He's Woo Jae's close friend.)

865
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,990
- He's Woo Jae's friend.
- This is a one-day class...

866
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,930
to make flower baskets.

867
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,400
Okay. What's the meaning of this flower?

868
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,170
This is matricaria.

869
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,540
- It means not giving in to adversity.
- "Not giving in to adversity."

870
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,400
- Being tough, like you.
- I see.

871
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,640
Okay.

872
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,840
- You know he's tough, right?
- You're right.

873
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,480
- Former soccer player. You know that?
- Yes. Right.

874
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,180
- Gerbera means love.
- I see.

875
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,380
- It means love.
- That's nice.

876
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,090
And lisianthus means everlasting love.

877
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,760
- "Everlasting love."
- So you overcome adversity and love.

878
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,060
- And it won't change.
- Right. It's like his painting.

879
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,890
Oh, right. That's my painting.

880
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,560
- That one?
- Yes. That.

881
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,860
- Gosh.
- It's from my first exhibition.

882
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,400
This is pretty.

883
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,840
- In blue.
- That's pretty.

884
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,040
I've never seen Woo Jae on a date.

885
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,340
- Really?
- No.

886
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,940
I've known him for 8 to 9 years.

887
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,480
But this is my first time.

888
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,450
You don't say that all the time, right?

889
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,310
No. Seriously. This is my first time.

890
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,350
(Ji Won is so witty.)

891
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,220
- Gosh, she's witty.
- That means she has feelings for him.

892
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,360
A man who brings his friend on a date.

893
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,390
- What makes him do that?
- I'm curious too.

894
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,130
I think he really wanted to
show him his girlfriend.

895
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,330
If a boyfriend never introduces
the girlfriend to his friends...

896
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,530
It means he doesn't want to.

897
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,370
(I see. He wanted to hide it.)

898
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,740
So what's the relationship
between you two?

899
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,310
- We're a couple until 5 p.m. today.
- Right.

900
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,640
- There's not much time left.
- After 5 p.m...

901
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,680
We have to break up.

902
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,410
(A couple with a time limit)

903
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,680
Then, the everlasting love...

904
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,020
- That's why it's more meaningful.
- Right.

905
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,950
You should see him play soccer.

906
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,490
(Woo Jae's silly friend
tries to help him.)

907
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,190
Can you describe it in your own words?

908
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,460
- In my own words?
- About me playing soccer.

909
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,790
When he plays soccer...

910
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,430
- Are you a midfielder?
- I'm a winger.

911
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,660
- A winger. Right.
- Yes.

912
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,100
He becomes quite insolent when he plays.

913
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
- Really?
- Yes.

914
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
(Joking)

915
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,470
- He's really good at soccer.
- Yes.

916
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,070
- That's gorgeous.
- We're putting more.

917
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
That suits Woo Jae, though.

918
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,450
(They filled the basket flower by flower,)

919
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,650
It's pretty.

920
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,790
(and they created
their own flower basket.)

921
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,790
You're good.

922
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,390
They look cute together.

923
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,390
- They're even wearing matching outfits.
- Yes.

924
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,290
- They're both blue.
- They look good together.

925
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
There it is.

926
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
(Ji Won exclaiming)

927
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,170
Watch out for the bike.

928
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,970
It's okay.

929
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,570
Let's go.

930
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,610
(A coffee shop in Yongsan, Seoul)

931
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,940
Go on.

932
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,650
This is my painting.

933
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,190
This place and another place have
my paintings on the walls.

934
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,990
- Your name is on it.
- Yes.

935
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,090
- I always write...
- Yes.

936
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,190
- the year and my name.
- That's cool.

937
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,560
- Did you paint it this year?
- Yes, this year.

938
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,570
- What does it look like?
- It's beautiful.

939
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,940
(Thinking)

940
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,870
The moon... But it's green.

941
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,940
- A mountain?
- You're green.

942
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,280
Wait.

943
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,650
It is a mountain.

944
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,680
- Is it?
- Yes.

945
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,380
- It's a mountain...
- It looks like a mountain.

946
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
You're right.

947
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,420
I painted a mountain.

948
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,450
- A mountain and...
- Yes.

949
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,890
That looks like the moon.

950
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,630
- Can I get a closer look?
- Sure.

951
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,030
It's a watercolor painting.

952
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,500
I'm looking at one of your paintings...

953
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,400
(She appreciates it.)

954
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,070
- from up close.
- Yes.

955
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,910
I liked how it's...

956
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,880
draping like a cloth.

957
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,940
Feel it.

958
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,750
It's awesome.

959
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,390
Thank you.

960
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,890
I mean it.

961
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,560
I wish I could have one in my house.

962
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,120
Thank you.

963
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,030
Now,

964
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,970
we don't have much time left.

965
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,140
This relationship will end at 5 p.m.,

966
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,910
but I don't think
my feelings will be over as well.

967
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,510
- So...
- That's true.

968
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,380
I also thought about this.

969
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,680
When the term ends,

970
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,950
- and you have...
- Yes.

971
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,990
- a change of heart,
- Yes.

972
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,490
I wonder how I'll feel.

973
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,020
That thought occurred to me
before bed last night.

974
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,260
- That means...
- I'm the same.

975
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,960
I thought the exact same thing.

976
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
- Did you?
- Yes.

977
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,730
It felt strange.

978
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,640
Do you...

979
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,510
usually get jealous?

980
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,080
I do get jealous.

981
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,140
- Really?
- Yes.

982
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,910
But you don't show it, do you?

983
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,150
- I don't think I do,
- Yes.

984
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,080
but it makes me seethe.

985
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,720
(Woo Jae lives with lava inside him.)

986
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,250
- It makes me seethe.
- Okay.

987
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,790
What about you? Do you get jealous?

988
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,490
- Me?
- Yes, he has to ask.

989
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,660
I never thought I was the jealous type.

990
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,690
Okay.

991
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,900
But when you were talking
to Je Yeon yesterday,

992
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,930
I got jealous.

993
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,070
- Seriously?
- Yes.

994
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,870
- I couldn't help but look.
- When did I talk to her?

995
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,170
- The brief chats?
- Yes.

996
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,740
- What did you say you did today?
- We watched a play.

997
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,240
- A play?
- Yes.

998
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,610
- "Just a Hand Away?"
- Yes.

999
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,810
- It's a romantic comedy.
- Yes, a romantic comedy.

1000
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,550
- And pork belly...
- Was it fun?

1001
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,680
- It was. We enjoyed it.
- I see.

1002
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,620
(Getting jealous)

1003
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,320
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh, my gosh!

1004
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,560
She's sulky!

1005
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,190
It's written all over her face!

1006
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,160
She's very concerned.

1007
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,000
(The smile of a dad)

1008
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,330
I couldn't help but focus.

1009
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,670
I was looking down,
but my ears were there.

1010
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,230
Like this?

1011
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,940
I wanted to know
what you were talking about.

1012
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,340
- She's very honest.
- Yes.

1013
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,540
Also, I could feel...

1014
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,770
(And she started looking
at him differently.)

1015
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,680
that the way you looked at me had changed.

1016
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,510
When we met eyes for a moment...

1017
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,720
while cooking or doing other things,

1018
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,850
it made me feel...

1019
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,790
like we were actually in a relationship.

1020
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,920
He must have been attracted to her.

1021
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,060
You spilled hot tea on your hand
yesterday, right?

1022
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,130
Yes.

1023
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,530
(Last night)

1024
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,130
Are you all right?

1025
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,540
- Are you okay?
- Get cold water on your hand first.

1026
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,370
- Oh, no.
- I'm fine.

1027
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,210
- Wasn't it hot?
- Are you okay?

1028
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,510
- You burned it, didn't you?
- Get some more water.

1029
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,680
- You need to keep your hand here.
- Keep going.

1030
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,350
- Keep splashing cold water on it.
- Oh, no.

1031
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,120
(Worried)

1032
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,490
I'm okay.

1033
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,820
Get some ice cubes and a towel.

1034
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,990
(He moved faster than anybody.)

1035
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Oh, man.

1036
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,400
Put this on your hand.

1037
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,030
You can put it on right away.

1038
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,930
I was...

1039
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,800
genuinely upset at the time.

1040
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,000
I see.

1041
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,370
I knew it was hot,
but you didn't even show it.

1042
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,540
Right.

1043
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,880
It didn't feel like it would end
by my worrying about it.

1044
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,680
I realized that my feelings had changed.

1045
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,990
(He realized that his feelings for her
have changed.)

1046
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,350
- Are you all right now?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1047
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,020
- Anyway...
- Yes.

1048
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Anyway...

1049
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,330
He's trying to express his feelings
as much as he can...

1050
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,730
as he doesn't have much time left.

1051
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,800
I feel like crying. Oh, no!

1052
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,300
I hope I continue to have
these feelings...

1053
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,170
I had in the last three days.

1054
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,740
I just...

1055
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,170
What time is it?

1056
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,570
- Should we check?
- Let's check the time.

1057
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,340
I'll get it. Do you have your phone?

1058
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,680
- Oh, I had it.
- Is it in your purse?

1059
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,750
Even I feel bad for them.

1060
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,510
- I wish we had that.
- What?

1061
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,580
"Would you like to extend
your contract relationship?"

1062
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,960
We even have leftover sujebi
in the refrigerator.

1063
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,290
Right.

1064
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,930
(Will there be a day when they can finish
what they couldn't do?)

1065
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,730
Though they have many days left,

1066
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,530
I think this is
the most successful relationship yet.

1067
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,900
I almost cried as I watched it. It felt...

1068
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,400
Why did you feel like crying?

1069
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,840
I know it was only for three days,
but they were genuine.

1070
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,640
- Yes, they seemed to like each other.
- Exactly.

1071
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,380
And we were able to feel that
through the screen,

1072
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,280
so I almost cried just now.

1073
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,850
But they have one more thing to do.

1074
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,580
They wrote each other postcards in Italy.

1075
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,250
Those haven't arrived yet.

1076
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,760
If those postcards arrive at one point...

1077
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,730
I mean, there's a high chance...

1078
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,260
that Woo Jae and Je Yeon wrote them
for each other.

1079
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,930
I think there will be a moment
when they falter.

1080
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:58,930
No!

1081
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,000
- But after what they shared...
- Why?

1082
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,910
I do want to reserve my judgment
for Woo Jae.

1083
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,310
- I see.
- It's true that his feelings grew,

1084
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,140
but it may be too soon...

1085
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,580
- to set his mind on her.
- Oh, right.

1086
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,110
- That's true.
- That's my opinion.

1087
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,880
But it's true that those two have...

1088
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,480
strong feelings for each other
at the moment.

1089
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,690
(Before going out on a date)

1090
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,690
Je Yeon is almost ready.

1091
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,200
- I'm not waiting for Je Yeon.
- What?

1092
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,000
- I'm not waiting for Je Yeon.
- You're lying.

1093
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,700
- Hi.
- Are you ready?

1094
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,740
- What?
- Are you ready?

1095
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,810
- Yes.
- Take your time.

1096
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,240
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.

1097
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,880
- Have fun.
- See you later.

1098
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,210
- At 5 p.m.
- Yes.

1099
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,280
Didn't you smell a woody scent
while you were following me?

1100
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,690
I smell it now.

1101
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,860
- Do you?
- Yes.

1102
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,960
- Did you get a good sleep?
- Yes.

1103
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,130
You barely slept, right?

1104
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,560
I barely slept.

1105
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,900
How long after did you go to sleep
after texting me?

1106
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,100
- Until when did we text?
- Past 3 a.m.

1107
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,030
Then, probably around 4 a.m.

1108
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,200
Then, you slept for about five hours.

1109
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,240
Why didn't you read my text?

1110
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,970
What? Did you send me another text?

1111
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,040
- You're lying, aren't you?
- I did text you.

1112
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,950
I text you when I'm up.

1113
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,850
I was too busy getting ready,
so I missed it.

1114
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,080
Yes, I thought so.

1115
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,620
It's their last day together.

1116
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,620
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's last day
of their contract relationship)

1117
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,590
Let's go.

1118
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,760
Yes!

1119
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,020
I've been craving eels since yesterday.

1120
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,760
- Have you?
- Yes.

1121
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,260
I also like eels.

1122
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,230
I'm glad that we have
similar tastes in food.

1123
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,270
Right.

1124
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,770
I like pretty much everything, though.

1125
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,640
The sunlight is so warm.

1126
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,810
It is.

1127
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,210
You guys went upstairs
pretty early last night.

1128
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,050
No, we were talking about
how it went yesterday.

1129
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,920
- How the dates went?
- Yes, the dates.

1130
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,620
Did you envy any of them?

1131
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,220
- Envy them?
- Yes.

1132
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,060
Like, "That date must have been nice."

1133
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,390
I don't think so.

1134
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,730
So, our date was the best?

1135
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,530
You bet.

1136
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,800
"You bet."

1137
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,200
What did you tell them?

1138
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,700
Me?

1139
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,010
I told them
that it made me really happy...

1140
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,440
when you were occasionally enthusiastic.

1141
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,910
You show a subtle reaction,

1142
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,110
and I love it.

1143
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,150
Do you?

1144
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,280
Anyway,

1145
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,980
it was fun and exciting.

1146
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,120
That's what I told them.

1147
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,360
- When I woke up this morning,
- Yes.

1148
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,930
- I did some pull-ups.
- Okay.

1149
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,360
- It was nice.
- Was it?

1150
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,400
- Yes.
- Really?

1151
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,000
Wait. We were supposed to watch that.

1152
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,570
- Me doing pull-ups?
- Yes.

1153
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,100
Why would you want to see me do pull-ups?

1154
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:46,840
To see how many you do.

1155
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,040
I'll count them for you.

1156
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,770
- She's joking.
- For that?

1157
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,910
- I probably do eight pull-ups.
- Eight?

1158
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,310
There are guys who can do 10 to 20.

1159
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,320
But I can do that many
if they're half pull-ups.

1160
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,920
(Half pull-ups)

1161
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,590
I feel like you make me childish.

1162
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,790
When I was just talking...

1163
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,400
It's been so long
since I was last obsessed with the count.

1164
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,030
Will you stop taming me?

1165
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,870
Taming a fox.

1166
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,900
I won't turn you into a hedgehog.

1167
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,510
How can a bunny tame a fox?

1168
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,280
Weren't you a puppy? Not a fox.

1169
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,750
- Me?
- Yes.

1170
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,510
I pursue
the characteristics of a fox, though.

1171
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,910
You pursue them?

1172
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,320
He aims to be like a fox.

1173
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,920
But his true nature is that of a puppy.

1174
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,090
I should read it now.

1175
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,090
He'll take out Ji Min's and read it.

1176
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,670
Why are you so silent? You're scaring me.

1177
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,700
What?

1178
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,810
I'm concentrating.

1179
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,210
Don't tell me you're ruling me out...

1180
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,280
in your head.

1181
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,310
"You've failed the screening test."

1182
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,110
- I'm kidding.
- Seriously.

1183
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,510
I'm kidding.

1184
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,520
You're really scary.

1185
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,980
I was joking.

1186
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,690
You were so scary just now.

1187
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,060
- They have good banter now.
- Yes.

1188
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,960
Why are you laughing?

1189
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,760
Oh, shoot.

1190
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,100
What is it?

1191
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,030
I regretted writing that.

1192
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,900
What's it about?

1193
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,110
Oh, his moves.

1194
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,040
- Please don't.
- Why?

1195
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,040
- "Whispering?"
- Whispering is his move.

1196
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,120
That's wrong.

1197
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,850
Everyone can whisper.

1198
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,050
Have you whispered to anyone
while you were here?

1199
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,460
- Has he?
- I think so.

1200
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,190
(Pondering)

1201
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,830
(Ji Min whispered in her ears
last night at the theater.)

1202
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,700
- Oh, in the theater.
- He did.

1203
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,630
(Ji Min whispered in her ears
last night at the theater.)

1204
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,110
(Feeling exposed)

1205
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,350
(Je Yeon bursts into laughter again.)

1206
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,480
Now what?

1207
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,180
Is she getting revenge?

1208
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,890
"How do I want my partner
to express her love?"

1209
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,090
- What was my answer?
- What?

1210
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,760
"Hugging and kissing."

1211
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,990
Your answers are pretty honest.

1212
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,300
Do you tend to be cute?

1213
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,730
- About the hugging,
- Yes.

1214
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,900
I'm going into her arms.

1215
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,330
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1216
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,970
She's not the one giving you a hug?

1217
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,100
I like that too,
but I also like being hugged.

1218
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,570
You really are a puppy.

1219
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,410
- I'm a fox.
- A puppy who wishes to be a fox.

1220
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,780
(This is funny.)

1221
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,620
He was a puppy!

1222
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,520
He totally is.

1223
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,250
That's adorable.

1224
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,020
- He seems pleased, though.
- Yes.

1225
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,090
Submit your document today.

1226
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,760
Okay, I'll submit mine.

1227
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,000
- Are we here?
- We've arrived.

1228
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,240
(Tapping)

1229
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,380
What?

1230
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,380
You're the princess with a mirror.
It's cute.

1231
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,020
- She's the Mirror Princess.
- Why do you apply it like this?

1232
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,120
- Like this.
- What?

1233
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,190
You apply it like this.

1234
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,020
- That's so cute.
- He's teasing her.

1235
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,960
I chose this restaurant
because you said you prioritized taste.

1236
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,700
Great.

1237
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,600
An eel restaurant.

1238
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,670
(Ji Min chose this place,
hoping she'd love it.)

1239
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,870
- This looks nice.
- So many people came here.

1240
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:45,940
They did.

1241
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,640
(The wall of autographs makes
the place more credible.)

1242
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

1243
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,210
Hello.

1244
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,850
Welcome.

1245
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,120
Oh, that's how you serve it.

1246
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,990
- That looks delicious.
- It does.

1247
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,920
That looks so good.

1248
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,590
- Push them to the side and eat them.
- Okay.

1249
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,060
I'll give you two pairs of tongs.

1250
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,760
- No, I'll just do it.
- Sure.

1251
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,660
Je Yeon, I got it.

1252
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,100
I'm really good at this.

1253
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,800
See?

1254
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,210
She's so cute.

1255
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,410
Is this unnecessary?

1256
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,840
(Finding her cute)

1257
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,150
(Ji Min will do the grilling.)

1258
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,680
How about we cook them
for a bit longer and eat them?

1259
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,920
Try one.

1260
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,090
Is it cooked?

1261
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,190
It's hot.

1262
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,200
It's good.

1263
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,730
This certainly is a popular place.

1264
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,000
- Eat the ones on the edge.
- Okay.

1265
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,810
This is seriously good.

1266
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,770
- We chose the right place, didn't we?
- Yes.

1267
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,440
- Here's your eel soup.
- Okay.

1268
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,050
- It's delicious.
- Thanks. Enjoy your food.

1269
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,490
Is it like loach soup?

1270
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:05,590
- Right.
- Does it taste like one?

1271
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,390
- Thanks.
- That must smell nice.

1272
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,860
He's so nice to her.

1273
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,630
(He gives her the bowl of rice.)

1274
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:23,040
(He eats his rice on the lid.)

1275
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,340
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

1276
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,580
The sesame leaves are also good.

1277
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,810
- The sesame leaves?
- Yes.

1278
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,280
They taste like garlic leaves,
your favorite.

1279
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,410
(He picks up a sesame leaf
and puts it on her plate.)

1280
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,610
Thank you.

1281
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,480
- Don't I eat really well?
- Yes.

1282
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,450
Usually, I eat very well.

1283
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,890
- She's very comfortable around him now.
- Seriously.

1284
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,020
(Pleased)

1285
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,590
(A thought strikes him.)

1286
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,230
Today is the last day of our relationship.

1287
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,500
Isn't it hard to believe?

1288
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
(It's already the last day
of their contract relationship.)

1289
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,900
We didn't have much time.

1290
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,170
- Three days?
- Yes.

1291
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:58,270
(The 3-day relationship was too short.)

1292
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,510
Also, it might be strange.

1293
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
When it's over?

1294
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,960
- I think Je Yeon is falling for him.
- The look on their faces...

1295
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,770
We've never seen that look
on their faces, have we?

1296
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,800
We haven't.

1297
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:30,240
Depending on whom you're with,

1298
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,570
do you behave differently?

1299
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,070
Me?

1300
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,480
- Or are you always the same?
- Doesn't everyone change?

1301
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,480
Of course.

1302
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,520
Are you the same?

1303
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,580
No.

1304
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,050
- I'm completely different.
- I'm completely different too.

1305
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,890
She must sense how different she is
in front of Woo Jae...

1306
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,330
and Ji Min.

1307
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,500
I have the most fun when I'm with you.

1308
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,730
- Oh, no.
- His eyes turned melancholic again.

1309
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,270
Why? Because it's different from usual?

1310
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,910
I think so.

1311
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,310
I like this side of myself.

1312
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,520
(In front of Je Yeon,)

1313
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,520
(I can be myself the most,
and I like that.)

1314
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,360
If I get to do something with you
next time,

1315
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,630
I'd like to do something active.

1316
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,900
Something active?

1317
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,940
I don't know many activities in winter.

1318
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,500
- Right, even if we get to do something...
- I like amusement parks.

1319
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,640
- What?
- Amusement parks.

1320
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,170
She brought it up first.

1321
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,810
- That's active.
- Yes.

1322
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,680
When I went to Jamsil yesterday,

1323
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,280
I wanted to go to the amusement park.

1324
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,280
Then I thought that it'd be too crowded.

1325
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,980
And so...

1326
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,390
I'll make it happen.

1327
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,590
That's nice and manly.
That's how to do it.

1328
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,390
"I'll make it happen."

1329
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,460
I didn't know about this place.

1330
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,570
Me neither.

1331
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,540
There is no empty space.

1332
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,110
- Right.
- It looks very dense.

1333
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,510
- Gosh, I'm cold.
- Are you cold?

1334
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,080
Let's put this behind your neck.

1335
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,810
Behind my neck? Won't it fall off?

1336
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,110
I'll fix it in your coat.

1337
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,310
Okay.

1338
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,620
I'll put mine in.

1339
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,950
- Won't you be cold?
- It's okay.

1340
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,150
(Ji Min sticks a hand warmer
inside Je Yeon's coat.)

1341
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,190
Did it work?

1342
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,060
I'll do it instead. Give it to me.

1343
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,020
You seem to be struggling.

1344
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,830
- I won't be able to secure it.
- Do it like this.

1345
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,000
Stick it in and keep your neck straight.

1346
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,500
- Like this?
- Like treating the forward head posture.

1347
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,370
Then I have to keep my head like this.

1348
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,500
- No, that's not necessary.
- Yes, it is.

1349
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,870
- It's very...
- Doesn't it work like this?

1350
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,040
Keep it here like this.

1351
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,280
Your coat doesn't stretch easily.
I'm wearing a dress,

1352
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,650
and the collar is wide.

1353
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,210
So it might slide.

1354
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,750
I'll just hold it.

1355
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,680
Look around. There's no one.

1356
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,220
- Isn't it nice?
- Until the end of the road.

1357
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,490
He keeps carrying her bag.

1358
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,760
(They're walking along the reed field
alone side by side.)

1359
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,420
Does it look good on me?

1360
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,760
It suits you perfectly.

1361
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,100
Carry it all day long today.

1362
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,460
Keep carrying it.

1363
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,930
- Usually, husbands do that.
- Right.

1364
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,340
I'm not extremely cold,
so put this on you.

1365
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,410
No, it's okay.

1366
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,810
I'm not very cold right now. I'm fine.

1367
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,710
What if you catch a cold?

1368
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,480
- Why don't we cover ourselves together?
- Together?

1369
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,350
Aren't you cold?

1370
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:28,680
I'll use half of it.

1371
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,660
My gosh.

1372
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,590
We have two hours left.

1373
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,890
It's sad that time is passing.

1374
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,330
Two hours?

1375
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,030
Let's spend two hours well together.

1376
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,730
What?

1377
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,800
What's wrong?

1378
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,210
- Shouldn't we spend it well?
- You're right.

1379
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,910
Ji Min can't stop smiling.

1380
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,480
I kept looking at our photos
before falling asleep.

1381
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,150
- Aren't they lovely?
- Yes.

1382
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,050
(Four-cut photos
showing their memory together)

1383
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,120
He pulled her toward him.

1384
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,020
This is good enough.

1385
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,760
(He looked at the photos all night long.)

1386
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,300
Ji Min is really in love with her.

1387
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,000
We look very different.

1388
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,170
It's fun and pleasing to look at them.

1389
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,170
He's very honest about it.

1390
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,610
- What makes it a good photo for you?
- What?

1391
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,040
When your face come out well?

1392
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,550
Don't you agree with me?

1393
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,480
What did you say?

1394
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,490
A photo turned out well
when your face looks good in it?

1395
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,950
No, that's not true.

1396
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,820
I like how...

1397
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,930
both of us are smiling.

1398
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,730
Didn't you have more to say?

1399
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,730
Yes, and...

1400
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,200
- Or was it a period?
- "Period?"

1401
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,400
(They laugh at the slightest joke.)

1402
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,870
They look so good together.

1403
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,680
So you like amusement parks?

1404
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,580
I like the atmosphere.

1405
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,780
- I know what you mean.
- Right?

1406
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,120
Like wearing a headband
and a school uniform.

1407
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,550
You know...

1408
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,920
You'd look good in it.

1409
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,030
I'll dress you up as a puppy.

1410
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,400
You should dress me up as a fox.

1411
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,560
- A fox?
- Yes.

1412
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,300
Otherwise, I'll dress you up as a monkey
instead of a rabbit.

1413
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,770
But isn't a monkey ridiculous?

1414
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,330
Puppies are cute.

1415
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,800
A monkey next to a puppy would be funny.

1416
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,540
Monkeys have cute ears.

1417
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,640
Do they?

1418
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,040
The perfect image of you
as an animal is...

1419
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,180
a sloth.

1420
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,850
A sloth?

1421
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,320
Last time, you said that it was a turtle.

1422
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,720
I like speed.

1423
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,350
I don't like being slow.

1424
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,760
I like things that are fast.

1425
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,060
Why is the sloth image so funny?

1426
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,560
A sloth doesn't fit me at all.

1427
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,900
- She got frantic.
- She spoke with an accent.

1428
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,300
- She said "speed" with an accent.
- It sounded like...

1429
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,340
- "I like speed."
- "I like speed."

1430
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,500
She was in a hurry.

1431
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,240
- "I like speed."
- "I like speed."

1432
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,640
"I don't like being slow."

1433
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,680
(That's so funny.)

1434
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,140
Right here.

1435
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,950
(They arrive at a nearby cafe.)

1436
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,220
It's warm in here.

1437
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,020
- It's nice.
- I agree.

1438
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,090
Have a strawberry first.

1439
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,270
After spending three days together,

1440
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,780
wouldn't it be strange to see
each other dating someone else?

1441
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,910
- Oh, no.
- Right.

1442
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,380
I was sitting next to you
for the last few days.

1443
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,650
Now, you can sit next to someone else.

1444
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,820
I might feel...

1445
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,290
somewhat jealous.

1446
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
Goodness.

1447
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,270
How do I face you starting from tomorrow?

1448
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,500
"How do I face you
starting from tomorrow?"

1449
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,970
You can't pretend not to know me
all of a sudden, okay?

1450
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,570
I wouldn't do that.

1451
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,480
Three days weren't long enough for me.

1452
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,020
Now they can communicate with their eyes.

1453
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,090
- Right.
- Yes.

1454
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,460
(Thinking)

1455
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,620
- Shall we extend it to three more days?
- Extending the contract?

1456
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,490
Has Ji Min learned acting?

1457
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,690
It's like watching a drama.

1458
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,040
What was your favorite
during the last three days?

1459
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,900
My favorite?

1460
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,970
(Thinking)

1461
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,550
I liked how I got to see new sides of you.

1462
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,020
I thought that you were a hedgehog.

1463
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,050
Me?

1464
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,050
Actually, you're a puppy
who wants to be a fox.

1465
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,660
This makes me so happy.

1466
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,760
How adorable!

1467
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,890
Only you know about it.

1468
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,500
I'll keep it a secret.

1469
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,900
For me...

1470
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,000
My favorite thing?

1471
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,480
I liked being awkward with you
at the four-cut photo booth.

1472
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,750
Inside the car on our way back
after having cocktails.

1473
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,620
How you were drunk.

1474
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,390
How I was drunk?

1475
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,730
Yes.

1476
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,900
I'd like to see stars from here.

1477
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,200
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

1478
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,540
Now that you're drunk,
you're even more attractive.

1479
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,570
What? I'm not drunk.

1480
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,070
That's cute too.

1481
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,080
(Opening wide)

1482
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,740
- Are you tensing your eyes open?
- How did you know?

1483
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,810
Is it obvious?

1484
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,250
I want to do it when I get back home,

1485
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,950
so I was giving it a try.

1486
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,050
My eyes keep closing.

1487
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,290
That was the most memorable.

1488
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,130
It was also nice in the car earlier today.

1489
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,840
(Feeling embarrassed)

1490
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,650
(A moment ago at the parking lot)

1491
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,820
The song sounds familiar.

1492
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,950
If you know, I'll give you 10 cents.

1493
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,060
I don't recognize it.

1494
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
(Tap)

1495
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,630
Is he holding her hand?

1496
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,870
What?

1497
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,770
- Did he hold her hand?
- Did he?

1498
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:55,840
Wait a minute.

1499
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,310
He put his hand on top of hers.

1500
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,470
(Frozen)

1501
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,080
Can you use a camera
that moves up and down next time?

1502
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,180
The one that goes down.
You know what I mean?

1503
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,910
Je Yeon didn't pull her hand away, right?

1504
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,650
- She kept it there.
- Right.

1505
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,150
(That's right.)

1506
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,250
(Fidgeting)

1507
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,790
That's why it was nice in the car.

1508
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,560
Why are you laughing?

1509
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,500
Ji Min's face might burst from laughing.

1510
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,500
It's nothing.

1511
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,300
He's breathing fast.

1512
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,680
(Feeling shy)

1513
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,020
I also liked our conversations.

1514
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,390
Our conversations?

1515
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,960
I had a good feeling from talking to you.

1516
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,290
Having good conversations is
very important.

1517
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,700
You seem to be curious...

1518
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,000
(You seem to be curious...)

1519
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,500
about the other person's thoughts.

1520
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,640
You asked me...

1521
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,610
a lot of questions
to get to know me better.

1522
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,610
Are your close friends from college?

1523
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,140
I have friends from college
and law school.

1524
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,910
Which ones are your closest friends?

1525
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,510
- My friends from college.
- College?

1526
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:15,520
Are there any particularities
that make you want...

1527
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,290
to have a serious relationship
with someone?

1528
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,020
Weren't there ranks?

1529
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,020
There are corporate lawyers and...

1530
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:25,930
- Partners?
- Right, partners.

1531
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,730
Yes, partners and associates.

1532
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,530
Associates.
Aren't they the lowest in rank?

1533
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,560
Yes.

1534
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:33,230
I tend to be like that,

1535
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,040
and I like to do that too.

1536
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,440
I thought that we were compatible
in that way.

1537
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,810
You can tell how sincere he is
in his look.

1538
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,310
I also like honest conversations.

1539
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,680
- I see.
- I like honest people.

1540
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,480
- Honest?
- In terms of that,

1541
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,850
I thought that we were compatible.

1542
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,690
What about the hedgehog?

1543
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:59,690
Right.

1544
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,170
Let's stay the same when we go back.

1545
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,970
I'll look for you often.

1546
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,510
(I'll look for you often.)

1547
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:27,290
(It's 5 p.m.)

1548
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:33,830
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's
contract relationship has ended.)

1549
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:40,940
She's so cute.

1550
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,800
Do you like babies?

1551
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,210
Yes.

1552
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,170
Do you want children...

1553
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,280
- when you get married?
- Yes.

1554
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,710
How many?

1555
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,410
- Two children.
- I see.

1556
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,150
Two boys, two girls, or a boy and a girl?

1557
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,750
It'd be nice to have one each.

1558
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:59,990
Right.

1559
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,390
You'd be a good mother.

1560
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,490
You'd be overly enthusiastic
about your children's education.

1561
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,590
About my children's education?

1562
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,100
(Laughing)

1563
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,660
If I were your husband,

1564
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,570
I'd say, "Stop it.
Our children are only human."

1565
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,600
I might say that.

1566
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,500
"Do they have to win first place?"

1567
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,170
Why do you think that I'd be a good mom?

1568
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,280
I may be enthusiastic
about their education,

1569
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,280
but would I take good care of them?

1570
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,410
You'd take good care of them.

1571
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,780
Also, you wouldn't treat them emotionally.

1572
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,490
You would persuade and guide them well.

1573
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:38,990
As well as your man.

1574
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,160
- Really?
- Yes.

1575
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,400
He says things...

1576
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,700
- that Kim Eun Sook would write.
- My goodness.

1577
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,870
I totally agree.

1578
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,740
I'm sure that he learned acting.

1579
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,410
At the end... You know what I mean?

1580
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,640
He says the subject at the very end.
After saying everything,

1581
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:57,210
he said, "As well as your man."
What was that about?

1582
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,580
He knows how to make it funny
at the last moment.

1583
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,780
That's hilarious.

1584
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,080
(Ji Min's killer charm has been updated.)

1585
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,660
An accident-prone area is coming up.

1586
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,190
- It looks so beautiful.
- Shall I take a photo?

1587
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,390
(The sky is colored by the evening glow.)

1588
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,070
It's beautiful.

1589
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,600
- It's so beautiful.
- It is.

1590
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,940
(They take photos
of their moments together.)

1591
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,070
Here we go again.

1592
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,180
(Inflating her cheeks)

1593
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,680
(Copying her cheek balloons)

1594
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,050
- Goodness.
- He's mirroring her.

1595
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,890
When I brought up four-cut photos,
you laughed.

1596
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,060
Because it was cute.

1597
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,030
How was that cute?

1598
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:49,800
Usually, everything about her is cute.

1599
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,100
All she has to do is breathe.

1600
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,770
Why did my phone switch modes again?

1601
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,570
- The same happened to me.
- Really?

1602
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,540
Isn't it because our contract ended?

1603
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,910
- Wait, the chat...
- The chat.

1604
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,840
Can't I access it?

1605
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,910
Is it gone?

1606
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,710
- That must be it.
- That must be it.

1607
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:05,850
Take care.

1608
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:08,850
- They must be locked out.
- Take care.

1609
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,150
Take care.

1610
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,020
I can't be curious
about what you do at night anymore.

1611
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,760
(Pouting)

1612
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,020
She's pouting.

1613
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:23,360
(He gets dizzy
from the cute face she made.)

1614
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,370
She's handling him once again.

1615
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,900
No way. This couple is no joke.

1616
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,370
- Should I make a turn?
- What?

1617
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,570
- Should I make a turn?
- Should I make a turn?

1618
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,170
- To go where?
- To run off with her.

1619
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,310
Should I turn the car around?

1620
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,910
Oh, that. Sure.

1621
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:37,980
(Chuckling)

1622
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,720
- His heart skipped a beat at her answer.
- I know.

1623
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,720
Je Yeon's charming, isn't she?

1624
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,790
She is.

1625
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:48,290
(Ji Min and Je Yeon's
contract relationship...)

1626
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,560
(comes to an unfortunate end.)

1627
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,660
- No way.
- My gosh.

1628
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,900
- That was...
- Kim Eun Sook.

1629
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,630
- I was reminded of Kim Eun Sook.
- They sounded like lines...

1630
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,530
- from Kim Eun Sook's drama series.
- Exactly.

1631
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:02,170
That's what we got
from Ji Min's choice of words.

1632
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:03,700
- Right?
- Down to that last one.

1633
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,140
"As well as your man."

1634
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,210
I mean...

1635
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:08,780
I remember how Ji Min was at the cafe.

1636
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,040
Their date was soon going to end,

1637
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,010
so he was trying to burn the image of her
into his memory.

1638
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,210
- By eyeing her every move.
- Yes.

1639
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:16,320
He was eyeing her every move
and listening to her every word.

1640
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,150
- It was touching.
- He got Je Yeon...

1641
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,190
to open her heart and let him in.

1642
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,390
- Eventually.
- She had no choice.

1643
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,490
- Which conversation do you remember?
- This one.

1644
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,460
"I thought you were a hedgehog,"

1645
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,490
"but you turned out to be a puppy."

1646
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,730
- I thought you were a hedgehog.
- Me?

1647
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,470
But you were a puppy trying to be a fox.

1648
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,440
She began the conversation
with that metaphor,

1649
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,640
- and Ji Min gave it a perfect ending.
- That's right.

1650
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,410
Only you know that.

1651
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,810
Really?

1652
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,610
Like that, Ji Min knows...

1653
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,110
- what to say at the end.
- I know.

1654
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,850
What's your take on Ji Min?

1655
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,280
He's the ultimate bachelor.

1656
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,050
As someone to marry or as someone to date?

1657
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,190
Both.

1658
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:53,950
- Really?
- Chan Hyeong...

1659
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,190
has always had your vote.

1660
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,560
(The sudden attack leaves her speechless.)

1661
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:59,130
I've been on the fence
since the last episode.

1662
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,360
To be honest... Sorry about that.

1663
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,200
I've been saying I'm your biggest fan,

1664
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,800
but now I'm not sure.

1665
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,270
- Ji Min...
- You can't help it.

1666
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,770
Ji Min's the kind of man I like.

1667
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,010
If they invite me to their wedding,
I'm going to be there.

1668
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,410
You were always a fan of Mr. Brown.

1669
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,640
Yes, I was always fond of Mr. Brown.

1670
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,480
Although, he had his hardships.

1671
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,510
It wasn't easy.

1672
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,010
- It wasn't chilly during the day.
- I know.

1673
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,980
- It's definitely chillier at night.
- It's chilly at night, right?

1674
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,180
- Woo Jae and Ji Won are first to be back.
- No one's here.

1675
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,820
You never know who'll end up with who.

1676
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,320
Where should I put this? Over there?

1677
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,760
- That'd be nice.
- Right?

1678
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,690
Where it wouldn't stand out so much.

1679
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,590
- This looks good.
- It's pretty.

1680
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,860
- Let's go.
- Sure.

1681
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,930
It's freezing.

1682
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,900
I'm going to make kimchi fried rice.

1683
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:45,470
(It's now a familiar sight
to see Homemaker Park cook.)

1684
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,380
(They make sure to clean up
around the house when they can.)

1685
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,380
Chae Eun's neat and tidy.

1686
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,450
(Tidy)

1687
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,620
(Clean)

1688
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,590
- I'm off to the bathroom first.
- Sure.

1689
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,920
Je Yeon and Ji Min are back.

1690
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,760
Oh, hey.

1691
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,760
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

1692
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,960
- Just now?
- We just got back.

1693
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,190
- Did you just get back?
- Yes.

1694
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:08,900
Where did you go?

1695
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,670
- We went to Paju.
- Paju?

1696
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,300
There, we ate grilled eel.

1697
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,470
- I remember you saying that.
- We then went to a cafe.

1698
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,800
How was the eel?

1699
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,370
- It was delicious.
- Was it?

1700
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,640
We went to a famous place.

1701
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,810
- Was it a famous place?
- Yes.

1702
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:23,240
Did Ji Min look it up?

1703
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,310
Yes.

1704
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,580
Is Ji Min back?

1705
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,980
- Yes.
- Right. You came back together.

1706
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,520
- Anyway, I'm off to the bathroom.
- Sure.

1707
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,750
Did you get changed?

1708
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,060
I just got back myself.

1709
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,090
Did you engage in serious conversations?

1710
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,130
Yes. We talked about how we felt...

1711
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,330
during this course of time.

1712
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,800
What about you?

1713
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,800
I guess we talked about that too.

1714
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,940
- Really?
- Yes.

1715
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,510
- It was pretty much the same.
- Sure.

1716
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,440
- You should get changed.
- I'm off to the bathroom.

1717
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,710
I shouldn't change out of this.

1718
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,050
Are you going to top it
with a fried egg...

1719
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,290
or just stir-fry the egg with the rice?

1720
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,420
You can fry your own egg if you want some.

1721
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,260
That's not what I meant.

1722
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,360
- I wanted your opinion.
- I know,

1723
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,030
but that's what I ended up saying.

1724
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,970
I can't believe you.

1725
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,900
(Ji Min's fun to tease.)

1726
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,600
That was brutally heartless.

1727
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:28,180
- Hi.
- Hi.

1728
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,580
- Hello.
- Is that kimchi fried rice?

1729
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,510
- Hi.
- Yes, kimchi fried rice...

1730
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,680
and soft tofu stew.

1731
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,180
Excuse me.

1732
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,680
Did you all have a good time?

1733
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,720
- We had a good time.
- Good for you.

1734
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,920
They all must've had early lunches.

1735
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,120
- I know. They're all...
- They're already hungry.

1736
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,360
- We're still quite full.
- We are.

1737
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,260
- I'm starving.
- Really?

1738
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,200
- I'm starving.
- When did you eat?

1739
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,600
- At 1 p.m.
- I see.

1740
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,870
It already looks delicious, Chang Hwan.

1741
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,670
Can't I have some right now?

1742
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,240
She keeps glancing at him.

1743
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,910
- You're so good at this.
- You're right.

1744
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,740
- With dried laver?
- That looks so good!

1745
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,810
- This is nice.
- Chang Hwan is a chef.

1746
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,450
Tell me about it. He's someone I like.

1747
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:10,320
Of course. The dish needs fried eggs.

1748
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,320
- This is no joke.
- I know.

1749
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,690
It's really good.

1750
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,220
We're now back to being single again.

1751
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,690
- I'll enjoy.
- Please enjoy.

1752
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:19,890
Chae Eun's not here.

1753
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,060
She's coming.

1754
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,530
I think she'll be here soon.

1755
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,800
Welcome.

1756
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,470
She must've been sleeping.
She looks cuter.

1757
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,100
(She enters in cute pajamas.)

1758
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:34,340
- We also need to eat the cake she made.
- Right.

1759
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:35,640
Don't think about leaving the table.

1760
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:38,310
Even though we're full,
we have to eat it all.

1761
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:40,710
- New feelings have blossomed.
- Thank you for this.

1762
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,150
- Thank you. I'll enjoy it.
- Thank you.

1763
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,220
- Is it okay?
- This is delicious.

1764
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,860
- It's not easy to cook for eight people.
- I know.

1765
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,660
This is delicious.

1766
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,300
- Really?
- Yes.

1767
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,900
- It's on another level.
- I know.

1768
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,430
It's good.

1769
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,900
- It's getting even better.
- He did a great job.

1770
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,400
They shared a gaze.

1771
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,710
He looks so happy.

1772
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,140
- Ji Min, contain your smiles!
- Is cooking school food my thing?

1773
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,610
Maybe I'm like the Master of School Food.

1774
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,840
The Master of School Food.

1775
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,210
(Self-conscious)

1776
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,620
(Glancing)

1777
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,320
(During dinner,
the two enter their own little world.)

1778
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,160
Won't the show be airing by now?

1779
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,530
Ha Neul's aware of the vibe between them.

1780
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,200
Ji Won, the flowers are pretty.

1781
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,360
- Right?
- Yes.

1782
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,930
- That huge one.
- That's right.

1783
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:34,500
I'm curious. How much was it?

1784
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,270
We went to a place
run by Woo Jae's friend.

1785
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,140
Really?

1786
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,840
- No way.
- That's huge.

1787
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,410
- Let's see.
- Is that it?

1788
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,280
- Did you think it was that one?
- Yes.

1789
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,810
- I was going to say it was pretty.
- It seemed like...

1790
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,380
Chae Eun was looking at something else.

1791
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,820
I thought it was something else.

1792
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,420
Her head was at a different angle.

1793
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,890
Her head should've been in that direction.

1794
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,690
- Chae Eun, come on.
- After the hard work we put in?

1795
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,520
She was saying
that something else was pretty.

1796
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,960
- That wasn't it.
- No wonder.

1797
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:02,460
I was wondering
why you suddenly went over there.

1798
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,800
That's so funny.

1799
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:09,440
(After dinner,
they gather to talk once more.)

1800
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,200
I need to take a photo of this.

1801
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,140
- Knock-knock.
- Hey.

1802
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,580
Let's go.

1803
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,610
I bet you're sleepy.

1804
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,120
Only a bit.

1805
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,820
- Would you like some time?
- Yes.

1806
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,560
Hey.

1807
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,460
- You can sit here.
- What was that?

1808
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,560
- What?
- What did you say?

1809
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,600
Would you like to sit here?

1810
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,870
She went to sit next to him.

1811
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:42,740
Je Yeon's following Ji Min's lead.

1812
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1813
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,910
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Enjoy.

1814
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,150
Here's to another busy week.

1815
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,950
- Cheers.
- The week's already over.

1816
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,390
I know. It's like treasure.

1817
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:04,930
- It's a treasure.
- It maintained its shape.

1818
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,560
- Let me lift it.
- Sure.

1819
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,700
- Is this tight enough?
- Yes, I'm good.

1820
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,660
It was sweet
how they tied each other's aprons.

1821
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,670
- Is it on hard mode?
- Yes, hard mode.

1822
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,430
It shows that you've done this before.

1823
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,270
(Chang Hwan's side, Chae Eun's side)

1824
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,040
(They made a Christmas cake
for everyone to enjoy.)

1825
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,540
It'll be like topping it with snow.

1826
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,410
- Nice.
- That's cute.

1827
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,050
It's pretty.

1828
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,350
- Let's do it.
- Two, three.

1829
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,450
- Didn't you blow it out?
- Impressive lung capacity.

1830
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,490
He blew in that direction.

1831
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:32,690
As expected from a former soccer player.

1832
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,690
- But we're having fun.
- It can't end just yet.

1833
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,490
I should run away.

1834
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,590
What now?

1835
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,700
Wait, what? A new...

1836
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,000
We're entering
new relationships this Friday.

1837
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,600
- What?
- See?

1838
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,730
- A new contract relationship.
- They get to do this twice?

1839
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,470
(Starting this Friday, you'll be entering
a new contract relationship.)

1840
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:55,580
(The news of new contract relationships
causes a shift in the air.)

1841
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,980
Look at Ji Won. She's gotten all serious.

1842
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,050
She must be anxious.

1843
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,950
I wonder who everyone
will write down this Friday?

1844
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,550
(What kind of changes will...)

1845
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,560
(the new contract relationships bring?)

1846
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,760
I...

1847
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,300
This has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

1848
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,470
But even if you get paired up...

1849
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,540
with someone else,

1850
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:25,970
I'll try not to be disappointed.

1851
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Sure.

1852
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,080
(Nodding)

1853
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,780
I don't know who Chan Hyeong will choose.

1854
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:36,520
You're right. Chan Hyeong's the wild card.

1855
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,050
I thought you were the wild card,

1856
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,420
but it turned out to be Chan Hyeong.

1857
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,990
That's something we talked about.
Chan Hyeong...

1858
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,790
- I don't know who...
- Chan Hyeong... I know.

1859
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,930
- I don't know who he likes.
- Exactly. We talked about that too.

1860
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,500
There will come a time...

1861
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,670
for Chan Hyeong
to finally make up his mind.

1862
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:57,140
And you think we'll have a love triangle?

1863
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,410
I don't know who'll be caught in it,

1864
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,010
but we'll have a love triangle.

1865
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,880
I believe we'll soon witness
the Revolt of Lee Chan Hyeong.

1866
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,150
That'll be our biggest challenge.

1867
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,880
The Revolt of Lee Chan Hyeong.

1868
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,120
I'll get going.

1869
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,750
New contract relationships
are on the horizon!

1870
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,990
(This show is spicy.)

1871
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,090
- This is spicy.
- I thought everyone...

1872
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,190
was getting a happy ending.

1873
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,020
When the new contract relationships
were announced,

1874
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,360
Ji Won seemed the most stressed.

1875
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,730
Gosh, Ji Won.

1876
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:21,960
She's most vulnerable
to emotional fluctuations.

1877
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,000
I agree.

1878
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,130
There are two people who I believe
will benefit from this new contract.

1879
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:28,340
Ha Neul and Chan Hyeong.

1880
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:31,100
I can't forget the sparkle
in Ha Neul's eyes.

1881
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,470
- Did you see her smile?
- Yes, earlier.

1882
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,440
I can't forget that look in her eyes.

1883
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:36,910
(A deep gaze)

1884
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:39,550
It's what you'd expect
in a weekend soap opera.

1885
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,280
A weekend soap opera.

1886
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,250
Ha Neul is the reason
this show feels so dynamic.

1887
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,250
- I agree.
- Right.

1888
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,390
Ha Neul impressed me today.

1889
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:47,120
This is what I liked about her.

1890
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,760
She ended the date with Chan Hyeong...

1891
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,990
- It was clean.
- She left nothing on the table.

1892
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,360
By doing so, Chan Hyeong...

1893
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,890
- could smile and move on.
- That's right.

1894
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,060
- Right.
- I'll get going.

1895
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,060
(The Revolt of Chan Hyeong
or Springtime for Chan Hyeong?)

1896
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:00,800
It snowed that day.

1897
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,270
It's Chan Hyeong.

1898
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,110
That must be his friend.

1899
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,540
- We rarely see each other outside.
- I know.

1900
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,750
- It's been a while.
- We always talk shop in the office.

1901
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,850
- I know.
- Right.

1902
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,250
I was able to spend most of my time...

1903
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,290
with one of the ladies.

1904
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:25,460
Spending time with only one person
would've kept you...

1905
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,400
from getting to know the other ladies.

1906
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,160
That's true. Yes.

1907
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:33,730
- Ha Neul's the best. She's great.
- Of course.

1908
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:34,830
However...

1909
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:39,670
(Were we able to get to know each other?)

1910
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,340
(What?)

1911
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:47,310
(Maybe there wasn't enough time...)

1912
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,850
(for them to get to know each other.)

1913
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:55,560
There's nothing easy about this.

1914
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,520
You should try harder
since you're on the show.

1915
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,190
- That's true. I should try harder.
- He's right.

1916
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,400
Chae Eun...

1917
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,170
There's a soft quality about her.

1918
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,930
She has the most innocent look.

1919
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,070
- That's right.
- I see.

1920
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,770
She loves food.

1921
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,940
She loves to cook,
and she loves everything about food.

1922
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,710
Everything in a grocery store excites her.

1923
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:17,440
That's what she's interested in.

1924
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,410
She has the vibe
of a nurturing mother and homemaker.

1925
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,780
She seems like the ideal spouse.

1926
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,220
That's what she's like.

1927
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,190
That's right.

1928
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,790
Chan Hyeong has a clear goal.

1929
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:33,090
He's looking for a spouse.

1930
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,090
(He wants a spouse
to spend his life with.)

1931
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,430
Then there's Je Yeon.

1932
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,270
I haven't had the chance...

1933
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,400
- to talk to her properly.
- Of course.

1934
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:44,400
Like me, she has a specialized job.

1935
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,270
- She's a lawyer.
- I see.

1936
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:49,980
(Chan Hyeong comes home
after meeting his friend.)

1937
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,150
May I join you guys?

1938
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,180
- Sure.
- Good.

1939
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,820
What type of law do you mainly practice?

1940
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:59,420
- Of course, he asks about her field.
- What do I specialize in?

1941
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,490
- Yes.
- In legal affairs of companies...

1942
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,790
- and real estate.
- Really?

1943
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,060
Companies?

1944
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:06,460
You might be needing her service.

1945
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,760
Have you ever consulted
for start-ups before?

1946
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,700
- Of course.
- Really?

1947
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,100
Do you assess investment contracts
and things like that?

1948
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:17,170
- I go over them, yes.
- You review them for companies?

1949
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,570
- Really?
- Yes.

1950
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:23,140
Recently, my company
needed some legal advice,

1951
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,310
so we looked for someone to take our case.
As you know,

1952
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:29,220
lawyers specialize in certain fields.

1953
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,980
- Of course.
- Some specialize in corporate law,

1954
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:34,220
so we looked for someone
who has experience working with start-ups.

1955
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,360
- That's your field as well.
- Ji Min needs to be worried.

1956
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:40,430
Was that your first choice?

1957
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,660
At first, I went into real estate.

1958
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,830
- Real estate?
- Yes.

1959
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,330
I then switched gears
and managed corporate affairs.

1960
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,170
- Even M and A.
- Even M and A?

1961
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,080
Tomorrow, Chan Hyeong...

1962
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,040
will eat with Je Yeon.

1963
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:59,210
Je Yeon?

1964
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,750
Did Chan Hyeong suggest it?

1965
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,120
- I was talking to Je Yeon downstairs.
- Right.

1966
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,990
We were just chatting.

1967
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,320
Chan Hyeong came home early today,

1968
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,460
and he hasn't been able
to talk to Je Yeon.

1969
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:17,100
He suggested that they
grab a meal tomorrow.

1970
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,570
- As he should.
- To that,

1971
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,700
- I said they should quickly book a table.
- What?

1972
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:23,470
I said they should quickly book a table.

1973
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:25,140
- Je Yeon's popular.
- I...

1974
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,270
Book a table?

1975
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:30,480
Those who haven't talked to one another
should get a chance.

1976
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,880
I want Je Yeon to explore her options too.

1977
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,110
(Other people
are now interested in Je Yeon.)

1978
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,920
- Because Ha Neul made herself clear...
- She made herself clear.

1979
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,990
- That's right.
- Right.

1980
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,390
That path has been cut off,
so he's finding a different path.

1981
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:47,390
That's right.

1982
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,860
Chan Hyeong is all action, isn't he?

1983
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,030
Chan Hyeong doesn't waste time.

1984
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,030
- That's it.
- Of course.

1985
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,700
He immediately takes action.

1986
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,700
I think the parents among our viewers
would enjoy Chan Hyeong's story.

1987
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:01,980
On paper, he is the guy
that all parents want for their daughter.

1988
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,340
- Even my mom.
- Right?

1989
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,110
She watched the show
and immediately asked about him.

1990
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,610
- Do you have a younger sister?
- I do.

1991
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,720
Despite the age difference,

1992
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,220
- my mom favored him.
- Exactly.

1993
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,350
(Of course, he's a favorite.)

1994
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:18,160
(They eat out as a group
for the first time in a while.)

1995
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,500
(Brushing)

1996
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:31,770
(Adjusting the clothes for the last time)

1997
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:32,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1998
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:33,840
Come on.

1999
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,010
(Leaving the house with excitement.)

2000
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,010
Je Yeon. Why don't we sit at the back?

2001
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,250
- Okay.
- Ji Min asks Je Yeon right away.

2002
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,250
- See you later.
- Ji Min takes great care of Je Yeon.

2003
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:49,660
(Night has fallen on the streets.)

2004
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,530
I'm hungry now.

2005
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:54,090
- I'm back to being hungry.
- Really?

2006
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,530
It's Christmas.

2007
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:56,660
- Pretty.
- Let's go.

2008
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,970
- Christmas.
- Nice.

2009
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:00,400
Head upstairs.

2010
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:02,600
Christmas.

2011
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,840
(A luxurious vibe)

2012
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:08,270
(Today, at this place,)

2013
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:14,280
(what will happen?)

2014
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,650
Nice.

2015
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:20,820
It's like Florence.

2016
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,190
- In Italy.
- When?

2017
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,320
It's similar.

2018
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,830
Was it the day Chae Eun appeared?

2019
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:26,860
Yes.

2020
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:29,200
What's going to happen?

2021
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,370
- Great work today.
- Great work.

2022
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:35,240
- Enjoy.
- Great work.

2023
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:41,310
(They're now a lot closer.)

2024
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,380
- It's so good.
- Right?

2025
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,580
Excuse me.

2026
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:47,250
I love crustaceans.

2027
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,420
- It looks delicious.
- Those all look good.

2028
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,690
(His jaw dropped.)

2029
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:53,990
(Amazed)

2030
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,690
I didn't bring my phone,
but I want to take photos.

2031
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,990
- Share yours with me later.
- I'll share it with you.

2032
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:01,290
She'll take them well, right?

2033
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:02,560
- I'm sure she will.
- Yes.

2034
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,900
- It's not her first time taking it.
- Let's take it.

2035
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,870
She's in love with food.

2036
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,670
This must be the bacon menu.

2037
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,470
Me too.

2038
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,670
(Snap)

2039
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:15,840
It came out well.

2040
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,110
(Impressed)

2041
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:22,220
(Nodding)

2042
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,320
Thank you for the food. Enjoy.

2043
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,390
- Enjoy.
- Thank you for the food.

2044
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,760
- Enjoy.
- Thank you for the food.

2045
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,130
It's really good.

2046
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,400
This here is no joke.

2047
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,100
It's so good.

2048
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,740
It's great.

2049
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,510
I'm suddenly not worried about
my tomorrow self.

2050
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,780
What?

2051
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,780
(Meanwhile)

2052
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,320
What is it? Will someone show up?

2053
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,790
- A catfish?
- No way, this is so wrong.

2054
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,660
Not right now.

2055
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,630
(One person has arrived
at the restaurant.)

2056
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:12,700
- A man or a woman?
- Thank you.

2057
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,230
- It's a guy.
- What?

2058
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,470
Dig in, everyone.

2059
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,870
Okay. I'll do that, Mr. Shin.

2060
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:21,340
- Let's begin after our meal.
- Thanks for the meal, Woo Jae.

2061
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,040
That's hilarious.

2062
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,040
(Happy)

2063
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,150
Who can eat jjajangmyeon tomorrow?

2064
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,420
Me.

2065
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,420
Let's enjoy a date then.

2066
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,660
Don't you dare ask for a bite.

2067
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,390
Not even a piece of tangsuyuk.

2068
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,600
(While they're enjoying dinner,)

2069
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,270
(a mysterious man approaches
the residents.)

2070
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,640
- You're mean.
- I'm mean?

2071
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,280
- "You're mean."
- Then I'll give you a bite.

2072
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,310
Nice.

2073
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:02,250
(They're getting closer.)

2074
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,020
- Oh, my.
- This is bad.

2075
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,150
- He's good-looking.
- Okay.

2076
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,390
- I'm already on my second glass of wine.
- Hey.

2077
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:08,760
- Get ready.
- Same here.

2078
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,120
- Really?
- Yes.

2079
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:12,660
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

2080
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,860
He's approaching them.

2081
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:16,830
Hi.

2082
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:24,540
What a looker.

2083
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,970
(Surprised)

2084
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,380
What's this?

2085
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,120
Ji Min?

2086
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:41,690
Ji Min.

2087
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:42,760
(Everyone is shocked...)

2088
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,930
(by the appearance of an unfamiliar man.)

2089
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:48,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

2090
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,030
I'm the guy who is supposed to come today.

2091
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:54,800
(Shocked)

2092
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,670
- We have another member.
- Another member?

2093
01:28:58,870 --> 01:28:59,940
Exactly.

2094
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,280
Oh, my.

2095
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,640
(The new resident
leaves everyone in shock!)

2096
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:06,010
- Gosh.
- He's good-looking.

2097
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,810
- He's very manly.
- Right?

2098
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,420
(The new resident has an intense look.)

2099
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,680
There's a sudden tension.

2100
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,090
We have our fifth male member.

2101
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,760
Is there a fifth female member?

2102
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,090
No way.

2103
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,760
- Hi.
- Hi.

2104
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,630
- The seat...
- A seat...

2105
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,400
Where should he sit?

2106
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,170
- He's handsome.
- I agree.

2107
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:34,170
- Right?
- He's a looker.

2108
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,240
Amazing.

2109
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,810
Nice.

2110
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,120
Hi.

2111
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,990
- The center?
- This is a shocker.

2112
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,820
- I told you earlier, didn't I?
- What?

2113
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,100
What we said as a joke became reality.

2114
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,900
He's here to make us have
an upset stomach.

2115
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,000
(Glancing)

2116
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:05,370
Look at their faces.

2117
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,710
Did you not know I was coming?

2118
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,720
Not one bit.

2119
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,750
Really?

2120
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,360
I thought you were an idol.

2121
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:25,590
(Brushing)

2122
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,360
He's keeping guard.

2123
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,930
- The guy is very manly.
- Right?

2124
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,870
(An awkward first greeting)

2125
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,180
Are you the owner of this place?

2126
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:47,210
I thought the restaurant owner
was coming to greet us.

2127
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:49,580
Exactly.
Like, "Are you enjoying the meal?"

2128
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,150
Did you just start dinner?

2129
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:53,290
- Yes.
- Yes.

2130
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,860
Nice to meet you.

2131
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,560
- Nice to meet you too.
- Nice to meet you.

2132
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,000
- We're shocked.
- Exactly.

2133
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,230
You shocked us.

2134
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,100
Are there ten members?

2135
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,570
This is no joke at all.

2136
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,470
I can't eat anymore.

2137
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,710
- Why?
- Because it's awkward?

2138
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,080
What about our rooms?

2139
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:21,780
Worry about that later.

2140
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,350
(A stifling atmosphere)

2141
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:31,720
Should we introduce ourselves?

2142
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:33,760
Shall I start?

2143
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,930
My name is Lee Sang Yun.

2144
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:38,030
I'm 29 years old.

2145
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:39,570
- It's open now, right?
- He's the youngest then.

2146
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,130
- Lee Sang Jun?
- It's Lee Sang Yun.

2147
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,340
- Lee Sang Yun?
- Yes.

2148
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,400
Lee Sang Yun.

2149
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,970
The new member is the youngest.

2150
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:50,240
- He's sorting out the ranks.
- It's different.

2151
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:52,750
- Is it your international age?
- International age?

2152
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:53,950
No.

2153
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,110
Which year were you born in?

2154
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:59,550
- I was born in 1996.
- In 1996? As for me,

2155
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,890
I was born in 1992.

2156
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,890
My name is Ahn Ji Min.

2157
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,690
- Are you 34?
- No, 33.

2158
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,890
Thirty-three.

2159
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:11,130
International age-wise, we're 32.
I was also born in 1992.

2160
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,400
But why do you use the international age?

2161
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,900
It's confusing.

2162
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,270
- Oh, no.
- He's quite sharp.

2163
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,070
- We're 33.
- You're 33?

2164
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,440
Born in 1992, my name is Lee Chan Hyeong.

2165
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,880
- Lee Chan Hyeong. Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

2166
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:27,050
- I was born in 1990,
- I see.

2167
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:28,210
and my name is Shin Woo Jae.

2168
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,850
- Shin Woo Jae?
- Yes, Woo Jae.

2169
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,150
I'm the oldest guy here.

2170
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,320
(Impressed)

2171
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,120
I was born in 1984.

2172
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,360
Really?

2173
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,190
My name is Park Chang Hwan.

2174
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:42,600
- You have a baby face.
- Right?

2175
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,270
The air is different, right?

2176
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:54,240
Born in 1996, my name is Bae Chae Eun.

2177
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,370
Bae Chae Eun.

2178
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,580
My goodness.

2179
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,250
I was born in 1999,
and my name is Moon Ji Won.

2180
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,050
Moon Ji Won.

2181
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,830
(Staring)

2182
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,500
I was born in 1995.

2183
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:20,970
My name is Lee Je Yeon.

2184
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,670
Hi.

2185
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,270
Hi.

2186
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,840
What's this?

2187
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,410
Ji Min is on guard.

2188
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:34,050
Born in 1998, my name is Joo Ha Neul.

2189
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,650
We actually know each other.

2190
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,790
- We do.
- What?

2191
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,720
- He knows Ha Neul?
- They know each other.

2192
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,090
Is he a dancer?

2193
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:45,790
- Really?
- You know Ha Neul?

2194
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,290
- Yes.
- But how?

2195
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,230
- You two already know each other?
- Really?

2196
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

2197
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,040
Do you have a book?

2198
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,040
I've read all of the books.

2199
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:00,810
The Pairing Books? I'm curious.

2200
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:03,140
I brought the book of the person...

2201
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:06,910
I thought would get along with me
the most.

2202
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,650
We'd like to know.

2203
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,380
I wonder whose Pairing Book he chose.

2204
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,550
This is important.

2205
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:13,650
First off,

2206
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,590
I liked the last phrase.

2207
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,090
I was near the end, about marriage.

2208
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,900
We had a similar mindset.

2209
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,160
(Her marriage values
caught Sang Yun's attention.)

2210
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,030
This part. "My superpower" made me laugh.

2211
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,840
Her financial sense was similar to mine.

2212
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:33,940
I see the need...

2213
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:35,940
to have a conversation with her.

2214
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:39,410
I couldn't feel
what she was like externally.

2215
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,980
Are you going to share it with us now?

2216
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,220
We revealed our colors...

2217
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,760
and which book we each...

2218
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,220
- chose.
- Is that so?

2219
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,490
I...

2220
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:56,700
What color is it?

2221
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,170
(Nervous)

2222
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:06,040
chose light blue.

2223
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,170
Who was light blue again?

2224
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,170
- Je Yeon.
- Je Yeon.

2225
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,180
Je Yeon.

2226
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:12,040
(Sang Yun chose Je Yeon's Pairing Book.)

2227
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:18,280
(Feeling bad for Ji Min)

2228
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,990
Ji Min.

2229
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,250
He's like a movie character.

2230
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,320
Why are you shooting a drama alone?

2231
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:26,830
- Wouldn't you call him a real catfish?
- Yes.

2232
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:28,030
- This vibe.
- Yes.

2233
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,130
Who does it belong to?

2234
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:36,800
(Amazed)

2235
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:40,340
I imagined we'd get along really well.

2236
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,710
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2237
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,540
- I liked your values.
- It's a first for me.

2238
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,440
I liked...

2239
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:47,650
the last part about your marriage values
the most.

2240
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:48,980
- Really?
- Yes.

2241
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:54,920
You wrote that you liked
to get along like friends...

2242
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:58,320
- and eat together after work.
- I did.

2243
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,130
I like those too.

2244
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,190
That's why...

2245
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:06,630
(Je Yeon and Sang Yun
have similar marriage values.)

2246
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:10,100
That was why light blue was my top choice.

2247
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,810
- Je Yeon. Your book...
- The others are good too.

2248
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:17,010
- was very concise.
- Yes.

2249
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:19,510
- I thought you were a cool girl.
- I racked my brain on it.

2250
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,080
Are you reading it again?

2251
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,350
- Are you reflecting on it?
- Reflecting?

2252
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,890
Writing things short is hard.

2253
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,490
After all, her book was chosen.

2254
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:31,390
(He's the first person...)

2255
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:32,990
She doesn't know what to do.

2256
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:36,330
(to choose Je Yeon's Pairing Book.)

2257
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,640
- How about a toast now that he's here?
- Okay.

2258
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,240
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2259
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,440
Nobody predicted this would happen.

2260
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,510
- Really?
- Not a single person did.

2261
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,880
(A secretive man has appeared.)

2262
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:54,950
Interesting.

2263
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:56,920
(A secretive man has appeared.)

2264
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,420
Gosh, this is fun.

2265
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:02,920
- Can't you hear the ratings shoot up?
- Exactly.

2266
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,320
This is much more interesting
than any drama.

2267
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,630
- These days,
- Gosh.

2268
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:09,030
- Heart Pairing is my favorite show.
- This is better than a drama.

2269
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:10,530
He's like an electric eel.

2270
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:12,060
An electric eel from the Amazon.

2271
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,300
(A big catch)

2272
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,400
The appearance of Lee Sang Yun,
the catfish.

2273
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,500
What an impressive appearance.
He's also the youngest.

2274
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:18,670
(The youngest male resident's appearance)

2275
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:21,510
Judging by his laid-back expression
and tone of voice,

2276
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:22,740
he's not ordinary.

2277
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:26,350
Men have an instinctive reaction
as a group.

2278
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:29,280
As for Ji Min, he has a lot to protect.

2279
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:32,180
With everyone putting up
an even greater guard,

2280
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:35,390
these men have become much more nervous.

2281
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:37,820
What did you think about
the females' reactions?

2282
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:40,260
- Chae Eun made a memorable expression.
- Yes.

2283
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,230
Little did I know she had such big eyes.

2284
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,230
What about Je Yeon?

2285
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:46,100
- Je Yeon was shocked.
- Je Yeon.

2286
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:50,400
- Her Pairing Book was never chosen.
- No.

2287
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,670
But a man who has chosen
her Pairing Book has come.

2288
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:56,280
Je Yeon looked really excited.

2289
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,040
Shall we have a look at
Sang Yun the Catfish's Pairing Book?

2290
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,750
He is young...

2291
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,180
but is very determined to get married.

2292
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,680
It's evident
from various parts of the book.

2293
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,590
Expressions used
throughout his book are...

2294
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:09,990
self-discipline...

2295
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,360
and financial sense.

2296
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,560
In "My Charms as a Spouse,"

2297
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:16,200
self-discipline and financial sense
are brought up again.

2298
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,930
He may be relatively young.

2299
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,570
But future-wise and financially,

2300
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:24,700
he's well-prepared...

2301
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,970
and must've thought deeply about them.

2302
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:30,410
The monthly incomes are the same.
Je Yeon's...

2303
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:32,380
- and Sang Yun's.
- It's the same.

2304
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,780
- Over 15,000 dollars a month.
- Over 15,000 dollars.

2305
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:36,120
In the Law of Attraction,

2306
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:39,120
they say similarity is the top attraction.

2307
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:41,350
We should keep an eye on them.

2308
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:45,090
Sang Yun is included
in the contract relationship, right?

2309
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,190
(Surprised)

2310
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,360
From now on.

2311
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,530
(Shocked)

2312
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:51,600
How easygoing Ji Min was.

2313
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:53,870
What will happen to it?

2314
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:55,400
I'm worried.

2315
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,700
Despite the chaos
due to the appearance of the catfish,

2316
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,800
our day job continues.

2317
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,210
It's an individual match today.

2318
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:01,640
This one is tough.

2319
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,940
It's a tough one.

2320
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,650
(Can you tell who has been paired
with whom?)

2321
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:11,620
(Mission 8: Guess the results
of today's pairing now.)

2322
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,720
Let's start with the unquestionable pairs.

2323
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:16,020
- Won't it be Ji Min and Je Yeon?
- Yes.

2324
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,020
It's always Je Yeon for Ji Min.

2325
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:18,560
- Exactly.
- Ji Min and Je Yeon.

2326
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,560
(Ji Min is devoted to Je Yeon.)

2327
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,030
Today, Je Yeon must've chosen...

2328
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:23,200
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min. Right?

2329
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,930
I doubt she suddenly chose the catfish.

2330
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:26,370
She didn't choose him, did she?

2331
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:28,670
She doesn't change that fast.

2332
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:29,770
- Je Yeon isn't like that.
- No.

2333
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:32,170
- I vote for Woo Jae and Ji Won.
- Woo Jae and Ji Won.

2334
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:33,210
I vote for Woo Jae and Ji Won too.

2335
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,340
Right? These two.

2336
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,440
- Me too.
- Ji Min with Je Yeon...

2337
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,440
and Woo Jae with Ji Won.

2338
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,140
(Everyone agrees on 2 pairs.)

2339
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,280
Two couples. Any more opinions?

2340
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:42,610
Who do you think Chae Eun voted for?

2341
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,680
- Chae Eun?
- Yes, Chae Eun.

2342
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,720
Chan Hyeong.

2343
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:48,990
- Chan Hyeong?
- He was her first choice.

2344
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,190
- He was one of the candidates.
- Wait.

2345
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,390
So if there's a chance,

2346
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:57,000
- Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun.
- Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun.

2347
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,900
It could be both ways.

2348
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:01,270
I'm expecting Chan Hyeong to send it
to Je Yeon.

2349
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:05,240
Ever since their last conversation,
they didn't interact enough...

2350
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,540
for him to text her.

2351
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,210
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun? It's possible.

2352
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,610
What did Chan Hyeong do?

2353
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,250
I don't know.

2354
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,380
I think I don't have a chance
to go to Italy anyway.

2355
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:16,650
(He gave up already.)

2356
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:18,020
- You have to gamble.
- I know.

2357
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,750
- You have to make a different move.
- I know.

2358
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,490
I've made up my mind.
I'll go with Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun.

2359
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:24,190
I'll go with Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun too.

2360
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:25,360
Okay.

2361
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,560
(We're a team.)

2362
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,260
- Okay.
- We'll go on our own.

2363
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,430
If anyone follows Si Won,
they both go down.

2364
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,130
(What will happen to these two?)

2365
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:34,770
(Oh, no)

2366
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,070
What's wrong?

2367
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,410
Then I'll switch to
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun.

2368
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,970
- Yes.
- That makes three couples.

2369
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:45,280
Chung Ah, Si Won, and I...

2370
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:46,980
chose three couples.

2371
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:48,610
Yay. Professor Park's on my side.

2372
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:51,720
Ji Seon and Mimi chose two couples.

2373
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,390
- Then...
- All right.

2374
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:54,920
shall we check Woo Jae first?

2375
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,190
Who did Woo Jae choose?

2376
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,730
(3 days of dating was romantic.)

2377
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:01,990
Ji Won.

2378
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,600
Those three days were intense.

2379
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:06,870
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2380
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:09,740
(Woo Jae chose Ji Won.)

2381
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,440
- That's right.
- Yes.

2382
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,870
(A smooth start)

2383
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,010
- Ji Won.
- Who did Ji Won choose?

2384
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,140
- Woo Jae.
- Yes. For now.

2385
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,540
For a while.

2386
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:19,950
- For a while?
- Yes, for a while.

2387
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:21,950
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2388
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:24,620
(Ji Won chose Woo Jae.)

2389
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:25,720
Yes.

2390
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:27,720
We got it.

2391
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,660
Next. Who did Ji Min choose?

2392
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,630
(3 days of dating wasn't enough.)

2393
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:36,530
(His feelings for Je Yeon keep growing.)

2394
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:38,060
Ji Min will definitely choose Je Yeon.

2395
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:39,930
- It's obvious.
- He never stops.

2396
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:41,270
(He'll go straightforward.)

2397
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:42,970
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2398
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:46,240
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

2399
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:47,410
- Yes.
- I knew it.

2400
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:48,510
(Just as expected)

2401
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:51,280
- Let's check Je Yeon's heart.
- Oh, Je Yeon.

2402
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,480
Who did Je Yeon choose?

2403
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,680
What if she chose Sang Yun?

2404
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:56,350
- I know. I doubt it.
- I doubt it.

2405
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:01,420
(Sang Yun suddenly appeared
with Je Yeon's Pairing Book.)

2406
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,320
She wouldn't do that.

2407
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:04,420
- Ji Min.
- She'd choose Ji Min for now.

2408
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,720
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2409
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:09,160
(Je Yeon chose Ji Min.)

2410
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,960
- Yes.
- I was right.

2411
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,300
- Okay.
- Now, it's time to check Chan Hyeong.

2412
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:17,340
- Chae Eun.
- Please.

2413
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,100
- Chae Eun.
- Did Chan Hyeong...

2414
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,210
Please.

2415
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:21,540
choose Chae Eun?

2416
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:24,340
(Chan Hyeong thinks Chae Eun is
kind and elegant.)

2417
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:25,610
Or Je Yeon?

2418
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:26,710
(These two expected Chan Hyeong
to choose Je Yeon.)

2419
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:31,520
(He wants to get to know Je Yeon more.)

2420
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,420
Who did Chan Hyeong choose?

2421
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:34,650
Je Yeon.

2422
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,720
(Je Yeon or Chae Eun?)

2423
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,030
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2424
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:43,560
(Chan Hyeong chose Ha Neul.)

2425
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,130
(He chose Ha Neul.)

2426
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,230
Who is it?

2427
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,200
Ha Neul?

2428
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:50,740
What's going on?

2429
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:53,240
It's not even Je Yeon but Ha Neul?

2430
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,580
After the three days of dating, he...

2431
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:58,180
Gosh, I totally missed it.

2432
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,410
After saying goodbye to her
with no regrets?

2433
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,580
- He has manners.
- He was showing manners.

2434
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,120
He was just being polite.

2435
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,180
(Oh, I'm getting a headache.)

2436
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,850
Right. We forgot that they went on a date.

2437
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:09,390
Then who did Ha Neul choose?

2438
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:10,520
Ji Min?

2439
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:13,090
(Ji Min is Ha Neul's ultimate ideal type.)

2440
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,730
(Saying goodbye to Chan Hyeong?)

2441
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:17,500
- Did she choose Chan Hyeong?
- Chan Hyeong?

2442
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,100
(Chan Hyeong or Ji Min?)

2443
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:20,630
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2444
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:24,140
(Ha Neul chose Ji Min.)

2445
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:26,200
- She chose Ji Min.
- Oh, Ji Min.

2446
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:28,540
She's moving on to Ji Min.

2447
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,310
Then who did Chang Hwan choose?

2448
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,910
(He fell for her whimsical charms
in the last 3 days.)

2449
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:37,120
(Is he landing on Chae Eun?)

2450
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,080
(Where is Chang Hwan's final destination?)

2451
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,790
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2452
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:44,120
(Chang Hwan chose Chae Eun.)

2453
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,660
- Oh, Chae Eun.
- Chae Eun.

2454
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,760
Then who did Chae Eun choose?

2455
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:51,030
(Chang Hwan whom she went
on a special date with to a unique place?)

2456
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:52,660
(Or Chan Hyeong who continues
to make her smile?)

2457
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,730
(It's confusing.)

2458
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:56,270
Chan Hyeong.

2459
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,440
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2460
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:01,640
(Chae Eun chose Ji Min.)

2461
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,010
(Eyes wide open)

2462
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:04,110
- Ji Min?
- What?

2463
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:05,410
(Why did she choose Ji Min
out of nowhere?)

2464
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,550
I don't get it.

2465
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,780
- Why...
- Did Chae Eun's arrow choose him?

2466
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:11,880
Why Ji Min?

2467
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:13,350
- That's out of the blue.
- That means...

2468
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:16,820
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun aren't
interested in each other at all.

2469
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,890
- Why?
- Who did Sang Yun choose?

2470
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:22,960
(Je Yeon with the light blue Pairing Book
who'd make a good couple)

2471
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,460
Je Yeon.

2472
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,800
(I can't be wrong again.)

2473
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,330
It has to be Je Yeon.

2474
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,700
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2475
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:33,070
(Sang Yun chose Je Yeon.)

2476
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:34,340
Okay.

2477
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:38,210
So, Mimi and Professor Park got it.

2478
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:39,880
I'll keep following Professor Park.

2479
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,780
Because Chung Ah changed
at the last minute...

2480
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:43,550
Why did you change?

2481
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:46,350
- We have a terrible hunch.
- You need to improve.

2482
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:48,820
We have a terrible hunch.

2483
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:52,020
I'm curious. Why did Chae Eun...

2484
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:53,760
He suddenly chose Ji Min.

2485
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:56,330
- Why did she suddenly choose Ji Min?
- She's circling around.

2486
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:58,830
She's appealing herself...

2487
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:02,100
for the new contract relationship
this week.

2488
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:03,270
It's giving me a headache.

2489
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:06,470
What you need to focus on is...

2490
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:08,710
Chan Hyeong with zero votes.

2491
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:10,240
No one voted for Chan Hyeong.

2492
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,540
(Chan Hyeong?)

2493
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:14,810
There will be a huge change
in their relationships.

2494
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:15,880
I'm giving you a heads-up.

2495
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,280
- How?
- His name is Lee Chan Hyeong.

2496
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,920
It's not Lee Bang Won's Rebellion,
but Lee Chan Hyeong's Rebellion.

2497
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:21,690
(Intrigued)

2498
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:27,690
(Woo Jae and Ji Won)

2499
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:33,900
(Ji Min and Je Yeon)

2500
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:36,740
(The new man's choice)

2501
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,540
It's too...

2502
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,810
(Peeping)

2503
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:42,940
(It's a shame...)

2504
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,840
(because you're too far.)

2505
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,580
(Bugged)

2506
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:48,180
(Do you want to sit over there then?)

2507
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,820
That's a good idea.

2508
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:52,150
(I'll probably get a chance later.)

2509
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:55,620
(He got his chance faster than expected.)

2510
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,220
I didn't expect to do it so much.

2511
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,590
We have a lot in common.

2512
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,860
We got to know each other so fast.

2513
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:04,800
Why so many ordeals?

2514
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,230
I'm going to flip the photo
before going to bed tonight.

2515
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:12,300
I'm flipping one tonight.

2516
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:17,410
I can't stop thinking
about the contract relationship.

2517
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:19,640
We can always make ourselves available.

2518
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,310
I thought this was my only chance
to say this.

2519
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:26,050
I thought you'd find me uncomfortable.

2520
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,420
- Long time no see.
- Right?

2521
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:31,090
I kept thinking we needed to talk.

2522
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:33,060
Time flies.

2523
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:36,530
I said I was going to focus
on what my heart says.

2524
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:42,100
The next two weeks are important.

2525
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:43,470
Don't be timid.

2526
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,670
Be enthusiastic.

2527
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:47,170
I'll drink soju and ask you everything
on my mind.

2528
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,410
Me too. I'm going to do the same.

2529
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:52,010
I was curious about him the most.

2530
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,280
Let's move over there, so we can talk.

2531
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,110
- You'll go and get this today?
- Yes.

2532
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,520
Really?

2533
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,820
Here? I know this place too.
