1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,140
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,740
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,470
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,040
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Heart Pairing starts again today.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,540
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,150
The official catfish
in the Heart Pairing studio,

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,110
Paul Kim, is with us again.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,080
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,250
- How have you been?
- Watching this show,

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,720
- I've been feeling dizzy.
- I see.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,020
There have been so many changes.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,560
It made me lose my mind.

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,590
Last week,
five couples went to the seaside...

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,760
for a date on Christmas Eve.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Sang Yun and Je Yeon,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Ji Min and Soo Ah,

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,870
Chan Hyeong and Chae Eun,

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
Woo Jae and Ji Won,

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,870
and Chang Hwan and Ha Neul had a date.

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,580
Among the five couples,
there was a new combination.

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,810
- It's Ji Min and Soo Ah.
- Ji Min and Soo Ah.

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,450
Ji Min and Soo Ah.

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,180
Soo Ah...

25
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,320
joined them late,

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,250
so she needed to get to know people fast.

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,660
Although she knows
Chang Hwan is a nice person,

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,860
Ji Min's first impression...

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,430
- charmed her.
- Right.

30
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,590
She needs to sort out
her tangled thoughts quickly.

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,700
- Right.
- I can see how she feels now.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,600
- Soo Ah said something wise.
- Yes.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,200
"If I feel so afraid of being rejected
that I stopped expressing my feelings,"

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,270
- "that would hurt my pride."
- Right.

35
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,840
- She left a wise saying.
- That's right.

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,470
Their energy level was different
from the contract relationship...

37
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,040
for Sang Yun and Je Yeon.
Their date remains in my memory.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,250
Ji Min came to where Je Yeon was waiting
by mistake.

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,380
- I think that had a huge impact.
- Right.

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,950
In front of Sang Yun, Je Yeon...

41
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,620
was troubled, sitting back in the car.

42
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,990
Unconsciously, to Ji Min,

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,160
- she's attracted like a magnet.
- Oh, my.

44
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,830
- You're for Ji Min and Je Yeon.
- Yes,

45
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,400
I am supporting them again.

46
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,300
Realizing she cares about Ji Min
more than she thought,

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,170
- she was...
- Right.

48
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,440
in agony, and I felt sorry for her.

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,310
It feels she found out
what she hadn't realized before.

50
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,310
- Right.
- Yes.

51
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,050
- Sang Yun has already known it.
- Yes.

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,150
He watched Je Yeon
keep paying attention to Ji Min.

53
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,420
He didn't know how they had been...

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,990
- before he came.
- I know.

55
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,320
- Right, he said that.
- Yes.

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,620
However, his heart heads..

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,990
- to Je Yeon.
- Right.

58
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,390
During the date, Sang Yun...

59
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,960
poured alcohol down his throat.

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,930
- Right.
- At that moment, already,

61
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,540
I clearly saw how Sang Yun felt, I think.

62
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,540
Goodness.

63
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,540
And Ha Neul shed tears.

64
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,240
Right. That night,
Ha Neul cried in front of Ji Min.

65
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,810
For Ha Neul,
the past month must have been tormenting.

66
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,750
- Right.
- Things didn't go as she wanted.

67
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,320
She went all in for Ji Min.

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,450
- Right.
- However,

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,290
- she couldn't obtain her love.
- No.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,390
It seems Ha Neul got things off her chest.

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,460
I won't do that starting tomorrow.

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,330
Ha Neul needs to go through that
at least once.

73
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,100
This is what I worried about most.

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,500
Ji Min and Soo Ah took a four-cut photo.

75
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,530
(Agreeing)

76
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,470
I definitely thought...

77
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,200
that would confuse Je Yeon.

78
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,640
That's what I felt.

79
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,840
And Ha Neul was watching it
from across the table.

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,780
And Ji Min was sitting next to Soo Ah.

81
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
(Ji Min was in the center of it all.)

82
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,710
- Their relationships are so tangled.
- Yes.

83
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,120
I can't even fathom what will happen.

84
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,120
(Before Saying I Love You)

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
(The residents come back
after the Christmas Eve date.)

86
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,160
Hello.

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

88
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,660
- I guessed right.
- What?

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,860
I guessed right about the two of you.

90
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,530
- Where did you have your date?
- I know everything.

91
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,570
We went to Gangneung.

92
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,600
We came back home,

93
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,170
and Ji Min looked very upset.

94
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,370
He looked so down.

95
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,010
You must be exhausted,
going on a date after work.

96
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,580
- Did the two of you go there?
- Yes.

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,020
He looked very worn out.

98
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,890
(Glancing)

99
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,690
It bothered me.

100
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,430
Just a few, or a lot?

101
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,170
(Ji Min leaves.)

102
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,670
(Looking around)

103
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,710
(Ji Min disappeared,
and that bothers Je Yeon.)

104
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,760
(In the dark room,)

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,260
(Ji Min is lost in thought, alone.)

106
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,800
(Thinking)

107
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,070
- Did you recharge your batteries?
- What?

108
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,170
Did you recharge your batteries?

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Did you sleep?

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
I slept on my way back home.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
- Why...
- Didn't you sleep here a while ago?

112
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,270
No, I didn't sleep.

113
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,410
Did you get some rest?

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,050
Why does she look like Mashimaro today?

115
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,310
She always looks like a rabbit.

116
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,180
She always does, but more like it today.

117
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,380
Do I look like a rabbit?

118
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,290
You like rabbits.

119
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,750
Yes, I like rabbits.

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,490
I put a rabbit sticker on my credit card.

121
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,830
(Observing Ji Min who's watching Je Yeon)

122
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,830
(Embarrassed)

123
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,700
- Why are you looking at me?
- Why...

124
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,570
Why are the two of you looking at me
at the same time?

125
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't help but look at you.

126
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,400
- I just wanted to look.
- Yes.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,300
(Smiling)

128
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,410
While we were
in the contract relationship,

129
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,540
it happened, I guess.

130
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,810
Ji Min and I grew attached to each other.

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,720
When I'm with Ji Min,

132
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,220
I have a sense of stability, for sure.

133
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,490
(Glancing)

134
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,590
Can I wash it?

135
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,590
(The Rabbit's Heart)

136
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,400
(Bothered)

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,870
- Let's clean things up.
- Okay.

138
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,040
It's late.

139
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,870
- I'll do it later.
- With Je Yeon? Okay.

140
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,280
You can leave now.

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,510
Then...

142
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,540
(Can we scoot over?)

143
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,150
- Anyway...
- I don't think he'll come back.

144
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,580
- Isn't he coming?
- As I see it,

145
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
he went to have a conversation.

146
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,780
She looks bothered.

147
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,020
Why aren't you leaving?

148
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,390
(Why isn't Ji Won leaving with Woo Jae?)

149
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,960
- Why does she have to go with him?
- Why does she?

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
They're a set.

151
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,060
(Come on.)

152
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,230
- If you're too convinced...
- As I said earlier,

153
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,500
- it's not over until it's over.
- Right.

154
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,830
(Glancing)

155
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,600
Ha Neul?

156
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,940
- Is Ha Neul feeling upset?
- No.

157
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,000
- No.
- Is she upset?

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,100
She isn't. Let's drink.

159
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,440
- Why...
- Did you argue?

160
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,570
No, nothing like that happened.

161
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,780
Nothing like that at all.

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
I guess Chang Hwan projected his feelings.
Nothing happened.

163
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,480
I guess so.

164
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,320
- Where's Ji Min, by the way?
- That's what I'm saying.

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,950
- It's unusual. He suddenly disappeared.
- Suddenly.

166
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,550
The two of them might be talking.

167
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,460
He might be talking with Ha Neul.

168
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,060
- Didn't he talk to you?
- No.

169
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,360
I'm not sure.

170
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
The two of them might be talking now.

171
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,060
I think you're right.

172
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,900
I'll tell you later.

173
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,770
(Poking)

174
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,770
I understood.

175
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,840
I don't think that's the reason.

176
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,770
- I can't say that.
- What do you mean by, "I don't know?"

177
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,910
- You're eating so well.
- What?

178
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,710
It feels so cold.
I wanted to eat something cold.

179
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,310
- We can't choose right now.
- I forgot.

180
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,250
- If we stay still, we might be able to.
- I guess...

181
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,020
Then shall we split up things
we need to buy?

182
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,290
Then I'll buy the cake.

183
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,390
- That's good.
- Okay.

184
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,490
Will you buy a cake?

185
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,690
I think Ha Neul will do a good job...

186
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,100
decorating it very nicely.

187
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,300
Right.

188
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,830
- Ha Neul can do that,
- There you go.

189
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,030
- you buy a cake, you buy a champagne,
- Cake and champagne.

190
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,370
and I'll get...

191
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,600
- something else. Something to eat.
- Snacks. Okay.

192
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,210
I'm curious about
what will happen tomorrow.

193
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,710
Tomorrow...

194
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,880
(See you tomorrow.)

195
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
He wasn't sleeping yet.

196
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
- He took a shower.
- He took a shower.

197
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,420
I didn't know.

198
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,020
What?

199
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,150
But all...

200
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,320
Things are getting complicated now.

201
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,260
(After thinking for a long time,)

202
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,130
(Je Yeon goes down to the 1st floor.)

203
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,260
We need two bottles.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
My goodness.

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,170
She saw them.

206
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,940
(Turning)

207
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,910
(Je Yeon comes back again.)

208
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,950
(Glancing)

209
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,690
(Je Yeon comes back to her seat.)

210
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,830
(Turning her head)

211
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,260
She seems to have a lot on her mind.

212
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,730
By the way,

213
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,070
how many napa cabbage leaves
has Chae Eun been eating so far?

214
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,000
She's so cute.

215
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,470
I think Chae Eun will live
the longest among us.

216
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,310
She's always healthy, eating healthy food.

217
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,410
(Someone who makes her think
about him more when out of sight)

218
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,980
My goodness.

219
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,020
(Bothered)

220
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,390
- Let's finish this.
- Let's finish this.

221
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,520
It's okay to take your time.

222
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,290
We walked around a lot.

223
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,160
This is no ordinary matter.

224
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,300
- Right.
- Good.

225
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,370
- Good job.
- Good.

226
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,670
- Merry Christmas.
- That's a good choice.

227
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,670
Merry Christmas.

228
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,040
- We're spending it like Christmas.
- I know.

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,970
- You know,
- Tomorrow will be the real deal.

230
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,010
I actually thought that I'd feel so lonely
this year-end.

231
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,210
I've been feeling lonely
and had a hard time.

232
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,450
It was very different from last year.

233
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,850
I thought I'd be lonely this year...

234
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,320
(Thinking)

235
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,590
- And suddenly...
- And suddenly...

236
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,220
(She made friends.)

237
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,330
- It's funny how life works out.
- You got to know nine new people.

238
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
- But...
- You're in a large family.

239
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,500
- I didn't imagine I'd have this time.
- Definitely.

240
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,760
- Right.
- I know.

241
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,170
I feel so thankful.

242
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,870
On Christmas, in my life so far,
how do I put it?

243
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,600
With other people,
it's like I'm having a party.

244
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,110
I've never experienced anything like this
in my life.

245
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,510
Same here. Due to my personality,

246
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,610
I've been meeting people
I've always known.

247
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,910
So the same daily routine...

248
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,020
- was being repeated.
- Right.

249
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,420
At such times, it's so hard...

250
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,560
- to meet new people.
- Right.

251
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,760
But I met these various people...

252
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,900
and got to be close to them like family.

253
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,130
I felt very lucky.

254
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
We have meals together.

255
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,500
Such nice people gathered here.

256
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,410
I hope the two of you
don't have plans for Christmas.

257
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,010
- Right, he said that.
- I don't have a plan yet.

258
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,310
I cleared my schedule.

259
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,380
(Another person
who's been waiting for Christmas)

260
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,350
Are you going to
an amusement park tomorrow?

261
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,590
- I want to go there myself.
- What?

262
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,590
It's nothing.

263
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,800
(He said he wanted to go
to an amusement park.)

264
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,870
Does the amusement park there...

265
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,170
have the zoo open these days?

266
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,470
I don't know.

267
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,240
On Christmas Eve,

268
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,170
it would be nice
if we could go there together.

269
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,640
- Do you mean an amusement park?
- Yes.

270
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,510
(Je Yeon had saved the amusement park
to go to later.)

271
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,120
I thought I knew myself well,

272
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,720
but I might be wrong.

273
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,990
(I hope we can spend a meaningful day
like Christmas together.)

274
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,730
(Thanks for the good time with you,
Je Yeon.)

275
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,460
I'm not sure whether it started
from the contract relationship...

276
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,870
or before that,

277
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,470
but already,

278
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,570
I have been attracted to him.

279
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,180
I could just feel it.

280
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,680
I had a feeling.

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,220
(Je Yeon stood up once again.)

282
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,900
(Je Yeon heads to Ji Min again.)

283
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,730
When Ji Min made a mistake
and came to where I was waiting,

284
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,600
I thought...

285
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,440
that I made up my mind.

286
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,680
I thought it would be nice
if he were the one.

287
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,320
She's going to Ji Min.

288
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,550
(She realized her feelings
when their paths diverged.)

289
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,620
- Je Yeon, what is it?
- What?

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,530
- Did you come to see me?
- What? Yes.

291
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,130
You looked a bit upset.

292
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,600
- Me?
- Didn't you?

293
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,170
- No.
- Do you feel good?

294
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,500
- I'm not feeling good.
- Why?

295
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,370
- How was it today?
- What?

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,680
Today? But...

297
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,980
- It really was my mistake.
- You...

298
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,510
It really was my mistake.

299
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,580
I said hello
and was about to move toward you.

300
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,880
I said hello
because I was glad to see you too.

301
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Did you take a wrong turn?

302
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,850
I took a wrong turn.

303
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,120
So I made a U-turn, pulled the car over,
and walked.

304
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
I see.

305
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,060
Shall I wear a cap...
I don't think I can wear a cap, right?

306
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,900
Your hair looks fine now.

307
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
- Does it?
- Yes.

308
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,270
But you said yesterday
that I looked better with my hair tied up.

309
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,310
I mean, when you show your ears.
You looked nice with your hair tied too.

310
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,440
- Really?
- Yes.

311
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,940
(Laughing)

312
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,110
We need to buy a cake tomorrow.

313
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,180
The girls decided to get five items.

314
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,380
- We're going to meet?
- We're paired.

315
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,650
- What?
- The two of us are paired.

316
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,560
- What?
- What?

317
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,760
- I can't hear you.
- Aren't we paired?

318
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,090
We need a deep conversation.

319
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,430
We can have it tomorrow.

320
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,930
Let's talk now.

321
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,570
Tomorrow, we'll have fun.

322
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,600
- Is something bothering you?
- What?

323
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,970
- Is something bothering you?
- You think I'm not bothered?

324
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,970
Yes.

325
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,210
Oh, my.

326
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
(Banging)

327
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,580
They came down.

328
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,020
I think they'll come here. Let's go.

329
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,690
- What have you been doing?
- I was taking a rest.

330
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,460
- What?
- I was talking to Ha Neul, and...

331
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,460
- Why aren't you going to bed yet?
- Shall I leave the room?

332
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,490
What?

333
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
Let's talk outside.

334
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Okay.

335
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,070
You can rest here, Chang Hwan.

336
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,240
I thought he was talking with Ha Neul.

337
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,410
(The two of them go somewhere else...)

338
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,510
(to continue the conversation
they didn't finish.)

339
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,550
(Sighing)

340
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,780
You're not feeling good, are you?

341
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,650
If I were with you, we could have talked.

342
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,920
But you left without saying anything.

343
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,230
I just...

344
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,070
Expressing myself,
whether it's a refusal or not,

345
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,900
doesn't feel good.

346
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,100
And in the meantime,

347
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,810
I've expressed my feelings for you,
but I don't know what you think.

348
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,350
So, I feel...

349
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,380
I have a lot on my mind.

350
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,320
(I have a lot on my mind.)

351
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,790
So,
if there's something that I misunderstood,

352
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,130
Yes?

353
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,660
I hope you can...

354
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,570
clear up the misunderstanding quickly.

355
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,410
I wanted to tell him honestly...

356
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,940
as far as I could.

357
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,980
Back then, we were not feeling good,

358
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,020
and the conversation continued.

359
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,290
Do you want to talk tomorrow?

360
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,790
Do you want to talk tomorrow?

361
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,560
(Nodding)

362
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
All right.

363
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,510
Shall I bring some tea?

364
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,240
- Tea?
- Yes.

365
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,110
- Can I pinch you?
- What?

366
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,850
- Can I pinch you?
- What?

367
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,850
(Laughing)

368
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,980
- I asked if I could pinch you.
- If you could pinch me?

369
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,020
Yes.

370
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,190
(Ji Min's timid provocation
makes her laugh.)

371
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,560
(Turning)

372
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,030
(Turning)

373
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,600
You look like a rabbit.

374
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,570
- Why are you glaring at me, Rabbit?
- What?

375
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,200
Why are you glaring at me like a rabbit?

376
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,710
Why do you have a sore throat?
Did you catch a cold?

377
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,710
It's not a cold.
It might be because it's dry here.

378
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,990
- Is it hot?
- Yes.

379
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,790
I'm going to sleep.

380
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,130
Good night.

381
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,330
Go.

382
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,870
Are you going this way?

383
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,900
- What?
- Which way are you going?

384
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,970
I'll go this way.

385
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
Go.

386
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,110
- Good night.
- Good night.

387
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,150
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

388
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,210
(Bye.)

389
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,950
(Hitting)

390
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,720
- I saw it.
- What did you see?

391
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,090
- What?
- What?

392
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,820
I saw the photo you took with her.

393
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,620
(Je Yeon's attack)

394
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,630
(Flinching)

395
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,130
- I couldn't help it.
- What?

396
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,360
- I couldn't help it.
- There's nothing you cannot help.

397
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,730
We were coming down
after riding the Sokcho Eye...

398
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,730
- and saw it.
- The Ferris wheel?

399
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,800
- What?
- The Ferris wheel?

400
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,740
Yes, but we didn't look very affectionate.

401
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,370
I didn't make a heart or anything.

402
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
But still.

403
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,010
- Could you have said no?
- What?

404
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,110
Could you have said no?

405
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,350
(Ji Min strikes back.)

406
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,650
You would've been more willing
to take pictures instead of saying no.

407
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,950
(Pouting)

408
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,650
You would've suggested
going to the photo booth.

409
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,790
Why would I do that?

410
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,820
(Chuckling)

411
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,090
I'll make it clear.

412
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,300
(Chuckling)

413
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,960
- Don't worry about it.
- That's not what I meant.

414
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,060
I wanted to tell you that I saw it.

415
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,130
Anyway,
don't let your imagination run wild...

416
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,670
because of the photo.

417
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,900
Okay.

418
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,970
(Nodding)

419
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,110
That's funny. "I saw it."

420
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,510
(Laughing)

421
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,910
Go ahead. I'll see you tomorrow.

422
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,560
(What will happen
to Ji Min and Je Yeon...)

423
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,190
(on Christmas?)

424
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,090
He's in a better mood now.

425
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,700
(That's cute.)

426
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,830
(The morning of their Christmas date
has come.)

427
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,740
Who do you think your date will be today?

428
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,900
You.

429
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
- I have no problem writing down a name.
- Okay.

430
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,010
But I do with the second name. No?

431
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,850
Anyway,

432
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,090
I have to name someone
I want to go on a date with, right?

433
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,190
I'm wondering what I can do
to make myself look more attractive.

434
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,130
Let's see.

435
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,160
(The residents are busy
getting ready for the date.)

436
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,300
Doesn't this look good?

437
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,500
(Styling her hair skillfully)

438
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,400
(Rolling)

439
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,210
Should I wear something else?

440
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,710
Do I look better with hairpins
on both sides? Or just on one side?

441
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,920
You look cute
if you wear them on both sides.

442
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,650
You look feminine
if you only wear it on one side.

443
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,720
- Really?
- Yes.

444
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,020
Then should I take it out?

445
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,390
I'm not trying to look cute.

446
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,030
(The time for their exciting date
has come.)

447
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,960
It's night.

448
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,300
(The residents leave the house
as they feel the butterflies.)

449
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,010
(With whom
will they get to spend the day?)

450
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,390
Hello.

451
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,230
You're here.

452
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,460
It's D-Day.

453
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,370
I wonder whom they chose for their date.

454
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,430
I'm so curious.

455
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,100
The street looks beautiful.

456
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,800
(The Christmas vibe is in full swing.)

457
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
- Who is that?
- It's Chang Hwan.

458
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,410
(Who is Chang Hwan waiting for?)

459
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,610
Please.

460
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,220
(At that moment, someone approaches him.)

461
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,620
- It's Soo Ah.
- It's Soo Ah.

462
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
(Smiling)

463
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,120
- He's happy.
- Look at him smiling.

464
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,730
(His Christmas date is Soo Ah.)

465
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,760
You knew it'd be me, right?

466
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
(Grabbing)

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,130
I was hoping...

468
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,600
- That it would be me.
- it would be you.

469
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,770
Chang Hwan is smiling so brightly.

470
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,910
I heard there was a Christmas market here.

471
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,640
- Over there, right?
- Yes.

472
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,710
- We could look around it.
- I wanted to check it out.

473
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,250
Really? If there's anything you find cute,

474
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,980
- Should we check it out?
- I'll buy everything for you.

475
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,820
You don't know what I'll pick.

476
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,620
What if I pick everything?

477
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,120
I can try to buy them all.

478
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,660
- "I can try."
- I ought to make it work somehow.

479
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,760
(What kind of Christmas
will they spend together?)

480
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,160
Gosh, Chang Hwan looks so happy.

481
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,630
- Look at these cute candles.
- They look so cute.

482
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,160
Having this in the house
would make my mom really happy.

483
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,170
- Should I buy one for her?
- Really?

484
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,270
- Yes. It's a present for your family.
- My mom would be so happy.

485
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,000
This one is cute. And so is this one.

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,140
Pick the one you like.

487
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,910
Winning brownie points from Soo Ah's mom.

488
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,410
Make sure to tell her it came from me.

489
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,010
- Okay.
- My gosh.

490
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,880
My mother loves knickknacks like this.

491
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,950
- I think you like them too.
- Yes.

492
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,620
I love them.

493
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,250
(Oh, my.)

494
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,320
This is a cute stall too.

495
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,720
To be honest,
I didn't know there were stalls like this.

496
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,490
- Really?
- How cute.

497
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,490
Do you have any gloves? These...

498
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,060
I want the red pair.

499
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,190
- Right? I thought you'd want it.
- Yes.

500
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,730
(Soo Ah picks a red pair of gloves.)

501
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,130
- The red gloves are so cute.
- The red pair?

502
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,470
- Yes.
- Sounds good. I...

503
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,870
- Should I get the black ones?
- No, get the white ones.

504
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,700
- The white ones? Okay.
- I knew it.

505
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,470
- Should we wear them now?
- Soo Ah picked them for him.

506
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,870
Touchscreen gloves.

507
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,280
I didn't know they were
touchscreen gloves. This is nice, though.

508
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,410
So lucky.

509
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,380
(They put on the matching gloves
right away.)

510
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,450
Do they fit your hands?

511
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,420
(They put on the matching gloves
right away.)

512
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,150
- The gloves go well with your outfit.
- What do you think?

513
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,220
- Do they look good?
- Yes.

514
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,890
They're so cute.

515
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,190
- Are they warm?
- Yes.

516
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,020
- Great.
- They make a good couple.

517
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,260
Something we can wear...

518
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,490
- Something we can wear?
- in the house.

519
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,700
- Loungewear?
- I ran out of loungewear.

520
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,460
I don't go to sleep
in pretty outfits like that.

521
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,230
Thank you.

522
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,170
(Trying on the beautiful sweater)

523
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,740
So cute. You look cute with that on.

524
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,540
"So cute."

525
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,710
I think I look good in red.

526
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,180
Are they warm?

527
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,750
(They gently place their hands together.)

528
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,110
(Oh, my.)

529
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,110
My goodness.

530
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,720
(A gentle push)

531
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
This is nice.

532
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,120
We've already bought so much stuff.

533
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Right.

534
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,590
They look like newlyweds.

535
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,490
Let's go to the tree and take pictures.

536
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,290
Are you ready?

537
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,500
(He gets ready in a rather unique way.)

538
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,670
- Come here.
- Soo Ah said, "Come here."

539
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,900
- I'll take it.
- Yes.

540
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,310
(A selfie together
in front of the Christmas tree)

541
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,440
They look great together.

542
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,810
- What? Why is your head so small?
- I'll move forward.

543
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,180
How beautiful.

544
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,750
You look great in pictures.

545
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,850
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,590
- Soo Ah is leading the whole date.
- "Come here."

547
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,850
But Soo Ah looks comfortable
to be leading.

548
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,220
- And Chang Hwan isn't uncomfortable.
- Right.

549
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,260
(Merry Christmas.)

550
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,600
(Amazed)

551
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
This is nice.

552
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,070
- My gosh.
- This is a beautiful place.

553
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,270
- Should I take off my shoes?
- Here? Yes, take off your shoes.

554
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,870
They have to take off their shoes?

555
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,810
It's not easy to take off boots.

556
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,240
- I feel so comfortable here.
- Yes, I think this was the right call.

557
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,540
What should we get?

558
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,580
- Yukhoe.
- Yukhoe.

559
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,410
- They're on the same wavelength.
- Yukhoe.

560
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,580
- You like everything raw. Yukhoe too.
- Yes.

561
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,220
- Hello.
- What would you like?

562
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,620
We'd like yukhoe with gamtae.

563
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,690
Do you have Diet Coke or Sprite?

564
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,420
We have Diet Earl Grey tea ade.

565
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,290
We have regular Sprite.

566
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,890
Should we get regular Sprite?

567
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,930
We'll take 1 Earl Grey tea ade
and 1 Sprite.

568
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,930
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

569
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,700
I like that
you clearly tell me what you want.

570
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,200
- Me?
- Yes.

571
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,600
- I decide fast, don't I?
- Yes.

572
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,900
So...

573
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,910
I like that about you.

574
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,040
- She's wise.
- She's certain about herself.

575
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,740
- Here you go.
- Okay.

576
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,450
- They look so good together today.
- Okay.

577
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,210
- Their outfits match too.
- Seriously.

578
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,720
Oh, my.

579
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,420
You eat raw eggs, right?

580
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,720
I can make a wrap for you.
Would you like one?

581
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,920
- My gosh.
- I'd be honored.

582
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,090
My hands are clean.

583
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,530
- I washed them.
- I can even overcome dirty hands.

584
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,130
- You can overcome dirty hands?
- Yes.

585
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,600
I can't make it look pretty, though.

586
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,900
- Do you eat wasabi?
- Yes, I love it.

587
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,270
- Here you go.
- Gosh. What is this?

588
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,100
How is it?

589
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,270
- Is it good?
- This is crazy.

590
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,280
Okay.

591
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,640
Wasabi? Oh, please.
He'd eat rocks if she offered them.

592
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,980
- He'd be happy even if it was just that.
- Right.

593
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,150
He'd be happy even if he only got wasabi.

594
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,250
My hands are clean too.

595
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,990
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

596
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,830
I can see that they're definitely
more comfortable around each other.

597
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,060
This is making my heart flutter.

598
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,030
- Did I make a good one?
- It's tasty.

599
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,400
It feels surreal
to spend Christmas with you.

600
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,730
Seriously. Earlier today,

601
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,640
I was surprised once again.

602
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,800
You always surprise me.

603
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,310
I was so happy.

604
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,980
I mean, I am. We're still on our date.

605
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,110
- Soo Ah seems happy too.
- She seems to be in a better mood, right?

606
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,850
(Chang Hwan is just happy
that Soo Ah showed up.)

607
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,090
You and Ha Neul didn't seem to
be in a good mood yesterday.

608
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,420
- Ha Neul and me?
- Yes.

609
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,030
This might be a long conversation.

610
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,230
Sure.

611
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,400
Ever since Friday night,
after you moved into the house,

612
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,030
Ha Neul told me I seemed happy.

613
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,330
I see.

614
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,000
She asked me many questions.
One of them was,

615
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,640
"Did you fall for her at first sight?"

616
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,040
"What happened?" She asked me that.

617
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,310
It made me wonder
and then reflect on my feelings.

618
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,810
(He thought about his feelings once again
at that moment.)

619
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,450
Our first meeting was dramatic.

620
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,250
You have this sense of maturity
I look for in women.

621
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,520
I saw this good side of you.

622
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,790
And...

623
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,130
Gosh,
I'm a bit embarrassed to bring this up.

624
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,630
But I'll be honest.
We talked about looks too.

625
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,030
We discussed looks too.

626
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,030
(Nodding)

627
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,270
As for the moment that changed everything,

628
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,970
it felt like
a cool breeze was washing over me.

629
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,470
That's a great expression.

630
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,640
Meeting you felt so refreshing.

631
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,310
It felt somewhat liberating.

632
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,610
Then this crossed my mind.

633
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,910
(Chang Hwan found his answer
after meeting Soo Ah.)

634
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,050
So I tried to sum up what happened.

635
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,550
Yes, your looks...

636
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,720
I'm shy to admit this,
but you're totally my type.

637
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,090
Our meeting was dramatic,
so my heart was about to explode.

638
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,960
But once I talked to you
and got to know you,

639
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,230
I noticed that you were good to everyone.

640
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,460
You have a great personality.
You're such a cool person and all.

641
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,800
After realizing all this,

642
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,130
I couldn't hate... I mean,

643
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,440
I didn't see any reason
to stop liking you.

644
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
That crossed my mind.

645
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,040
I wondered, "Is there a reason for me
not to make up my mind?"

646
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,780
I came to that realization.

647
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,050
(The more he thought about her,
the deeper his feelings became.)

648
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,310
He's indirectly confessing to her.

649
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm too shy to look at you now.

650
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,190
(Staring)

651
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,390
You didn't know that I would...

652
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,390
bring this up, right?

653
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,390
(Nodding)

654
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,330
But I didn't tell you this
to pressure you or anything.

655
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,200
I guess a part of me wanted to show you...

656
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,300
that I could be this honest with you.

657
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,340
His ears are so red that they might burst.

658
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,800
(Did his heartfelt confession
get through to Soo Ah?)

659
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,210
Soo Ah understood everything.

660
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,870
(Did his heartfelt confession
get through to Soo Ah?)

661
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,110
It was an indirect confession.

662
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,340
- It was a confession.
- It sounded like a confession,

663
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,380
but a long one.

664
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,150
- First of all, I'm grateful to you.
- Yes.

665
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,190
When I first moved into the house,

666
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,990
if I had spent my 1st 3 days
with someone else other than you,

667
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,660
I wouldn't have been able to adjust
to this environment well, to be honest.

668
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,000
- Really?
- Yes.

669
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,570
It just means that you're down-to-earth.

670
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,740
You're a pure-hearted guy.

671
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,140
Am I?

672
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,040
Yes. I think you're a pure-hearted guy.

673
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,380
So when I came home, I couldn't help...

674
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,550
but look for you first.

675
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,790
I often said hello to you first.

676
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,650
- Hello.
- Right.

677
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,290
What did you do today?

678
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,830
I took care of my cat in the afternoon.

679
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,730
I patted it.

680
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,030
(She was curious about Chang Hwan's day.)

681
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,660
You should go
and change into comfortable clothes.

682
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,570
- Let's have tea together.
- She paid a lot of attention to him.

683
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,330
(Chang Hwan seemed
to be having a hard time.)

684
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,940
(And Soo Ah was concerned about him.)

685
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,400
You get so exhausted after a flight.

686
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,210
- You used to be a flight attendant.
- Yes.

687
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,740
I kept doing that.

688
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,710
But I didn't know why.

689
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,050
When I was having a meal with someone,

690
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,690
I kept thinking about you.

691
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,160
I know that you're such a genuine person.

692
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,030
I knew that you would be concerned.

693
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,100
(Soo Ah vaguely knew
about Chang Hwan's feelings.)

694
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,200
So...

695
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,100
I might not be able...

696
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,070
to make a decision
in the next couple of days.

697
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,840
I might not be able to decide,

698
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,810
but I'm really grateful
that you shared your feelings with me...

699
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,080
on this date.

700
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,750
I know that it's not easy
to be this honest with someone.

701
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
Right.

702
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,520
And yes. I was interested in Ji Min.

703
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,750
The truth is...

704
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,300
He's transparent in his own way too.

705
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,100
- Yes. That's right.
- Yes.

706
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,500
- I was curious about that side of him.
- Yes.

707
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
So yesterday,

708
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,600
- we went on a date.
- Yes.

709
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,180
I can understand that.

710
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,240
I was curious about him.

711
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,110
But I need to take some time
to think about this.

712
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,880
Like about why I'm feeling this way.

713
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,590
I should think about...

714
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,720
why I was interested in that side of him.

715
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,420
(Many thoughts cross his mind
after hearing her thoughts.)

716
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,720
He must feel a little down.

717
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,390
Soo Ah is clear about her intentions.

718
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,060
Someone might be more interested in you.

719
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,430
And vice versa.

720
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,070
But most importantly,

721
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,540
I just hope that...

722
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,840
you have the time and energy to observe
other people's feelings for you.

723
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,940
Honestly, that's all I can wish for.

724
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,380
He's being honest with her.

725
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,080
This conversation with you...

726
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:50,290
will help me think more deeply
about my feelings...

727
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,490
because I didn't know
this was how you felt about me.

728
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,460
I'm brave when I need to be.

729
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,460
I honestly became more curious about you.

730
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,770
So...

731
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,570
a big part of me
wants to spend time with you...

732
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,640
and get to know you better.

733
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,610
If you don't mind,

734
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,280
I would like...

735
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,550
to spend more time with you
while enjoying delicious food.

736
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,090
We can have sashimi three meals a day.

737
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,320
I can have tripe
and intestine soup the next day...

738
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,960
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

739
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,330
I can also show you what I'm like.

740
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,100
I'm sure there are more beautiful charms
about you I don't know about yet.

741
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,170
I'll continue...

742
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,740
to try my best
to satisfy my curiosity about you.

743
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,840
I could feel that he meant every word.

744
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,080
He was so honest with me.

745
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,050
So I couldn't help...

746
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,880
but lean toward him.

747
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
(His heartfelt confession
moved Soo Ah's heart.)

748
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,060
(Where will their hearts...)

749
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,360
- Sincerity moves people's hearts.
- Right.

750
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,560
(end up?)

751
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,460
- I just got goosebumps.
- Okay.

752
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,430
This is the rear gate of my alma mater.

753
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,600
Could you give me
a tour of your alma mater?

754
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,770
A tour of my alma mater?

755
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,170
This building is...

756
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,610
I can't remember the name.

757
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,580
- Isn't there a hall or something?
- Yes.

758
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,680
There's one for liberal arts.
The other one is for social studies.

759
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,920
I can't remember which one it's for.

760
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,850
- She looks so youthful.
- She's so pretty.

761
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,360
(The campus is filled
with Soo Ah's memories.)

762
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,390
All the students we're seeing here
are your juniors, aren't they?

763
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,230
- Right?
- Yes.

764
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,430
- The juniors are puzzled.
- They're puzzled.

765
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,070
Our campus is small, but beautiful.

766
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,000
The building and the view behind that
are so pretty.

767
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,100
- Pretty, right?
- Yes.

768
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,740
I want to show you my alma mater too.

769
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,510
- Where did you go?
- Korea Aerospace University.

770
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,580
Korea Aerospace University.

771
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,980
- On campus,
- I'm curious.

772
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,310
- we have an airstrip.
- My gosh.

773
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,350
I bet it looks so cool.

774
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,880
Airstrips look so cool.

775
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,250
- It's quite long.
- Yes.

776
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,250
- The sight of it alone brings excitement.
- Right.

777
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,890
- Our campus is tiny and cute.
- Yes.

778
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,090
This is a mirror.

779
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,190
I always checked my reflection
in the mirror here.

780
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
Should we check our reflections here?

781
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,700
- Should we take a picture?
- Yes.

782
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,300
- A full-length shot.
- Yes.

783
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,300
- Like this? What do you think?
- Yes.

784
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,500
Great.

785
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,600
One, two, three.

786
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
Again.

787
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,710
- One, two, three.
- Gosh.

788
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,880
When you like someone,
you want to take pictures together.

789
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Great.

790
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,480
Did you date someone on campus too?

791
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,280
- On campus? While I was in school?
- Yes.

792
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I can't remember.

793
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,680
Come on.

794
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,890
That was so long ago.
I can't seem to remember.

795
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,050
I can tell you about my history.

796
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,520
Don't tell me because I won't.

797
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,960
You shouldn't remember it either.

798
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,690
- The past is the past.
- Yes.

799
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,090
"You shouldn't remember it either."

800
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,330
The gloves were a great buy too.

801
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,100
I wanted to buy either gloves or a scarf,
no matter what today.

802
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,970
I didn't realize that
I looked good in red.

803
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,540
- That's your color.
- It looks great on me.

804
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,810
- It matches the color of your outfit.
- Do they look good on me?

805
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,840
Yes.

806
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,840
- These gloves match my color.
- I feel so proud.

807
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,710
Yes. That's the right color for you.

808
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,380
(Their hands meet.)

809
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,050
This is one of my moves when I flirt.

810
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,090
- Gosh. I almost...
- You didn't even give me a heads-up.

811
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,390
I almost kept going with that...

812
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,360
before I realized what I was doing.

813
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,820
Should we skip a few steps?

814
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,330
Well, sometimes,
you have to skip a few steps.

815
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,330
They interlaced their fingers
with the gloves on.

816
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,300
"Should we skip a few steps?"

817
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
(The two of them
bonded more deeply today.)

818
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,800
- It's the first time we saw that.
- Yes.

819
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,770
That is indeed Chang Hwan's flirting move.

820
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,070
- Right. He definitely flirted with her.
- Yes.

821
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,740
Gosh, he's going all out today.

822
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,680
Chang Hwan made a big flirting move today.

823
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,650
He started with the serious conversation.

824
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,150
Then he interlaced his fingers with hers
at the end.

825
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,520
Chang Hwan. You deserve my compliment.

826
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,020
(You totally deserve a compliment.)

827
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,950
Paul, how did you grab a woman's hand
for the first time?

828
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,150
"Grab?"

829
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,220
He grabbed their hand
instead of holding it?

830
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,430
- Grab it like a handshake?
- A handshake.

831
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,190
If my memory serves me right,

832
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,060
I held her hand all of a sudden.

833
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,900
- All of a sudden?
- Yes.

834
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,100
- Without a heads-up?
- I created some tension first.

835
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,200
But how did it feel?

836
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,800
- Were you nervous before you did that?
- Before I did that,

837
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
- I was walking.
- Did you match her pace?

838
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,010
My entire attention was on my hand.

839
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,010
- I was walking while looking at her hand.
- Like this?

840
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,480
- Like this?
- Then I saw my chance. "Now."

841
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,380
- I start with my pinkie.
- Right.

842
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,450
She might do that
because she's the careful type.

843
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,850
- Intimacy begins with holding hands.
- Right.

844
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,380
I liked what he said to her
more than anything.

845
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,090
"A cool breeze was washing over me."

846
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,190
(They totally agree.)

847
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,960
- Right.
- That was really nice.

848
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,520
- That was the highest compliment.
- Right.

849
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,660
"That's the line of the day."

850
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,830
(A romantic confession by Chang Hwan)

851
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,030
- He felt trapped in a stuffy place.
- Right.

852
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,500
Meeting her was like opening a window
just to feel the cool breeze.

853
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,040
"That's what you are to me."
That was what he said.

854
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,440
That comment was...

855
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,140
I liked how Soo Ah looked
when he said that.

856
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
- Right.
- Yes.

857
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,810
If I use that sentence
in the lyrics of my song,

858
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,510
- "A cool breeze."
- I'll pay him royalties.

859
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,750
(He'll pay him royalties right away.)

860
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,820
- "You were like a cool breeze to me."
- That's right.

861
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,220
("You were like a cool breeze to me."
Lyrics by Chang Hwan)

862
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,790
(It's Christmas when everyone is excited.)

863
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,860
(He's waiting for his date.)

864
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
It's Sang Yun.

865
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,700
(Whom will he spend Christmas with?)

866
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,100
- Whom will he meet?
- Who is it?

867
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,470
(Someone approaches him.)

868
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,570
(Sang Yun's date is...)

869
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,610
(Chae Eun.)

870
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,740
- It's Chae Eun.
- It's Chae Eun.

871
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,610
(Smiling broadly)

872
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,880
- Hi.
- It was you.

873
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,180
About Sang Yun.

874
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,720
There are things that I think about
but never say out loud.

875
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,060
But he's someone who says those things
without hesitating.

876
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,490
(The day of the postcard pairing)

877
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,830
- He cut you off.
- What?

878
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,700
- He cut me off?
- He was like a goalkeeper.

879
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,000
I thought he was Casillas.

880
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,130
I know. And he answered instead.

881
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,630
He answers instead.

882
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,100
(That's funny.)

883
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,540
If you're with Chae Eun,
you'll never starve to death.

884
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,870
Of course. I feed you only tasty things.

885
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,780
- Hi.
- It was you.

886
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,140
- You waited long, right?
- Hi. Yes.

887
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,780
- Sorry.
- I'm about to freeze to death.

888
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,050
(A Date of the Two Who Are the Same Age)

889
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,620
- Do you have a hand warmer?
- Yes, I do.

890
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,780
I can feel that...

891
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,990
he also feels that we click together.

892
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,590
- Chae Eun wrote his name.
- Yes.

893
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,260
(They matched as they wrote each other
as their 2nd choices.)

894
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,090
Chae Eun was interested in Sang Yun too.

895
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,090
Yes. And Sang Yun looks
really comfortable with her.

896
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,130
Right.

897
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,530
- Because they're the same age.
- Yes.

898
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,660
That gives them no pressure.

899
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,770
I can really feel the year-end vibe.

900
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,670
I know. Actually, I like places like this.

901
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,670
- Is that so?
- A shiny place in the city...

902
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,870
where you can feel that it's the year-end.

903
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,580
And a house party on Christmas.

904
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,010
Right. With my friends at home.

905
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,610
Or you go to a nice place
in your neighborhood.

906
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,080
(They arrived at a nice restaurant.)

907
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,510
I wonder what they'll be like
when they eat.

908
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,020
What kind of food do you usually enjoy?

909
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,620
I'm okay with anything but spicy food.

910
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,620
Me too.

911
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,960
I like everything.

912
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,360
I'm hungry. I just became so hungry.

913
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,790
They went to have beef slice hot pot?

914
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,260
My friends and I enjoy food
that older men would like.

915
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,670
So we like this kind of food.

916
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,700
Pyeongyang naengmyeon
and beef slice hot pot.

917
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,010
It's so good.

918
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,650
I go to a place like Gwangjang Market.

919
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,350
I start with yukhoe.

920
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,450
(That must be tasty.)

921
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,680
When I'm full, I sit at a cart bar.

922
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,920
I order chicken skin or tteokbokki.

923
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,590
Everyone here knows that
I'm serious about food.

924
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,490
She's serious about food.

925
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,860
- What a waste.
- I know.

926
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,230
(They couldn't finish
the beef slice hot pot.)

927
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,530
(They felt bad about
the leftover food from then.)

928
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,170
(Today, they'll eat without regret.)

929
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,040
- The two look good together.
- They seem to click well.

930
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,210
Did you know I'd be here?

931
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,510
Of course. They should talk about that.

932
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,840
I thought it would be you.

933
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
What about you?

934
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,850
I thought it would be you,
so I did my best to find something tasty.

935
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,550
- Really?
- Because I thought you'd come.

936
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,650
That's touching. You're the best.

937
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,190
(Sang Yun looked for a good restaurant
for Foodie Chae Eun.)

938
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,720
"Chae Eun will be here."

939
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,330
I thought, "I must find a place
with tasty food, no matter what."

940
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,300
I thought I'd be having a date with you,

941
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
so I wanted to wear something trendy.

942
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,470
Is that the best you could do
to look trendy?

943
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,640
Well, this is...

944
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,000
Well, you need to check out my pants too.

945
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,870
(Laughing)

946
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,170
(This is the trendiest she can be.)

947
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,180
That's cute.

948
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,340
- It looks so good.
- I think we can order some more.

949
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,710
- Do you like mushrooms?
- Yes.

950
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,580
I love them too.

951
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,020
This is crazy.

952
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,290
Gosh. It's tastier than the meat.

953
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,930
This is going to make me faint.

954
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,500
- Isn't it so good?
- It's so chewy.

955
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,730
You really know
where to find something tasty.

956
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,530
You enjoy eating, right?

957
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,540
I have a social media account
for good restaurants.

958
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,210
Do you want to see it?

959
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,110
Did you upload all these photos?

960
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,110
Yes.

961
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,880
This is amazing.

962
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,550
This burrata is so tasty.

963
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,820
- You know, you must add more cheese.
- That's a must.

964
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,150
They really like eating good food.

965
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,220
Gosh, I've been to this place.

966
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,120
I know. I heard that
you went there with Chan Hyeong.

967
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,260
Yes. I told him about this place a lot.

968
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,290
He knows every place.

969
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,760
It's more comfortable
since we're the same age.

970
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,170
I joke around a lot.

971
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,500
You do? I think you'd be funny.

972
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,900
I really like it when people say that.

973
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,400
- Is that so?
- That I'm funny.

974
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,470
Do you want to be the funny one?

975
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,110
I'm like that too.

976
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,580
My friends always tell me this.

977
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,710
"You just need to shut your mouth."

978
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,750
"Don't try to be funny."

979
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,050
Everyone knows that
Chae Eun likes eating tasty food.

980
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,150
And I like eating good food too.

981
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,750
I've been to this place a lot.

982
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,560
Goodness. You know all these places?

983
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,290
How can you know all of them?

984
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,290
(Sang Yun is surprised
by Chae Eun's food data.)

985
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,990
I really like people
who know how to enjoy...

986
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,700
eating good food and having good drinks.

987
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,300
We'll gain weight if we go on dates.

988
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,330
Seriously.

989
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,640
We'd gain at least 5kg in 2 weeks.

990
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,900
I think...

991
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,610
it's really good when you can hit it off
when talking about food.

992
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,940
Because for work,

993
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,480
since we have different jobs,
you don't understand it anyway.

994
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,880
I agree.

995
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,220
"I see."

996
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,820
"Let's have something tasty after work."

997
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,920
(They have different jobs,
but they become happy with good food.)

998
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,190
- They look comfortable.
- I know.

999
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,230
It's important to get rid of
the stress together.

1000
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,260
Right.

1001
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,660
Did you try this last time?

1002
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,060
Me? No, I've never had this before.

1003
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,600
- Is that so?
- This is my first time...

1004
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,700
eating braised pork belly.

1005
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,270
That's interesting.

1006
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,140
Actually, since I'm going to China soon,

1007
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,540
I was going to have
really good braised pork belly.

1008
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,040
- I heard that you were going to Shanghai.
- Right.

1009
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,450
- I really love Shanghai.
- I see.

1010
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,550
You must go to this place.

1011
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,050
It's called Hangzhou Yi Qian.

1012
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,990
What? I've already added that place
on my list.

1013
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,290
- Of course. You know where to go.
- How did she know that?

1014
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,290
She knows everything.

1015
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,090
I went there for work.
I've been to many different places.

1016
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,390
If you go there for work,

1017
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,930
do you do a photoshoot there
and come back?

1018
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:34,930
Yes.

1019
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,670
- For a Chinese brand.
- A Chinese brand?

1020
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,570
That's amazing.

1021
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,800
Do they have your photos there then?

1022
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,980
I think they have my photos there.
For that brand.

1023
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,010
That's cool.

1024
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,950
Then do you adjust your schedule
all by yourself?

1025
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,010
I do everything myself.

1026
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,220
Amazing. You must be meticulous.

1027
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,550
Were you never in an agency?

1028
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,560
(Nodding)

1029
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,520
- It must be tough.
- That's amazing.

1030
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,900
- What is?
- You schedule everything by yourself.

1031
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,500
And in the beginning,

1032
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,530
you must have an agency
to help you understand the system.

1033
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,930
You learn what to do,

1034
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,800
and you find out
what the reasonable price is.

1035
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,840
That's right.

1036
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,070
I learned them all by experience.

1037
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,140
And I...

1038
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,710
say things directly.

1039
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,610
So when I meet people for work,

1040
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,880
and if they've been
in the business for long,

1041
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,890
I just ask them directly.
"I'm asking since I don't know anything."

1042
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,290
"What should I do with this?"
And most people give me good advice.

1043
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,690
Is that so?

1044
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,560
- He's so cool.
- I know.

1045
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,660
(Sang Yun learned how to work in his field
by asking around.)

1046
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,030
Do you get along well...

1047
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,300
with someone who's older than you?

1048
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,500
What's the meaning of that question?

1049
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,040
- Je Yeon is older than him, right?
- Yes.

1050
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,140
I usually...

1051
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,240
get along well with someone
who's the same age as me.

1052
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,310
(Someone who's the same age?)

1053
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,780
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

1054
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,820
We don't have much time left,

1055
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,120
- but we don't know what will happen.
- Chae Eun has a lot on her mind.

1056
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,120
(I usually...)

1057
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,020
(get along well with someone
who's the same age as me.)

1058
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,460
Is that so?

1059
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,930
If I look back at the people I've dated,

1060
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,070
because I like dating someone who makes me
feel comfortable like a friend...

1061
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,170
I've met people
who were the same age as me the most.

1062
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,570
If I count the numbers.

1063
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,810
What was it like
when you were with Je Yeon?

1064
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,820
It wasn't that comfortable, but...

1065
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,790
I thought you two had fun.

1066
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,590
It was fun.

1067
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,690
We're quite similar in character.

1068
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,790
I thought so.

1069
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,100
- I had this feeling.
- Right.

1070
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,200
And...

1071
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,900
I thought I'd become more comfortable...

1072
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,640
if we got closer.

1073
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,440
(Sang Yun wanted to
become close to Je Yeon.)

1074
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,340
I wanted to see that too.

1075
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,210
(Chae Eun could see
how Sang Yun felt about Je Yeon.)

1076
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,680
That's how I felt about her.

1077
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
What about you?

1078
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,320
I think you'd be in a long relationship.

1079
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,820
Me? No, I...

1080
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,990
Lately,
I haven't met someone for a long time.

1081
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,730
What were the reasons for your breakups?

1082
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,930
I don't know,

1083
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,730
but they only went on for 3 to 4 months.

1084
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,940
After that,
I end it if it doesn't look promising.

1085
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,410
If marriage is on your mind,

1086
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,810
I can see why.

1087
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,440
- I like conversations like this.
- They're being honest.

1088
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,810
Have you ever experienced...

1089
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,710
something like that
in a past relationship?

1090
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,420
- I have.
- I see.

1091
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,550
Marriage hasn't really been on my mind.

1092
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,590
It seems that way.

1093
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,360
- I was younger back then.
- Right.

1094
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,030
But now that I'm 30,

1095
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,600
my view on marriage has changed.

1096
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,070
My life is stable now,

1097
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,400
and I'm making as much money as I want.

1098
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,770
Also, I'm more sure of myself.

1099
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,670
He's being honest right now.

1100
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:08,010
I feel like it'll be nice
to share the life I've created.

1101
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,150
That's why my view has shifted recently.

1102
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,710
(That's what led to his determination.)

1103
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,250
After you came to live with us,

1104
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,790
a lot has changed.

1105
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,790
If only I had joined back when you did.

1106
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,530
After you joined,

1107
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,630
you shook up the dynamic...

1108
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,870
that had been forming up until then.

1109
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,100
I feel like I helped them
be more sure of each other.

1110
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,800
Really?

1111
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,840
Sang Yun's aware of it.

1112
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,140
To be honest,

1113
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,880
I've been forcing myself to look away,

1114
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,510
thinking that
I don't need to feel those emotions.

1115
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,620
- Sang Yun's aware of it.
- That's what he really thinks.

1116
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,490
Mentally, it's been taking a toll on me.

1117
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,950
Goodness.

1118
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,290
I tried my best to grab her attention.

1119
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,630
I wanted our dates to be special.

1120
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,900
I wanted her to have...

1121
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,270
a better and more comfortable time
in the car...

1122
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,010
than she did with Ji Min.

1123
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,740
I wanted to take her to places,
better than those he had taken her to.

1124
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,010
(He wanted her to enjoy it so that
she wouldn't think of anyone else.)

1125
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,250
This is a memory
that will last a lifetime.

1126
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,750
(The effort he put in
during their contract relationship)

1127
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,250
During those two days,
we went to special places.

1128
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,930
We had such a good time
in these amazing places,

1129
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,160
but then we returned
to our everyday lives.

1130
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,000
I felt the pressure upon returning.

1131
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,870
When we had our last meal,

1132
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,540
it was...

1133
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,740
I had a rough time on that date.

1134
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,240
She had to order something red
when she was wearing white.

1135
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,650
She couldn't even wear an apron.

1136
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,310
How could she even eat her meal?

1137
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,920
(Something went wrong during
what should have been the perfect date.)

1138
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,920
You won't be able to eat properly today.

1139
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,860
Since she couldn't eat properly,
I wanted to entertain her with my words,

1140
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,090
but nothing came to mind.

1141
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,790
He's more meticulous than he seems.

1142
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,870
After that date,

1143
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,070
I had to think about so many things.

1144
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,100
(It's been eating away at Sang Yun.)

1145
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,640
(That night,
after they returned from their date,)

1146
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,210
(he saw the two together.)

1147
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,240
I remember that moment.

1148
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,450
(Sang Yun was confused.)

1149
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,120
It's complicated, isn't it?

1150
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,890
Because of that,
it has been hard for me emotionally.

1151
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,930
- He just never let it show.
- It must've been hard for him.

1152
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:42,100
(His wandering emotions
have nowhere to go.)

1153
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,600
You switched up the dynamic.

1154
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,410
The mood shifted.

1155
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,980
That's not why I came here, though.

1156
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,150
Exactly.

1157
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,550
I can see that you're giving it your all.

1158
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,550
I can tell what kind of person you are.

1159
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,990
Chae Eun's been noticing it.

1160
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,120
It's best to try everything possible.

1161
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,590
Don't we have like four days left now?

1162
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,000
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

1163
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,630
- Almost 3 days.
- We have 3 days left.

1164
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,670
It's hard to tell what'll happen.

1165
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,440
(Who will they eventually choose?)

1166
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,080
- It must've been hard for him.
- How did he endure this?

1167
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,580
Je Yeon has a huge place
in Sang Yun's heart.

1168
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,020
But he half knows...

1169
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:37,920
that it might not work out.

1170
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,020
He's lost some of his confidence.

1171
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,560
He saw Je Yeon looking at Ji Min
and searching for him...

1172
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,630
on many occasions.

1173
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,400
It's the same for everyone.

1174
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,730
In the end,

1175
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,370
we all want to be loved,

1176
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,930
- and that never changes.
- Right.

1177
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,540
Whoever comforts you...

1178
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,910
when you want that the most...

1179
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,480
is someone you might end up falling for.

1180
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,250
That's what I think.

1181
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,150
So rather than suddenly
having feelings for her,

1182
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,220
I think he's realized...

1183
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,720
that he's more comfortable around her.

1184
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,120
Chae Eun has a good thing going
with Chan Hyeong,

1185
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,420
- but Sang Yun's also interested in her.
- Right.

1186
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,090
- This is opening up some doors.
- Exactly.

1187
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,230
This is a couple we didn't expect.

1188
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,530
- I know.
- Tell me about it.

1189
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,630
It's tough, isn't it?

1190
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,600
(A night painted in Christmas lights)

1191
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,000
(A wine bar in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

1192
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,840
Is that Woo Jae?

1193
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,480
(Who will Woo Jae's date be?)

1194
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,080
(Light steps)

1195
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,180
I wonder who it is.

1196
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,920
Who is it?

1197
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,550
(Beaming)

1198
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,490
(It's Ji Won.)

1199
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
(Standing up)

1200
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,990
Hi.

1201
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,360
- She's pretty.
- No way.

1202
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,060
Woo Jae and Ji Won.

1203
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,670
(Woo Jae and Ji Won's Christmas date)

1204
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,730
- I bet you didn't know.
- I didn't.

1205
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,330
- You had no idea.
- No way.

1206
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,770
- She's adorable.
- She looks amazing today.

1207
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,870
- It's a gift.
- Is this a gift?

1208
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1209
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,110
- Did you expect me?
- I had no idea.

1210
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:12,850
I kind of expected it.

1211
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,620
- Really?
- About one percent.

1212
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,650
- One percent?
- Yes.

1213
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,290
Then, it's a miracle.

1214
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,550
No way.

1215
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,930
It's even nicer to see you out here.

1216
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,100
- Right.
- Especially...

1217
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,200
since this is Haebangchon.

1218
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,300
It's where I live.

1219
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,440
I love it.

1220
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,310
Right, and also...

1221
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,250
Since I figured there was...

1222
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,210
a one percent chance...

1223
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,590
There was an independent bookstore
on my way here.

1224
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,190
I bought a book for you...

1225
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,890
in case you showed up.

1226
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,890
- Really?
- Yes.

1227
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,860
I wouldn't have been able to give you this
if you hadn't been my date today.

1228
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,100
(He bought a book
while excited for their date.)

1229
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,160
Anyway...

1230
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,630
I got you this just in case.

1231
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,370
- It's not a book I've read.
- Okay.

1232
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,100
But the title...

1233
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:13,070
seemed to speak to the situation we're in.

1234
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,280
- Really?
- Yes.

1235
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,180
(Excited)

1236
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,350
What is it?

1237
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,120
No way.

1238
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,320
How cool of him.

1239
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,090
(Careful)

1240
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,730
- I love it, Woo Jae.
- Really?

1241
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,230
Read it sometime.

1242
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,700
- I will.
- Good.

1243
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,730
Thanks.

1244
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,870
I'm touched that you bought this,

1245
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,580
hoping I'd be the one to show up.

1246
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,680
It was...

1247
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,050
a maybe.

1248
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,520
- Like a gift.
- Right.

1249
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,920
I thought maybe, I could be given a gift.

1250
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,390
That's what I thought.

1251
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,120
This is such a great gift.

1252
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,890
Really? Right.

1253
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,800
(It's the perfect present.)

1254
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,930
Thanks. This is...

1255
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,130
- Take your time reading it.
- I will.

1256
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,610
(Tapping)

1257
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,640
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1258
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,680
Merry Christmas.

1259
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,450
(Humming)

1260
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,620
- Is it good?
- It is.

1261
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:34,220
(A quiet time alone)

1262
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,290
It might now be immediate,

1263
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,430
but have you thought...

1264
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,300
about what kind of person...

1265
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,170
you want to marry?

1266
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,840
As for me...

1267
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,840
This is what I say often.

1268
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,010
I want my spouse...

1269
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,350
to be my best friend.

1270
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,420
Right.

1271
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,490
I want someone I can talk to a lot.

1272
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:09,120
Someone who'll be my companion in life.

1273
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,730
That's who I want to marry.

1274
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,230
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1275
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,670
What about you?

1276
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,500
I want to marry someone who can love me...

1277
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,510
for the person I am.

1278
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,480
You know,

1279
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,380
while staying at the house,

1280
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,080
I was able to think...

1281
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,150
about marriage...

1282
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,650
in a more serious way.

1283
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,990
I was able to think about it more.

1284
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,520
Before this,
marriage was a vague idea to me.

1285
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:47,700
Maybe it's because I haven't met someone
who made me want to think about marriage.

1286
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,130
Anyway...

1287
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,340
You might be flustered by this question,

1288
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,410
but how would it be for you
to date me for real?

1289
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,750
(Woo Jae flirts with her out of nowhere.)

1290
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,290
If I date you for real?

1291
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:11,990
(Nodding)

1292
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,690
What about you?

1293
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,960
I'd like that.

1294
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,590
- Goodness.
- What?

1295
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,730
(Confidently, he tells her how he feels.)

1296
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,440
You seem like a great person.

1297
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,980
So what if we chose each other
at the very end?

1298
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,550
I think we could make this work.

1299
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,520
(Smiling)

1300
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,550
That's what I thought.

1301
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,130
I have fun talking to you,

1302
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,900
and time flies.

1303
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,440
It's like that for me too.

1304
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,280
There's a place nearby
I'd like to take you to.

1305
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,180
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

1306
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,980
Right. Let's hustle.

1307
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,220
(They go someplace after dinner.)

1308
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,620
- Let's not run, though.
- I can't believe you asked me that.

1309
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,260
- I wonder where we're going.
- We're here.

1310
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,900
Here?

1311
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,300
It's my studio.

1312
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,430
- Really?
- Yes.

1313
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,470
No way.

1314
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,640
That must be Woo Jae's studio.

1315
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,740
(Woo Jae's studio)

1316
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,940
(My gosh)

1317
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,110
This is my studio.

1318
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,520
- Isn't this a first for us?
- No way.

1319
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,150
I didn't expect this at all.

1320
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,150
- Really?
- No.

1321
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,350
I love the mood of this place.

1322
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,090
(Everywhere...)

1323
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,060
- This is it.
- It's an honor.

1324
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,420
(Everywhere,
you can see traces of his work.)

1325
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,630
- How is it this pretty?
- Is it?

1326
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,690
Yes.

1327
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,760
This is one of mine.

1328
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,300
There's a certain mood to it.

1329
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,670
Take a look around.

1330
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,400
Feel free to look around.

1331
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,840
(Woo Jae's paintings
that channel his artistry)

1332
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,200
This is so cool.

1333
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,070
(Gazing)

1334
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,040
- Can I look at it up close?
- Yes.

1335
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,310
(Recently,
she saw one of his paintings at a cafe.)

1336
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,350
It's watercolor.

1337
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,420
What's this called?

1338
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,890
"Before Dawn."

1339
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:25,950
(Today, she sees his work at his studio.)

1340
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,890
This is a night view I drew from memory.

1341
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,760
It's so meaningful
that he invited her there.

1342
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,060
What does that look like?

1343
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,830
- Forsythia.
- What?

1344
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,100
It looks like forsythia.

1345
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,300
That's a star.

1346
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,040
The emotions I felt
when I first saw a star...

1347
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,440
were drawn on the canvas like that.

1348
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,210
Fill it in like so.

1349
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,810
- Are you sure I can do this?
- Go ahead.

1350
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,950
He's cool, isn't he?

1351
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,380
There.

1352
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,850
It's okay.

1353
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,750
You can apply pressure.

1354
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,530
(Ji Won colors it in herself.)

1355
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,290
You're good at this.

1356
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,600
When I showcase this,
I'll tell people you painted some of it.

1357
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,540
- Really?
- I'll say that.

1358
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,310
I love them. They're meant to be.

1359
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,840
- I know.
- Exactly.

1360
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,480
(A bus stop shrouded in darkness)

1361
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,250
(A man carefully approaches Ha Neul.)

1362
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,420
That's Ha Neul.

1363
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,850
(It's Chan Hyeong.)

1364
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,020
Really?

1365
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,060
(Smiling)

1366
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,520
Hi.

1367
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

1368
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,900
Hey.

1369
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,800
- It must've been cold out here.
- You appeared out of nowhere.

1370
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,000
It seems really cold out here.

1371
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,640
- I brought one for you.
- No, I'm good. Keep them.

1372
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,670
- You seem colder than I am.
- I already have one.

1373
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,440
- You seem colder.
- I have one.

1374
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

1375
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,110
Did you expect me?

1376
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,550
- I had no idea.
- Exactly.

1377
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,110
I had no idea who'd be here.

1378
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,620
You were calm, though.

1379
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,480
I was wondering who'd be here.

1380
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,850
Chan Hyeong had feelings for her,
didn't he?

1381
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,160
I think he still has feelings for her.

1382
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,520
A man's feelings for the woman he liked...

1383
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,860
never go away.

1384
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,390
- What a saying.
- Right.

1385
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,560
- Really?
- Yes.

1386
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,760
- Hasn't it been a while?
- It has.

1387
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,470
- It has been quite a while.
- I know.

1388
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:18,730
It's kind of awkward.

1389
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,830
- Is it?
- Yes.

1390
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,640
Compared to when we spent
a lot of time together...

1391
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,910
- Exactly.
- Right?

1392
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,610
The last time we were together...

1393
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,240
- was for our contract relationship.
- Right.

1394
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,940
- Right.
- They still remember.

1395
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,880
During these next two weeks,

1396
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,320
we'll get to know each other better.

1397
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,890
Will we get to know each other better,
or...

1398
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,200
(He sensed Ha Neul's feelings
in the words she didn't say.)

1399
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:57,340
(Their relationship came to a stop
after that.)

1400
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,280
Why did she want to go out
with Chan Hyeong again?

1401
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:01,840
I'm not sure.

1402
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,180
(A cafe in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province)

1403
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,280
Are they at a cafe?

1404
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,450
(A cafe in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province)

1405
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,450
Right.

1406
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,950
(They get together
after quite some time has passed.)

1407
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,390
I'm shy for some reason.

1408
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,890
- It's nice to see you again, though.
- I know.

1409
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,860
I had a feeling...

1410
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,300
- that you'd show up today.
- I see.

1411
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,900
I don't know about you, but...

1412
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,670
I don't know if you thought I'd show up,

1413
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,740
but I wrote your name down for this date.

1414
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,110
I wanted the chance to talk to you.

1415
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,210
At least once.

1416
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,780
Right. We talked...

1417
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,120
- about grabbing lunch sometime.
- I know.

1418
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,520
I've made up my mind now.

1419
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,190
- Really?
- I have.

1420
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,330
After much consideration?

1421
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,890
Yes, I'm done thinking about it.

1422
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,360
- I'm almost there.
- I see.

1423
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,270
What about you?

1424
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,600
I'm leaning strongly to one side as well.

1425
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,840
He's nearly made up his mind.

1426
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,910
Are you no longer stressed out
about the situation?

1427
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,050
Yes.

1428
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,720
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Yesterday cleared things up for me.

1429
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,680
- That's great.
- It worked in my favor.

1430
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,250
- It should.
- I'm at ease now.

1431
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,120
Because of what happened yesterday?

1432
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,770
I really think Chan Hyeong
is the person...

1433
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,740
she can be comfortable with
and open up to...

1434
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,440
on Christmas.

1435
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,940
Exactly. You're right.

1436
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,920
(A cafe in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province)

1437
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,020
- Watch your step.
- Sure.

1438
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,150
Don't you smell a campfire?

1439
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,320
- I do.
- Right?

1440
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,660
- The smell of burning wood.
- Exactly.

1441
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,830
The smell of firewood.

1442
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,160
- This is so pretty.
- We're here.

1443
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,360
It's beautiful.

1444
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,430
- Is this Christmassy for you?
- This feels like Christmas.

1445
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,070
- It's Christmas for sure.
- Yes, it's Christmas.

1446
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,540
- I'll put these down.
- Sure.

1447
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,310
- All right.
- There you go.

1448
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,480
- This is nice.
- It's warm.

1449
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,640
(Silent and Warm Like Christmas)

1450
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,710
Right?

1451
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,550
- Totally.
- This is really warm.

1452
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,650
(Burning hot)

1453
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,680
Here's your tea.

1454
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,820
- Is this mine?
- Yes.

1455
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,850
- And this is mine.
- Right.

1456
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,620
You should have hot chocolate
at a place like this.

1457
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,530
I didn't know that was a thing.

1458
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,000
It's been a dream of mine...

1459
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,670
to have hot chocolate under a blanket
on Christmas.

1460
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,900
I'm getting to enjoy that today.

1461
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,810
I know.

1462
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,180
You got everything you wanted.

1463
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,910
My Christmas dream came true.

1464
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,550
- My precious Christmas dream.
- Exactly.

1465
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,820
It's hard to ignore their chemistry.

1466
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,730
Look at us wrapping things up like this.

1467
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,430
We're even spending Christmas...

1468
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,860
- I know.
- together.

1469
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,430
Tell me about it.

1470
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,170
How did we end up
spending so much time together?

1471
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,170
- That's fascinating to me.
- Right.

1472
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,610
- It feels so nostalgic.
- I agree.

1473
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,540
- We have so many memories together.
- Yes.

1474
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,250
Didn't we spend almost one-third
of our time together?

1475
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,780
- If you think about it.
- You're right.

1476
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,160
(They went on their 1st 1-on-1 date
with each other.)

1477
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,230
- It's so pretty here.
- You're right. It's incredible.

1478
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,260
Shall we go in?

1479
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,400
(Reflecting each person's taste,)

1480
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,000
(they picked out a Christmas gift.)

1481
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,940
At that time, I thought
the two of them would become a couple.

1482
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,970
- Right.
- Right.

1483
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,010
That's right.

1484
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:56,110
(They also wrote postcards
to share their feelings.)

1485
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,310
(When we return to Korea,
I hope to get to know you better.)

1486
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,380
(I hope that we share our daily lives
and thoughts during the remaining time.)

1487
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:04,620
(They had their first
contract relationship in Korea.)

1488
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,850
I agree.

1489
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,920
- This is amazing.
- How does it feel?

1490
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:09,360
It's quite heavy.

1491
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:14,700
(Before they knew it, they had created
countless memories together.)

1492
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,270
- This is lovely.
- Yes.

1493
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,670
Gazing at the fire.

1494
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,070
Crackling.

1495
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,380
- Shall we grill some marshmallows?
- Yes, we have marshmallows.

1496
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,880
How do we grill these properly?

1497
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,450
You have to keep turning it.

1498
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,750
- Turning.
- Turning.

1499
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,930
I used to do this a lot with my family
when we went camping.

1500
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,460
Did you go camping often with your family?

1501
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,760
I went camping often when I was a child.

1502
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,330
Camping? Right.

1503
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,430
- With a family of my own,
- Right.

1504
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,800
I'd like to go camping.

1505
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,700
Camping is like...

1506
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,740
going to a place of your choice...

1507
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,310
- that isn't designated.
- Exactly.

1508
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,710
It'd be romantic with a bonfire like this.

1509
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,720
- That sounds like so much fun.
- I'd be with a partner...

1510
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,680
- who's on my side.
- Right.

1511
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,250
I'd talk to her all day long.

1512
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,460
You told me that...

1513
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,420
you've been worried.

1514
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,760
Now that you've gone through that period,

1515
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,960
do you think there are more positives
than negatives?

1516
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,500
- In conclusion?
- He's worrying about her.

1517
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,170
The tough period was short.

1518
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,640
It was very short.

1519
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,570
The positive side was much bigger.

1520
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,710
- Good things happened more each day.
- Right.

1521
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,180
The people are wonderful.

1522
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,150
- I felt encouraged by them.
- Right.

1523
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,650
In my life...

1524
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,050
December of this year has been...

1525
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:47,860
very special to me personally.

1526
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,260
You're right.

1527
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,760
- Ever since I became an adult.
- Right.

1528
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,330
- This month has been very memorable.
- Right.

1529
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,970
(Staring)

1530
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,540
I also have more places with memories
than before.

1531
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,840
Whenever I pass by them,
I'll recall the past.

1532
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,870
Did you spend the time meaningfully?

1533
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,010
Everyone spent their time meaningfully.

1534
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,210
(Chuckling)

1535
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,510
I won't be able to talk to you.

1536
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,980
Why not?

1537
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,650
I could tell that
you were deep in thought,

1538
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,490
so I felt hesitant to talk to you.

1539
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,060
So he knew.

1540
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,230
Don't I look more peaceful now?

1541
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,230
- You're right.
- Right?

1542
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,130
It feels like the Ha Neul...

1543
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,830
- Do you think that I'm back?
- I first met is back.

1544
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:31,830
Right.

1545
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,900
That's right.

1546
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,310
That's because Chae Eun helped me a lot.

1547
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,510
- From talking to each other?
- From talking to each other.

1548
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,980
This morning,
she kept asking me if I was okay.

1549
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,890
I'd like to be friends...

1550
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,330
- with people at the Pairing House.
- Me too.

1551
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:00,190
We often say,
"When we go out, let's do this and that."

1552
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,300
I said to Woo Jae,

1553
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,170
"Send you the address of your studio
and the passcode."

1554
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,170
Even the passcode?

1555
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,500
I told him, "Send me the passcode.
I'll invite myself in."

1556
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,110
I'm jealous.

1557
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,510
(Staring)

1558
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,250
I love how I can see my breath in winter.

1559
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,980
(Exhaling)

1560
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,520
Yes, I love that.

1561
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,720
(Exhaling)

1562
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:37,500
It feels like the beginning and the end.

1563
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,270
Today feels like the end, doesn't it?

1564
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,270
Yes.

1565
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,300
I'm very happy to spend the beginning...

1566
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,310
- and the end with you.
- Me too.

1567
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,610
I can tell that Ha Neul is
more at peace with herself.

1568
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,710
She seems lighthearted.

1569
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,910
It feels like writing the beginning
and the end of a book.

1570
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:59,420
"This story starts in Italy."

1571
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,090
- It's like a children's story.
- Right?

1572
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,260
You're right.

1573
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,760
I can't wait.

1574
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,200
For what?

1575
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,530
For the future.

1576
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,300
- It's another start.
- I look forward to the future.

1577
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
Merry Christmas.

1578
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,140
Merry Christmas to you too.

1579
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:23,740
(Both the beginning and the end were warm
for Chan Hyeong and Ha Neul.)

1580
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:27,720
I can understand why Ha Neul
asked Chan Hyeong on a date.

1581
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,720
To wrap things up on a good note.

1582
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,290
After coming to terms
with her feelings for Ji Min,

1583
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,560
- Ha Neul felt thankful to Chan Hyeong.
- I agree.

1584
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,660
It's Chan Hyeong
who made an effort for her.

1585
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,930
I also feel relieved to know...

1586
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,700
- that they became supportive friends.
- Right.

1587
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,730
(A good ending)

1588
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,470
(Filled with people full of excitement)

1589
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:52,310
(The street on Christmas)

1590
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,940
(The person for the last date)

1591
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,210
It's Ji Min.

1592
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:03,250
(The person for the last date, Ji Min)

1593
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,060
(Ji Min's date is walking from afar.)

1594
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,160
Come on, Je Yeon.

1595
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,700
(Ji Min's date today is...)

1596
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,970
It's Je Yeon.

1597
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,000
(Ji Min's date today is Je Yeon.)

1598
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,040
- Hi.
- You dressed for Christmas.

1599
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,970
There you are.

1600
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,510
- Did you recognize me from the back?
- What?

1601
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,540
Did you recognize me from the back?

1602
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,380
No, I saw your profile.

1603
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,010
You didn't recognize me from the back?

1604
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,150
I saw your profile first.

1605
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:39,590
That's cute.

1606
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,120
Something seems to have changed.

1607
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,860
Don't they look natural around each other?

1608
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,890
Je Yeon's voice sounds very comfortable.

1609
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,500
You are totally dressed
for Christmas today.

1610
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,800
I dressed for Christmas, didn't I?

1611
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,270
What's the idea behind your outfit today?

1612
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,740
Christmas.

1613
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,940
- Christmas?
- Yes.

1614
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,470
I'm dressed as a tree.

1615
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,710
(Laughing)

1616
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,310
If we get mixed, it'd be perfect.

1617
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:07,620
Yes.

1618
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,320
(Wiggling)

1619
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,450
(Smiling)

1620
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,090
(They keep bursting out laughing.)

1621
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,760
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

1622
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,770
Did the order go in?

1623
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,670
- He said that he's coming at 7 p.m.
- At 7 p.m.?

1624
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,140
- Did you look at what's in the front?
- What?

1625
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:33,740
- In the front.
- No, I didn't.

1626
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,110
- It's very beautiful.
- Really?

1627
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,810
- After the meal, shall we take photos?
- What?

1628
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:39,980
Shall we take photos over there?

1629
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,580
Okay.

1630
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,560
Did I act like a hedgehog yesterday?

1631
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,930
- Right, I...
- You seemed to be...

1632
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,430
in a worse mood than I thought.

1633
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,700
I see. Right.

1634
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,040
That's understandable.

1635
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:07,070
When you came, I felt much better.

1636
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,980
- Really?
- Yes, because you came.

1637
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,580
When you come down to the first floor,

1638
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,280
you seem funny and cute.

1639
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,350
I find you adorable.

1640
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,820
When you poke your head out...

1641
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,520
I can imagine the process
you go through...

1642
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,720
before coming down to the first floor.

1643
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,860
You keep lingering around
without knocking.

1644
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,830
He likes everything about her.

1645
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,900
(Embarrassed)

1646
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:35,370
(Suddenly, he has a question for her.)

1647
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,300
- Is there something on your mind?
- What?

1648
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,440
- Is there something on your mind?
- You don't think there is?

1649
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,010
Goodness.

1650
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,310
You aren't worried about anything now?

1651
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,920
- What?
- You aren't worried?

1652
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,690
- Are you very worried?
- I guess I don't make it obvious.

1653
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,560
- No one can tell.
- It's impossible to tell.

1654
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:00,030
- Really?
- It's not obvious at all.

1655
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,230
(Disappointed)

1656
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,840
It's not easy for me either.

1657
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:12,970
I know.

1658
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:17,680
- I'll go up to the second floor.
- That's right.

1659
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,080
(Fidgeting)

1660
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,350
It's really delicious.

1661
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,390
- Right?
- Yes.

1662
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,390
It's more delicious
when you're with someone you like.

1663
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,530
You look perfect for Christmas right now.

1664
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,730
- Really?
- I want to take a photo of you.

1665
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,200
Were you disappointed
because I took photos...

1666
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,900
with Soo Ah?

1667
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,810
Yes, it's good to talk about that.

1668
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,470
Was that the four-cut photo?

1669
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,940
No, it wasn't the four-cut photo.

1670
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,780
I wasn't particularly disappointed.

1671
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,520
I just thought, "They took photos
similar to the four-cut photo."

1672
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,990
Je Yeon.

1673
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,190
She's cute.

1674
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:09,760
That's cute.

1675
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,300
I just thought, "They took photos
similar to the four-cut photo."

1676
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,710
Aren't you drinking too much?

1677
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,580
I'm thirsty.

1678
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,580
- That's cute.
- Maybe because it's dry.

1679
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,220
Are you thirsty?

1680
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,560
I ate without realizing what they were.

1681
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,600
What?

1682
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,060
- This is my first meal.
- Isn't it truffle?

1683
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,430
I'm really hungry.

1684
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,300
Didn't you have lunch?

1685
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,070
- Why? Did you go somewhere?
- I went to get a haircut.

1686
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,610
- Is there a big difference?
- What?

1687
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,170
- Is there a big difference?
- A difference?

1688
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,610
The curls are gone.

1689
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,010
Your hair used to be curly.

1690
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,480
On the sides.

1691
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,820
I also got a haircut.

1692
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,050
He's so charming.

1693
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,050
(Laughing)

1694
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,390
Is it not obvious?

1695
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,290
(Brushing)

1696
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:10,390
(Showing it until Je Yeon recognizes it)

1697
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,390
- Which one is better?
- What?

1698
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,290
Do I look better now or before?

1699
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,300
Now.

1700
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,170
(Feeling certain)

1701
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,910
(Laughing)

1702
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:28,610
You came to the wrong place yesterday.

1703
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,710
I thought that it was you.

1704
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,480
I felt pleased
because you were happy to see me.

1705
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,280
I was very happy to see you.

1706
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,320
- Right.
- I hadn't seen you in a long time.

1707
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,520
That's right.

1708
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,120
So I thought it was you and said hello.

1709
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,120
Right.

1710
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:45,590
But I reversed.

1711
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:48,760
It's hilarious.

1712
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,730
I was pulled by you without realizing it.

1713
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,300
That's right.

1714
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:59,410
(The fleeting memories...)

1715
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,410
(of yesterday)

1716
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,840
That was the stroke of genius.

1717
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,310
I remember clearly when you waved at me.

1718
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,410
- Right?
- Yes.

1719
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,880
I will never forget that sight of you.

1720
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,420
What she said is quite meaningful.

1721
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,820
Ji Min is meticulous and detailed.

1722
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,390
He explains everything 1 by 1.

1723
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,160
When there's something on his mind,

1724
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,490
- he always brings it up.
- He talks it out.

1725
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:22,130
He points it out...

1726
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,360
and talks it out.

1727
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,270
- That's his personality.
- Isn't that very important?

1728
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,670
(Staring)

1729
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:39,050
(Both of them are silent for a moment.)

1730
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:46,520
(They look at each other.)

1731
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,120
What is it?

1732
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,820
I was just looking at you.

1733
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,930
I wanted to thank you for the present.

1734
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,400
- Thank you so much.
- That's right.

1735
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,000
I was very moved by it.

1736
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,810
I wrote it to conclude
our time in Florence.

1737
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,080
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

1738
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:16,050
When you were
in a contract relationship with Ji Won,

1739
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,790
all of us got together
to share what we did.

1740
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:19,790
Yes.

1741
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,960
Your concerns about your career path.

1742
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,260
You said that
you talked about that with her.

1743
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,570
I realized that
we never talked about that.

1744
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,800
You're right.

1745
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:37,200
So I got curious...

1746
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,070
about your concerns
related to your career.

1747
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:44,310
Why haven't we talked about
something like that?

1748
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:50,150
I wasn't in a relationship.

1749
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,190
But in terms of my career...

1750
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,190
Yes.

1751
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,290
My financial status,

1752
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:02,400
and my relationship with friends
and family.

1753
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,870
All of these...

1754
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:05,930
have been stable.

1755
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,200
Speaking of my work,

1756
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,170
I joined this company in May of this year.

1757
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,540
So I've worked here for 7 to 8 months.

1758
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:19,150
I really love what I'm doing.

1759
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,080
I love it very much.

1760
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,150
My work involves strategy development.

1761
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:26,190
I analyze companies' investor relations,

1762
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,590
securities data, and academic journals.

1763
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:33,390
Based on what I find,
I write insights reports.

1764
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:34,390
Yes.

1765
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,760
The more specialized knowledge I gain,

1766
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,230
the more I feel like an expert,
like an analyst.

1767
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,140
That learning process is fun.

1768
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,210
As I live every moment...

1769
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,910
with small accomplishments,

1770
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,410
I believe that...

1771
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,150
I'll get a good opportunity in the future.

1772
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,220
That's amazing.

1773
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,050
That's how I feel about my career.

1774
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,290
That's why I think you're amazing.

1775
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,520
Me? Why?

1776
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,290
When you win a case,
you'd feel very accomplished.

1777
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,330
Right.

1778
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,030
I will feel more pressure than before.

1779
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,770
What if you have to work overtime
all the time...

1780
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:16,600
for just one case?

1781
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:19,040
That's possible.

1782
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,480
It could be fun since the result
will depend entirely on you.

1783
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:26,180
- You'll have to take responsibility.
- The responsibility...

1784
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,980
- It would be just as rewarding.
- Right.

1785
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:31,080
It'll be quite difficult in the beginning.

1786
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,120
In the beginning? I'll have to work hard.

1787
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:38,090
I can't imagine you in court.

1788
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:40,960
Later, you can come and see me.

1789
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,300
- What?
- It's nothing.

1790
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,570
- What did you say?
- Later, you can come and see me.

1791
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,730
- Come and see you?
- Yes.

1792
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,540
- I'll come.
- No, don't come.

1793
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,000
- I'll watch you in person.
- Then I won't be able to work.

1794
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,940
You didn't know that about me in Italy.

1795
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,650
In Italy,
I was drawn to you instinctively.

1796
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,150
(Feeling content)

1797
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,580
For me, it was a relief.

1798
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,750
I was drawn to you instinctively,

1799
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,390
and I also thought that
you had an amazing career.

1800
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:20,200
(Embarrassed)

1801
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,470
So I was happy to see you.

1802
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,380
For you, isn't it based on your feelings?

1803
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:31,550
The feeling you get from that person.

1804
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,950
The feeling? Did I tell you?

1805
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,580
- That I consider the feeling I get?
- Yes.

1806
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:40,890
But you can't describe it in words.

1807
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:41,860
No.

1808
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,590
I hope that...

1809
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,060
you get a good feeling from me.

1810
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,370
(Nodding)

1811
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,040
That's why I kept writing your name.

1812
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,170
I'll be even better
when you see me after the show.

1813
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,610
Really?

1814
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:01,510
Yes.

1815
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,220
What do you order
when you go to the movies?

1816
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,350
- Caramel popcorn.
- Caramel popcorn?

1817
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,950
Is it squid grilled in butter?

1818
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,750
Butter squid? That's a must.

1819
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,920
- That sounds delicious.
- I always order that.

1820
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,820
Did you also play the piano
when you were a kid?

1821
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,090
Yes, up to " 30 New Studies in Technics"
by Czerny.

1822
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,360
Do you know why I played the piano?

1823
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,300
My older sister's ideal type
was a man with beautiful hands.

1824
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,330
She wanted to raise me
as a man with beautiful hands.

1825
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,400
I can tell.

1826
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:32,210
- Did you compete?
- Yes.

1827
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,010
- Did you win prizes?
- Yes.

1828
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,380
Playing the piano suits you well.

1829
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,810
Playing the violin also suits you well.

1830
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,650
Since you have a small face,
it'd be hard to rest your chin.

1831
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,950
(He starts to bombard her
with compliments again.)

1832
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,380
Were you quiet...

1833
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,380
when you were in school?

1834
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,220
I was the one who always
played buck buck during lunchtime.

1835
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:48,490
Did you like soccer?

1836
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,890
During lunchtime,
I went outside instead of eating.

1837
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,590
I played soccer barefoot.

1838
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,160
Did you wear glasses
when you were in school?

1839
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,330
Yes, have you seen me with glasses on?

1840
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:58,500
Show me.

1841
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:00,030
- What?
- You should go wearing glasses.

1842
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:01,500
I can't do that.

1843
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,840
I'll look completely different.

1844
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,510
It'd be so funny.

1845
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,710
(Laughing)

1846
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,240
Do you have a photo of when you were 20?

1847
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,180
- Are you drunk?
- Is my face red?

1848
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,280
Just a little.

1849
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,180
I look so red.

1850
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,050
(Bursting into laughter)

1851
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,420
Let's take another photo
if we get the chance.

1852
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:19,750
Before this all ends.

1853
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:24,460
That's the most meaningful thing
I got from living here.

1854
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,060
I looked at it...

1855
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,260
the most.

1856
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,310
That photo was so cute...

1857
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,540
that I couldn't stop looking.

1858
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,350
(Cheers?)

1859
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,790
Do you think
this Christmas went nicely for you?

1860
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,260
What? Yes.

1861
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,460
You think so?

1862
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,460
(Nodding)

1863
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,100
Do you think so?

1864
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,440
- Me?
- Yes.

1865
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,610
It was the best Christmas.

1866
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,440
I'm so glad that we met today
instead of yesterday.

1867
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,310
- It's so lovely.
- Right?

1868
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,080
I've been wanting to take a photo of this.

1869
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,620
It's beautiful.

1870
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:26,950
- Stand over there.
- What?

1871
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,960
- Where?
- Here.

1872
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,020
(Ji Min wants to take a photo of her
in front of the tree.)

1873
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,830
But I want to show my back.

1874
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,290
- Instead of my front.
- Sure.

1875
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:36,000
- Or my side.
- Your side?

1876
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,000
- Like this?
- That looks good.

1877
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,030
I'll take it like this.

1878
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,000
He looks like her boyfriend.

1879
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,070
Step inside.

1880
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,400
- Here?
- Yes.

1881
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,840
I'm a bit shy.

1882
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,970
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

1883
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,780
- Je Yeon.
- What?

1884
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,110
Look at me.

1885
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:52,510
- Look.
- No.

1886
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,280
(You can tell the photos are good
from the way he's smiling.)

1887
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,580
Ji Min just finds her so cute and pretty.

1888
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,920
- You look amazing.
- Really?

1889
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,920
Yes. Your face doesn't seem red at all.

1890
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,020
(Your face doesn't seem red.)

1891
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:03,960
- Look at me.
- What?

1892
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,290
- Look at me.
- I don't want to.

1893
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,560
- Just once.
- What?

1894
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,830
Just your eyes.

1895
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:09,860
(Slightly turning)

1896
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,200
(The model makes eye contact,
and the photographer goes insane.)

1897
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,900
- They look so good.
- Really?

1898
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,240
("In front of the Tree on Christmas")

1899
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,470
You look like a queen.

1900
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,270
I like this one.

1901
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,380
She's happy now.

1902
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,680
(Lovey-dovey)

1903
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:26,610
Let's ask them to take a photo of us.

1904
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,320
- What do you think?
- I love it.

1905
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,320
See?

1906
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:32,850
(This time, they take one together.)

1907
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:33,920
Come on.

1908
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,090
(This time, they take one together.)

1909
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,990
- Are you smiling?
- Yes.

1910
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,460
- You can look to the side.
- Okay.

1911
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,200
- Since you don't want to look forward.
- Okay.

1912
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,300
(Glancing)

1913
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,500
They made eye contact!

1914
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,970
You're supposed to look.

1915
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,710
Okay. I'll look straight up.

1916
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:55,180
- She said, "You're supposed to look."
- Just a few more.

1917
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:57,210
- That's so pretty.
- Beautiful.

1918
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,810
I love this photo!

1919
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:03,720
(Their cute eye contact is also in one.)

1920
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,490
You should have looked at me naturally.

1921
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:10,190
We haven't seen that one yet.
This is the one.

1922
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,830
- This is nice. Right?
- Right?

1923
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,090
This one.

1924
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,130
They even touched their hands.

1925
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,430
- This one looks nice.
- Yes.

1926
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,870
- I'll send them to you.
- Sure.

1927
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,940
Merry Christmas.

1928
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,410
- Merry Christmas.
- Careful.

1929
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,750
I think we look better together
after my haircut.

1930
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,250
Yes.

1931
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,850
What do you mean, "Yes?"

1932
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,980
You cut your hair nicely.

1933
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,320
I'll keep this haircut.

1934
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:42,790
Take more photos with me.

1935
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,760
Is this Hongdae?

1936
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,860
Yes, Hongdae.

1937
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,800
It's been so long.

1938
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,030
Have we ever walked
somewhere so noisy before?

1939
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,470
I don't think so.

1940
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,240
You guys should link arms. It's winter.

1941
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,740
(Looking closely)

1942
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:03,010
What is it?

1943
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,780
- Tell me if you feel tipsy.
- Okay.

1944
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,010
(He keeps checking on her.)

1945
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:11,080
- Do you need a hangover cure?
- A hangover cure?

1946
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,020
A hangover cure.

1947
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,150
Should we have one?

1948
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:15,720
- You're that drunk?
- No.

1949
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,760
(Laughing)

1950
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,660
We're literally on the main street
of Hongdae.

1951
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,390
Should we buy an umbrella?

1952
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,830
Should we?

1953
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,830
Why don't you lean on something here?
I'll go and get it.

1954
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:26,200
Okay.

1955
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:31,600
(Ji Min went to buy an umbrella
for the light rain.)

1956
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,410
- Ji Min is so constant.
- Indeed.

1957
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,750
(He quickly buys one
and goes back to her.)

1958
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,180
Ta-da!

1959
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:44,050
- I got the biggest one.
- Thanks.

1960
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,490
We have to walk, so...

1961
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,720
I find this pretty fun.

1962
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,390
- Don't you?
- I do.

1963
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,860
(Holding on)

1964
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:00,130
- Why? Are you getting rained on?
- No, I'm worried about slipping.

1965
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,600
Can you hold on to my elbow instead?

1966
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,100
Sure. Okay.

1967
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,940
(Two people and one umbrella)

1968
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:09,780
The rain isn't so bad.

1969
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,610
(For some reason,
the rain doesn't bother him.)

1970
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,120
This is it.

1971
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:20,720
There aren't many left.

1972
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,960
Let's buy one now.

1973
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,320
- This one.
- That's cute.

1974
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,690
- It's cute.
- It is.

1975
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,160
- Should we buy this one?
- Yes.

1976
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,190
Great.

1977
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:32,930
(They instantly chose a white cake.)

1978
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,240
- Pay it with this.
- I'll send you the money.

1979
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,640
- No, use this card.
- I didn't bring my wallet.

1980
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,710
Just use mine.

1981
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:42,140
Instead of sending me the money,
can you buy me something tasty?

1982
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,210
I will.

1983
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,640
- When?
- What?

1984
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,810
When will you buy me?

1985
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,780
- When do you want it?
- As soon as possible.

1986
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,320
As soon as possible? Okay.

1987
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,820
Something better than steak.

1988
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:54,650
(Nodding)

1989
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,390
They make such a cute couple.

1990
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,460
- When I wrote you that postcard...
- Yes?

1991
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,630
- You know, I wrote it in a rush.
- Okay.

1992
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,730
I read it again,

1993
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,100
- and it stopped way too suddenly.
- Okay.

1994
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,230
So, I regretted it.

1995
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,870
Where did it stop?

1996
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,670
It felt like I wasn't brave enough...

1997
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:16,740
to give it a proper ending.

1998
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,880
That it's always been you for me.

1999
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,580
The whole time.

2000
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,920
- I wanted to write that.
- Really?

2001
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,250
I regretted not writing that.

2002
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,560
You've always been the one for me,
Je Yeon. You know that, right?

2003
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,160
From the beginning.

2004
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:35,400
You did tell me that you regretted it,

2005
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,460
but I never expected you to rewrite it.

2006
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,700
I was so touched.

2007
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,600
Did you know I'd come?

2008
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,670
I would have gone back if you hadn't.

2009
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,740
(Scoffing)

2010
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:50,480
- Je Yeon.
- Yes?

2011
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,880
There has never been a single moment...

2012
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,150
when I didn't want you.
So, why wouldn't you believe me?

2013
01:26:58,920 --> 01:26:59,990
Nothing.

2014
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,920
There has never been a moment
when I didn't want you.

2015
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,290
What do you mean, "I don't believe you?"

2016
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,760
Is that so?

2017
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:11,930
(Bantering)

2018
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,100
But I doubt we'd have had this moment...

2019
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,140
if I hadn't done that.

2020
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:19,510
- You don't know that.
- Why not?

2021
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:21,170
But it was the same for me.

2022
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,780
I wouldn't have kept...

2023
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,680
writing your name
if I hadn't had feelings for you.

2024
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:28,480
But my interest in you from the start...

2025
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,220
Have you been interested in me
from the start?

2026
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,250
(Looking forward to her answer)

2027
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,820
What do you mean by "start?"

2028
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,090
Were you interested in me at first?
Back in Italy?

2029
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:43,300
Everyone left
such a good impression on me, so...

2030
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:44,760
I don't mean that.

2031
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:46,870
You're changing the subject again.

2032
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:52,040
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

2033
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,440
(Their memorable date
on Christmas has ended.)

2034
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,470
I did have fun.

2035
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,940
I'll remember this Christmas
for a long time.

2036
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,010
Me too.

2037
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,140
(Their memorable date
on Christmas has ended.)

2038
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,080
Good times.

2039
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,750
(Even a newlywed envies
how lovey-dovey they are.)

2040
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,020
Those two showed us...

2041
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,520
- the textbook example of a date.
- Indeed.

2042
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,090
- A typical, lovey-dovey date.
- Yes.

2043
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,190
Are we back too soon?

2044
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:15,060
(Ji Min and Je Yeon came back first
after the date.)

2045
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,860
They came back early.

2046
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,570
- Where are you going?
- What?

2047
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:21,000
I checked if there was anyone
in the living room.

2048
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,100
No one's here.

2049
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,370
(Peeking)

2050
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:27,710
What?

2051
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:28,840
- I'll come right to you.
- Okay.

2052
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,510
She seems so happy.

2053
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,520
We should be near the tree.
It's Christmas, after all.

2054
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:44,120
(The two enjoy the rest of Christmas
at home.)

2055
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,530
They seem much more comfortable
around each other.

2056
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,530
They do.

2057
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,830
Pick your favorite photo.

2058
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,700
The one from earlier.

2059
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,430
The one where we made eye contact.

2060
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,500
- Why are you hiding it?
- What?

2061
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,600
- Why are you hiding it?
- I'm not hiding it.

2062
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,940
I'm just looking at other photos. Hold on.

2063
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:02,280
She seems shy.

2064
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,540
(Staring)

2065
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,710
It's just...

2066
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,850
(Looking)

2067
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,320
- He pulled her.
- This one looks nice.

2068
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,590
You look like a total girlfriend.

2069
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,690
- Right?
- Yes.

2070
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:18,930
This one.

2071
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:22,360
(Finding her cute)

2072
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,360
This is the one.

2073
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,530
- I love this one.
- Yes.

2074
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:28,100
- It's that one, right?
- Oh, my.

2075
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,240
All the photos after this one are nice.

2076
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:33,170
I like the one where you're smiling.

2077
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:35,270
- This looks awesome.
- Yes.

2078
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,780
Why are you clicking the heart
on everything?

2079
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,850
(Flustered)

2080
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:49,090
You're supposed to click the heart
on the photos you like.

2081
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,560
I believe...

2082
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,290
Je Yeon fell for Ji Min...

2083
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:55,430
with the smile he gave
when he found her cute.

2084
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,460
Exactly.

2085
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,530
It makes you feel so loved.

2086
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:01,830
She looks so happy.

2087
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,040
(Embarrassed)

2088
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,140
Ji Min can't stop smiling.

2089
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:10,480
But the restaurants
must have closed early.

2090
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,150
Has everyone gone to the next place?

2091
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,750
That...

2092
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:20,450
makes things unfair for us.

2093
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,620
(Laughing)

2094
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,090
We can't eat any more today.

2095
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,290
Should we have Chapagetti
before bed tomorrow?

2096
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:27,430
- Chapagetti?
- I'm so good at making it.

2097
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:28,430
Why not today?

2098
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,200
- She's so cute.
- Do you want one now?

2099
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,270
- Are we allowed to eat now?
- Yes.

2100
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:37,170
- I'm so confident, though.
- I do want Chapagetti.

2101
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:38,810
- Should we share just one bag?
- Should we?

2102
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,170
(Let's do it.)

2103
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:45,780
Chapagetti sounds so good.
It's been so long since I had it.

2104
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:54,390
Wait in your seat.

2105
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,860
- You don't need my help?
- No.

2106
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,430
Okay.

2107
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:03,500
What if I want more while I'm making one?

2108
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,100
No. I shouldn't eat too much. I can't.

2109
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,100
Should we cook two?

2110
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,940
Two bags.

2111
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:13,270
(Staring)

2112
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:15,070
Two?

2113
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,180
Je Yeon seems more energetic.

2114
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,450
You're very eager.

2115
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,590
(She washes the dishes,
and he cooks Chapagetti.)

2116
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,960
Aren't you tired?

2117
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,190
What? No.

2118
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,960
- Are you?
- No.

2119
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,030
I'm fine too.

2120
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,600
(Smiling)

2121
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:42,000
Coming through.

2122
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,140
(Pouring out the water)

2123
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:59,320
(He adds the soup powder...)

2124
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,920
(and stirs it.)

2125
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,090
(Looking)

2126
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,290
(Focused)

2127
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:14,030
(Their Chapagetti is ready.)

2128
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,540
- I normally boil it down.
- What's that?

2129
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,310
(In awe)

2130
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,980
It smells so good.

2131
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,510
- Let's eat.
- It looks scrumptious.

2132
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:30,480
- Don't be too surprised.
- What?

2133
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,290
Don't be too surprised.

2134
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,850
You should have this one.

2135
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,320
It's got more sauce.

2136
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,130
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2137
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:45,160
(Giving her kimchi first)

2138
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,770
He's giving her kimchi next to her.

2139
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,270
It must be so tasty.

2140
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:54,070
It's so good.

2141
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,140
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

2142
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:56,710
(Proud)

2143
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:59,450
It's been so long
since I last had instant food.

2144
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:02,550
No, it's good because I cooked it well.

2145
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:03,550
You're right.

2146
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,090
- So cute.
- You cooked it really well.

2147
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:12,430
(A big bite)

2148
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,070
He's happy again.

2149
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:21,400
(Ji Min just can't hide his feelings.)

2150
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,440
Exactly.

2151
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:24,100
- Give me the bowl.
- Okay.

2152
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:27,210
He's giving her more
since she's enjoying it.

2153
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:28,340
It's good they cooked two bags.

2154
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:29,340
(Her eyes are focused.)

2155
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,740
It's good we cooked two bags.

2156
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,210
- If we had only cooked one...
- We would have regretted it.

2157
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,120
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.

2158
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,620
- It's nice and comfortable.
- What?

2159
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:46,990
I feel so comfortable.

2160
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,060
- What?
- I looked because you were pretty.

2161
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,000
You say I'm pretty
every time you get the chance.

2162
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:56,670
Are you my dad?

2163
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:58,970
(Chang Hwan and Soo Ah are back.)

2164
01:33:58,970 --> 01:33:59,970
(They also have a good vibe.)

2165
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:01,310
He said,
"I looked because you were pretty."

2166
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:03,680
I like how Chang Hwan expresses things.

2167
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:05,440
Who are they?

2168
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:07,450
- Hi.
- Who's here?

2169
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:08,480
Hey, guys.

2170
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,220
- Did you cook Chapagetti?
- Yes.

2171
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,220
Do you want me to cook one?

2172
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,620
We went to a Christmas market
in Gwanghwamun.

2173
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:16,420
- That must have been so fun.
- We bought a few things.

2174
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,760
(The couples come back 1 by 1.)

2175
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,790
Didn't you guys...

2176
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:24,130
Hi.

2177
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,900
- Hi!
- We're back.

2178
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,270
- Hello.
- We guessed correctly.

2179
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,000
We guessed correctly.

2180
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,100
Did you?

2181
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,840
- Is there only one couple left?
- Yes.

2182
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:40,480
(The night of Christmas goes by.)

2183
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:42,680
There was a bonfire,
so we could stare at it.

2184
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,920
Right. A bonfire.

2185
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,220
- That sounds like fun.
- We had a bonfire.

2186
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:48,220
- And it snowed all of a sudden.
- And we roasted marshmallows.

2187
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,990
It rained where we were.

2188
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,990
- It was lovely.
- Really?

2189
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:52,320
- We had wet snow.
- I didn't know there was such a place.

2190
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,490
- It was like hail.
- Right.

2191
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:55,930
We're back.

2192
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:57,030
(The last couple finally arrived.)

2193
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:58,560
I hope we're last.

2194
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,670
- What? Where is everyone?
- It's quiet.

2195
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:03,640
Right? I don't think anyone's here.

2196
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,700
I hear them.

2197
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:07,770
You're right.

2198
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,140
- Hi!
- Hi!

2199
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,840
- Do we have any chairs?
- What did you guys get?

2200
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,480
- Where did you go today?
- Us?

2201
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,620
- What did you do?
- We just ate in Sangsu.

2202
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,020
Who did you go on a date with?

2203
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:20,920
- Je Yeon.
- I see. Where did you go?

2204
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:27,430
(Their text messages arrived.)

2205
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,030
They told us to send the text by tomorrow.

2206
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:38,140
It's a home date.

2207
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,910
"A private home date."

2208
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:40,970
(Home Date Announcement)

2209
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,640
I guess there's a separate house.

2210
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,010
They're staying out overnight?

2211
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,350
Until one o'clock?

2212
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,550
- No way!
- You guessed wrong.

2213
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:53,550
I did.

2214
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:56,120
Where do the ones who aren't matched stay?

2215
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,590
Probably this house.

2216
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,090
Yes,
our final selection is on Friday night.

2217
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,830
Before the final selection
on Heart Pairing,

2218
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:06,830
the residents have
the final event waiting for them.

2219
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:08,770
This time,
it won't be in the Pairing House.

2220
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,940
There will be a sweet home just for them.

2221
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,940
- Oh, no.
- This is wild.

2222
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,210
This is going to change so many things!

2223
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:15,370
They're sleeping together.

2224
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,180
Yes. They're sleeping out.

2225
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,410
- Sleeping out.
- Sleeping out.

2226
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:20,210
- Yes, that's a great way to put it.
- They're sleeping out.

2227
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:22,080
- In a separate house.
- Yes.

2228
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,150
- Like staying at a hotel.
- Yes.

2229
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,720
This one is intense, though.

2230
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:28,090
They're going to experience
what it's like to be married.

2231
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:29,090
Exactly.

2232
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,660
What is this about?

2233
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,130
- What's this?
- What?

2234
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,260
What does this mean?

2235
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,970
I was going to go to bed,

2236
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:43,040
but the text message was so flustering.

2237
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:48,670
We have to be paired up.

2238
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:50,910
Yes. This is tough.

2239
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:51,940
(Looking)

2240
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:52,980
This is getting interesting.

2241
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:57,050
(What outcome
will this announcement bring?)

2242
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,480
This is a tough one.

2243
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:06,660
(Pondering)

2244
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,260
I wonder who Je Yeon picked.

2245
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,460
(Jumping up)

2246
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,400
- Ji Won.
- Yes? What do we do?

2247
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,540
Come with me.

2248
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,870
- What do we do?
- Come here.

2249
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,110
Have you made up your mind?

2250
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:39,090
(Sang Yun goes upstairs.)

2251
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,630
(Knocking)

2252
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:46,700
Who could it be?

2253
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:52,970
What?

2254
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:54,940
Did you take a shower?

2255
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,710
No, I was chatting with Ha Neul.

2256
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:57,940
What did you talk about?

2257
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,880
About what we're doing tomorrow and such.

2258
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:01,880
I see.

2259
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,920
(Shocked)

2260
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,790
Sang Yun?

2261
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:09,120
(Sang Yun?)

2262
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,660
Right.

2263
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,190
That was why I wanted to see you.

2264
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:18,300
It'll be our last time.

2265
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,440
I did some thinking.

2266
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:38,480
I'm going to write your name.

2267
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:41,350
(She's out of the frame.)

2268
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,590
(What's going on?)

2269
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:46,390
(Speechless)

2270
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,160
I'm going to write your name.

2271
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,470
- Really?
- Yes.

2272
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,340
- Out of the blue?
- That's...

2273
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:59,410
just what I think.

2274
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,610
Chae Eun must be in a dilemma.

2275
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,450
I enjoyed my time with you.

2276
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:09,880
It was fun.

2277
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,550
I'm in a really tough spot right now.

2278
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,860
That wasn't my intention.

2279
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,090
(Getting up)

2280
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,890
Can he hear them?

2281
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:25,830
(Glancing)

2282
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:30,300
Either way, both of us need to leave
tomorrow morning.

2283
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:31,300
Right.

2284
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:36,440
I didn't think we'd have time
to consider in the morning.

2285
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:42,850
- Can he hear them?
- He's heading over.

2286
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:47,290
Everyone is all over the place
and can't fall asleep.

2287
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:48,320
He heard everything.

2288
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,990
I can't sleep. I'm getting some water.

2289
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:54,930
- Oh, no.
- To think that'd happen.

2290
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:55,930
(Glancing)

2291
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:58,400
I won't get any sleep tonight.

2292
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:02,430
- But you must.
- You made it so that I can't.

2293
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:05,200
- We need to sleep.
- What now?

2294
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:11,910
What's worse is that Chan Hyeong
just passed by.

2295
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:14,310
(Chan Hyeong passed by the two.)

2296
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:28,530
(Glancing)

2297
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:30,130
(Je Yeon also passes by the two.)

2298
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,400
This is bad.

2299
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,600
Sang Yun's expression
is changing slightly.

2300
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:45,410
I didn't call you out to hear your answer.

2301
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:46,550
- I know.
- I just...

2302
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:48,180
I know that.

2303
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:50,020
Okay.

2304
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,090
Think about it.

2305
01:40:58,490 --> 01:40:59,930
(Nodding)

2306
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:01,460
The home date is big.

2307
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,730
(Surprised)

2308
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,600
What a twist.

2309
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:10,800
That just now between Sang Yun
and Chae Eun was intense.

2310
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,270
(After a storm has passed,)

2311
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:16,840
(Chan Hyeong is in the kitchen all alone.)

2312
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:23,920
Chan Hyeong is also sensitive.

2313
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:35,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

2314
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,430
- You go to work tomorrow, right?
- Yes.

2315
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,030
That was why I went to bed early.

2316
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,600
But this is no time to sleep.

2317
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,570
Because of the others?

2318
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:47,970
Yes, since they're walking around.

2319
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:48,970
I see.

2320
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:53,410
Tomorrow will be tiring.

2321
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:55,080
But it can't be helped.

2322
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:58,020
Wasn't it hard living here?

2323
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,990
Mentally and such.

2324
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:02,050
- While you were here.
- While I was here?

2325
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:03,220
It was hard.

2326
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:09,060
Everyone...
Well, not necessarily everyone,

2327
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:12,870
- but they thought I had it easy.
- Really?

2328
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:14,930
- Me.
- I see.

2329
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:19,770
If I were more physically fit
during this show,

2330
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:23,810
- Would it have been better?
- it would've been better,

2331
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:25,880
and I would've been less stressed out.

2332
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:27,850
But it's the opposite.

2333
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,220
That's making me stress out more.

2334
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,280
I get it.

2335
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,690
We have three days left now.

2336
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:37,090
- That's not long.
- For real.

2337
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,060
He must have a lot on his mind.

2338
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:41,530
Did you pick a partner for tomorrow?

2339
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:43,200
- My partner for tomorrow?
- Yes.

2340
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,900
- I have to decide by 2 p.m. tomorrow.
- Yes.

2341
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,270
By 2 p.m.

2342
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,170
It'll be tough,
but good luck to us with the decision.

2343
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,240
Yes.

2344
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:55,910
Right.

2345
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,910
- Go to sleep.
- Good luck...

2346
01:42:58,910 --> 01:43:00,250
- Yes.
- until the end.

2347
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:02,050
- Let's do our best.
- Of course.

2348
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,020
(Stopping)

2349
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:15,390
(Chan Hyeong,
who was returning to his room,)

2350
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:18,230
(heads to Chae Eun's room.)

2351
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,330
(Hesitating)

2352
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:21,900
Don't just stand there and do nothing.

2353
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,070
You must go to Chae Eun.

2354
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:25,570
(He plucks up the courage.)

2355
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:27,070
Yes, go to her.

2356
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:32,340
(Knocking)

2357
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,080
Aren't you exhausted?

2358
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:36,420
I am.

2359
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,880
But I was in no situation to sleep.

2360
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,190
We were loud, weren't we?

2361
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:42,390
We must've been loud.

2362
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,460
I came out for some water,

2363
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:49,760
and everyone was awake.

2364
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,830
On my way...

2365
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:57,800
to the kitchen earlier,

2366
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,670
I saw you talking seriously with Sang Yun.

2367
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:05,410
Sang Yun...

2368
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,080
I think...

2369
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:13,950
his mind has changed quite a bit.

2370
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:15,390
His mind changed?

2371
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:18,490
Like how?

2372
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:20,990
In his decision-making.

2373
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:27,700
- He switched paths?
- Yes.

2374
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,140
To you?

2375
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:37,510
Sang Yun wanted to tell me that.

2376
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:42,280
Did you already choose?

2377
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,020
- Me?
- Yes.

2378
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,350
I haven't sent the text message yet.

2379
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:50,320
It must've been
a really hard decision for you.

2380
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,060
Honestly,

2381
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,560
I was...

2382
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,700
almost certain about my decision.

2383
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,270
I see.

2384
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:11,510
Same here. I was too.

2385
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:14,480
Really? Oh, dear.

2386
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:22,690
But out of the blue like this...

2387
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,490
I know.

2388
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,300
- I get it.
- Goodness.

2389
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:41,670
It's obviously your decision to make.

2390
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:45,210
I wasn't trying to put any pressure...

2391
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:46,880
on you.

2392
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:51,780
I was simply curious and asked.

2393
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:56,050
It's just...

2394
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:00,530
In a way, I didn't think much about it.

2395
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:03,930
I must've assumed it was a given.

2396
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:08,070
I think the two were certain
about each other.

2397
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,200
But...

2398
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:13,340
I'm suddenly thinking
the situation might change.

2399
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:19,180
It must be tough on Chae Eun.

2400
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:23,050
Take it easy.

2401
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:29,490
Don't think about it too much.

2402
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,860
Don't get stressed out from contemplating.

2403
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:34,360
Whatever decision you make,

2404
01:46:34,630 --> 01:46:36,660
it should be for your sake.

2405
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:43,030
Thanks.

2406
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,540
Okay?

2407
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:50,840
- Good night.
- Good night.

2408
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,310
(Good night.)

2409
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:55,750
Don't think too much. Take it easy.

2410
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:57,220
No pressure.

2411
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:11,760
(It's not over yet.)

2412
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,270
(Faced with a new dilemma,)

2413
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:22,440
(who will Chae Eun choose?)

2414
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:28,750
(The night of Christmas grows deeper.)

2415
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:31,280
Okay. It's not over until it's over.

2416
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,550
Personally,

2417
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:34,150
Sang Yun's moves...

2418
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:35,320
are right up my alley.

2419
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:39,290
I put myself in Sang Yun's shoes
and thought...

2420
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:44,300
he must've decided
not to waste his time on someone...

2421
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,360
who keeps being wishy-washy.

2422
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:48,070
Chae Eun's thoughtful order...

2423
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:51,070
or style of conversation might have...

2424
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:52,500
comforted Sang Yun.

2425
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,040
- "Comfort" is really the right word here.
- Right?

2426
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:57,440
From what I see, Sang Yun...

2427
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,280
did indeed see Chae Eun
as a nice person...

2428
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:02,150
and was comforted by her.

2429
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,020
But when he talked about his worries
to Je Yeon,

2430
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:07,990
I could feel his feelings for her.

2431
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:11,660
Sang Yun wanting to write Chae Eun
as his home date partner is fine.

2432
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:13,930
But giving Chae Eun a heads-up...

2433
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:15,560
- It's a sudden turn.
- Exactly.

2434
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,530
- It's a quick turn.
- I think...

2435
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:19,400
there was a turning point.

2436
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,530
Ji Min has a great presence.

2437
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:25,540
He must feel left out
because of how lovey-dovey the two were.

2438
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,410
But Chae Eun...

2439
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:29,570
continues to listen
to Sang Yun's feelings.

2440
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:32,940
If I were Sang Yun...

2441
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:36,780
and felt, whether directly or indirectly,

2442
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:38,950
how much Je Yeon missed Ji Min,

2443
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:40,220
I, too,

2444
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,450
would be standing at a crossroads.

2445
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:44,290
Sang Yun saw Je Yeon in chaos
because of Ji Min.

2446
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:45,520
- He did.
- Right?

2447
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,690
- Now then,
- Gosh.

2448
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:48,190
- How intense.
- we will deduce...

2449
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:51,030
who the male and female residents chose...

2450
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:52,860
- as their home date partner.
- I don't know.

2451
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:54,100
It's an individual match.

2452
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,230
Okay. Woo Jae is easy, right?

2453
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:57,500
- Yes.
- Totally.

2454
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,970
- Yes.
- Draw Woo Jae's line.

2455
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:01,240
Ji Min is easy too.

2456
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,480
Ji Min will choose Je Yeon.

2457
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:05,310
- Isn't Chan Hyeong also easy?
- Isn't Chan Hyeong easy?

2458
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:06,310
- Yes.
- Yes.

2459
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:07,450
I think...

2460
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,310
You can deal with your own dilemma.

2461
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,550
I...

2462
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,580
Listen. Chan Hyeong's...

2463
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,850
expression earlier
seemed like he was hurt.

2464
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:17,460
I've never seen Chan Hyeong
make such an expression before.

2465
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:19,360
I think he'll choose Ha Neul.

2466
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,430
I drew my line.

2467
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:21,860
I drew it to Ha Neul.

2468
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:24,030
- I agree it's Ha Neul.
- Because of that expression?

2469
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:27,430
Here's why. Earlier, Chae Eun said,

2470
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:29,870
"I was almost certain about my decision."

2471
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:31,940
- Exactly.
- With that, his expression changed.

2472
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,240
- Really?
- Yes.

2473
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,510
- He could've shut his heart.
- It must've hurt him.

2474
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:37,280
If you like someone,
you must lower yourself.

2475
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,310
- Yes.
- I agree.

2476
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,980
- Stand on your pride,
- Yes?

2477
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:41,080
- and you'll lose everything.
- True.

2478
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:42,610
That was a golden saying.

2479
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:44,580
"If you like someone,
you must lower yourself."

2480
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:46,320
The other party will think of it...

2481
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,450
- as lovely.
- Of course.

2482
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:48,790
- Really?
- Yes.

2483
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,360
Chang Hwan is easy, right?

2484
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:51,820
Chang Hwan is easy.

2485
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:53,530
Sang Yun gave us a heads-up.

2486
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:55,360
He did.
Not writing her name would be problematic.

2487
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,130
Sang Yun has to write her name
after what he has said.

2488
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:59,460
Sang Yun said he would write
Chae Eun's name.

2489
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:01,030
- Was he lying?
- Was it a trick?

2490
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:03,200
It will be weird
if Sang Yun writes Je Yeon's name.

2491
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,600
Sang Yun. You shouldn't fool us
after what you've done.

2492
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:08,240
- I'm with Paul today.
- To Ha Neul.

2493
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,340
Our arrows point differently
for Chan Hyeong.

2494
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:12,080
As for the female residents,
let's start with Ji Won.

2495
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,750
- Ji Won? Okay.
- Ji Won is...

2496
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:16,010
Isn't Soo Ah confusing?

2497
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,450
- Soo Ah is tough?
- Yes.

2498
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,980
(Laughing)

2499
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:21,420
No. When Soo Ah had a meal with Ji Min,

2500
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:23,360
she noticed Ji Min was suffering.

2501
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,060
- So she wouldn't choose Ji Min?
- Okay.

2502
01:50:25,290 --> 01:50:26,420
What about Ha Neul?

2503
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,590
- I think she'll choose Chan Hyeong.
- Chan Hyeong.

2504
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:30,300
- Chan Hyeong.
- I think it'll be Chan Hyeong.

2505
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:31,760
- Ha Neul...
- I think...

2506
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,000
Ha Neul might write Ji Min
as it's the last date,

2507
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,200
even if it doesn't work out.

2508
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,740
I choose Ji Min.

2509
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:39,200
Because she's fine
even if they don't have a date?

2510
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,970
To think Chae Eun...

2511
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,910
- would give us a headache.
- Exactly.

2512
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:45,280
- Chae Eun and Sang Yun?
- No.

2513
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,340
- Chan Hyeong.
- Chan Hyeong.

2514
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,410
You think she'll choose Chan Hyeong?

2515
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:48,980
- I'm thinking Sang Yun.
- What?

2516
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,550
- I'm actually not good at guessing.
- Is that so?

2517
01:50:51,650 --> 01:50:53,850
- That's a relief.
- I think she'll choose Chan Hyeong.

2518
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:56,120
If I think back to her conversation
with her twin sister.

2519
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,590
And Chan Hyeong will cry.

2520
01:50:58,190 --> 01:50:59,220
Their home date...

2521
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:01,290
We'll be able to witness
a very joyful home date.

2522
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:02,530
- I hope so.
- And...

2523
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,860
- I think Je Yeon will choose Sang Yun.
- Same here.

2524
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:06,330
But if she doesn't write Ji Min,

2525
01:51:06,330 --> 01:51:07,530
it'll be the end of the two.

2526
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:08,570
- And...
- Ji Min...

2527
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:10,970
Didn't Je Yeon see
Sang Yun and Chae Eun...

2528
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,400
- talk?
- She did.

2529
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,710
- Right?
- Yes.

2530
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:15,370
I'll go with my wish.

2531
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,340
I'll choose with a happy ending in mind.

2532
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,980
- Here's the problematic part.
- I'm all set.

2533
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,450
If they don't get paired,

2534
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,980
everyone must see each other at home.

2535
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,720
(Screaming)

2536
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,020
They would be like,
"Why didn't you write me?"

2537
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:30,160
- Whatever.
- Let's see the answer.

2538
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,290
We'll start with
the male residents' choices.

2539
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:35,590
- Firstly, who did Woo Jae choose?
- Oh, gosh.

2540
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:37,230
There's only one answer.

2541
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,400
Let's go.

2542
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,070
(Heart Pairing Love Line)

2543
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,430
(Woo Jae chose Ji Won.)

2544
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:42,500
- I knew it.
- Correct.

2545
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,300
Next is Chang Hwan's choice.

2546
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,440
(Will he choose Soo Ah, the one
he shared a breath of fresh air with?)

2547
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,580
Chang Hwan and Soo Ah.

2548
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:55,250
(Chang Hwan chose Soo Ah.)

2549
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:57,420
Who did Ji Min choose?

2550
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:02,450
(It was you all along.)

2551
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:03,590
This one is...

2552
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:04,760
It's clear.

2553
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:08,060
(Ji Min chose Je Yeon.)

2554
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,960
All male residents are straightforward.

2555
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,030
And...

2556
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,600
Sang Yun's choice.

2557
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:15,070
(Chae Eun, whom he could relax around?)

2558
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,870
(Je Yeon, who makes him nervous?)

2559
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,800
If not, it'd be a scandal.

2560
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:23,710
(Sang Yun chose Chae Eun.)

2561
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:24,910
- Of course.
- Okay.

2562
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,880
Next is Chan Hyeong.

2563
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,150
- Please. Seriously.
- For real.

2564
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:29,680
- Gosh.
- Did he really get upset back there?

2565
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,850
You chose Ha Neul for Chan Hyeong, right?

2566
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,580
That would be really mean of Chan Hyeong.

2567
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:34,590
- His awkward smile meant...
- He got hurt.

2568
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:36,120
Who did Chan Hyeong choose?

2569
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,890
(Did he turn to Ha Neul?)

2570
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:42,690
(Did he go all in on Chae Eun?)

2571
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:44,600
- Don't tell me...
- No way.

2572
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:46,500
Please.

2573
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,940
(Chan Hyeong chose Chae Eun.)

2574
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,240
- Chae Eun.
- That was nerve-racking.

2575
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,570
- Of course.
- Chan Hyeong.

2576
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:56,070
- Chan Hyeong is not that kind of guy.
- Exactly.

2577
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:58,310
- No, he's not.
- Paul, you were...

2578
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:00,880
- He's right. You went too far.
- Paul...

2579
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,850
- underestimated Chan Hyeong.
- Right?

2580
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:05,020
- That's not good, is it?
- No.

2581
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,920
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

2582
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:09,350
The results for the female residents...

2583
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:10,490
will...

2584
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:13,560
- not be revealed at this time.
- Come on.

2585
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:15,830
We'll check it out next week.

2586
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:18,160
This is terrible.
Heart Pairing is terrible.

2587
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,900
Kim Seong Ju should be the MC.

2588
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,270
(Enjoying the teasing)

2589
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:23,470
- This...
- It will be revealed in 60 seconds.

2590
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:24,600
Paul has to leave now.

2591
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:27,140
How am I supposed to leave
without knowing the result?

2592
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,240
Oh, no.

2593
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:32,180
How about we rank who is the cleanest...

2594
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,410
- among the guys?
- I'm in.

2595
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:36,920
But I've never been to Sang Yun's room.

2596
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:38,950
I've been there, and it was squeaky clean.

2597
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:41,320
So he's in first place.

2598
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:42,920
- Sang Yun is in first place?
- Yes.

2599
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,160
Our floor looks dirty.
How about we clean it?

2600
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:48,430
Hello, Rocky.

2601
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:50,260
Yes, I'm right here.

2602
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,660
Start cleaning.

2603
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,470
Okay, I will start cleaning.

2604
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:58,570
(Thorough)

2605
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,410
That's so cool.

2606
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:02,410
It's moving around really well
all on its own.

2607
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:04,110
Right? And it's cute.

2608
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:07,180
(Clean)

2609
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:13,650
(All done cleaning)

2610
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:16,290
(Unlike anything they've imagined)

2611
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:18,320
(A home date with just the two)

2612
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,430
I did think I wouldn't get paired.

2613
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:24,930
(The more desperate the feelings,
the more complicated they become.)

2614
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,000
(A moment to truly understand
my own heart.)

2615
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:33,970
(More carefully than ever)

2616
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,810
(Or...)

2617
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:38,680
(without hesitation)

2618
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:40,980
(She spots him.)

2619
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:43,880
What a surprise.

2620
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:47,920
(A day with just the two of us)

2621
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,490
I'm not going to sleep.

2622
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,990
I hope we last for a long time.

2623
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:57,360
(Will we be able to share
another moment like this?)

2624
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,300
(One day before the final decision)

2625
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:00,830
Talk about what?

2626
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:02,930
This will be our last time...

2627
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,140
in this house.

2628
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,840
- It works.
- Ji Min. Do you mind?

2629
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:10,070
- What is it?
- Can we talk?

2630
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:14,550
What is it?

2631
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:16,950
I should tell you now, even if it's late.

2632
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,690
I know that...

2633
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:22,320
it was really tough.

2634
01:55:24,190 --> 01:55:25,290
Do you see it?
