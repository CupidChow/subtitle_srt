At 12,

the feeling of home.

But in this world, apart from the fires of the battlefield,

113

there are also hearth fires of ordinary homes.

It would at least make it a bit warmer,

You can't see anything once you're asleep anyway.

124

It's a waste of effort.

125
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,480
Precisely because it's a place to sleep,

126
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,830
it should be warmer.

I immediately took a liking to it.

177
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,120
I think it suits you perfectly.

178
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,300
It's for...

179
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,630
It's for me?

180
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,780
You're always in a military uniform.

181
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,660
I think

182
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,400
only this plain jade hairpin

183
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,090
wouldn't look awkward on you.

184
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
You don't like it?

185
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,350
It's ugly.

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,550
It's not ugly.

187
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,200
You're beautiful anyway.

188
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,990
Don't take it off.

189
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,260
This is the first time I've given someone a gift.

190
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,040
Thanks for indulging me.

[Jing'an Bookstore]

Why did you stop?

193
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,880
Don't you like biographies?

194
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,310
A bookstore this big

195
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
must have everything.

196
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,510
If you find the ones you like,

197
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,470
you won't have to trouble Su Muyang

198

to search everywhere.

199
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
I noticed that you didn't even touch the biographies

200

he gave you last time.

201
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,320
Whether he really betrayed you

202
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,910
or

203
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,170
was genuinely forced by circumstances,

204
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,260
I guess now

205
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,270
you just don't want anything

to do with him.

207
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,550
It's not that.

00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Really.

209
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
I just...

don't like biographies anymore.

211
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,990
I thought if I bought more biographies,

212
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,910
you could forget the past

213
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,200
and enjoy reading.

214
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,610
But since you don't like them anymore,

215
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,410
just forget it.

216
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,050

[The Beauty of Hell: The Legend of Li Shuang]

So it seems you really are,

241
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,820
as the book says,

242
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,240
cunning

243
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,240
and two-faced.

The Beauty of Hell?

245
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,840
I was wondering

246
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,170
who came up with that name

247
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,270
and who spread

248
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,190
all these stories.

249
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,720
The book also says

250
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,560
you ate many children

251
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,570
to perfect your martial arts.

252
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,870
Is that true?

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,200
It's all true.

254
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,120
In fact,

255
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,150
not only do I love eating children,

256
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,390
I also like

257
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,630
eating fair-skinned young men.

258
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,610
Are you scared?

259
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,290
Not at all.

260
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,630
I actually think

261
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,080
these absurd stories

262
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,710
make you even more alive.

263
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,480
Ever since I met you,

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,120
you've always kept a stern face,

being cautious

266
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,960
and thoughtful.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
Being serious all the time is exhausting.

268
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,570
I think you could learn from your brother.

269
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,140
Being carefree

270

and lighthearted

271
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,360
isn't so bad, is it?

272
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,960
Mind your own business.

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,690
These bizarre storiesâ€¦

Some say I kill without mercy,

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,860
and some say I care for the people.

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360

You wouldn't understand anyway.

younger brother of Duan Aoze, the Emperor of Benevolence of Yao State.

He is titled Prince Annan.

He is extraordinarily wise and a masterful commander,

to fight them outside the city.

309

The Taijin Army has marched a long way

and urgently needs a victory to boost morale.

311

They will be impatient in battle.

312

It's the rainy season,

313
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,750
and they're not accustomed to the environment,

314

which is depleting their forces.

not attack.

In the Battle of Jiyang,

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,370
Taijin suffered a crushing defeat,

322
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,340
which soon became legendary.

323
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,090
At court, he excels in both civil and military affairs,

324
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,510
and in private life, he displays remarkable grace,

Its spine is as hard as rock,

328
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,110
and its blade is sharp and bright.

329
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,110
It's a fine sword.

330
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,350
But what a pityâ€”

331
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,900
rigid things break easily.

332
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Humans are like this,

333
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,250
and so are swords.

334
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,930
Forgive me, Prince Annan.

335
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,390
Forgive me, Prince Annan!

336

Your sword-forging skills are not yet up to par.

337
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,990
You should practice more when you return.

Sir,

339
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,420
are you from Yao State?

340
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,880
The Master has quite an unpredictable temperament.

341
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,940
Sometimes he goes out without notice

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,370
and won't return for half a month.

343
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Why do you have to waste your time waiting here?

344
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,750
Is that so?

345

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,160
on the first and fifteenth of every month.

348
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,490
Today is the fifteenth.

349
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,030
Just now, when I arrived,

350
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,690
I saw the carriage at the gate.

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,750
The Master must have gone

352
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,550
on foot today for his health.

353
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,240
So that means

354
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,900
Mr. Zang is still in the city.

355
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll go find him.

356
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,210
Miss.

357
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,550
You may leave.

358
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,750
Yes.

359
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,920
General Li,

360
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,310
I didn't show myself simply because I didn't want to see you.

361
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,160
How did you even become a general

362
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,420
with such poor social awareness?

363
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,310
This way, sir.

364
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,000
Thank you.

365
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,030
After you.

366
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,980
You know me?

367
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,740
You really don't remember me?

368
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,240
Fine.

369
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I've been searching for you in vain.

370
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Do you have

371
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,360
a flame-shaped mark

372
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,390
on your back?

373
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,800
I served you three pots of tea within two hours.

374
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,440
I've fulfilled my hostly duties.

375
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,270
Now that you've seen me,

376
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,830
please leave.

377
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,000
Mr. Zang,

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
you haven't even asked my purpose for coming

379
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,490
and you're already asking me to leave?

380
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,490
You are a general of Taijin.

381
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,080
You can't possibly be here to do business with me, can you?

382
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,400
Exactly.

383
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,480
That's exactly why I'm here.

384
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,400
For the next three years,

385
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,790
all food, clothing, and supplies for the Changfeng Army

386
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,640
will be purchased from Ninglan.

387
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,750
What do you think?

388
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,200
General Li,

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,480
Ninglan may be small,

390
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,880
but its main business is trade.

391
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Money is the last thing it lacks.

392
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,550
From what I know,

393
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,110
you've always been frugalâ€”

394
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,160
even when staying at an inn.

395
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,110
Three years of procurementâ€”

396
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,830
this profit probably wouldn't even match

397
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,040
the value of your head.

398
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,590
If I had put something in this tea,

399
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,500
you would already have been sent

400
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,150
to the capital of Yao State.

401
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,510
Don't worry.

402
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,270
I have no intention of taking this reward.

403
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,200
I only want to make my stance clearâ€”

404
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,270
Ninglan has always kept to itself

405
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,830
and never involved itself in disputes between the two countries.

406
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,350
Please don't waste your time here.

407
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
You have been implanted

408
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,670
with dark magic.

409
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,510
This magic

410
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,030
is activated by blood.

411
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,350
Once the blood pact is established,

412
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,860
you would gain immense power and serve your master with unwavering loyalty.

413
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,000
Why should I believe you?

414
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,180
With so many people in Yao State,

415
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,210
why was I chosen?

416
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,590
Because you've had exceptional physical qualities since childhood

417
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,510
and are a rare martial arts prodigy,

418
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,160
you're naturally one in a million.

419
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,780
She keeps you by her side

420
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,660
to use you,

421
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,030
to turn you into

422
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,200
a bloodthirsty beast.

423
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,260
Before, when I was lost in the wild,

424
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,140
it was Li Shuang who saved me.

425
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,330
Besides,

426
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,030
if she really had ulterior motives,

427
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,030
why would she have sent me away back then?

428
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,830
Then why don't you consider why,

429
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,670
when you were lost,

430
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,270
it just so happened that Li Shuang

431
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,150
appeared by your side?

432
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,050
She's the mastermind behind all this.

433
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,650
She knows you are bound by the blood pact

434
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
and cannot leave her.

435
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,050
The reason she repeatedly pushes you away

436
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,510
was to tame you,

437
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,870
so you would willingly

438
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,590
be under her control.

439
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
Isn't that right?

440
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,170
I understand

441
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
you do not

442
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,130
want to bring trouble upon yourself.

443
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,000
But sometimes,

444
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,690
trouble comes to you

445
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,030
whether you want it or not.

446
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,550
As long as I maintain neutrality,

447
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,270
both Yao State and Taijin will be my backers.

448
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,830
I am not afraid of trouble.

449
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,680
General Li,

450
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,310
please leave.

451
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,800
Mr. Zang,

452
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,480
you're well-informed

453
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,380
and good at business,

454
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,400
but you can't protect yourself.

455
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,920
Now that

456
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,040
Yao State has a new ruler,

457
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,000
the whole situation has drastically changed.

458
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,730
If war breaks out in the future,

459
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,960
they won't keep their promises

460
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,220
like Prince Annan did.

461
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,720
The Changfeng Army

462
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,660
can ensure Ninglan's safety.

463
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,960
I won't interfere with your trade.

464
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,510
What I want is simpleâ€”

465
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,790
a map of Ninglan

466
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,580
in your hands.

467
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,230
Thank you for telling me.

468
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,150
But Li Shuang and I

469
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,560
have faced death together before.

470
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,400
I know her,

471
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,920
and I trust her.

472
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
How ridiculous.

473
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,810
I'm just afraid you've misplaced your trust.

474
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,870
She came to Ninglan

475
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
under the pretense of official business,

476
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,590
but in reality, she's investigating your background.

477
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,520
Unfortunately,

478
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,480
you're completely in the dark about it.

479
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,270
You keep claiming that Li Shuang has ulterior motives.

480
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,730
What evidence do you have?

481
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
This man is called Zang Budu.

482
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,320
He's a major figure in Ninglan,

483
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,350
with the widest network of information.

484
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,070
Well?

485
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,880
Do you believe me now?

486
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,510
What is his full name?

487
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,960
Does he have any birthmarks

488
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,620
or distinguishing features?

489
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,110
If he did,

490
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,210
I wouldn't need to trouble you.

491
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,350
I found this person in the mountains.

492
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,350
He was injured and lost his memory.

493
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,680
Found in the mountains?

494
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,110
You really do like meddling.

495
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,790
What exactly

496
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,680
are you trying to say?

497
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,440
I just don't want

498
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,330
to see you being manipulated.

499
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,040
Of course,

500
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,310
this matter is

501
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,290
indeed too cruel for you.

502
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,550
But fortunately, you're still alive.

503
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,150
The most important thing now

504
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,370
is to break the blood pact on you.

505
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,960
Can you break it?

506
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,000
But only the one who tied the knot can untie it.

507
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,510
Outside Lucheng,

508
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,120
there's a dense forest.

509
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,720
In three days,

510
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,200
you must find a way

511
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,750
to go there with Li Shuang.

512
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,590
That way,

513
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,000
I might be able to break your blood pact.

514
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Three days?

515
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
Why the hurry?

516
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,990
This dark magic

517
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,300
concerns your life.

518
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,160
It must be removed as soon as possible.

519
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,950
Remember,

520
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,410
three days.

521
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,240
Where have you been?

522
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,570
Why are you back so late?

523
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,070
What's wrong?

524
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,470
Where did you go just now?

525
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,760
It concerns military matters.

526
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,740
I can't tell you.

527
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,480
You can't tell me?

528
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,110
Or...

529
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,070
are you afraid to tell me?

530
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,070
What do you mean?

531
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,880
Zang Budu has eyes and ears everywhere.

532
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,640
Surely

533
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,560
he can help you find out my background, right?

534
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,400
You followed me?

535
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,090
I have my reasons

536
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
for doing this,

537
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,170
but I cannot tell you right now.

538
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,810
Fine.

539
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
You can't tell me.

540
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,430
So what if I investigate you?

541
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,160
You're in the General's Residence.

542
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,640
Investigating your identity

543
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,750
is my duty.

544
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,190
What's wrong with that?

545
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,590
Fine.

546
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,330
Since that's the case,

547
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,080
I want to ask you a question.

548
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,030
If it turns out I'm of questionable background,

549
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,790
what would you do with me?

550
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,160
Punish me,

551
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,720
kill me,

552
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,310
or abandon me like worthless trash,

553
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,260
leaving me to fend for myself?

554
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,270
General!

555
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,240
General!

556
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,960
Come in.

557
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,720
General,

558
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,660
Military Supervisor Li Zhangyi is almost here.

559
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,550
Greetings, General.

560
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,930
Isn't this

561
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,480
the naked young man

562
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,190
in your tent that day?

563
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,360
This is a military matter.

564
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,490
You shouldn't be present.

565
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,380
Wait at another camp for a moment.

566
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,550
General,

567
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,270
you've traveled all night.

568
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:30,680
Should we firstâ€¦?

569
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,610
Get to the point.

570
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,840
That Li Zhangyi

571
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,040
is part of Prince Li's faction.

572
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,930
He has always been at odds with Old General Li in court.

573
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,960
His visit this time

574
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,760
might be disadvantageous to us.

575
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,650
He's an Imperial Military Supervisor, carrying the emperor's authority.

576
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,980
No matter what, we can't fall out with him.

577
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,100
When we meet him,

578
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,480
just cooperate with him.

579
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,280
Handle everything else as the situation demands.

580
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,310
My Lord.

581
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,270
I am Qin Lan, an officer of the Changfeng Army.

582
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,600
I am Luo Teng, a captain.

583
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,310
Greetings, Lord Li.

584
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,510
Lord Li.

585
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,680
Lord Li!

586
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,960
You've had a long journey.

587
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,140
Lord Li,

588
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,670
you must be exhausted.

589
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,370
The general has been waiting for you.

590
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,160
My Lord,

591
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,450
please come in.

592
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,190
Lord Li, thank you for coming here all the way.

593
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,310
Outside,

594
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,180
the mountain wind is cold,

595
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,920
but inside the tent it's as warm as spring.

596
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,550
General Li,

597
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,130
you really know how to enjoy yourself.

598
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,720
The mountain climate

599
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,070
is nothing like Yunjing.

600
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,200
It's rainy all year.

601
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,590
I always

602
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,730
share the same living conditions as my soldiers.

603
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,600
You are the Imperial Military Supervisor.

604
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,270
We dare not

605
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,350
be negligent in hosting you.

606
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,070
Speaking of enjoying oneself,

607
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,240
how could I

608
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,240
compare to you?

609
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,270
This cloak

610
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,310
appears to be made of expensive fabric,

611
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,810
with intricate embroidery.

612
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,890
It's clearly a royal tribute.

613
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,600
It clearly shows that you're most favored

614
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,920
by Prince Li.

615
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,920
On what grounds

616
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
are you saying this?

617
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
His Majesty never likes ministers conspiring

619
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,010
or giving gifts privately.

620
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,500
Lord Li,

621
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,350
how could you commit such an offense knowingly?

622
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,500
Servents.

623
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,490
The Purple-Gold Sword granted to me by His Majesty is here.

624
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,860
Criminal Li Shuang, kneel at once.

625
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,440
His Majesty has never condemned me.

626
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,240
I

627
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,200
cannot accept the title of "criminal"

628
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,330
that you place on me.

629
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,160
His Majesty granted me full authority to investigate the Huo Du case.

630
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,350
There are many suspicious points.

631
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,650
It's clear someone

632
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,240
deliberately framed him

633
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,790
to plot against a court minister.

634
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,200
And you, Li Shuang, failed in your investigation,

635
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,510
making you a prime suspect.

636
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,260
Lord Li.

637
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,990
My Lord.

638
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,800
Huo Du

639
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,489
was indeed a spy collaborating with the enemy.

640
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,900
I have verified that.

641
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,630
But his death

642
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,880
was truly an accident.

643
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,000
An accident?

644
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,000
If what you say is true,

645
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,110
then whoever killed Huo Du

646
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,760
must have been silencing a witness.

647
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,320
If I may, General,

648
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,000
why did you only hand over a corpse

649
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,070
but not the murderer?

650
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Or could it be that

651
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,920
the one who eliminated him

652
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,800
to prevent future troubles

653
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,880
was you?

654
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,370
Since you cannot prove your innocence,

655
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,000
it counts as a confession.

656
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,190
I

657
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,790
carry the emperor's orders.

658
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,360
I must punish you severely.

659
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,840
Guards!

660
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Yes!

661
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,340
Strip her armor

662
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,190
and give her 30 lashes with the military rod.

663
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,920
Yes!

664
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,030
Who dares!

665
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,880
Step back!

666
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,640
Luo Teng!

667
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,000
General!

668
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,880
Step back!

669
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,450
Luo Teng!

670
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,300
My Lord!

671
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,880
Actually, the person who killed Huo Du...

672
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,810
-Was me.
-Was me!

673
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,960
I was the one

674
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,160
who accidentally killed Huo Du.

675
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,610
With the fact before us,

676
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,090
I am willing

677
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,610
to accept any punishment.

678
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,360
Then let me ask you,

679
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,440
who is your blood master?

680
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,620
When you were lost,

681
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,020
why did she just happen to appear?

682
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,920
So what if I investigate you?

683
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,800
You're in the General's Residence.

684
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,710
Investigating your identity

685
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,070
is my duty.

686
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,520
What's wrong with that?

687
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,630
Li Shuangâ€¦

688
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,630
is she really that kind of person?

689
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,990
Perhaps...

690
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,390
she didn't intentionally hide it from me.

691
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,360
But if that's the case,

692
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,710
why does she refuse to tell me?

693
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,170
My Lord,

694
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,320
the Huo Du case has already been settled.

695
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,190
If you have doubts, you can continue a thorough investigation.

696
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,510
Why did you resort to private punishment?

697
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,190
For the sake of

698
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,450
serving in the same court as the General,

699
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,220
please stop here.

700
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,150
Please stop here, My Lord.

701
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,880
My Lord, please reconsider it.

702
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,340
The General is honorable.

703
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,190
She willingly accepted the punishment to prove her integrity.

704
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,650
I heard the Changfeng Army

705
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,530
maintains strict discipline.

706
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,190
The agreed 30 lashes

707
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,480
shall not be reduced by even one.

708
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,370
Lord Li...

709
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,650
How dare you!

710
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,630
Who are you

711
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
to interfere with this punishment?

712
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,060
Who allowed you to come out?

713
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,010
Go back!

714
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,550
Li Shuang is the commander of the Changfeng Army.

715
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,590
How dare you petty officials

716
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,760
punish her?

717
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,960
If she is injured

718
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
and word gets out,

719
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,840
Yao State might seize the opportunity to start another war.

720
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,770
Can you bear that responsibility?

721
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,920
General Li herself has admitted

722
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,710
accidentally killing Huo Du.

723
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,400
Our laws are strict.

724
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,280
Even a general cannot escape punishment.

725
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,050
My Lord, you are eager to achieve merit,

726
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,170
yet you cannot even determine who the suspect is.

727
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,030
I killed Huo Du.

728
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,410
I was the only one present when it happened.

729
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,010
I will bear the consequences

730
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,340
of what I did alone.

731
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,920
General Li, you certainly know how to command your subordinates.

732
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,420
Even in such a serious case,

733
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,380
someone rushed to take responsibility.

734
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,470
Very well.

735
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,820
Since that is the case,

736
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,210
I shall question you thoroughly.

737
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,970
Guards!

738
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,430
Take him away!

739
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,920
Who dares!

740
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,240
Lord Li,

741
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,960
if you wish to provide the court with a resolution,

742
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,630
I will cooperate.

743
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,510
But now, having beaten me,

744
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,710
you still intend to take my subordinate.

745
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,880
The Changfeng Army

746
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,360
is not a place where anyone can do as they please.

747
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,190
Li Shuang,

748
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,800
you are shielding your subordinate.

749
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,110
Do you intend to defy the imperial order?

750
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,530
My Lord, you keep claiming

751
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,650
there is an imperial decree.

752
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,480
Well, I'd like to see

753
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
where it is!

754
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,320
You should know

755
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,840
the punishment

756
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,730
for forging an imperial decree.

757
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,770
My Lord,

758
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,190
this is their territory.

759
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,790
We shouldn't use force here.

760
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,940
If things escalate,

761
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,670
it may be hard to resolve.

762
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,150
Fine.

763
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,630
Whatever I witnessed today,

764
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,230
I shall report to the court in full detail.

765
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,840
General Li,

766
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,050
you'd better act wisely.
