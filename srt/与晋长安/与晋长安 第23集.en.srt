No matter how powerful you are,

you can't defend
against the malice in the dark.

he's resorted to such despicable means.

we can make it out of here alive today?

Please calm down, Your Highness.

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,630
We carried out your command
to intercept the Crown Prince's carriage,

sat only Jin'an
from the General's Residence.

115
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,680
I dared not act rashly,

116
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,030
so I had to let Jin'an go

117

of doing anything right!

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,560
Spare me, Your Highness.

122

Keep searching.

123

125
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,159
Understood.

126
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,310
Jin'an deliberately exposed himself

127
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,800
to lure them into pursuing him.

128
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,460

will have his back.

I'll go check it out.

157
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,400

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,320
Huai'en?

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,790
Your Highness,

161
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
where are you heading?

162
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,480
Didn't expect

163
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,080
Prince Li to have
such an extraordinary sidekick.

164
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,750
Prince Li has never

165
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,550
liked such roundabout tactics.

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
As remote as that road is,

167
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,940
he could have simply killed me directly

168
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,870
without going to all this trouble.

169
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,390
Your Highness, you're so sharp-witted.

170
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,230
I was right about you.

171
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,240
Who are you?

172
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,920
How dare you imprison the Crown Prince?

173
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,470
How rude of you.

174
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,940
When did I ever imprison His Highness?

175
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
The door is right over there.

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,370
If you want to leave,

177
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,380
you're free to go anytime.

178
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,280
You went to great lengths
to bring me here.

179
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,370
While you haven't treated me
with proper courtesy,

180
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,900
you haven't hurt me either.

181
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,580
What on earth are you up to?

182
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,480
Your Highness, you're perceptive.

183
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,150
Prince Li is
desperately trying to kill you.

184
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,780
General Li

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,050
is also in a hurry to cut ties with you

186
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,400
to save her own skin.

187
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,580
But Your Highness,
if you were to leave this place,

188
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,890
wouldn't that be

189
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,650
walking straight into danger?

190
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,220
Staying between two opposing armies,

191
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,970
and being so familiar
with news from the city,

192
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
are you

193
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,590
from Yao State?

194
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,160
It's a pity, though.

195
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I bear the mere title of Crown Prince

196
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,490
with no real power.

197
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,910
If you plan to use me

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,700
to force Taijin to submit,

199
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,940
I'm afraid

200
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,660
you're wasting your time.

201
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,030
Your Highness,

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,190
just look.

203
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm merely

204
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,200
a wandering brute from the jianghu

205
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,320
with no place in my heart
for state affairs.

206
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,710
I just feel

207
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,870
that you, as the Crown Prince,

208
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,870
are bullied all the time

209
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
and live in constant fear
like a stray dog.

210
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,380
I simply can't stand to watch it anymore.

211
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,960
I brought you over

212
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,270
to offer you a way out

213
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,980
to start anew.

214
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,270
Tempting smooth talk

215
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
always has a reason behind it.

216
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,120
Rather than waste time
beating around the bush,

217
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,510
why don't you just cut to the chase?

218
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,270
Fair enough.

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,740
The General's Residence

220
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,700
has something I'm after.

221
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,910
I heard about the Crown Prince's matter.

222
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,750
Any updates?

223
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,840
We've searched everywhere along the way.

224
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,960
Not only the Crown Prince,

225
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,240
but the whole convoy's gone,

226
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
as if they vanished into thin air.

227
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,680
Could they have gotten lost?

228
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
The escorting soldiers

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,870
were all carefully selected,

230
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,080
knowing Lucheng's terrain
like the back of their hands.

231
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,390
I've sent reinforcements

232
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,840
to expand the search area.

233
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,790
We must find him.

234
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,960
Are you going

235
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,790
to look for him in person?

236
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
This happened because of me.

237
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,150
I can't sit by and do nothing.

238
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,480
Ji Ran and the others are searching
along the way.

239
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,270
Then we

240
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,430
can check those rugged areas.

241
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,150
We might

242
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,580
discover something unexpected.

243
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,800
The footprints seem

244
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,900
to be heading that way.

245
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,080
Let's go.

246
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,790
The footprints

247
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,200
end right here.

248
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,870
I've been wondering.

249
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,190
Since those people
using the silver needles

250
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,590
have kept targeting you,

251
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,030
why would they
drag the Crown Prince into it this time?

252
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,030
Perhaps after losing to me repeatedly,

253
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,360
they couldn't accept it

254
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,510
and wanted to leverage the Crown Prince

255
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,770
to force me to come out.

256
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,070
I'm thinking

257
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,960
that His Highness

258
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,250
shouldn't have to suffer so much.

259
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,480
Although my father

260
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,560
has always treated me like his own,

261
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,240
I've known well
that living under someone else's roof,

262
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,390
I must be careful

263
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,550
with my words and behaviors.

264
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,440
I know you don't want excessive intakes
of sweets to affect your sword practice,

265
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,960
so I told the palace maids

266
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
to use less sugar.

267
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,320
Others thought I was always standing up
for the Crown Prince,

268
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,790
but few knew

269
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
that His Highness

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,030
was my only friend back then.

271
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,030
Now,

272
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
he's in danger

273
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,550
due to my oversight.

274
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,400
Regret won't help.

275
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,920
We should find the Crown Prince
as soon as possible.

276
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,550
And then

277
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,040
I'll figure out what to do next.

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,579
Let's treat your wound first.

279
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,710
If it gets infected,

280
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,589
we'll lose both the Crown Prince

281
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,430
and you.

282
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,170
So what's your plan?

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,030
You knew that the man in black

284
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,430
was one of their targets.

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
To keep me safe,

286
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,350
you planned

287
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,030
to take it all on yourself.

288
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,480
You had to send the Crown Prince away,

289
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,540
so you felt guilty.

290
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,450
Yet Prince Li was relentless,

291
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,060
leaving you nowhere to hide.

292
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,770
So you planned to go all out.

293
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,560
I know everything in your mind,

294
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
and I'll help you make it all.

295
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,970
You've been on edge lately,

296
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,500
not even getting any proper rest.

297
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,400
Shuang,

298
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,070
you still have me by your side.

299
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,680
You're willing to risk your life for me,

300
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,770
and I would do the same for you.

301
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,470
I don't want to see anyone die.

302
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
I just want to end this mess

303
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,030
and spend

304
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,800
the rest of my life with you.

305
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
In those biography scrolls I've read,

306
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,870
all the young ladies
would cry their eyes out

307
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,270
at the slightest injury.

308
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,780
But look at you.

309
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,590
With all these wounds,

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,070
you haven't even flinched,

311
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,030
let alone shed a tear.

312
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,730
Ever since I entered Lucheng,

313
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,510
I'm no longer some pampered lady.

314
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,380
I'm the General of the Changfeng Army.

315
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,840
I have neither the time

316
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,240
nor the luxury to be weak.

317
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,280
But I'm different from the others.

318
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,240
You are everyone's general,

319
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,400
yet you're my one and only beloved Shuang.

320
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,090
It's alright.

321
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,200
Neither I

322
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,210
nor these lush woods and bright moon

323
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,270
would know it.

324
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,240
Master.

325
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,750
Li Shuang's broken
into the secret forest with her man.

326
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,210
They're heading this way.

327
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
I knew she would come,

328
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,220
but I didn't expect it to be this soon.

329
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,440
Seems like you don't have much time left

330
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,640
to consider, Your Highness.

331
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,550
You and Prince Li are

332
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,000
meant for a fight to the death.

333
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,350
Instead of

334
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,920
fleeing and hiding,

335
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,730
why not go all out
and fight to the bitter end?

336
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,920
Your Highness,

337
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,590
I can ensure your survival

338
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,510
or even help you rise to power
in one fell swoop,

339
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,350
free from future worries.

340
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,310
As Crown Prince,

341
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,110
you have no power, no influence.

342
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,170
And even the loyalty
and friendship that could've

343
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,890
saved your life are gone now.

344
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,850
If you don't join hands with me,

345
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,520
what other path

346
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,630
do you have other than death?

347
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,570
What are you after

348
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
in the General's Residence?

349
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,310
The man in black,

350
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,730
Jin'an.

351
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,400
I can sense

352
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,530
the stronger aura of the Crown Prince.

353
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,490
Help.

354
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,160
Help...

355
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Help me.

356
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,410
Your Highness.

357
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,820
Your Highness!

358
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

359
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,090
Let's first find a way

360
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,090
to take them back.

361
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,120
Your Highness!

362
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,330
Anxiety and fear

363
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,260
have made it hard for you to focus.

364
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,000
Though there are no serious problems,

365
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
you still need some good rest.

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,060
Your Highness.

367
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,310
Your Highness.

368
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,600
Run, Your Highness.

369
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,680
Your Highness, run.

370
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,440
Your Highness.

371
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,310
Mr. Mo Yin.

372
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,240
Your Highness.

373
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,790
Huai'en was injured because of me.

374
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,640
Could you

375
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,300
check on him for me?

376
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,420
Of course, Your Highness.

377
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,550
I treat

378
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,920
all patients equally,

379
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,290
with no distinction

380
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,460
between princes and commoners.

381
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,270
[That weird.]

382
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,680
[Why do]

383
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,010
[these wounds show traces
of Wuling Mountain techniques?]

384
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,950
Is there something wrong?

385
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

386
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,440
Despite some internal injuries,

387
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,640
no vital parts were hurt, fortunately.

388
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,670
He only needs some medicine
to promote circulation

389
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,870
and reduce bruising.

390
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,290
Your Highness.

391
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,760
Are you alright, Your Highness?

392
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,360
His Highness is fine.

393
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,370
Your Highness.

394
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,560
Do you know

395
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,880
who abducted you?

396
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,800
Who else could it be?

397
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,510
As long as I'm alive,

398
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,440
my dear brother

399
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,160
won't easily let me go.

400
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Had Huai'en not saved me,

401
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,000
I would probably

402
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,430
be dead now.

403
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,960
This one's on me.

404
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,050
Sorry for my oversight

405
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,770
and lack of consideration.

406
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,810
-I promise that next time...
-Promise what?

407
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,940
Promise that next time

408
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,760
you'll successfully
throw me even farther away?

409
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,440
General,

410
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,160
His Highness just got out of danger
and needs some peace and rest.

411
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Please talk to him

412
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,960
after His Highness feels better.

413
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,960
Then we will

414
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,200
take our leave.

415
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,200
Mr. Mo Yin, please hold on a minute.

416
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,810
Due to treacherous mountain paths,

417
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,070
I accidentally got some minor injuries.

418
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,300
Would you mind helping me dress them?

419
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,290
General, you truly are a remarkable woman.

420
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,200
You don't seem concerned
about the social distance

421
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
between men and women.

422
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,290
How clumsy the man was

423
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,930
to bandage the wound

424
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,310
this badly!

425
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you for your help, sir.

426
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,200
Sir, you've put aside our past grudges

427
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,260
and offered us so much generous help.

428
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,050
I really appreciate it.

429
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,640
General, Miss Lu told me

430
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,730
that you never

431
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,220
take good care of yourself

432
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,200
and even pay

433
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,350
no attention

434
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,510
to minor wounds.

435
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,960
You specifically asked me
to dress your wounds today.

436
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
I guess

437
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,270
you have something to ask me, right?

438
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,110
His Highness was thrown
into a great fright this time.

439
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,440
Is he really alright?

440
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,810
Not only is he fine,

441
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,960
he's even in much better shape
than you are, General.

442
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,240
Then

443
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
what about Huai'en?

444
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,340
This man is extremely loyal.

445
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,770
I think he must have been

446
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,130
fretting over
the Crown Prince's situation recently,

447
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,990
causing him digestive problems.

448
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,400
Just now,

449
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,790
when I checked his pulse,

450
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,590
guess what I found?

451
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,270
What?

452
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,730
His constipation

453
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,930
has lasted for at least five days.

454
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
In this case,

455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
it seems

456
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,160
that I was overthinking it.

457
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,960
It's never wrong to overthink
a matter of life and death.

458
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,770
In my opinion,

459
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,590
it's uneasy to cure him.

460
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,510
If this keeps up,

461
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm afraid
it could lead to serious complications.

462
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,160
Where

463
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,550
did you get this?

464
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,930
Weren't you so into the show
you put on just now?

465
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,680
Why quit acting now?

466
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,240
Ever since you showed up in Lu City,

467
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,070
I've suspected your identity.

468
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,730
Despite our meticulous plan,

469
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,500
the Crown Prince was still abducted.

470
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,510
So it was because of you,

471
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,280
a spy hiding in my place.

472
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,080
General, you must be joking.

473
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,520
Not even the deepest dungeon
could hold me.

474
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,710
For the Crown Prince, a mere weakling,

475
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,270
why would I bother
working as a spy for others?

476
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,030
Since you recognize this needle,

477
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,720
you must know its owner

478
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,000
and must be involved in it somehow.

479
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,510
If you don't come clean,

480
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,940
I'll have no choice
but to throw you into prison

481
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,740
for relentless interrogation.

482
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,500
Why don't you let people finish speaking

483
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,060
before resorting to force?

484
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,680
I don't know why this person

485
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,280
kidnapped the Crown Prince.

486
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,310
I came to your place

487
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,570
for the man in black.

488
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,550
Or should I say,

489
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,270
Jin'an?

490
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,270
How much do you know about him?

491
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,960
General, you can rest assured.

492
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,790
I've been at your residence
for so many days.

493
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,310
If I truly wanted to harm anyone,

494
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,590
I'd have done it long ago.

495
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,240
Why would I wait until today?

496
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,720
During your long stay at my residence,

497
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,650
you've been keeping a low profile.

498
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,530
I guess it's because

499
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
you're no match
for the man in black, right?

500
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,270
As unpredictable
as your martial arts skills are,

501
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,550
I can do nothing to you.

502
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,680
Guess I'll

503
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,710
have to call Jin'an for help.

504
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,510
I once thought
you were an upright and reliable general.

505
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,110
Didn't expect you

506
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,830
to be as cunning as Jin'an.

507
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,490
The Jade Linglong inside Jin'an's body is

508
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,750
a sacred relic of my Wuling Mountain.

509
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Do you mean

510
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,240
that only by removing the Jade Linglong

511
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,400
can we save Jin'an?

512
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,400
This way, we can save

513
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,350
not only him, but also you

514
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,110
and all the other living beings.

515
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,570
Will it endanger his life?

516
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,520
No, it won't.

517
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,330
But whether it's removed or not,

518
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,130
all his memories of you, General,

519
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,100
will be totally wiped out.

520
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,170
Jin'an and I originally agreed

521
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,240
that when everything was settled,

522
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,550
he'd go to Wuling Mountain with me.

523
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,070
But given the complicated situation now,

524
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,920
he doesn't have much time left.

525
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,070
I have to...

526
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,920
I have to spill

527
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,400
everything to you

528
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,160
like a big-mouthed guy.

529
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,240
If he refuses

530
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,270
to go with me one day in the future,

531
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,760
I might

532
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,980
need to ask for your help, General.

533
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,510
Has Jin'an

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,930
known about this all along?

535
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,440
He didn't want you to worry,

536
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,240
so he kept it from you on purpose.

537
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,550
I'm not in cahoots

538
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,170
with this silver needle's owner.

539
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,110
Many years ago,

540
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,730
my godfather was murdered,

541
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,710
and the Jade Linglong was stolen.

542
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,530
The same silver needle

543
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,810
was left at the scene.

544
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,990
I have a blood feud with its owner.

545
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,880
General, please

546
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,570
tell me the truth about it.

547
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,140
Since I brought Jin'an
back to my residence,

548
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,730
this person has launched
several attacks on us.

549
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,260
He acts in a mysterious way,

550
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,300
coming and going without a trace.

551
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,240
I know very little about him.

552
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,030
The only clue is

553
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,350
that he can use silver needles

554
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,050
to manipulate innocent people at will.

555
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,600
Could it be the acupoint-sealing needle?

556
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,620
Some time ago,

557
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,370
I had Jin'an draw his portrait

558
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,490
and searched everywhere,

559
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,310
but still found no trace of him.

560
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,310
So you do recognize him, sir.

561
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,030
Who is he?

562
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,540
I can not jump to conclusions,

563
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,910
but I will certainly
get to the bottom of it.

564
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,080
This person kidnapped the Crown Prince,

565
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,000
yet was willing to let him return
safe and sound.

566
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,660
He must be up to something big.

567
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,310
I urge you, General,

568
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,490
not to let your guard down.

569
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,810
The shadow puppet is way too powerful.

570
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,010
I've set several traps.

571
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,900
Still, he not only escaped easily

572
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,630
but also injured me.

573
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,710
The shadow puppet and the Jade Linglong
haven't perfectly merged yet.

574
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,510
If he loses his mind,

575
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,150
the consequences
of the chaotic power can be devastating.

576
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,880
If we don't act decisively now,

577
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,920
it'll be a big threat
looming large in the future.

578
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,659
You're already so exhausted,

579
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,389
yet you still try to stay awake?

580
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,270
Let me finish what I'm working on first.

581
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
I'm sorry

582
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,740
for keeping you up so late with me.

583
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,650
I couldn't fall asleep anyway.

584
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,910
You've been working
until the middle of the night.

585
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,670
What

586
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,130
is this exactly?

587
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,610
This is the child doll I made for Nanxing.

588
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,360
And this is his wife.

589
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,080
I've thought it over.

590
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,150
I plan to visit him

591
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,960
first thing tomorrow morning.

592
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,710
You're right.

593
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,210
There's something

594
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,440
we must get over.

595
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,070
Those who remain

596
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,960
need to move on.

597
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,400
Nanxing saved your life.

598
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,110
The doll you made is so ugly.

599
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,590
Isn't that

600
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,800
repaying kindness with ingratitude?

601
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,230
I've tried my best.

602
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,580
Nanxing's biggest wish in life

603
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,490
was to have a family of his own.

604
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,150
Now that he's gone,

605
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,630
no matter what,

606
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,440
I must do everything I can

607
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,480
to fulfill that wish for him.

608
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,010
With such good intentions,

609
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,200
you're certainly honoring
all that Nanxing did for you.

610
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,260
To honor his kindness,

611
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,280
I should find the one who killed him

612
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,170
and finish the murderer

613
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,510
to avenge him.

614
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,360
An eye for an eye,
and this cycle of revenge will never end.

615
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,190
Do you have to trap yourself
in this worldly karma?

616
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,000
You're saying so

617
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,600
because you've never experienced

618
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,670
the pain of losing someone close to you.

619
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,360
Now that he's gone,

620
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,920
these things

621
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,590
are just meant to ease

622
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,960
the regrets and guilt

623
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,320
of the living.

624
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
They're all fake.

625
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,980
Make the murderer pay with his life.

626
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,550
That's the only real thing
I can do for him.

627
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,610
What if

628
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,470
the killer is someone
on good terms with you

629
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
or even one of your family members?

630
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,540
Would you still have to kill them?

631
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,500
If they were truly my family,

632
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,230
how could they hurt someone
important to me?

633
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,300
Nanxing,

634
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,230
I've brought you your wife and child.

635
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
You can rest in peace now.

636
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,380
Thank you

637
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,690
for making such a beautiful family
for Nanxing.

638
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,800
I might be

639
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,320
leaving soon.

640
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,090
This is Clear Moon Pearl.

641
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,230
Take it.

642
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,400
Why give me something so valuable?

643
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,030
You want to rebuild the clinic,

644
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,740
and I can't think of any other way

645
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,690
to help you.

646
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,000
Ordinary people love fortune.

647
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,180
Money is always

648
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,490
the way to go.

649
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,070
Jin'an,

650
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,760
I need to leave the General's Residence
for something urgent.

651
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,490
Do you remember our agreement?

652
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,480
There's something

653
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,610
I want to figure out.

654
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,590
What do you think makes shadow puppets

655
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,550
lose control?

656
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,570
I'm not sure.

657
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
I only heard about it

658
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,000
from my godfather when I was young.

659
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,110
Many years ago,

660
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,030
there was a shadow puppet
in the mountains.

661
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,670
It seemed like a normal man,

662
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,960
who even got married
and had children in the village below,

663
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,550
living an ordinary life.

664
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,590
But later, for some reason,

665
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,630
it suddenly lost control

666
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,750
and slaughtered everyone

667
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,980
in the entire village within one night.

668
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,060
Therefore,

669
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,050
to ensure peace for all people,

670
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,640
I must take you back with me.

671
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,690
I'll go with you.

672
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,930
The moment you told me

673
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,610
that the Jade Linglong
would drain Shuang's life,

674
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,320
I just made this decision.

675
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,500
But right now, Lucheng is in turmoil.

676
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,760
Shuang is caught in the middle of it

677
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,020
and having a hard time.

678
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,400
I need to help her
get through this crisis first.

679
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,360
But the Jade Linglong is unpredictable.

680
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,150
What if you

681
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,280
completely lose control before then?

682
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,510
If I lose control,

683
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,510
can you protect the people
at the General's Residence for me?

684
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,580
I have no connection with them.

685
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,660
I only want to get what I'm after.

686
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,190
If I totally lose it,

687
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,840
please

688
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,130
guarantee their safety

689
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,100
even if it means killing me.

690
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,710
I promise you

691
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,860
that once everything is settled,

692
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,790
I'll go with you.

693
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,410
Alright,

694
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,790
I promise you

695
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,230
that I'll do my best.

696
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,080
If necessary,

697
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
I'll take extreme measures.

698
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,190
Thank you.

699
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Do shadow puppets

700
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,240
also have compassion

701
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,850
and concerns about others' lives?

702
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,320
Your Highness,

703
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,190
latest reports say

704
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,320
that Li Shuang's brought the Crown Prince

705
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,180
back to the General's Residence.

706
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,520
When did this happen?

707
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,000
Around dawn.

708
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,110
After they returned,

709
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,800
the General's Residence
shut the doors to all visitors.

710
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,570
Not even a fly had come out

711
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,090
until sunset.

712
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,400
Li Shuang

713
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,280
sent the Crown Prince away
and then brought him back again.

714
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,710
What trick is she playing?

715
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,000
What's the use of wild speculation?

716
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,010
Who's there?

717
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,370
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

718
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,110
I mean you no harm.

719
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,510
I've come

720
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,680
to offer you

721
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,790
a great gift.

722
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,880
Everyone, leave us alone.

723
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

724
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,010
Your Highness,
if you want to kill the Crown Prince,

725
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,670
you just need to strike directly.

726
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,520
Although Li Shuang commands
powerful forces,

727
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,920
the Changfeng Army isn't

728
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,730
the Li family's private army after all.

729
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,510
She wouldn't dare use them arbitrarily.

730
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,440
The General's Residence
has only a few dozen people.

731
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,520
As long as you bring enough troops,

732
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,000
there's no way you'll lose.

733
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,570
Since you know this matter so well,

734
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,030
how could you not know

735
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,280
that Li Shuang's got

736
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,630
a man in black who has

737
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,150
overwhelming power
to even fight thousands of soldiers?

738
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,950
Please don't worry about that man,
Your Highness.

739
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,490
On the day of the heavenly calamity,

740
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,220
he will certainly not appear before you.
