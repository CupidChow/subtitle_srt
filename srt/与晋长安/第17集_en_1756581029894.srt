[Sixu Clinic]

4
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,710
Boss.

5
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,789
I've finished all the work.

6
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,710
Then I'll…

7
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:01,590
You can go.

8
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,350
Okay.

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,350
Wake me up tomorrow morning.

10
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,759
Got it.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,410
Is it that hard to make it official?

12
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,140
Please, just go home already.

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
I have to get up early every day

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,470
to train at the General's Residence.

15
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,240
It's killing me already.

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
If Shuang finds out

17
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,560
you've been drinking at my place,

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,690
she'll probably make me train harder.

19
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm feeling down

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,150
and want a drink

21
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,050
and a chat with my friend.
What's wrong with that?

22
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,290
If you don't tell and I don't tell,

23
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,350
how would she know?

24
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,230
Just don't tell her, simple as that.

25
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,350
Besides, Lu Xin,

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,120
when have I ever sold you out?

27
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,650
Don't you trust me?

28
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,030
It's not that.

29
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,150
I'm just curious—

30
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,420
do men care about titles too?

31
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,410
Men and women are equal, okay?

32
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,810
On this point,

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,520
I agree with Li Shuang.

34
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,280
You're desperate for a title.

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,430
Is it because the Crown Prince is coming

36
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,160
and you're feeling unsettled?

37
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,430
I do feel a bit uneasy.

38
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,970
But don't you think

39
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,410
since the Crown Prince betrayed her,

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,590
she should've…

41
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,960
let go of the past?

42
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,380
If romantic feelings

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,050
were so easy to let go of,

44
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,110
there wouldn't be

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,270
so many lovesick people in this world.

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
Stop drinking.

47
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,590
You don't need to be so pessimistic.

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,750
If you ask me,

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,520
you're not

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,380
much worse than the Crown Prince.

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,190
Really?

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,270
Really.

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,840
You're both grown men,

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
both young and handsome.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
And besides, as you said,

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,750
all people are equal.

57
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,800
It's just that…

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,590
the Crown Prince and Shuang

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,750
share an irreplaceable past,

60
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,150
while you

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,710
don't even remember your own past.

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,940
That really is a shame.

63
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,390
Sometimes,

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,140
I want to tell her
about my past experiences,

65
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,900
but I don't know where to begin.

66
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,630
Have you ever thought

67
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,960
that perhaps you and Shuang

68
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,310
had met before?

69
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,950
A fleeting glance

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,190
in a vast crowd.

71
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,120
You and she are meant to be.

72
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,170
That's how it's written
in all the love stories.

73
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,930
Drink up.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,040
Okay.

75
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,120
Years ago,

76
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,480
I heard about a method

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,150
to restore memories from folk tales,

78
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,150
but I've never tried it.

79
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,750
After all, patients like you

80
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,600
are too rare.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,070
Hold on, Lu Xin,

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,800
what do you mean by that?

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,710
You want to use me
as your test subject again?

84
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,870
Have you forgotten
what happened to my beard last time?

85
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,070
What I gave you was just tonics
that were good for your health,

86
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,510
totally harmless.

87
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,750
Besides, I'm not giving you
any medicine this time.

88
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,890
How about this?

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
Why don't you tell me
more stories instead?

90
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,320
No more stories.

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,460
If you're not willing, forget it.

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,510
Perhaps one day you'll wake up

93
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,980
with your memories back.

94
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,480
Maybe tomorrow,

95
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,120
next year,

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
decades from now,

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,170
or centuries later.

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,159
Finish your drink and leave.

99
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,720
So what is this method?

100
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,800
Clear your mind of stray thoughts,

101
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,330
fix your eyes on it,

102
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,270
and imagine yourself

103
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,190
getting drowsier,

104
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,190
and drowsier,

105
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,710
and drowsier.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,830
Well? Sleepy yet?

107
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,890
If you are, sleep.

108
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,720
Not at all.

109
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,250
Don't talk.

110
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,950
You'll get sleepy soon.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,310
W-Wait a sec.

112
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,640
What is it?

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Did you remember something?

114
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,310
Are you alright?

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,870
You can't hold your liquor at all.

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,270
It's so late.

117
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,640
Why are you still up?

118
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,530
I had a few drinks with you earlier

119
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,240
and then went out to sober up.

120
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,190
How come you were gone for 2 hours

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,750
and came back smelling even more of wine?

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,870
Is it that bad?

123
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,270
Lu Xin made me drink.

124
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,000
I refused at first.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,360
I reminded her
that she had training tomorrow morning,

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,430
but she insisted I drink.

127
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,430
She said I looked upset

128
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,120
and offered to drink with me.

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,870
I said I really couldn't,

130
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,070
but she said I had to.

131
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:31,650
I...

132
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,700
I couldn't refuse her,

133
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,800
so I had a few drinks with her.

134
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,070
You nitpicked about my manners

135
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,030
in every way

136
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,680
and then went out drinking yourself.

137
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,360
How shameful.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
As my teacher,

139
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,810
shouldn't you be setting an example?

140
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes.

141
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,390
I was wrong.

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,950
As your teacher,

143
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,610
I should...

144
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,650
What did you say?

145
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,680
Mr. Jin'an,

146
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,580
am I serving you tea

147
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,770
in a proper manner?

148
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,360
It's proper.

149
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,840
Your request was sudden,

150
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,400
but the proper etiquette

151
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,750
must still be observed.

152
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,549
These 5 items

153
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,480
symbolize diligence in learning,

154
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,110
dedicated teaching,

155
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,680
good fortune,

156
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,130
success in examinations,

157
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,970
and perfection in virtue.

158
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,720
But I recall

159
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,630
that the traditional student's gifts

160
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,630
include 6 things.

161
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,550
Dried meat is too expensive.

162
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,350
All right.

163
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,630
You're not just an ordinary teacher to me,

164
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,870
so my gifts for you

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,970
cannot be ordinary either.

166
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,870
The Crown Prince is coming to Lucheng

167
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,070
to reward the troops.

168
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,910
I'll be busy for a while.

169
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,230
This bead contains my blood.

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,690
When I'm not around,

171
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,460
you can use it in emergencies.

172
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,520
Why did you hurt yourself again?

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
You've risked your life for me

174
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,670
so many times.

175
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,910
Compared to that,

176
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,420
this is nothing.

177
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,700
Your Highness,

178
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,030
the Crown Prince has entered Liangzhou.

179
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,890
He'll be in Lucheng within 2 days.

180
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,000
What's the situation

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
along the way?

182
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,150
All the prefectures

183
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,600
are loyal to Prince Li.

184
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,600
Even if the Crown Prince wants

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,060
to win them over, he can't.

186
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,000
But before he set off,

187
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,370
he met with Li Wei's son,

188
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,990
Li Ting.

189
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,270
I planned to let him off for the sake

190
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,110
of our brotherly bond,

191
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,970
but he just can't behave himself,

192
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,440
fixated on winning the Li family over.

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,390
If he had both the prime minister

194
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,500
and the Li family on his side,

195
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,700
he'd be unstoppable.

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,860
As long as he's breathing, he's a threat.

197
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,460
Our men are already in place,

198
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,380
waiting for your word.

199
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,720
Go tell them

200
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,070
to make it clean and quick.

201
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,620
Yes.

202
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,830
Don't blame me
for being a ruthless brother.

203
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,840
If you must blame someone,

204
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,600
blame yourself.

205
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,360
[Lucheng]

206
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,560
General,

207
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,150
the Crown Prince sent word earlier,

208
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,680
telling you to wait in camp.

209
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Why did you still come out to welcome him?

210
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,980
His Highness doesn't want to trouble us—

211
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,300
that is his kindness.

212
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,470
But
if I hadn't come,

213
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,150
it'd be seen as disrespectful
to the future ruler.

214
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,810
But aren't you
and the Crown Prince old friends?

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why care so much about formalities?

216
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,420
Li Shuang, general of the Changfeng Army,

217
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,180
welcomes the Crown Prince.

218
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,030
Shuang,

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
didn't I tell you

220
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,040
to wait at your residence?

221
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,420
Why did you come all the way out here?

222
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,140
Get up.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,660
Your Highness came from afar.

224
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,660
I had to welcome you personally,

225
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,270
or I'd be breaking protocol.

226
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,630
You've all waited long.

227
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,630
Soldiers,

228
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,200
your health comes first.

229
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
Please rise.

230
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,260
We'll set out at once.

231
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,940
Your Highness,

232
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,530
you've had a long journey.

233
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,780
Everything's arranged

234
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,910
at the post station.

235
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,110
Welcome the Crown Prince into the city!

236
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,940
Welcome the Crown Prince into the city!

237
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,400
Thank you
for being so considerate, General.

238
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,740
Protect His Highness!

239
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,940
Move!

240
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,070
Don't kill him!

241
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,240
If they're all dead,
how will we investigate later?

242
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,990
Shuang!

243
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,280
Your Highness!

244
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,950
Your Highness!

245
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,220
Your Highness!

246
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,180
Your Highness!

247
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,870
Send for the army physician.

248
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,670
Let's hurry to the post station.

249
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,390
We don't know who the assassins are.

250
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,600
The post station may not be safe.

251
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,680
Help His Highness onto the horse.

252
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,540
We're going back to my residence.

253
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,370
Your Highness,

254
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,790
we were eager to protect you

255
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,790
and acted rashly.

256
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,990
Please forgive us.

257
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,290
Lock down all information.

258
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,619
No one is to hear of this.

259
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,720
Yes.

260
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,890
You're hurt?

261
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,310
What happened?

262
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,530
I'll explain later.

263
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,210
I'll get His Highness treated first.

264
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,230
Though the wound is deep,

265
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,110
thankfully, it missed the vitals.

266
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,070
But you need proper rest and care

267
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,750
to completely recover.

268
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,000
You may leave.

269
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,260
Your Highness.

270
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,510
Shuang,

271
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,130
what are you doing?

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,500
I failed to protect you

273
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,730
and let you get injured.

274
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,230
Please punish me.

275
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,400
Why should I punish you?

276
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,050
Look, I'm right here in one piece.

277
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,400
Protecting you

278
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,880
is my duty,

279
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,480
but at that critical moment,

280
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
you saved me instead.

281
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,780
It was my fault that you got injured.

282
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
I owed you.

283
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,840
Of course I had to save you.

284
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,250
Your Highness.

285
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,650
These past 3 years,

286
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,260
have you been well?

287
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,530
Your Highness.

288
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,230
Thank you for your concern.

289
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,970
All is well…

290
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,720
in Lucheng.

291
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,400
Shuang,

292
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,110
it's just the two of us here.

293
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,910
Do you still need to be so formal?

294
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,310
You can push me away,

295
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,200
and I know the reason why.

296
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,270
But for these 3 years,

297
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,470
I've wanted to come to see you every day.

298
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,840
Yet I couldn't.

299
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,110
Your Highness,

300
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,040
walls have ears.

301
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,690
If someone overheard,

302
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,000
it could tarnish your reputation.

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,750
Earlier at your residence,

304
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,460
I saw a man.

305
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,960
As I recall,
you've only ever kept

306
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,760
female attendants by your side.

307
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,690
Your Highness,

308
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,640
that man

309
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,510
once saved my life.

310
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,440
He had no family,

311
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,110
so I took him in

312
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,810
and
gave him a job.

313
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,740
I've heard things have been
unstable along the border.

314
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,420
When it comes to household staff,

315
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,480
it's best to use people you know well.

316
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,590
Yes.

317
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Summon him.

318
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,470
I want to meet him.

319
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,640
Yes.

320
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,440
Shuang told me

321
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,600
she found you in the woods
and brought you back.

322
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,040
What were you doing

323
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,800
in the wilderness?

324
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
I was attacked

325
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,830
by a beast in the mountains

326
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,760
and blacked out.

327
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,030
People in Lucheng are kind and friendly.

328
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,890
I never thought

329
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,640
even the wild beasts here
were somewhat kind too.

330
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
It attacked you

331
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,010
but didn't eat you.

332
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,250
If Your Highness doubts me,

333
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,480
you can go into the mountains
and see for yourself.

334
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,030
Jin'an!

335
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,510
Don't talk nonsense.

336
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,590
Your Highness,

337
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,190
Jin'an hasn't been here for a long time

338
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,190
and hasn't learned proper manners.

339
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,070
It's fine.

340
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,490
Did you just say

341
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,610
his name is Jin'an?

342
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,240
Yes.

343
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,350
It means lasting peace
and prosperity in Taijin.

344
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,830
It's a good name.

345
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
You gave it to him?

346
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,680
Yes.

347
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,130
Since General Li has
high expectations for you,

348
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,730
you should behave yourself,

349
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,090
serve her diligently,

350
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,110
and learn a servant's manners
as soon as possible

351
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,180
so she won't be let down.

352
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,060
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

353
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,920
I'm not a servant
who takes orders from just anyone.

354
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,110
General Li has served me tea
as my student.

355
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,890
I'm her exclusive personal teacher,

356
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,910
staying with her and teaching her

357
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,690
arts and etiquette.

358
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,340
Jin'an!

359
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,130
Your Highness,

360
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
Jin'an meant no offense.

361
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,040
Please forgive him.

362
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,570
You're still injured.

363
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,520
Get up.

364
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,720
We grew up together.

365
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,110
If he's your teacher,

366
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,510
then in my presence,

367
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,200
there's no need for such formalities.

368
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
Life in the army is dull and hard.

369
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,070
Music, chess, calligraphy, and painting

370
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,640
do help ease the boredom.

371
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,020
By the way, Shuang,

372
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,030
have you read the biographies

373
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,070
I sent you?

374
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,760
Your Highness, if there's nothing else,

375
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,290
I'll take General Li back
to dress her wounds.

376
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,470
You…

377
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,480
Shuang,

378
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,230
I know

379
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
you have feelings for me.

380
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,510
As long as you say yes,

381
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,370
I'll go to Father tomorrow
to revoke the decree

382
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,570
and cancel my engagement to the Ji girl.

383
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,680
Your Highness, don't come in.

384
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,960
It could stir gossip.

385
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,850
I've been

386
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,730
keeping this hairpin for you.

387
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
Now that Your Highness is getting married,

388
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,780
I should return it to you.

389
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,400
This hairpin

390
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,850
was left to me by my mother.

391
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,850
I gave it to you.

392
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,350
Do you still not understand?

393
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,220
Do you truly mean

394
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,780
to cut off all ties with me?

395
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,420
He is the Crown Prince.

396
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,590
You provoked him again and again.

397
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,920
If he's truly angered,

398
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,030
no one can protect you.

399
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,790
He caused you to get injured,
so he's at fault.

400
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,590
If you hadn't returned alive today,

401
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,250
then forget the Crown Prince—

402
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,120
I'd even destroy the entire Taijin court

403
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,310
to avenge you.

404
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,200
Jin'an!

405
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,960
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,220
I was just worried about you.

407
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,680
Don't ever say

408
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,070
such reckless things again.

409
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,680
Also,

410
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,610
during this period,

411
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,750
stay away from the Crown Prince

412
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,750
to avoid trouble.

413
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,050
I'm a general of Taijin.

414
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,030
My country, my family,

415
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,360
and the Changfeng Army—

416
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,350
I'll risk my life to protect them all.

417
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,790
Protecting the Crown Prince

418
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,960
is my duty as well.

419
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,930
You want to protect everyone,

420
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,890
but have you
thought about protecting yourself?

421
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,640
My life

422
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,350
belongs to Taijin and the Li family.

423
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,410
I'm ready to die at any time.

424
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,720
What about me?

425
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,590
There's a bond between us.

426
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,050
Have you thought about what I should do

427
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,000
if you die?

428
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,400
[General's Residence]

429
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,440
Your Highness,

430
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,830
everything has been taken care of.

431
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,830
Rest assured.

432
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,680
Is your injury serious?

433
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,870
It's nothing.

434
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,780
Your Highness,

435
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,530
Prince Li has always seen you
as a thorn in his side.

436
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,520
I never expected him
to be so bold this time.

437
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,110
You arrived in Lucheng
and were attacked right away.

438
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,640
In the capital,
bound by Father's authority,

439
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,200
he wouldn't dare go too far.

440
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,830
Now that I'm out here alone,

441
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,060
it's the perfect chance to strike.

442
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,830
I just didn't expect

443
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,790
he'd be so impatient

444
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,180
and dare to attempt
a brazen assassination.

445
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,730
I believe

446
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,760
the more impatient Prince Li is,

447
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,590
the more likely he'll trip himself up.

448
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,920
But there's one thing I don't understand:

449
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,590
Your Highness is of royal blood.

450
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,160
Not punishing General Li

451
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,360
is already showing her mercy.

452
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,290
Why did you take that blade for her?

453
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,670
It all started because of me.

454
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,720
I told Shuang not to come receive me

455
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,540
precisely because I didn't want her
to get hurt.

456
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,240
But she came anyway.

457
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,790
Three years ago,

458
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
I let her down.

459
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,470
Now that we've met again,

460
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I can't let her get hurt for me again.

461
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,610
But Your Highness,

462
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Prince Li is powerful
and well-connected now.

463
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,160
Your relationship with General Li

464
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,760
has long been a threat to him.

465
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,670
If…

466
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,120
General Li will surely
become your weakness.

467
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,030
To my brother,

468
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,270
my past, my present,

469
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,830
and everyone around me

470
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,610
are all my weaknesses.

471
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,250
So what is there to fear?

472
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,970
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]

473
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,100
Your Highness, please.

474
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,510
Father, you summoned me.

475
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,670
May I ask the reason?

476
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,450
Father, please don't be mad.

477
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,580
With heavenly tribulation imminent,

478
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,720
you actually tried
to assassinate the Crown Prince.

479
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,770
I knew nothing of the tribulation.

480
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,330
I only wanted to ease your burdens.

481
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,790
Please believe me.

482
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,100
You fool.

483
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,520
The sacrificial ritual has strict rules.

484
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,770
If he dies before the tribulation,

485
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,590
the formation will collapse.

486
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,550
I was ignorant.

487
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,470
I deserve nothing less than death.

488
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,920
I've always valued you,

489
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,430
but you're too impatient

490
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,330
and never learn caution.

491
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,780
How can I rely on you?

492
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
Father, you're visionary.

493
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I will remember your teachings.

494
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,040
The Bureau of Astronomy reported

495
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,560
that Mars will soon appear near Antares.

496
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,570
Lucheng is the best site
for the sacrificial ritual.

497
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,370
I'll give you a chance
to make up for your mistake.

498
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,300
Set out at once for Lucheng
and assist in the ritual.

499
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
On the day of the tribulation,

500
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,010
bring the Crown Prince to the altar
and cut his heart out.

501
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,470
Then it's all done.

502
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,680
Remember—

503
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,750
until then,

504
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,580
there must not be the slightest mistake.

505
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,530
I will do my utmost.

506
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,020
But what if
the Crown Prince refuses to die

507
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,800
as a sacrifice?

508
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,840
You're his elder brother.

509
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,960
You'll have to give him a push.

510
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,710
I'm giving this dagger to you.

511
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,880
It carries my authority.

512
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,680
He dares not disobey.

513
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,970
Yes, Father.

514
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,850
He actually survived.

515
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,460
What incredible luck.

516
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,200
I heard he was slashed

517
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,070
and barely survived.

518
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,510
He truly has a fate strong enough
to take the tribulation.

519
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,770
I underestimated him.

520
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,240
So what should

521
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,580
we do next?

522
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,200
This brother of mine

523
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,450
appears gentle and modest

524
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,820
but is actually calculating,

525
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,590
always opposing me.

526
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,130
This trip to Lucheng—

527
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,880
we'll settle both old

528
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,130
and new scores.

529
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,240
Your Highness, now is the perfect time

530
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,350
to go to Lucheng.

531
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,740
Your Highness,

532
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,880
His Majesty's head eunuch, Jin Bao,

533
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,640
has been quite devoted to your cause.

534
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,300
He replaced the golden pills
with poison made from aconite,

535
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
and His Majesty never got suspicious
after taking it.

536
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,070
By the looks of things,

537
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,610
the day of a power shift is near.

538
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,500
Father's days must be numbered.

539
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,790
Otherwise, he wouldn't be

540
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,920
so desperate for a sacrifice
to extend his life.

541
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,680
I don't believe in astrology,

542
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,550
but just in case—

543
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,670
we absolutely cannot let the Crown Prince

544
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,740
actually die on the altar.

545
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,550
His Majesty definitely

546
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,630
has eyes and ears in Lucheng.

547
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,940
If we act too early, wouldn't it...

548
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,370
Do you think I haven't thought of that?

549
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,750
Su Muyang's life

550
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,090
can be spared until the day of the ritual.

551
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,290
Just kill him before he gets on the altar

552
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,310
and then throw his body up there.

553
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,350
By the time I return to the capital,

554
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,510
Father will have succumbed to the poison,

555
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,370
and I will be able to legitimately

556
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,310
ascend the throne.

557
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,350
To be the Crown Prince

558
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,220
has never been my goal.

559
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,680
If I'm to be anything,

560
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,920
I'll be the supreme one—

561
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,120
the ruler of the nation.

562
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,310
Attention!

563
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,410
His Majesty has spoken.

564
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,980
The Changfeng Army has guarded the border

565
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,510
and defeated enemies,
making outstanding military achievements.

566
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,240
His Majesty is greatly pleased

567
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,510
and is offering

568
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,690
the entire army treasures, fine silk,

569
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,690
and 100 jars of imperial wine

570
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,630
to reward your loyalty.

571
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,489
End of the proclamation.

572
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,739
The Changfeng Army thanks
His Majesty for his grace!

573
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,070
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

574
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,400
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

575
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,630
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

576
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,030
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

577
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,030
General is here.

578
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,480
General.

579
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,670
General, here's to you.

580
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,400
To you.

581
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,150
Drink up, brothers!

582
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,880
General, here's to you.

583
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,320
General.

584
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,440
Good wine! Fill my glass.

585
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,710
Drink up!

586
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,070
Fill it up!

587
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,630
Good wine! Drink!

588
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,150
Come on, fill it to the brim!

589
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,480
Cheers!

590
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,340
Come on, drink!

591
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,199
-General.
-General.

592
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,810
Drink to your heart's content!

593
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,590
Li Shuang of the Changfeng Army

594
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,050
requests an audience
with the Crown Prince.

595
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,490
Greetings, Your Highness.

596
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,110
Please rise.

597
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,730
There are no outsiders here.

598
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,390
No need for such formalities.

599
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,550
Shuang,

600
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,150
what brings you here?

601
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,440
Your Highness has not fully recovered

602
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,920
but personally rewarded the army.

603
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,970
It's truly a blessing
for the Changfeng Army.

604
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,820
I must thank you in person.

605
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,590
Also, this...

606
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,360
It's the finest wound salve,

607
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,120
a gift from a renowned
physician friend of mine.

608
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,050
It works wonders for sword wounds.

609
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,580
No wonder you're distant with me.

610
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,260
I've missed so much

611
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,630
of your life.

612
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,710
Three years have passed in a flash.

613
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,920
Here at the border,

614
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,680
you've made new friends.

615
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm glad you have.

616
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Her name is Lu Xin.

617
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,760
She saved me when I was injured.

618
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,180
She's a close friend

619
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,110
to whom I'm indebted.

620
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,170
If you're willing,

621
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,510
tell me more, will you?

622
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I've been fine

623
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,370
these 3 years at the border.

624
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,400
Besides Lu Xin,

625
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,110
I've made another friend

626
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,300
called Jin'an.

627
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,260
Though I found him and took him in,

628
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,690
he's saved me many times from danger.

629
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,360
He didn't mean
to offend Your Highness earlier.

630
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm willing

631
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,010
to accept any punishment for him.

632
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I've never cared much for etiquette.

633
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,830
Why would I hold it against him?

634
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,960
The more trustworthy
the people by your side,

635
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,320
the more at ease I can be.

636
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,260
Thank you for your understanding.

637
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,030
You haven't fully recovered yet.

638
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,160
You should head back and get some rest.

639
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,760
I still have
military matters to attend to.

640
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,100
I'll take my leave now.

641
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,470
Your Highness, it seems
General Li still cares about you.

642
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,130
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
come in person to give you the salve.

643
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,480
I'll certainly

644
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,670
be nice to her friends.

645
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,200
But seeing her so careful with me

646
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,110
makes me really sad.

647
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,330
Have you investigated

648
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,720
Jin'an's identity?

649
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,440
There's little information about him.

650
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,670
Nothing seems suspicious.

651
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,360
It's said that when General Li found him,

652
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,910
he had already suffered a head injury
and lost his memory.

653
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,500
Besides,

654
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,840
he was the one who killed Huo Du.
