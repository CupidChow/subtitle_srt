[Shadow Love]

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,930
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,380
Don't move.

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Your shoulder wound hasn't healed.

5
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,920
Could it be related to
the vanished supernatural strength?

6
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
Don't move.

7
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,100
You seem to be different.

8
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
So...

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,680
all those hurtful words you said that day,

10
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,940
trying to push me away,

11
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
was because

12
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,430
you wanted to pull me out of this mess?

13
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,970
But did you ever think that

14
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,680
from the moment you picked me up,

15
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
brought me back to your residence,

16
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,710
and learned the secret of my body,

17
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,600
I was already part of this game?

18
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,120
In court intrigues,

19
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,820
a single misstep

20
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,240
could cost you your life.

21
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,650
You don't even remember your own past.

22
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,310
How could you possibly understand

23
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,430
its complexity?

24
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,190
This matter is indeed complicated.

25
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,230
But I did kill Huo Du.

26
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,030
If turning me in can solve the problem,

27
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,430
just do it.

28
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,190
If I turn you in...

29
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,470
you'll die.

30
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,950
Are you scared?

31
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
I fear death,

32
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,560
but I'm not afraid to die for you.

33
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,140
Otherwise,

34
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,310
I wouldn't have come back.

35
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,720
You keep saying

36
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,640
you can't leave me.

37
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,180
Why?

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,730
Yessterday, you were in a coma,

39
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,950
but today you're perfectly fine.

40
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,630
Is it because of Lu Xin's
exceptional medical skills?

41
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,690
Or is it because...

42
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,190
you drank my blood?

43
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,770
That day we first met,

44
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,310
when you were being chased
by the Yao Army,

45
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,720
I felt a powerful force

46
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,870
flow through me.

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,370
And from that moment on,

48
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,630
I had this urge

49
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
to protect you.

50
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,130
You're saying that

51
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
from the day I found you,

52
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,820
my blood

53
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,510
bound us together?

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,830
I thought...

55
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,590
all I needed was blood.

56
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,630
But after last night,

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I realized...

58
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,120
all I need is your blood.

59
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,780
I depend on your blood,

60
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,880
and your presence.

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
Once I'm away from you

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,730
or haven't seen you for a long time,

63
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,070
I'll suffer a heart-piercing pain.

64
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,160
That day you took me back
to the stone chamber,

65
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,470
I vaguely remember hearing them say...

66
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,930
Blood oath.

67
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,220
If that's the case,

68
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,260
why didn't you say anything

69
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,540
when I tried to drive you away that day?

70
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,210
I didn't say anything,

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
because I didn't want to scare you.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,750
I left

73
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,870
because you wanted me to.

74
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,680
Whatever you wish to do,

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,159
I'll do my best to make it happen.

76
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,950
Our blood oath may be real,

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,770
but my desire to protect you

78
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,390
is also real.

79
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,250
If it frightens you,

80
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,480
I'll leave again.

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Where would you go?

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,780
If you die, would that be on me?

83
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,910
So, you're worried about my safety.

84
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:09,930
If it's because

85
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,490
I took that strike for you,

86
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,240
then it was worth it.

87
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,360
You should focus on recovering first.

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
We'll worry about

89
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,680
the rest later.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,320
By the way,

91
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,630
those flowers...

92
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,520
they're beautiful.

93
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,450
Wait,

94
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,540
I want to verify something.

95
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,730
General,

96
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,710
as you ordered,

97
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,120
the soldiers have been training hard,

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,520
and not daring to slack off
for a single day.

99
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
Report!

100
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,080
General,

101
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,010
urgent news from the front line!

102
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,470
The Yao Army is on the move.

103
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,930
Our spy reported that

104
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,610
the Yao Army

105
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,659
has entered combat readiness.

106
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,370
Under the cover of night,

107
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,420
they're slowly

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,340
advancing toward our borders.

109
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,170
It seems

110
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,040
they intend to launch a surprise attack.

111
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,630
The Yao Army was defeated at Lucheng
less than a month ago.

112
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,140
During this time of regime change,

113
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,440
they suddenly sending out troops,

114
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,590
and now is not

115
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,080
a good time for them to start a war.

116
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,740
It seems

117
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,670
the Yao Army has
gotten the fake deployment map.

118
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,600
Since the Yao Army is so desperate,

119
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,159
we'll give it everything we've got.

120
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,930
[General's Residence]

121
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,440
Although we won

122
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,910
this battle,

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,510
the entire army,

124
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,600
the soldiers' drills,

125
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,510
the logistics management,

126
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,750
and every little detail

127
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,950
cannot be neglected.

128
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,030
The whole army

129
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,000
must remain ready at all times.

130
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Understood.

131
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,000
Is there anything else?

132
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,590
General,

133
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,490
you don't look well lately.

134
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,080
Is that so?

135
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,050
I hadn't noticed that.

136
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,000
General!

137
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,360
General!

138
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,200
The Young Master

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,100
is making a scene in the backyard!

140
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,430
We can't handle him,

141
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,650
please go there right away.

142
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,880
You head back to camp first.

143
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,520
Let's go.

144
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,680
To the fallen soldiers of Taijin...

145
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,410
Happy New Year!

146
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,360
Come get your money!

147
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
Young Master!

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Happy New Year!

149
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,360
Over there.

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,050
Soldiers!

151
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,460
Money's here!

152
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,690
Come get your money!

153
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,470
-Here, take the money.
-General!

154
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,240
General!

155
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,270
Please go talk to Young Master.

156
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,910
If this continues,

157
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,670
he'll burn the house down!

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
Happy New Year!

159
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,360
Soldiers!

160
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you going to do?

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,030
Kick over the fire basin

162
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,720
and beat him again?

163
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
What else can I do?

164
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,480
I thought he would reflect on his actions,

165
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,010
but he's only gotten worse.

166
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,190
Someone

167
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,430
claims to

168
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,470
treat soldiers like family,

169
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,550
but forgets about you on holidays!

170
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,360
Soldiers!

171
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,930
If you become vengeful ghosts,

172
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,480
don't let her off the hook!

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,390
Soldiers!

174
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,830
It's not like you haven't hit him before.

175
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,570
Did it help?

176
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,460
If you hit him, it only hurts you too.

177
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,780
Grab more clothes!

178
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,970
Buy more things.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,430
Since you know so much about
getting along with people,

180
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,960
and you were once a kid yourself,

181
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,550
you go.

182
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,630
Me?

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
You don't want to?

184
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,320
I can't hit him or scold him,

185
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
and you won't go talk to him.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,080
Fine.

187
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,040
Let him burn the whole residence down.

188
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,520
Then we'll be homeless.

189
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,030
Are we going to be homeless together?

190
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
Soldiers,

191
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,950
come get your money!

192
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,820
Just you.

193
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,550
Annoying Li Ting!

194
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,850
Take some silver

195
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,870
and buy yourselves nice things.

196
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,150
Alright, alright, you may leave now.

197
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,120
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
It's chaotic down there.

199
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,910
I'll burn some

200
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,560
handy weapons for you,

201
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
and this jar of wine.

202
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,740
It's the finest liquor.

203
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,110
It's cold down there,

204
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,230
drink more wine

205
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,370
to warm yourselves.

206
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,840
You knew it was dangerous,

207
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,430
why didn't you tell me?

208
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,470
Would it have made
any difference if I told you?

209
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,930
You're making such a big scene,

210
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,080
just to get Li Shuang's attention, right?

211
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,540
Something this dangerous

212
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,650
is exactly what you wanted.

213
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,800
That's nonsense!

214
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,670
Why would I want her attention?

215
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,030
She calls me immature

216
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,440
and reckless.

217
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,080
She just doesn't know...

218
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,600
that I care more about

219
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,080
those fallen soldiers than she ever could.

220
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,070
If you really care that much,

221
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,750
show some sincerity.

222
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,740
Burn something more valuable
than these incense.

223
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm sure their families
have already burned plenty of it.

224
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,080
You're so noble.

225
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,160
You should burn something valuable.

226
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,910
These soldiers suffered so much.

227
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,320
They spent years guarding our borders,

228
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,840
living on scraps,

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,790
and facing life and death
situation every day.

230
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,390
Your clothes are so fine,

231
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,250
they probably never even seen

232
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,170
fabric like this, let alone wore it.

233
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,000
This is the finest fabric

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,060
I received for my birthday last year.

235
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,510
That should be good enough

236
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,510
for the soldiers.

237
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,030
And these boots, these waterproof coats

238
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,740
that my nanny made all by hand.

239
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,970
You can have them all.

240
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,800
Is that enough now?

241
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,530
It should be enough.

242
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,760
Except for a pair of underpants.

243
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,090
Underpants are most important!

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,950
I think...

245
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,140
they might need a servant
to help out down there.

246
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,200
I should burn you and send you to them.

247
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,590
Why didn't you dodge?

248
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,260
You say you care about them.

249
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,210
Then tell me,

250
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,630
what are their names?

251
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,030
Where did they come from?

252
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,930
I don't know.

253
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,970
But Shuang may not know either.

254
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,180
Every soldier in the Changfeng Army

255
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,000
is registered in the records.

256
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,470
If they die in battle,

257
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,550
their names will be crossed off.

258
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,890
Why are...

259
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,840
all their names crossed out?

260
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,000
They were soldiers who died in battle.

261
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,010
They're no longer with us.

262
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,560
So many people died in one battle.

263
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,640
You're a general,

264
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,040
why would you do this yourself?

265
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,100
They fought alongside me for many years.

266
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,720
I should remember them.

267
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,750
Soldiers.

268
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,520
You are all brave men
of the Changfeng Army.

269
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,320
May your spirits

270
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,670
protect Shuang.

271
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,810
Please make her invulnerable,

272
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,940
and live a long life.

273
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,660
If you meet

274
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,220
the King of Hell down there,

275
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,570
please pass on a message for me.

276
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,590
If Shuang's lifespan is cut short,

277
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,450
please take mine to make up for it.

278
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,920
Your wounds just healed.

279
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,860
You should go back and rest now.

280
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,900
Do you think

281
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,460
she...

282
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,560
will forgive me?

283
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,450
Shuang asked me to tell you

284
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,860
that she cares about you a lot.

285
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,840
Of course she does!

286
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,390
She's my sister!

287
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,730
if she doesn't care about me,

288
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,390
who else would she care about?

289
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,580
By the way,

290
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,300
burn them cleanly.

291
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,780
That's very thoughtful of him.

292
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,590
Who asked you to tell him all that?

293
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,520
I only spoke your true feelings for you.

294
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,120
If you don't say some things,

295
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,840
others will never hear them.

296
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,520
That's true for Li Ting,

297
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,080
and it's true for you too.

298
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,160
So,

299
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,150
I don't have to be
a homeless anymore, right?

300
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,150
You don't want to?

301
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,770
There's never been a man in our residence,

302
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,010
yet he's so close to Shuang.

303
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,900
Could it be that Shuang and him...

304
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,080
No way.

305
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,720
I must find out

306
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,180
who this man really is.

307
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,550
It's one of us.

308
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,750
Brother.

309
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,480
Brother.

310
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,190
Chen.

311
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,250
You're finally back.

312
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,030
We thought

313
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,860
Empress Qin's assassins had gotten you.

314
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,670
This time,

315
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,770
I infiltrated Prince Annan's
funeral procession,

316
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,730
and managed

317
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,960
to sneak a look.

318
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,430
The corpse in the coffin,

319
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,510
had a damaged face,

320
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,040
making it unrecognizable.

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Although the build was similar,

322
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,400
there were subtle differences

323
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
compared to Prince Annan.

324
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,589
So you're saying

325
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,329
that person might not be Prince Annan.

326
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,200
Prince Annan might still be alive?

327
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,560
Be careful, walls have ears.

328
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,570
So that means...

329
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
Prince Annan is still alive.

330
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,880
Prince Annan's funeral

331
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,500
was arranged entirely by Empress Qin.

332
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,790
She grandly announced his death,

333
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,590
and the purpose was to

334
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,310
put the young prince on the throne.

335
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,710
So where is Prince Annan?

336
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,810
We can only hope that

337
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,230
Prince Annan is just missing,

338
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,040
and not in Empress Qin's hands.

339
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,350
Otherwise,

340
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,210
his chances of survival are slim.

341
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,070
Empress Qin

342
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,480
has always seen Prince Annan

343
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,920
as a thorn in her side.

344
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,540
We must act before she does

345
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,160
and find Prince Annan quickly.

346
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,750
That's easy for you to say.

347
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,090
Empress Qin first
disbanded the Black Armored Army,

348
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,890
and then she hunted us down.

349
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,830
Only the three of us

350
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,270
from the entire guard unit escaped.

351
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,000
How are we supposed to find him?

352
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
There's someone

353
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,490
who might be able to help us.

354
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,880
Who?

355
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,000
Prime Minister, Zuo Chengzhi.

356
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,160
He was close with Prince Annan.

357
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,800
We need to find a way

358
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,880
to reach Mr. Zuo.

359
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,640
With his help,

360
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,480
I believe

361
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,030
things will be easier.

362
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,910
[Yao State's Imperial Palace]

363
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,000
By decree of His Majesty

364
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,790
and the Empress Dowager,

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,680
Shi Du is hereby promoted

366
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,640
to General of the Cavalry,

367
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,960
and Zhao Jingyuan

368
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
to General of the Chariots.

369
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,200
Furthermore,

370
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,920
General Shi Du

371
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,480
is appointed to guard the Southern Pass.

372
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,110
Thank you, Your Majesties!

373
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,590
Your Majesties,

374
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,880
the General of the Cavalry
and the General of the Chariots

375
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,620
are crucial military positions.

376
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,930
Shi Du and Zhao Jingyuan

377
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,160
are still too inexperienced.

378
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,790
I'm afraid they are not suited
for these positions.

379
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,440
I implore

380
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,170
Your Majesties to reconsider.

381
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm not suited?

382
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,700
Is Prime Minister Zuo,
at this advanced age,

383
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,770
going to go to the front lines
and face the enemy?

384
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,640
After the Battle of Lucheng,

385
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,070
our army was severely weakened.

386
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,220
If Prince Annan were here,

387
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,550
he would likely advise rest and recovery.

388
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,830
Sending out troops rashly

389
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,030
would not be a wise decision.

390
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,090
I urge Your Majesties to reconsider.

391
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,190
In the Battle of Lucheng,

392
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,350
Duan Aodeng left his post
without permission,

393
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,350
causing our army

394
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,680
to be utterly defeated.

395
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,000
Her Majesty considered
he was the late emperor's brother,

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,680
so she chose not
to hold him accountable for the defeat,

397
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,240
and ordered a grand funeral for him.

398
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,480
Yet, Prime Minister Zuo

399
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,510
keeps mentioning Prince Annan.

400
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,270
Are you suggesting that without him,

401
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,550
our Yao State has no capable men left?

402
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,480
Prince Annan
spent his life on the battlefield,

403
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,160
and devoted his whole life to our state!

404
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,110
How dare you belittle him?

405
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,880
However,

406
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,080
I would like to ask Her Majesty.

407
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,160
Although Prince Annan was buried,

408
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
the body

409
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,680
in the coffin

410
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,070
was unrecognizable.

411
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,440
Furthermore,

412
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,640
all Prince Annan's guards

413
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,000
were slaughtered overnight.

414
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm afraid

415
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,350
someone's plotting behind the scenes.

416
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,750
There must be more

417
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,240
to Prince Annan's death.

418
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,770
How dare you, Zuo Chengzhi!

419
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,070
Are you saying someone
deliberately swapped the body

420
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,750
and hid Prince Annan?

421
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,880
That's absurd!

422
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
The late Emperor was assassinated,

423
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
and Prince Annan went with him.

424
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,440
No citizen of Yao State

425
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,170
can tolerate such
a national and personal debt.

426
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,920
We must

427
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,680
fight this war!

428
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,270
As for the burial,

429
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,030
the late Emperor and Prince Annan

430
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,880
were brave men of Yao State.

431
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,720
As a woman,

432
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,550
I could only do my best

433
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,130
to give them a dignified farewell.

434
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,230
Mr. Zuo, if you have doubts,

435
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,310
you are welcome to investigate yourself.

436
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,960
I will absolutely not

437
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,920
raise any objection.

438
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,030
Prince Annan

439
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,550
was our greatest general,

440
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,860
and the current Emperor's uncle.

441
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,480
Whether he lives or not

442
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,790
is of great significance.

443
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,440
I request

444
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,040
Your Majesties' permission

445
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,030
to send out

446
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,510
search parties,

447
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,830
leave no clue unchecked,

448
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,080
and put Your Majesties'

449
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,200
minds at ease.

450
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,640
Such loyalty from Minister Zuo

451
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,650
is truly Yao State's blessing.

452
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,160
Then let's do as
Prime Minister Zuo suggests.

453
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,480
Your Majesty is truly wise.

454
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,700
I ask for your punishment, Your Majesty.

455
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,030
Punishment?

456
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,190
You deserve to die a thousand times!

457
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,680
You couldn't even
manage a simple body swap,

458
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,000
and now Zuo Chengzhi holds this over us!

459
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,160
Your Majesty,

460
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Zuo Chengzhi is insolent.

461
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,540
Please allow me

462
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,830
to kill him for you.

463
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,070
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

464
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
You want to draw more attention now?

465
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,720
If you kill every court official,

466
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
who will serve me?

467
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,830
I admit my fault.

468
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Since those old fools

469
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,440
are so dedicated to Prince Annan,

470
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,480
then I'll bring him back

471
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,200
and have him work for me.

472
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,350
Let him keep those old ministers in check.

473
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,510
From now on,

474
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,350
no one will ever threaten

475
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,160
my son's throne again.

476
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,590
Jin Wujian.

477
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,400
I give you ten days.

478
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,860
You can bring him back, can't you?

479
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,440
I will return with
the shadow puppet and Jade Linglong

481
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,550
to see you,

482
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,480
and redeem myself.

483
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Get lost!

484
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,110
Aodeng.

485
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,920
Aodeng.

486
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Your Majesty.

487
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,880
Please don't blame me.

488
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,310
Only by locking you tightly

489
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,750
with these chains,

490
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,550
can we

491
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,720
stay together forever.

492
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,230
You came just in time.

493
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,440
The food's still hot,

494
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,570
let's eat together.

495
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,270
Come on.

496
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,790
Sit.

497
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,510
Have some soup first.

498
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,830
Why are you

499
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,920
only eating rice,

500
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,980
and not the dishes?

501
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,370
The rice is delicious.

502
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,810
Even if it's good,
you can't just eat rice.

503
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,110
Listen,

504
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,160
now that you're
at the General's Residence,

505
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,410
you're our guest.

506
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,580
No need to be formal with me.

507
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,570
It's just one more mouth to feed,

508
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,030
I can certainly afford it.

509
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,790
Try this.

510
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,200
No need.

511
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,010
What do you mean "no need"?

512
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm not really used to

513
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
eating these dishes.

514
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,870
Such a big table of food,

515
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,350
with sour, sweet, spicy, bitter and salty,

516
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,680
yet not a single dish suits your appetite?

517
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,350
I had the kitchen

518
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,750
make this chicken soup

519
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,010
especially for you, to help you recover.

520
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,920
The ingredients are great,

521
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,720
but...

522
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,260
the cooking method is a bit rough.

523
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,480
These dishes...

524
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,400
some too spicy,

525
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,270
some too salty.

526
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,720
The sweet and sour flavors are unbalanced.

527
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,240
The heat is poorly controlled.

528
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,350
But that's not the real problem.

529
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,330
The real problem is,

530
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,400
the seasonings are

531
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,480
added at random.

532
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,200
There's no method at all!

533
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,110
It completely covered
the food's natural taste,

534
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,960
leaving only blandness and fishiness.

535
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,420
It goes against
the very purpose of cooking.

536
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,480
I didn't realize you were so picky.

537
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,490
But this bowl of rice...

538
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
is absolutely exquisite.

539
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,840
It must be

540
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,580
from Lucheng's rice paddies.

541
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,630
From the field

542
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,720
to the bowl

543
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,230
in less than half a day.

544
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,880
No fancy skill needed,

545
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,110
yet it's

546
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,000
so soft, chewy, and tender.

547
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,240
It's so fragrant and delicious.

548
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,960
Perfect!

549
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
I didn't know

550
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,140
you knew so much about cooking.

551
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,030
I didn't know either.

552
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,440
But when I see these dishes,

553
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,590
these judgments just automatically

554
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,880
appear in my mind.

555
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's go.

556
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,270
Where to?

557
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,310
I'm taking you out to eat.

558
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,640
How can you recover without proper meals?

559
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,350
What would you like to eat?

560
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,400
[Sixu Clinic]

561
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,000
Is it spicy?

562
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,510
It's just a cup of tea.

563
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,640
What's the big deal?

564
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,460
I'm a grown-up now,

565
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,850
so naturally I should act like one.

566
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,160
Being grown-up
isn't about putting on airs.

567
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,550
First, you need to learn
to care for others,

568
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,830
especially your sister, Shuang,

569
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,310
Don't give her so much trouble.

570
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,440
Of course.

571
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,350
Tell me,

572
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,510
what brings you here?

573
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,390
I want to ask you

574
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,720
about someone.

575
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,830
Take care.

576
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,110
Please come again.

577
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,780
Please come in.

578
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,350
No wonder Manxiang Restaurant
is Lucheng's best restaurant.

579
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,440
This fish tastes fresher

580
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,370
than the ones right out of the lake.

581
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,240
I'll accept that the fish

582
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,300
is worth the price,

583
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,510
but why put so much gold leaf on it?

584
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,960
It's not even edible.

585
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,880
Well,

586
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
dishes should look, smell, and taste good.

587
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
The fish is fresh and tender,

588
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,110
but the color is a bit dull.

589
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,680
A touch of gold leaf

590
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,960
can definitely stimulate the appetite.

591
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,690
It's an art on the dining table.

592
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,310
Art?

593
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,670
I don't really get it.

594
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,110
But you seem to know a lot about this.

595
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,110
Could it be...

596
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,400
that you used to be

597
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,680
a young master before?

598
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,820
A young master from a noble family

599
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,200
and a general's daughter...

600
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,140
That sounds like a perfect match.

601
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,830
In your dreams!

602
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,780
What nonsense are you talking about?

603
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,170
If I were a noble young master,

604
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,840
besides knowing about food,

605
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,730
I'd surely know
a thing or two about clothes.

606
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,800
Shall we try?

607
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,240
Please come again!

608
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,830
Since you're living in my residence,

609
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,660
I'll reluctantly get you

610
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,690
a few outfits.

611
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,750
Let's go.

612
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,310
Distinguished guests,

613
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,270
please come in.

614
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,940
This one suits you.

615
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,480
The fabric is light and thin,

616
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,800
and feels smooth to the touch.

617
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,640
Unfortunately,

618
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,030
the weaving is poorly done,

619
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,280
The cloud patterns are all messed up.

620
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,610
This one suits you well.

621
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,830
It looks good,

622
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,000
but...

623
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,340
the embroidery’s too flashy,

624
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,320
too extravagant,

625
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,090
not elegant.

626
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,910
This one's color and fabric

627
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,870
are nice.

628
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,270
This one is great!

629
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,640
But if I wear it in this weather,

630
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,440
I'll definitely get a heat rash.

631
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,990
Since you have so many opinions,

632
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,170
pick one yourself.

633
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,500
Go ahead.

634
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,920
I'll take this one.

635
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,720
Young master, you have excellent taste!

636
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,310
This is our newest arrival.

637
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,200
It's the most expensive

638
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,550
brocade this season.

639
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,790
This quality is great!

640
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,790
We even have

641
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,110
a ready-made outfit,

642
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,770
I'll fetch it for you to try on.

643
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll go get it.

644
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,840
Why are you staring at me?

645
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,830
I'm just wondering

646
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,430
when you became so generous.

647
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,350
It's not about generosity.

648
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,450
I just don't care much
about food or clothing.

649
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,510
You've been at my residence for so long,

650
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,880
and helped me so much.

651
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,200
You even

652
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,600
risked your life
to save me more than once.

653
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,400
Getting you a decent outfit

654
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,640
is the least I can do.

655
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,710
I didn't know the General

656
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,560
could say such nice things.

657
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,200
What you just said

658
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,240
makes me happier than getting that outfit.

659
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,480
You're happy with just a few words?

660
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,240
Well, that saves me money.

661
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,170
Shopkeeper, about that fabric...

662
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,240
I just complimented your generosity.

663
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,340
Jin'an?

664
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,540
You think he'd be
a good brother-in-law, too?

665
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Brother-in-law?

666
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,870
He's just a lowly servant.

667
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,860
How could he be worthy of Shuang?

668
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,440
I don't like hearing you talk like that.

669
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,920
All beings are equal. We all go through
life, aging, sickness, and death.

670
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,550
There's no high or low status.

671
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,270
Besides, he's not a servant.

672
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,200
He's the one who saved your life.

673
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,480
If he hadn't killed Huo Du

674
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,510
and rescued you,

675
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,960
would you still be here

676
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,750
leisurely

677
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,240
sipping tea with me?

678
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,640
He killed Huo Du?

679
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,200
Even though the court

680
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,680
demoted your father,

681
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,350
Shuang valued loyalty

682
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,830
and didn't turn him in.

683
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,440
That day at the residence,

684
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,550
he took a strike for Shuang.

685
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,270
Sharing life and death,

686
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,730
it's a very touching move.

687
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,050
Don't you think they'd make a good match?

688
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,200
How is it?

689
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
It suits you well.

690
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,400
You're right, miss.

691
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,750
Our shop

692
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,070
tailors clothes for many warriors,

693
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,330
and has quite the reputation in Jianghu.

694
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,350
Look at him.

695
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,590
Such a handsome gentleman.

696
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,960
And with our clothes,

697
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,880
he's even more charming.

698
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,060
Miss?

699
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
Please wrap up the old clothes,

700
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,370
he'll wear this outfit.

701
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,170
Sure!

702
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,390
I'm on it.

703
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,680
Perhaps I really was a warrior before.

704
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,200
A warrior

705
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,110
sounds more fitting
for a general's daughter.

706
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,400
Helping the weak and saving the world.

707
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,530
Robbing the rich and helping the poor.

708
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,950
Indeed,

709
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,020
you've robbed quite a lot from me.

710
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,080
Let's forget the meal earlier.

711
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
But for this outfit,

712
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,720
we'll split the bill.

713
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,200
I've already paid my share,

714
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,530
and I'll deduct your part from your wages.

715
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,960
Didn't you say it was a gift?

716
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,270
A gift

717
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,310
has its limits.

718
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,680
Besides,

719
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,200
didn't you just say

720
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,820
you wanted to be worthy
of a general's daughter?

721
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,680
Fine, deduct it then.

722
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,880
You can't be unaware of

723
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,100
what's happening in your family, right?

724
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,190
The tea's getting cold.
I'll go heat it up for you.

725
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,150
It's fine.

726
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,659
Family matters never concerned me.

727
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,670
My father and Shuang
have their own ways of handling things.

728
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,270
If Shuang didn't turn him in,

729
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,739
she must have her reasons.

730
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,020
I've known you for a long time,

731
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,020
but that's the first time
you've said something

732
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,820
that sounds like an adult.

733
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,949
Really?

734
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,760
Yeah.

735
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,389
There's one more thing
I want to ask, Lu.

736
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,360
Go ahead.

737
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,190
The smoke the assassin used that day,

738
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,960
was it harmful to Shuang?

739
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
It's just some cheap, outdated stuff,

740
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,280
with a pungent smell.

741
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,480
Shuang held her breath
and didn't inhale any.

742
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,320
Don't worry.

743
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,030
So it was low-quality stuff.

744
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,670
With your advanced medical skills,

745
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,920
and you love collecting rare medicines,

746
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,550
I'm sure you have

747
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,680
some high-quality ones.

748
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,720
Show me.

749
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,510
You slipped up,

750
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,970
and made me unhappy,

751
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
so you should make it up to me.

752
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,770
Alright, alright,

753
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,660
I'll let you have a quick look.

754
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,630
This medicine is amazing.

755
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,630
It looks dazzling,

756
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,800
but when you put it in food,

757
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,360
it disappears without a trace.

758
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Just a tiny bit

759
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,270
can make someone sleep for hours.

760
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,040
It's my secret formula.

761
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,800
You're impressive.

762
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,070
The tea...

763
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,320
I just drank

764
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,870
wasn't sweet enough.

765
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,310
Do you have any sugar?

766
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,290
You still have a child's taste, I see.

767
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:56,740
Wait a moment.

768
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,270
I'll add some sugar for you.

769
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,720
Add plenty, please.

770
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,590
General.

771
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,240
Since it's going to

772
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,480
be deducted from my wages anyway,

773
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,340
one more won't make a difference.

774
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,510
The way

775
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,970
you checked the clothes earlier,

776
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,630
I thought

777
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,550
it might have
something to do with your past.

778
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,800
If you're willing,

779
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,370
whenever you remember something,

780
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,040
I'll be here to uncover it with you.

781
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,280
Treating yourself well sometimes

782
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,740
isn't really indulgence.

783
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,490
You deserve all the beautiful things

784
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,450
this world has to offer.
