00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,840
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 9]

3
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,410
My Lord, please calm down.

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,479
Calm down?

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,759
Li Shuang showed me such disrespect.

6
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,680
How can I possibly calm down?

7
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,190
To upset yourself so much

8
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,039
over a criminal's daughter

9
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,150
is not worth it.

10
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,840
Had I known Li Shuang was so arrogant,

11
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,680
I'd have given her dozens more strokes.

12
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,430
You,

13
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,310
write a letter to the court at once.

14
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,870
Report that the one who killed Huo Du
is hiding in the Changfeng Army.

15
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,530
If Li Shuang dares shield him,

16
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,750
I'd like to see
how she's going to pull that off.

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,360
My Lord,

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,660
that's not advisable.

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Li Shuang must know

20
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,050
that he was just a servant,

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,760
and even if he were handed to the court,

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,340
His Majesty wouldn't be satisfied.

23
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,750
Yet to protect him,

24
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,280
she fell out with you in public,

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,410
even at the risk of crossing Prince Li.

26
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,350
Looks like that boy

27
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,350
means a great deal to her.

28
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,120
Have you looked into his background?

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,190
His name is Jin'an.

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,190
I heard that Li Shuang
took him back a while ago.

31
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,240
He's homeless,

32
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,780
a useless wretch with no martial skills.

33
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,650
No martial skills?

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,150
Then how did he kill Huo Du?

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,060
I've already investigated it.

36
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,530
It was just an accident.

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,550
They say
he merely pushed Huo Du accidentally,

38
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,560
and that worthless fool just died.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Sit. Tell me more.

40
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,790
So you're suggesting

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,940
that I do Li Shuang a favor and let it go?

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,030
Exactly, My Lord.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,310
Although Li Wei has been demoted,

44
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,030
the Li family and the Changfeng Army

45
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,190
are not to be underestimated.

46
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,310
If you can persuade

47
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,630
Li Shuang to align with Prince Li,

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,560
His Highness will surely be pleased,

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
and you'll win

50
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,150
His Highness's favor.

51
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,520
If Li Shuang still refuses to cooperate,

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,470
you can bide your time to deal with her

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
and Jin'an later.

54
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,160
Send word to the General's Residence.

55
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,670
Tell them I'll pay a visit

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,960
later today.

57
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes.

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,280
Who does Li Zhangyi think he is?

59
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,860
He hurt you so badly.

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,700
You always worry about me.

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
But after all these years by my side,

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
you should be used to it.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,180
Don't I always get injured

64
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,030
now and then?

65
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,120
How could I ever get used to it?

66
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,600
You're my best friend.

67
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,680
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

68
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,070
At worst,

69
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,140
I'll be more careful.

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,140
I just need to be more careful.

71
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,130
You're always trying to be tough.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,730
I'm leaving now.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Remember to apply the ointment.

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,409
Don't worry.

75
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,659
I'll be fine soon.

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,670
What's wrong?

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,120
Nothing.

78
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
Take care on the road.

79
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm off.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,070
Shuang,

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
it's over between you
and the Crown Prince.

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,560
Rather than dwelling on the past,

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,790
you should let it go

84
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,600
and cherish what you have now.

85
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Ji.

86
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,680
Miss.

87
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,230
Although this is the General's Residence,

88
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,720
it's also where Shuang lives.

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,050
With women everywhere,

90
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,830
your frequent visits

91
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,970
may not be proper.

92
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,600
Miss,

93
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,810
you misunderstand.

94
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,050
I'm here to report
something important to General.

95
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,000
Judging from your expression

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,630
and gait,

97
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,210
it doesn't seem like an urgent matter

98
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,070
that requires a personal visit.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,140
You know best
if there's any misunderstanding.

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,720
I am

101
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
just offering a friendly reminder.

102
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,390
Just now,

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,480
I took matters into my own hands.

104
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,280
You don't blame me?

105
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,830
You owned up to it.

106
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,180
In that situation,

107
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,360
you stepped out and took the blame.

108
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
Why would I blame you?

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,420
But what you did today

110
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,750
has pulled you

111
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,890
into this power struggle.

112
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,800
They won't

113
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,690
let you off easily.

114
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,730
Li Zhangyi is Prince Li's man.

115
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,630
Prince Li is

116
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,070
both favored

117
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,990
and trusted
by His Majesty.

118
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,210
Why didn't you compromise?

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,820
Prince Li is ambitious

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,730
and aspires to be the crown prince.

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,830
If he truly gains military power,

122
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,490
he will certainly start a war.

123
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,000
When that day comes,

124
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,760
it's the common folks who will suffer.

125
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,830
Since ancient times,

126
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,750
the fight for the throne
has always been bloody.

127
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,600
Perhaps you're just a pawn too.

128
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,700
Why get yourself involved?

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,680
Perhaps

130
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,390
I am just a pawn.

131
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,800
But I don't want to be involved
in court politics.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,750
I only know

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,100
that behind me stand the Li family

134
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,280
and the Changfeng Army.

135
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,370
All I want is to protect

136
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,270
the people I should protect.

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
I decided to come back

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,850
because I wanted to face this with you.

139
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,780
It's my fault that I failed

140
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,460
to protect youâ€”

141
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,250
letting Li Zhangyi hurt you like this.

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,560
Being in the eye of the storm,

143
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,150
I'm bound to suffer a little.

144
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:31,990
Genâ€¦

145
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,670
General.

146
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,790
Li Zhangyi has sent word.

147
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,720
Tonight,

148
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,420
he'll visit you in person.

149
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,410
Make the arrangements.

150
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,790
Prepare a banquet for him.

151
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,200
Yes.

152
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,110
Your wound has opened again.

153
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,070
Let me bandage it for you.

154
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,550
It might hurt a bit.

155
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Let me attend tonight's banquet

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,920
with you.

157
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,190
You said
I'm already involved in this struggle.

158
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,120
If you hide me away on purpose,

159
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,600
Li Zhangyi

160
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,900
certainly won't let it go.

161
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,980
Besides, if I'm there,

162
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,080
I can protect you.

163
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,590
Protect me? How?

164
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,170
You're as weak as a kitten now,

165
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,750
and you've lost the supernatural strength
you had as a child.

166
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,480
How are you going to protect me?

167
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,970
Last time you took a blade for me

168
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,750
and barely survived.

169
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,670
Instead of risking your life for me,

170
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
I'd rather

171
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,080
you stay alive and well.

172
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,150
As the mastermind behind everything,

173
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,390
she surely knows
you're bound by the blood pact

174
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,520
and can't leave her.

175
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,550
She wants you to obey her willingly.

176
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
What's wrong?

177
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,550
Nothing.

178
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,790
Don't move.

179
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
You're bleeding.

180
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,670
If I still had some of my strength,

181
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,730
I could at least do something for you.

182
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,440
But things are so unpredictable with me,

183
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
and I might never return to how I was.

184
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm completely useless now.

185
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,170
Why are you still willing
to keep me by your side?

186
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,510
Most of the women

187
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,910
in my residence

188
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,320
are homeless castaways.

189
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Since you have nowhere to go,

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,840
you might as well stay here for now.

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,670
Besides,

192
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
there's still

193
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,180
the blood pact between us.

194
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,910
There's a dense forest outside Lucheng.

195
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,720
Three days from now,

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,390
you must find a way

197
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,320
to bring Li Shuang there.

198
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,910
Only then

199
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,350
can I have a chance
to break your blood pact.

200
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,630
To you,

201
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,030
is this blood pact

202
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,120
a blessing

203
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,030
or a curse?

204
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
If it could be broken,

205
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,120
would you try?

206
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,930
Orâ€¦

207
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,530
would you still choose to keep me here?

208
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,670
Mr. Ji.

209
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,240
How is General?

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,240
Her wound's been dressed.

211
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Nothing serious.

212
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,390
What did you

213
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,120
and General do

214
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,750
in Ninglan?

215
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,970
You're her right-hand man.

216
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,320
Why are you asking

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,440
an outsider like me?

218
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,930
Wouldn't it be quicker

219
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,330
to ask her directly?

220
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,820
When you speak of General,

221
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,240
show some respect.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,530
Exercising your authority

223
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,440
on the battlefield is not enough,

224
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,700
and now you're forcing me
to be grateful?

225
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,200
You have no right
to complain about General.

226
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
If it weren't for you,

227
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,550
she wouldn't have been punished today.

228
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,790
Your past is suspicious.

229
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,590
She already showed you mercy
by sparing your life.

230
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,320
Before leaving for Ninglan,

231
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,490
she even asked me to find your portrait

232
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,080
and look into your past,

233
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,660
just to give you a surprise.

234
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,750
Why did she do that?

235
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,960
You saved Young Master.

236
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,880
That makes her indebted to you.

237
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,950
If you dare use that debt of gratitude

238
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
and be rude to her,

239
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,790
I'll kill you myself.

240
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,840
She cares so much about me,

241
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,270
yet I let others mislead me

242
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,770
and doubted her.

243
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,510
My sharp senses

244
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,830
are back.

245
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,170
General,

246
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,480
Lord Li has arrived.

247
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,970
General, I gave you strokes today.

248
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
Though it was official business,

249
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
I fear it might have offended you

250
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,830
and damaged our bond as colleagues.

251
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,120
I hope you won't take offense.

252
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,880
You overthink it, My Lord.

253
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,250
Achievements should be rewarded.

254
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,580
Mistakes should be punished.

255
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,710
That's the rule of the Changfeng Army.

256
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Speaking of rules,

257
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,810
tell me then,

258
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,560
is Jin'an killing Huo Du

259
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,960
an achievementâ€¦

260
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,890
or a mistake?

261
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,110
I was just joking.

262
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,410
The Changfeng Army is known
for its strict discipline.

263
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,370
If you insist on protecting him,

264
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,270
you must have your reasons.

265
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,640
It's just that

266
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,070
when I think of Mr. Li,

267
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,410
who has illustrious military achievements

268
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,210
yet is affected because of this,

269
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,490
I feel bad for him.

270
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,140
This dagger is forged of cold iron,

271
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,100
sharp enough to cut through steel.

272
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,720
The pearl on its hilt
is
from the southern seasâ€”

273
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,800
a once-in-a-century find.

274
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,240
Prince Li,

275
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,070
knowing your fondness
for fine weapons,

276
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,970
had this dagger made

277
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,360
especially for you.

278
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,920
Prince Li is

279
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,210
of noble rank.

280
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,750
His gift
is

281
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,070
lavish indeed.

282
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,090
Unfortunately,

283
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,030
I,

284
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,110
as a rough warrior,

285
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,150
am not used to such delicate things.

286
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,230
I'm afraid I can't accept

287
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,940
His Highness's kindness.

288
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,530
General Li,

289
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,640
you truly don't know what's good for you.

290
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,350
Have you forgotten your place

291
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,080
after being admired for so long

292
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,540
at the border?

293
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,400
Lord Li,

294
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
you are mistaken.

295
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,070
The Li family
is Taijin's loyal subject.

296
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,290
The Changfeng Army

297
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,730
consists of Taijin citizens.

298
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,860
For generations,

299
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,890
we've only sought to defend Taijin.

300
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,770
We know

301
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,720
our duty

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and have never forgotten our place.

303
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,200
My Lord,

304
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,560
General Li is devoted
to serving the country.

305
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
That's a blessing to Taijin.

306
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,350
Indeed,

307
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,030
I came today

308
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,110
just to have a simple meal

309
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,720
and offer my apologies.

310
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,090
I didn't expect

311
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
to upset you again, General.

312
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,830
My bad.

313
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
My bad.

314
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,000
Just sitting here eating and drinking
is so boring.

315
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,830
Why not

316
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,140
arrange some entertainment?

317
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,440
No girl in your residence

318
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,480
is ordinary.

319
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,250
I'm afraid

320
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,350
they can't sing or dance.

321
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,960
I heard that you're skilled

322
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,400
in riding and archery.

323
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,170
As it happens,

324
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,070
I know a thing or two about them.

325
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Why don't we

326
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,720
have a contest?

327
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,710
What do you say?

328
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,830
Lord Li,

329
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,720
General is injured

330
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,070
and shouldn't draw a bow.

331
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,000
Please allow me

332
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,030
to take her place.

333
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,070
Generals get injured

334
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,110
in battle all the time,

335
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,780
but the war still goes on.

336
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,550
Surely they wouldn't

337
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,010
surrender just because of

338
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,710
an injury.

339
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,830
-But...
-Ji Ran,

340
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,490
stand down.

341
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,730
Don't spoil the fun for Lord Li.

342
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,310
Yes.

343
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,160
Lord Li,

344
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,840
please.

345
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,880
General,

346
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,100
since it's a contest,

347
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,400
shouldn't we

348
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,100
place a wager
to make it more interesting?

349
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,640
My Lord, what do you have in mind?

350
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,990
If I win,

351
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,410
you must accept

352
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,370
the precious dagger from Prince Li.

353
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,310
And if you lose?

354
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,240
If you lose,

355
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,570
you'll drop all charges against Jin'an.

356
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,330
As for Huo Du

357
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,020
colluding with the Yao State,

358
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,960
I will give His Majesty

359
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,620
a satisfactory explanation.

360
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,110
Report!

361
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,910
Lord Li scored nine points.

362
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,070
Seven points.

363
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,270
Eight points.

364
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,030
Nine points.

365
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,480
Six points.

366
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,530
A total of 39 points.

367
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,640
General,

368
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,560
you'd better think it through.

369
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,540
With Prince Li's help in the capital,

370
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,340
your father

371
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,800
would surely suffer less.

372
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,350
Since General's wager concerns me,

373
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,810
I should be the one

374
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,440
to shoot the arrows.

375
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,110
What do you think, Lord Li?

376
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,200
Your fate

377
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
should be in your own hands.

378
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,610
But if you take her place,

379
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,120
the rules are broken,

380
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,510
and the wager

381
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,580
must double.

382
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,450
Anything you say, My Lord.

383
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,750
Very well.

384
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,030
Thenâ€¦

385
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,350
we'll wager your life.

386
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,970
Lord Li!

387
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,020
As you wish.

388
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,010
Missed.

389
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,970
Zero points.

390
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,640
10 points.

391
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,590
10 points.

392
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,780
10 points.

393
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,160
10 points.

394
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,440
Total of 40 points.

395
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,430
Since

396
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,430
we had a bet,

397
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,800
I hope you

398
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,690
will honor your agreement.

399
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,240
Fine.

400
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,630
Let's go.

401
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,240
You've been by my side for so long,

402
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,160
yet I had no idea

403
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,600
you had such remarkable skills.

404
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,240
Your wound is bleeding again.

405
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,640
Let me bandage it for you.

406
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,140
You deliberately
missed the target earlier.

407
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,270
You were testing me.

408
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,110
He threatened you with your father,

409
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,760
so I had to know where your heart lies.

410
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,400
Youâ€¦

411
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,400
I heard it.

412
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,260
Where my heart lies has never changed.

413
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,030
Do you think I only care

414
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,030
about my father?

415
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,480
I care about your life too.

416
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,440
We've only

417
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,790
known each other for a few months.

418
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,480
I shouldn't

419
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
mean so much to you.

420
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,590
Why do you care so much

421
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,010
about whether I live or die?

422
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,140
In these chaotic times,

423
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,800
staying alive is hard enough.

424
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,600
How could I let you die so easily?

425
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,100
Ji Ran told me

426
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,810
you went to Zang Budu

427
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,880
to find out about my past,

428
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,540
not to investigate me.

429
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,180
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,130
I haven't uncovered anything yet.

431
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
There was nothing to say.

432
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,590
Perhaps you're right.

433
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,830
We've not known each other long.

434
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,400
I shouldn't have pried.

435
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,310
It's my fault

436
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,270
this time.

437
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,820
If I'd had more patience

438
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,410
or thought things through,

439
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,050
maybe I wouldn't have misunderstood you.

440
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,410
I overestimated myselfâ€¦

441
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,020
and underestimated you.

442
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,930
Then tell meâ€”

443
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,190
back in Ninglan,
you were already acting strange.

444
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,720
After we returned,
you kept testing me.

445
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
What is it you're hiding from me?

446
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,440
That's the whole story.

447
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,710
Do you have anything to say?

448
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,710
You already have doubts.

449
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,600
I have nothing to say.

450
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,720
Since I lost my memory,

451
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
that was the first time
someone had mentioned my past.

452
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,270
Naturally, I had to think it over.

453
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,610
But I figured it out.

454
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,870
I trust you.

455
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,080
You've lost all your memories.

456
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,880
What makes you trust me?

457
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,440
Without memories,

458
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,380
I still have my intuition.

459
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,030
You've never mistreated me

460
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,230
or anyone around you.

461
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,830
I trust what I see

462
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,480
and what I feel.

463
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,180
What about the blood pact?

464
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,470
It inflicts excruciating pain on you

465
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,880
and robs you of freedom.

466
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,500
If it could be broken,

467
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,800
why not give it a try?

468
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,680
If it can be broken,

469
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,120
I'll find the way myself

470
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,940
instead of putting you in danger with me.

471
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,140
Have you consideredâ€¦

472
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,690
maybe that person

473
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,410
was telling the truth?

474
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
I want to tell you

475
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,400
that even if the blood pact

476
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,060
was deliberately made by you,

477
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,010
I still want to have

478
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,930
a deeper bond with you.

479
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,980
She keeps you by her side

480
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,440
just to use you

481
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,880
and turn you

482
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,970
into a bloodthirsty beast.

483
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,150
Since I've chosen to trust Li Shuang,

484
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,240
I can't let him influence me.

485
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,520
Master.

486
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,550
It's still early.

487
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,240
That shadow puppet

488
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,370
might show up later.

489
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,330
You still don't understand human nature.

490
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,480
I gave him three days.

491
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,110
If he meant to come,

492
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,460
he'd be here already.

493
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,850
Empress Dowager's 10-day limit
is almost up.

494
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,920
What should we do?

495
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,590
Ultimately,

496
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,060
a shadow puppet can't live
without their blood master.

497
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,420
If we control Li Shuang,

498
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,540
the shadow puppet
will be easy to deal with.

499
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,110
I've changed your dressing.

500
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,790
Be careful these days.

501
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,920
Don't get injured again,

502
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,650
understand?

503
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
Sorry for troubling you.

504
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,750
Don't be absurd.

505
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,610
There's no trouble at all.

506
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,880
Your quick recovery

507
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,830
is the best reward

508
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,230
for me as your physician.

509
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,560
I'll write you a prescription.

510
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,960
Take the medicine for a few days.

511
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
It's just a superficial wound.

512
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,160
Why do I need to take medicine?

513
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,220
That's exactly it.

514
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,220
Normally, this kind of wound

515
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
would almost be healed in a few days.

516
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,570
Why is it healing so slowly this time?

517
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,350
Your body must not be

518
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,720
as strong as before.

519
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,890
Look at youâ€”

520
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,240
pale as a ghost.

521
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,070
One might think

522
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,730
you've been drained of blood.

523
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,350
Could it really

524
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,040
be related to Jin'an taking my blood?

525
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,400
This one

526
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,600
is the prescription.

527
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,190
And this map

528
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,510
shows a natural hot spring

529
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,140
in the forest outside the city.

530
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,200
You only need to soak in it

531
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,090
for about 30 minutes,

532
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,360
and it'll promote blood circulation

533
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
and fade scars.

534
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,160
When you're better,

535
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,290
go there regularly.

536
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,770
I don't have time for that.

537
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,550
Make time!

538
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,590
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

539
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,450
I'll go.

540
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,920
Who is there?

541
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,310
Don't waste your energy.

542
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,409
My camp was ambushed

543
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,320
twice before.

544
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,810
You were behind it?

545
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,310
Sharp as ever, General.

546
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,230
What is it you want?

547
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,000
What you picked up in the Barren Forest

548
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,679
was mine to begin with.

549
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,739
I just want it back.

550
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,190
You mean

551
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,560
Jin'an?

552
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,590
Your approach

553
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,800
is inappropriate.

554
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,900
Then call me presumptuous.

555
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,360
But I'm doing it for your sake.

556
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,070
Having someone of unknown origin
by your side

557
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,320
must be unsettling.

558
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,739
Give him to me

559
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,110
so we don't have to go against each other.

560
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,510
I took him in,

561
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,840
so he's mine now.

562
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,050
Whether I keep him

563
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,150
or kill him,

564
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,360
no one else has any say in it.

565
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,400
Is that so?

566
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,740
Then you'll have to suffer for it.

567
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,940
How is this happening?

568
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,950
Li Shuang.

569
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,880
Holding out until now

570
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,630
and still not begging for mercy.

571
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,030
You deserve your reputation
as Taijin's top female general.

572
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,630
I never expected

573
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,590
such a perfect fusion.

574
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,420
Li Shuang!

575
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,150
No!

576
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,560
If you don't want her to die,

577
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,940
you must come with me.

578
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then I'll let her go.

579
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,700
I'll go with you.

580
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,030
So you truly love your blood master.

581
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,590
Tell me,

582
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,880
after each transformation,

583
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,590
are you always this lucid?

584
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,120
Yes.

585
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,430
How long does it last?

586
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,590
Two hours.

587
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,520
I never imagined

588
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,280
Jade Linglong
could fuse with you
so perfectly.

589
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,230
So you're the one

590
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,760
behind all this.

591
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Now that you know,

592
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,220
you must realizeâ€”

593
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,630
only I hold the answers

594
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,420
to your past.

595
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,600
Come with me,

596
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,030
and I'll give you the answers.

597
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,150
What do you say?

598
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,510
Master.

599
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,710
Let's go.

600
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,500
[General's Residence]

601
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,360
Urgent military report!

602
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,940
General is not in the residence now.

603
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,820
Do you know

604
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,610
where she is at the moment?

605
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,360
General!

606
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,480
General!

607
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,190
General!

608
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,160
General!

609
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,240
General!

610
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,360
General!

611
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,720
General!

612
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,120
General,

613
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,760
the enemy has reached the border.
