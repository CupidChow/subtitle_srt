[Episode 30]

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,280
So I will

4
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,640
take Li Shuang away
from Yunjing as soon as possible.

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,350
Su Muyang

6
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,120
fears the Changfeng Army's power,

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,640
so he won't dare move against you.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,840
What if Shuang refuses?

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
As long as you don't stop me,

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,150
I'll find a way.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,479
And if I do stop you?

12
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,900
Then I'll stick around until you give in.

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,910
Good.

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,220
Only someone with your character

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
can truly protect her.

16
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,590
Shuang insists on returning to the capital

17
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,230
because she doesn't want to implicate
the Li family and the Changfeng Army.

18
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,120
She always feels she owes me her life.

19
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,520
Loyalty, filial piety, propriety,
and righteousness—

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,840
these values that shaped her

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,700
are also close to destroying her.

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Right now,

23
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,280
only you can break

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,740
these deadly constraints

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,050
and set her free.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Grand General, I won't let you down.

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,410
This Dragon Sword
has been with me for years.

28
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,940
Today, I give it to you

29
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,280
as a gift

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,020
for your future wedding with Shuang.

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
From now on,

32
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,860
keep her safe for me.

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,430
If she refuses to leave

34
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,890
and keeps being stubborn,

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,680
show her this sword and tell her,

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,560
"You are Li Wei's daughter."

37
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,270
If she enters the palace,

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
she'll only become a hostage,

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
a pawn His Majesty will use

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,910
to purge or control me.

41
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,720
Only if she escapes far away

42
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,750
will I be free of worry.

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,200
I understand.

44
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,950
I won't disappoint you, Grand General.

45
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,470
Master,

46
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,770
as you instructed,

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,079
the flag has been cleaned

48
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,870
and restored completely.

49
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,720
[Annan]

50
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,150
This is the military flag
of the Black Armor Army

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,740
under Prince Annan Duan Aodeng
of Yao State.

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,130
Back then, during the Battle of Lucheng,

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,750
when the Emperor of Yao State
reached the border area,

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,270
I led a team

55
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,960
to pursue him.

56
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,810
Grand General,

57
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,540
the wheel tracks lead that way.

58
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,310
This is our only chance to capture
the Emperor of Yao State alive.

59
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,790
You guys stay here.

60
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,160
If we haven't returned

61
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,350
by dawn,

62
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,650
go back to camp and report.

63
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,510
Grand General!

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
This mission

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,250
is certainly perilous,

66
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,140
but if it can end the war
between the two nations,

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,230
it will be a blessing.

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,100
This is
the Emperor of Yao State's carriage.

69
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,580
Let's split up and surround them.

70
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,920
Duan Aoze.

71
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,310
Li Wei?

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,120
Today, my victory may not be honorable,

73
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,290
but for the sake of all people,

74
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,740
I must capture you alive.

75
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,760
At present,

76
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,020
Yao State has sent envoys
to negotiate peace.

77
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,550
There are some conditions
we cannot concede,

78
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,390
but we should return prisoners of war

79
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,510
to show sincerity.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,270
This military flag

81
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,950
will be returned as well.

82
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,870
What's wrong with you?

83
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,770
Forgive my rudeness.

84
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,160
I suddenly feel unwell.

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll take my leave first.

86
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,800
Come and catch me!

87
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,480
Wait for me!

88
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,870
I'm coming for you! I'm coming for you!

89
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,480
Hurry up!

90
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,310
Aodeng,

91
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,440
are you alright?

92
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,120
Long live Your Majesty!

93
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,909
This military flag

94
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,240
is also a trophy taken that day.

95
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,970
Did you really see it clearly?

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,640
I dare not speak recklessly.

97
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,370
Though that person's behavior

98
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,310
was completely different
from Prince Annan,

99
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,630
their voice and appearance

100
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,830
were very similar.

101
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,430
This matter is extremely serious.

102
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:20,950
Therefore,

103
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,410
I rode back as fast as I could
to report to you.

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,390
How did he react

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,030
when he saw you?

106
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,690
He was indifferent.

107
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,480
So I couldn't confirm his identity.

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,909
However,

109
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,510
he seems to have some conflict

110
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,970
with the Emperor of Taijin

111
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,840
because of General Li Shuang

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,100
of the Changfeng Army.

113
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,110
Jin Wujian hasn't returned to report yet.

114
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,680
He is most likely already dead.

115
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,960
This person must certainly be Duan Aodeng.

116
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,760
Since we can no longer control
the shadow puppet,

117
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,430
I absolutely cannot let him
return alive to Yao State.

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Your Majesty,

119
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,140
although we declared early on
that Prince Annan was dead,

120
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,840
his former supporters in the court

121
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,240
have never accepted it

122
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,760
and have been secretly searching for him.

123
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,400
His Majesty is still young

124
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,310
and his position is not yet secure.

125
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,710
Whether this person is Prince Annan
or not,

126
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I think

127
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,840
we cannot afford to be careless.

128
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,120
You just said

129
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,600
Su Muyang had a falling out with him

130
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,070
because of that female general?

131
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,720
Yes.

132
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,030
Everything in the world—

133
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,200
even when two nations clash—

134
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,270
seeks

135
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,030
only advantage.

136
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,750
As long as my offer is generous,

137
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,030
I believe

138
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,750
Su Muyang will be willing to help me
with this favor.

139
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,840
You're wise, Your Majesty.

140
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,520
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]

141
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
Your Majesty,

142
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,870
regarding the case of Jia Shihong
embezzling disaster relief funds,

143
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,150
after thorough investigation,

144
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,950
the evidence is now conclusive.

145
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,820
Your Majesty,

146
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,970
why are you hesitating to convict him?

147
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,960
The judgment

148
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,710
of this case

149
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,180
rests with His Majesty.

150
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,440
You have repeatedly interfered

151
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
and spoken disrespectfully

152
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,490
before His Majesty.

153
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,610
Are you

154
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,520
intending to rebel?

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,920
Throughout history,

156
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
any wise ruler

157
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,280
would first share the worries
of the people.

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,390
The disaster relief case

159
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,580
concerns the livelihood of the people.

160
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Your Majesty,

161
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,960
please do not fear the powerful officials

162
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,220
and allow the law to be applied unfairly.

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,080
Your Majesty,

164
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,410
please do not fear the powerful officials

165
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,700
and allow the law to be applied unfairly.

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,140
Ministers, there is no need to argue.

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,070
I have already made my judgment.

168
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,000
Jia Shihong, governor of Jiuqing County,

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,930
abused his power for personal gain

170
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,270
and embezzled disaster relief funds.

171
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,070
The charges have been verified.

172
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,390
Effective immediately,

173
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,640
he will be dismissed, investigated,

174
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,570
and all his property confiscated.

175
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,670
His relatives

176
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,270
and clansmen

177
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,480
will be executed for the same crime

178
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
as a warning to others.

179
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,550
Your Majesty.

180
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,430
Your Majesty!

181
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,440
Let go of me!

182
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,550
I am the Prime Minister.

183
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,610
How can I be arbitrarily implicated?

184
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,400
Prime Minister, you repeatedly claim

185
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,240
to be very close to this guilty official—

186
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,510
how can you call it false accusation?

187
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,980
Moreover,

188
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,600
if I hadn't considered your service
in two reigns

189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
and sent someone
to investigate thoroughly,

190
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,860
we might never have uncovered

191
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,190
your crime of regicide.

192
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,350
How dare he?

193
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,270
Su Muyang!

194
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,240
You...

195
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,910
Bring in Jin Bao.

196
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,340
Your Majesty!

197
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,270
Your Majesty!

198
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,470
Your Majesty!

199
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,450
Your Majesty!

200
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,790
Spare my life, Your Majesty!

201
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,670
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

202
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,150
Save me, Prime Minister!

203
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,440
Prime Minister, please save me!

204
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,910
You!

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,870
Fine!

206
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,070
Your Majesty!

207
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,200
It was Mr. Ji.

208
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,000
Mr. Ji forced me to do it.

209
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,430
He had me secretly switch

210
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,880
the late emperor's elixir.

211
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
How dare he commit such a heinous act?

212
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Mr. Ji wields immense power.

213
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,270
I dared not disobey, Your Majesty.

214
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,200
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

215
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,350
Immediately

216
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,890
throw Ji Lan into the Imperial Prison.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
Execute the entire Ji family

218
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,090
to the utmost penalty.

219
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,030
They truly deserve it.

220
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,080
Your Majesty!

221
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,930
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

222
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,010
Your Majesty!

223
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,990
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

224
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,120
Your Majesty!

225
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,760
[Li Residence]

226
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,840
Greetings, sir.

227
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,550
Mr. Quan,

228
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,150
where are you rushing off to?

229
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,410
In a few days,

230
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,410
it will be the Master's birthday.

231
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,540
I'm hurrying

232
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,440
to the wine shop

233
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,070
to order some birthday wine.

234
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,040
Such an important occasion—

235
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,390
why haven't I heard anyone
in the residence mention it?

236
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,510
Our Master

237
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,720
has never liked extravagance.

238
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,440
Even on his birthday every year,

239
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,560
he only has a simple meal.

240
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,550
So I thought,

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
this year,

242
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,550
with you, the Miss,

243
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,480
and the Young Master

244
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,150
all here,

245
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,810
it's a rare gathering.

246
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
We should make it lively,

247
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,870
right?

248
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,780
I'm off then.

249
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,600
Your Majesty,
you're in quite a good mood today.

250
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,390
In the past, if you had

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,730
no business with me, you wouldn't take

252
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,690
a single step inside my palace.

253
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,100
Now that I'm in this Imperial Prison,

254
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,750
you actually enjoy coming.

255
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Why did they

256
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,890
give you such harsh treatment?

257
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,270
Drop your hypocritical act.

258
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,580
Haven't you fawned and played

259
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,680
the submissive role long enough?

260
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,130
Don't think I don't know.

261
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,630
Once I, your only obstacle, am removed,

262
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Li Shuang's coronation

263
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,920
will be just around the corner.

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,270
Even at this point,

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
all you care about

266
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,580
is still the position of Empress.

267
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
With such limited vision,

268
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,000
how could you ever stand
on equal footing with me?

269
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,630
From beginning to end,

270
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,610
you've always treated me
as if I didn't exist.

271
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,110
Besides the position of Empress,

272
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,730
what else could I possibly care about?

273
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,170
If I hadn't condescended
to marry you back then,

274
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,900
giving you access
to the Prime Minister's power,

275
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
would you even be alive today?

276
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,510
Your arrogance

277
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,950
is exactly like your father's.

278
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,510
Do you really think

279
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,000
that I've survived until today

280
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,790
because I had the Ji family's support?

281
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,110
It was the late emperor
who didn't want me dead,

282
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,720
because my life,

283
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,450
just like our marriage,

284
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,400
was just a pawn
to block misfortune for him.

285
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,720
I seized this empire with my own hands,

286
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,790
yet your Ji family

287
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,840
wanted to reap the benefits.

288
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,240
How could I

289
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,400
possibly forgive that?

290
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,560
We are husband and wife.

291
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,420
Have you ever, for even a moment,

292
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,829
treated me as your wife?

293
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,450
It's precisely because

294
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,609
you are my lawful wife

295
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,610
that I cannot bear

296
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,830
to see you executed publicly.

297
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,170
Haven't you always coveted
the position of Empress?

298
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,260
A posthumous title

299
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,960
will serve just as well.

300
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,610
Father-in-law,

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
you haven't eaten for days.

302
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,110
I assume

303
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,610
you've given up on life.

304
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,890
You ungrateful bastard.

305
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,510
So

306
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,480
all this time
since you entered the capital,

307
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,720
pretending weakness before me,

308
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,410
it was just a staged performance

309
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,440
to lure me into arranging Jin Bao,

310
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,510
trapping me in your

311
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,600
two-birds-one-stone scheme.

312
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,110
That way, I could kill Father

313
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,190
and get rid of you at the same time.

314
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,730
A temporary humiliation

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,330
was nothing to me.

316
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,490
I won't die.

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,270
Even if I must,

318
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,530
I will expose you first!

319
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,370
Your right hand?

320
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,210
I do intend to kill you,

321
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,330
but I won't let you die so easily.

322
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,190
Do you really think

323
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,920
that the entire court

324
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,060
doesn't know what really happened?

325
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,190
Even so,

326
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,720
today

327
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,470
I already hold absolute power

328
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,850
that cannot be shaken.

329
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,320
Father-in-law, didn't you say

330
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,610
that I was incompetent
and had no achievements,

331
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,140
unable to command respect?

332
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
Your death

333
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,180
will be my first political accomplishment.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,680
Tianjiao!

335
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,430
Su Muyang.

336
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,200
You will

337
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
die a terrible death!

338
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,240
You want to execute me publicly

339
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,590
to establish your authority.

340
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,030
I absolutely won't let you

341
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,310
have your way!

342
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,340
Your Majesty,

343
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,500
he has already died.

344
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,660
Issue my edict:

345
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,680
the criminal official Ji Lan

346
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,990
shall be beheaded,

347
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,650
and his head displayed at the city gate
for 3 days

348
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,760
as a warning.

349
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,720
Yes.

350
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Shuang.

351
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
Father.

352
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,790
I just received word

353
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,320
that Ji Lan and his daughter

354
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,820
have died suddenly in prison.

355
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,410
Was it His Majesty?

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,750
When the rabbits all die,

357
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,750
the hounds are no longer needed.

358
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,410
Now that he sits on the throne,

359
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,250
he won't allow anyone
to control him anymore.

360
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,210
I just didn't expect it all
to happen so quickly.

361
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,830
You and Jin'an should pack immediately

362
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,720
and depart at once.

363
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,240
If you delay,

364
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,370
who knows what could happen.

365
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:29,960
Father.

366
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,940
With the Prime Minister's faction fallen,

367
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,920
the Li family
will surely be the next target.

368
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,440
How can I leave at a time like this

369
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,240
and leave you to face this alone?

370
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,830
Didn't he tell you

371
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,670
what I said to him?

372
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,920
Don't worry about me.

373
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,830
Leave immediately.

374
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,270
The Li family's reputation

375
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,270
has been built over years

376
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,030
with blood and loyalty.

377
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,410
Moreover, the Changfeng Army
is still under our command.

378
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,000
Even if His Majesty
wants to make things difficult for me,

379
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,510
I don't think he would go too far.

380
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,550
But Father...

381
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,880
His Majesty is here!

382
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,200
Come here.

383
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,040
Back in Lucheng,

384
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,790
I wanted to give you

385
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,960
this hairpin,

386
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,400
but you refused it.

387
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,590
Now,

388
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,550
it's finally in your hands again.

389
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,750
Wear it

390
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,160
when you attend the coronation, okay?

391
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,560
The Prime Minister
was scheming his whole life,

392
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
yet in the end,

393
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,440
his arrogance blinded him.

394
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,050
Unaware of the predator lurking behind,

395
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,170
he died suddenly in the palace.

396
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,480
I just didn't expect

397
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,060
that so soon after their deaths,

398
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,810
you would already be arranging
the empress's coronation.

399
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,060
You truly are busy
with national affairs daily,

400
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,920
without a moment's rest.

401
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,930
Are you accusing me?

402
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,390
Three years ago,

403
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,430
if not for
the late emperor's arranged marriage,

404
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,180
how could we have been separated?

405
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,960
I only wish to make up for past regrets.

406
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,200
Is that wrong?

407
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,510
I know

408
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,100
your heart belongs to Jin'an.

409
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,920
But I can grant him high office, wealth,

410
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,520
and a lifetime of prosperity

411
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,640
as compensation for him.

412
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,490
Your Majesty, may I ask,

413
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,260
is this compensation really for Jin'an,

414
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,270
or for the unease

415
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,190
in your own heart?

416
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,970
Jin'an possesses divine power.

417
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,960
How could he be easily abducted?

418
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,960
It was you

419
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,700
who put Kongqing Water
in his wine that day

420
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,160
to suppress his power.

421
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,860
Prince Li died suddenly,

422
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,540
and you claimed Jin'an did it.

423
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,090
That's because you knew—

424
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,660
like a lamb entering the tiger's den—

425
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,750
he wouldn't stand a chance
of returning alive.

426
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,080
You shifted all the blame onto Jin'an.

427
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,130
Aren't you afraid that one day

428
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,370
you'll face divine retribution?

429
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,710
Your right hand...

430
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,690
That's right.

431
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,710
I did it all.

432
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,510
With this very right hand,

433
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,950
I killed Su Muli.

434
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,400
And it was I

435
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,120
who tried to let Jin'an

436
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,470
bear the guilt of fratricide for me,

437
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
to die with scheming and injustice,

438
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,170
with no place to be buried.

439
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,080
Jin'an risked his life alone

440
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,370
for you.

441
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,030
How could you repay him with betrayal?

442
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,070
The victor takes all.

443
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,700
That is the way of the world.

444
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,050
To ascend to the throne,

445
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
I can sacrifice

446
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,510
parents, siblings,

447
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,390
relatives, and even my wife.

448
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,270
Yet I gave you

449
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,570
the only bit of true heart I had.

450
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,750
And you want to betray me for another man.

451
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,090
Even so,

452
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,240
I forgave you.

453
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,790
I even allowed you
to go to Wuling Mountain to save him.

454
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,120
I have repeatedly yielded

455
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,160
for your sake,

456
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,370
showing the utmost benevolence.

457
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,960
I am the Emperor.

458
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,360
Whatever I desire,

459
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,110
I will obtain.

460
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,920
Whether you're willing or not,

461
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,270
I will keep you by my side forever,

462
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,100
letting you, just like me,

463
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,350
love without being loved in return,

464
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,810
forever deprived of hope.

465
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,480
All who defy me

466
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,510
will meet a bitter end.

467
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,640
Bro,

468
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,170
do you think this man

469
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,430
could be Prince Annan?

470
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,060
He does look quite like him.

471
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
But seeing his carefree attitude,

472
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,760
I'm not certain.

473
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,780
That's impossible.

474
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,720
That day, I clearly heard

475
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,070
what Bai Kun secretly reported

476
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,240
to Empress Dowager Qin.

477
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,570
There can be no mistake.

478
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,360
Moreover,

479
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,200
Chen Kuan and his group

480
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,740
also disappeared
after arriving in Lucheng.

481
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,670
And this man

482
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,160
came from Lucheng

483
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,110
with the female general
of the Changfeng Army.

484
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,240
I don't think

485
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,530
this is mere coincidence.

486
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,460
Keep following him.

487
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,790
You two have been following me all day.

488
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,190
What exactly do you want?

489
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,920
Could it be that you plan to kill
and rob me

490
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,720
right under the Emperor's nose?

491
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,200
Sir, you misunderstand.

492
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,990
We

493
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,990
are not bandits.

494
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,450
It's just that your appearance

495
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,680
greatly resembles our long-missing master.

496
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,310
That's why

497
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
we've rudely disturbed you.

498
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,030
What's

499
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,950
your master's name?

500
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,520
My master's surname is Duan.

501
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,350
A year ago,

502
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,900
he suffered great misfortune.

503
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,970
Everyone said he was dead,

504
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,400
but we two brothers know

505
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,590
it wasn't

506
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,110
our master

507
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,750
in that coffin.

508
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,030
Therefore, we have been

509
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,720
searching for him tirelessly ever since.

510
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,440
Right now,

511
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,830
we've just arrived in Yunjing

512
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,760
and are unfamiliar with the place.

513
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,830
We humbly ask you

514
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,890
for some guidance.

515
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,880
We

516
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,860
would be eternally grateful.

517
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,640
I cannot help you find him.

518
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,110
Judging by how weary and travel-worn
you are,

519
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,440
you must have suffered much along the way.

520
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,240
Since your master is lost,

521
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,210
why not seek a new path for yourselves?

522
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,200
A loyal servant serves only one master.

523
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,410
We brothers

524
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,830
have sworn a blood oath

525
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,240
that even if we die,

526
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,530
we would follow him to the underworld,

527
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,880
loyal to him alone.

528
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,880
It's been so long,

529
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,040
and there's still no sign of him.

530
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,410
Perhaps he's dead.

531
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
I treat you politely only because

532
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,880
you resemble our master a bit.

533
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,300
If you dare speak nonsense again,

534
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,190
I'll kill you!

535
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,110
Wei Heng.

536
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,380
It's been a year,

537
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,920
and your temper hasn't changed.

538
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,650
You...

539
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,530
I am Wang Meng.

540
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,480
I am Wei Heng.

541
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,240
Greetings, Prince Annan.

542
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,970
Don't kneel.

543
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,510
Are you saying

544
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,050
that Empress Dowager Qin sent a letter

545
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,170
and revealed my identity to Su Muyang?

546
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,770
Meng and I rode here as fast as we could

547
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,180
just to reach you first.

548
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,640
Otherwise,
once Empress Dowager Qin's message

549
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,160
reaches the Taijin Palace,

550
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,590
it would be difficult for you

551
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,310
to leave.

552
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,000
I will definitely return to Yao State,

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
but not yet.

554
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,830
Why?

555
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,960
During the Battle of Lucheng,

556
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,490
Empress Dowager Qin
took Ze out of the palace.

557
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,720
I hurried there,

558
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
and all I remember is a stone chamber

559
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,510
and that I did see Ze.

560
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,350
But what happened afterward,

561
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,810
I've forgotten entirely.

562
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,640
Ze...

563
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,790
How did he die?

564
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,030
I have failed you.

565
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,640
That day,

566
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,100
we followed you there,

567
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,460
but we arrived too late.

568
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,310
When we arrived,

569
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,140
His Majesty

570
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,160
was already lying in a pool of blood.

571
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,860
That day, Li Wei sheathed his sword
and tried to escape.

572
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,250
We fought with all our might to stop him,

573
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,580
but he still got away.

574
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Prince Annan,

575
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,210
I heard that you had been

576
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,830
secretly staying close to his daughter,

577
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,750
Li Shuang,

578
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,030
and only recently entered the palace
with her.

579
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,070
Is this

580
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,720
a part of your plan?

581
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,480
I was in danger in Lucheng at that time.

582
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,730
It was Li Shuang who saved me.

583
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,090
It seems all of this

584
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,550
was arranged by fate.

585
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,640
Li Wei.

586
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,000
If Li Wei hadn't attempted
to assassinate His Majesty,

587
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,800
Empress Dowager Qin
wouldn't have come to power,

588
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,660
and Chen Kuan wouldn't have died.

589
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,190
Prince Annan,

590
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,290
you must avenge

591
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,790
His Majesty

592
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,320
and our fallen brothers.

593
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,600
Prince Annan.

594
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,260
Li Shuang has nothing to do with this.

595
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,030
You must not harm her.

596
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,420
The only one we are going to kill

597
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,400
is Li Wei.

598
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,240
Very well.

599
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,120
As long as we can kill Li Wei,

600
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,000
I

601
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,920
am willing to sacrifice everything

602
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,240
to assist you loyally.

603
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,880
I am Duan Aoze,

604
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
the sage ruler of Yao State.

605
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,640
Who dares

606
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,000
to intrude?

607
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,160
I am Li Wei, General of Cavalry

608
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,590
of Taijin!

609
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm here to end your miserable life!

610
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Aodeng,

611
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,489
save me.

612
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,480
Save me!

613
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,199
Your Majesty!

614
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,510
I am your elder brother!

615
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,659
When we arrived,

616
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,520
His Majesty

617
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,139
was already lying in a pool of blood.

618
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,900
That day, Li Wei sheathed his sword
and tried to escape.

619
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,400
We fought with all our might to stop him,

620
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,840
but he still got away.

621
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,190
It's so late.

622
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,200
Why haven't you gone to bed?

623
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,520
I was waiting for you.

624
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,200
Where have you been?

625
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,280
I had nothing to do,

626
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,820
so I went for a walk.

627
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,630
Father said

628
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,230
you had something to tell me.

629
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,360
No wonder people say

630
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,010
a man is a different person

631
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,940
before

632
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,920
and after marriage.

633
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,670
You used to be completely honest with me,

634
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,680
and now you have your own secrets.

635
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,750
You don't have hidden savings, do you?

636
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,510
Don't worry.

637
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,400
I couldn't care less.

638
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,360
That won't do.

639
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,670
You're the only one in this world

640
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,000
who can keep me in check.

641
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,950
I've asked the Grand General
for your hand,

642
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,760
and he agreed.

643
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,110
I'm planning to take you away
from Yunjing.

644
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,070
Then we can cut ties

645
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,710
with all our troubles

646
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,280
and start fresh,

647
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,110
living the life we want.

648
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,340
You don't want that?

649
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,910
How could I not?

650
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,920
Being with you forever

651
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,830
is all I've ever wanted.

652
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,400
Tomorrow

653
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,640
is the Grand General's birthday.

654
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,890
Once we leave,

655
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,480
who knows when we'll see him again.

656
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,630
How about we stay

657
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,180
to celebrate his birthday before leaving?

658
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,400
Your Majesty,

659
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,660
there's an urgent letter from Yao State.

660
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,760
The land cession hasn't been settled yet.

661
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,360
What trick are they trying to play
this time?

662
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,550
Put it here.

663
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,430
Your Majesty,

664
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,440
the birthday gift
you ordered for General Li

665
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,630
has been delivered.

666
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,150
General Li's military achievements
are remarkable.

667
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,320
And General Li Shuang

668
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
has also won great military merit

669
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,550
and will soon enter the palace
to serve at your side.

670
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,360
Your Majesty,

671
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,960
if you value the Li family,

672
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,190
why don't you visit personally

673
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,920
to show your imperial favor?

674
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,550
Are you saying

675
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,880
the Li family's achievements

676
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,440
are unmatched,

677
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,630
and even I

678
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,160
must curry favor with them?

679
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,030
I dare not.

680
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,500
I spoke out of turn.

681
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,400
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

682
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,920
Get out!

683
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,670
Yes.

684
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,630
Recently, I was surprised to learn

685
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,920
that the death of Prince Annan,

686
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,850
Duan Aodeng,
under the former ruler was suspicious.

687
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,510
After thorough investigation,

688
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,970
we discovered that he is now
hiding in Taijin

689
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,570
under the name Jin'an.

690
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,270
The Emperor of Taijin,

691
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,560
please do us a favor

692
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,330
and spare him any trouble.

693
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,550
Jin'an is actually Duan Aodeng?
