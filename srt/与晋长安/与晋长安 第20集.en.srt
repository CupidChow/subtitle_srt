00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,840
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,509
Shuang.

4
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,480
You'd go drown your sorrows alone

5
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,920
whenever you were upset.

6
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,480
So this time,

7
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,440
I've warmed up the wine

8
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,800
for you in advance.

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
How did you know I was upset?

10
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,560
Didn't I tell you

11
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,620
my senses are extraordinary?

12
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,320
I heard everything
you and Ji Ran discussed

13
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,360
in the side hall.

14
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,440
Can't you control your senses?

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,590
You were talking with the door open.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,860
It didn't seem to be that private.

17
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,430
Besides,

18
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,360
even without this ability,

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,960
I could've heard everything

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,870
just by passing by.

21
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,960
Besides

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,829
enhanced senses of

23
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,120
smell and hearing,

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,380
do you have any other special abilities?

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
Can you

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,480
see through walls?

27
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,200
Get your mind out of the gutter.

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,340
I know not to look at what I shouldn't.

29
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,230
My abilities are just enhanced.

30
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,540
I don't know magic.

31
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,170
I can't see through things.

32
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,100
That's a relief.

33
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,360
Anyway, it's clear

34
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,290
Prince Li wants the Crown Prince dead

35
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,690
since he hired assassins

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,870
and even poisoned the blade.

37
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,250
Luckily, the Crown Prince survived.

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,829
But now Prince Li's coming to Lucheng.

39
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,829
Are you worried

40
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,270
he'll harm the Crown Prince again?

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,940
Prince Li is high-ranking and powerful.

42
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,150
The position of Crown Prince

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,710
originally belonged to him.

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,430
Holding this grudge for three years,

45
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,310
I'm sure

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,280
he'll seize any opportunity

47
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,120
to eliminate him.

48
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,090
The Li family and Changfeng Army

49
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,220
have always been your Achilles heels.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,690
Crown Prince must be protected,

51
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,490
and Prince Li can't be offended.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,870
Rather than walking on eggshells,

53
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,600
why don't you

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,250
entrust the Crown Prince to me?

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,470
To you?

56
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,960
I can't guarantee I'll get along well

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,430
with the Crown Prince,

58
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,840
but I'm sure

59
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,960
I can protect him.

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,370
Do you have other concerns?

61
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,990
The matter of the man in black

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
has reached the capital.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
Crown Prince hasn't mentioned it,

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
but I still feel uneasy.

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,270
Actually,

66
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,480
besides my enhanced senses,

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,460
my strength has also changed.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,800
I no longer need to

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,870
rely on

70
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,870
the Lingxu acupoint to fight well.

71
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,870
And it seems

72
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,130
my strength keeps growing.

73
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,090
I once appeared as the man in black

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
to avoid your suspicion.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,750
Now that you know who I am,

76
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,350
I don't need to hide anymore.

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,510
The man in black

78
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,440
will probably never appear again;

79
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,600
just Jin'an.

80
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,670
Your bodily changes are so unpredictable.

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,000
If left unchecked,

82
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,320
could you end up hurting yourself?

83
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,560
Mo Yin is from Wuling Mountain.

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,600
Since he cured Crown Prince of poisoning,

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,480
perhaps

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,150
he can also unravel
the secret of your body.

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,420
I'll go ask him.

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
I know you worry about me.

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
But actually, I've already

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
asked him myself.

91
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,600
He said...

92
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,390
He said

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,310
if I keep my power under control,

94
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,190
I'll be fine.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,920
What about you?

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,850
Have you taken the tonic

97
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,870
Lu Xin prescribed

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
for your qi and blood?

99
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,159
How have you

100
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,240
been feeling?

101
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,200
If you can control your power well,

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,360
I shouldn't suffer from backlash.

103
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,390
Besides,

104
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,240
since returning from Cang Mountain,

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,570
I've been very healthy.

106
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,220
That's good.

107
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,390
Did Shuang get you

108
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,020
to come escort me?

109
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,800
Does it matter?

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,190
If it was Shuang's idea,

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
I need to know the reason.

112
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,030
If you took it upon yourself,

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,940
all the more do I need
to know your motive.

114
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,120
Prince Li will arrive in Lucheng soon.

115
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,870
From today on,

116
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,810
I'll personally attend to Your Highness.

117
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,290
Are you scared?

118
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,760
Understandably so.

119
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,430
You survived

120
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,390
assassination attempts and poisoning.

121
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,360
By now,

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,240
you must be well aware of

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,290
why Prince Li is coming to Lucheng.

124
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm the Crown Prince.

125
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,790
If Prince Li wants to kill me,

126
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,810
those around me will be in danger.

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,300
By being my bodyguard,

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,090
aren't you afraid of death?

129
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
If you die,

130
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,190
the one who suffers won't be me

131
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,240
but Shuang.

132
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,950
By protecting you,

133
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm safeguarding Shuang's peace.

134
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,190
Besides,

135
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,980
it's not that easy

136
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,490
to kill me.

137
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,410
Quite confident, aren't you?

138
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,340
Prince Li is
surrounded by skilled fighters.

139
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,600
What makes you so sure you can protect me?

140
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,870
Last time, you were willing to die

141
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,920
for Shuang.

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,950
That was when I knew

143
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,210
you really like her.

144
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,510
Since we're both serious about her,

145
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,770
there must be a winner.

146
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,290
Until everything is settled,

147
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,360
Your Highness must stay alive.

148
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,240
Your Highness hasn't fully recovered.

149
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,120
Be careful not to catch a cold.

150
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,490
Your Highness,

151
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
are you still troubled about Prince Li?

152
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,210
You're of noble status.

153
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,720
No matter how bold Prince Li is,

154
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,480
he wouldn't dare act openly,

155
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,630
especially here

156
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,840
in the General's Residence,

157
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,480
with General Li present.

158
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Huai'en.

159
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,289
We've been in Lucheng for days now.

160
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,030
Have you heard anything

161
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,170
about the man in black?

162
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,110
Since defeating the Yao Army,

163
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,190
that man seems to have vanished.

164
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Have you discovered something?

165
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,050
Isn't it odd that

166
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,800
he accomplished such a great deed,

167
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,370
yet there's no trace of him

168
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,300
and even no mention of him?

169
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,270
Could he be

170
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,780
hiding in Changfeng Army,

171
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,900
or perhaps here?

172
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,710
Don't make

173
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,970
baseless claims.

174
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,570
Noted.

175
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,440
Over there!

176
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,290
Father is here.

177
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,250
Father is here.

178
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
I'm so scared.

179
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,890
Don't be scared.

180
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,900
Don't be scared.

181
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,080
With Father here,

182
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,120
you have nothing to fear.

183
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Don't be scared.

184
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,520
Don't be scared.

185
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,650
[Lucheng]

186
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,380
[Lucheng]

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,440
I wanted to keep a low profile

188
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,600
on this trip.

189
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,080
This is rather extravagant.

190
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,320
Your Highness has had
a long, tiring journey,

191
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,790
Ensuring your comfort

192
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,480
is just my duty.

193
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
General Li is still waiting for you
at the post house.

194
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,080
Should I send someone

195
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
to inform her?

196
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,910
I'm tired.

197
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,070
[Liu Yu]
[Governor of Lucheng, Taijin]

198
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
Then please rest well, Your Highness.

199
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,500
I'll take my leave.

200
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,800
Is Your Highness

201
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,140
planning to meet Li Shuang in person?

202
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,030
I must find out for myself

203
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,720
what

204
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,910
she really thinks.

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,550
It doesn't matter

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,840
if the Crown Prince is

207
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,700
still alive.

208
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,890
He'll have to meet his end eventually.

209
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,050
If he's dead,

210
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
it'll save me considerable effort.

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,150
By then,

212
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
even if Li Shuang refuses to surrender,

213
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
she'll still be implicated.

214
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,130
What if the Crown Prince isn't dead?

215
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Then it depends on Li Shuang's attitude.

216
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,960
In the worst-case scenario,

217
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,460
we must make them understand that

218
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,150
the Li family's backing of Crown Prince

219
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
is useless.

220
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,250
[General's Residence]

221
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,240
Unaware of Your Highness's arrival,

222
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,740
I failed to welcome you properly.

223
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,950
Please forgive me.

224
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
Last time, due to my negligence,

225
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
I kept you waiting at the post house.

226
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
Do you hold a grudge against me?

227
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,560
I wouldn't dare.

228
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,150
When news of assassination attempts
on Crown Prince reached the capital,

229
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,270
the court was in turmoil,

230
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,960
and memorials
impeaching the Changfeng Army

231
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,230
piled up like mountains.

232
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,790
But considering the Li family's
generations of meritorious service,

233
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,120
I personally intercepted them all.

234
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
Just to

235
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,840
do you a favor, General Li.

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
If someday

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,440
I need your assistance,

238
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,720
I hope you'll support me wholeheartedly.

239
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,580
When the time comes, don't forget

240
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,870
that I was the one

241
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,480
who preserved your life

242
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,130
and your family's honor.

243
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,360
Greetings, Brother.

244
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
I didn't know you were coming.

245
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Sorry for the late greeting.

246
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,030
Please forgive me.

247
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,270
We're brothers.

248
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,900
No need for such courtesy.

249
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,230
You've lost weight, Crown Prince.

250
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,510
Are your wounds healing?

251
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,770
Has your poison been fully neutralized?

252
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,360
Thanks to you,

253
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,070
I'm out of danger now.

254
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,800
That's good.

255
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,360
General Li and I were just

256
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,030
discussing
the assassination attempt on you.

257
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,490
How's the investigation going, General Li?

258
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,770
Your Highness,

259
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,200
the assassins' identities

260
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,910
haven't been fully confirmed,

261
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,950
but we've gathered substantial evidence.

262
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,000
I believe the truth

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,330
will come to light soon.

264
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,530
Then, we'll report every detail,

265
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,150
however minor, to the court.

266
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,960
But I've heard that

267
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,320
on the day of the incident,

268
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,960
all the assassins

269
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,120
were killed on the spot
by Crown Prince's guards.

270
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,720
If they'd arrested someone alive,

271
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,120
the investigation
wouldn't be so difficult.

272
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,790
Crown Prince's guards

273
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,870
are so inept,

274
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,880
unable to protect their master

275
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
nor make proper arrests.

276
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,730
Baoxing.

277
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,270
Yes.

278
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,600
My guards have followed me for many years;

279
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,510
all absolutely loyal.

280
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,370
Don't be naive.

281
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,510
If they're just loyal, that's fine,

282
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,750
but what if someone harbors ill intentions

283
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,280
and conspires with rebels?

284
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,600
How would I explain to Father then?

285
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,960
I've brought quite a few men with me
this time.

286
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,790
I'll leave some clever and reliable ones

287
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,790
here by your side.

288
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,410
As your elder brother,

289
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,480
I'll feel more at ease this way.

290
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,130
Help!

291
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,150
Crown Prince!

292
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,900
I haven't seen you before.

293
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,320
When did Crown Prince recruit you?

294
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,890
Your Highness,

295
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,390
I serve the Li family;

296
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,460
temporarily assigned

297
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,920
to serve the Crown Prince.

298
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,840
But didn't they say

299
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,550
only female servants work

300
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,390
at the General's Residence?

301
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,030
It's understandable though.

302
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,390
Stationed at the border,

303
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,870
General Li must have many lonely nights.

304
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,240
Just as men traditionally have
multiple wives and concubines,

305
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,750
General Li now has a wife

306
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,720
and a concubine.

307
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,840
How delightful!

308
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,940
Your Highness.

309
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,700
I, Li Shuang, am solely devoted to
protecting the homeland

310
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
and nothing else.

311
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,870
Please—

312
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,160
Your Highness is naturally brilliant

313
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
and all-knowing.

314
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,670
I am

315
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,480
truly in awe of you.

316
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,910
You're a clever one, huh?

317
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,750
Go on.

318
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,550
How am I so brilliant?

319
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,840
Just now, Your Highness mentioned

320
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,870
the Crown Prince's poisoning.

321
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,360
However,

322
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,840
the public only knows about
the assassination attempt

323
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,390
and not his poisoning.

324
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,000
This must mean

325
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,910
Your Highness has

326
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,370
exceptional perception.

327
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,320
Of course,

328
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,580
with your meticulous mind

329
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,480
and your love

330
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
for your brother,

331
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,840
it makes sense that

332
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,790
you noticed his pale lips and weak qi,

333
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,120
and logically inferred

334
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,510
that he was poisoned.

335
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,270
General Li.

336
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,630
I heard Crown Prince was poisoned

337
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,960
and on the brink of death

338
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,980
but was saved by a miracle doctor.

339
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Bring this person

340
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,840
to dine with us.

341
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,120
Go invite him.

342
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm not going.

343
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,410
After freeloading
at the General's Residence for so long,

344
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,390
surely they can ask you for a favor.

345
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,550
Freeloading?

346
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,070
I've moved all my belongings here.

347
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,790
I see patients
and write prescriptions all day

348
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,320
and brew medicine all night.

349
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,240
My delicate skin

350
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,930
has been ruined by the heat and overwork!

351
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,160
I'd really love to leave.

352
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,080
Would your general let me go?

353
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,670
Don't waste your time.

354
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,000
Bureaucratic gatherings
filled with fake niceties

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,750
are beneath me

356
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,080
and my refined elegance.

357
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,390
The situation is urgent

358
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,360
and delicate.

359
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,150
After I help Shuang through this crisis...

360
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,470
I'll consider your proposal

361
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,400
to return to Wuling Mountain with you.

362
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
On one condition:

363
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,730
you must behave yourself.

364
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,069
In my eyes,

365
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,770
you are no different from

366
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,160
my medicine utensils.

367
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,900
Who are you to order me around?

368
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,750
This outfit is exquisite,

369
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,040
while this one's elegant.

370
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,200
Which do you think is more appropriate

371
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,500
for the event?

372
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,870
I've heard that
in our previous battle with Yao State,

373
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,020
a heroic man in black swooped in to help

374
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,400
defeat the Yao Army.

375
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,790
Mr. Mo Yin,
since you're skilled in detoxification,

376
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,680
could you be

377
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,760
that very man in black?

378
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,650
Is that an insult, Your Highness?

379
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,720
That man masked his face
with black armor,

380
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,310
so he must be extremely hideous

381
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,640
and ashamed of his face.

382
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm drop-dead gorgeous.

383
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,020
How could he be
mentioned in the same breath as me?

384
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,980
You're amusing,

385
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,750
very much to my liking.

386
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,720
Speaking of the battle at Lucheng,

387
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,650
Li Zhangyi was ordered to supervise
but neglected his duties

388
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,410
and nearly caused a disaster.

389
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,000
But General Li, in your memorial,

390
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,110
you accused him of treason.

391
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,260
May I ask if that was an exaggeration?

392
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,740
Your Highness.

393
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,960
I merely

394
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
reported the facts.

395
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,570
That Li Zhangyi was

396
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,920
putting on airs

397
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,550
in the name of Your Highness.

398
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,620
I didn't want your reputation
to be tarnished

399
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,420
because others mistake you
as covering up for him.

400
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,510
I didn't expect you to be

401
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,130
so considerate of me.

402
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,000
I've really failed to
appreciate your kindness.

403
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
It's only right that I offer you a toast.

404
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,510
The life of a warrior is
brutal and harsh,

405
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,010
yet you still have such fair skin,

406
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,620
outshining my pampered concubines.

407
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,920
Your Highness!

408
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,960
Your fine clothes are stained,

409
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,490
undermining your dignity.

410
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,110
You should get changed.

411
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,730
Those uninvolved should vacate the room.

412
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,810
We'll take our leave.

413
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,400
I told you

414
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,750
such impulsivity would
harm others and yourself.

415
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,790
Regain composure

416
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,540
and control the Jade Linglong—

417
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,950
Jin'an!

418
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,000
Calm down!

419
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,260
When the shadow puppet goes berserk,

420
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,520
it truly loses all sense of rationality.

421
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,070
No way.

422
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,760
Why don't I remember anything?

423
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,380
At the banquet just now,

424
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,130
if I hadn't stopped you
for fear of exposing the secret

425
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,260
of Wuling Mountain,

426
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm afraid everyone in that room

427
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,070
would have died on the spot.

428
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,830
There's no more room for delay or excuses.

429
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,590
Today,

430
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,660
you must leave with me.

431
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,200
No.

432
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,520
I can't.

433
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,590
Shuang is still in danger.

434
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,310
I can't abandon her.

435
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,570
You still don't get it?

436
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,350
Right now,

437
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,950
you're her greatest threat.

438
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,860
Jin'an.

439
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,540
What happened just now?

440
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,110
Was it because of that flame pattern?

441
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,110
You're bleeding!

442
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,720
It's because of me.

443
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm sorry.

444
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,790
I lost control in my rage...

445
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,630
and hurt you again.

446
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,910
I'm fine.

447
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,470
Don't worry about me.

448
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,480
Although Prince Li is domineering,

449
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
he'll take Changfeng Army into account

450
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,510
and won't go too far.

451
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,590
I understand you're resentful.

452
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,640
But now isn't

453
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,570
the right time to turn against Prince Li.

454
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,560
A little self-inflicted injury
to rekindle old feelings

455
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,640
and win hearts.

456
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,350
Well played, Brother.

457
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,010
Though I'm not gifted,

458
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm not one to court death.

459
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,790
The poison I'd been given

460
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,850
is extremely rare.

461
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,510
With your power,

462
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,400
there's nothing you can't know.

463
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm sure you

464
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,480
understand the situation
better than anyone.

465
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,110
Is that so?

466
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,370
Everything I have is bestowed by Father.

467
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,830
If you have any doubts,

468
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,600
you may plead your case before Father

469
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
and let him make the final judgment.

470
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,550
You worthless dog!

471
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,980
If Prince Li were hurt,

472
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,110
could you bear the consequences?

473
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,160
I'm sorry I wasn't sturdy enough

474
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
and startled Your Highness.

475
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,220
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

476
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,860
Have mercy, Your Highness!

477
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,880
I beg for your mercy!

478
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
Your Highness,

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,490
in this world,

480
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
the greatest danger is
falling from great heights.

481
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
Nothing's more reliable

482
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,120
than your own family.

483
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,030
In that case,

484
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,890
the most suitable candidate

485
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,200
would be my brother.

486
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,190
I'll have to trouble you

487
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,240
to serve as my stairs, Brother.

488
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,610
Your Highness,

489
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,830
the Crown Prince is of noble status.

490
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,230
Would it be appropriate?

491
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,240
You have a point.

492
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,590
In that case,

493
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,180
you can take his place.

494
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,040
-Watch it—
-As your brother...

495
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,540
I'm willing to serve you

496
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,370
to my best ability.

497
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,600
Your Highness!

498
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,110
Hit the road!

499
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,400
Your Highness.

500
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,380
Your Highness.

501
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,680
How preposterous

502
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,350
for a prince to
humiliate the Crown Prince in public.

503
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,890
If he keeps giving in
without fighting back,

504
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,430
I fear things will only get worse.

505
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
You've smashed almost everything.

506
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,100
Still not satisfied?

507
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,390
If you're not done,

508
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,680
keep smashing.

509
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,300
Your Highness.

510
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,550
With such a reaction,

511
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,620
aren't you afraid of eavesdroppers

512
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,350
reporting it back to Prince Li?

513
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,700
So what if he finds out?

514
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,320
Isn't this what he wants to see?

515
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,200
He was clearly

516
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,410
trying to back you into a corner.

517
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Yet I couldn't do anything about it;

518
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,670
only submit to his bullying.

519
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,610
Your Highness.

520
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,950
I've led troops to battle

521
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,880
for many years.

522
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,240
No matter how uneven the odds,

523
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,240
I never admit defeat

524
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,550
until the very end.

525
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,450
Just like these damaged flowers,

526
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,510
as long as there's a glimmer of hope,

527
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,610
they won't simply wither away.

528
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,690
But Prince Li has

529
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,900
made thorough preparations.

530
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,590
He wouldn't make things easy for me.

531
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,590
Shuang.

532
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Will you help me?

533
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,690
Your Highness,

534
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,920
as long as you're in my residence,

535
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,850
I'll do everything to protect you.

536
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Shuang.

537
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,120
You're all I have now.

538
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,650
Don't be so courteous.

539
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,070
It's our duty.

540
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,550
Actually,

541
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,510
my visit to Lucheng

542
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,720
isn't just to reward the troops.

543
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Father has also entrusted me

544
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,590
with another important matter:

545
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,960
to find the man in black

546
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,100
and bring him to meet Father.

547
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,660
This man in black was vital

548
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,570
in Changfeng Army's triumph

549
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,100
over the Yao Army

550
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,960
in the battle of Lucheng.

551
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,550
If such a talent

552
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,240
could serve the imperial court,

553
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,000
he'd surely

554
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,620
make a formidable general.

555
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,860
Your Highness,

556
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,310
the man in black is incredibly powerful,

557
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,440
but his whereabouts

558
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,110
are unpredictable,

559
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,810
and he never shows his face.

560
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,270
Finding him won't be easy.

561
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
This man is

562
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,860
extraordinary,

563
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,480
yet his identity

564
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,450
and allegiance

565
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,400
remain completely unknown.

566
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,720
As a general,

567
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,830
you didn't bother investigating him.

568
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,640
Shuang,

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,270
this isn't like you.

570
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,900
Or perhaps...

571
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,050
You've actually already

572
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,600
discovered his true identity in private?

573
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,740
If it weren't for the Changfeng soldiers

574
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,870
risking their lives

575
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,360
and fighting fiercely,

576
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640
how could the man in black alone

577
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,420
have turned the tide?

578
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,790
So,

579
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,270
rather than relying on one man,

580
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,160
we should unite as one

581
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,540
and build a prosperous nation,

582
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,400
such that

583
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,070
millions of citizens will

584
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,600
all be like the man in black.

585
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,610
What does Your Highness think?

586
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,720
Your Highness,

587
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,640
I've fought alongside him,

588
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,820
with our lives entrusted to each other.

589
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,160
I haven't investigated deeply,

590
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,760
but I'm willing to trust him.

591
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,760
Very well.

592
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,270
I understand.

593
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,350
If there isn't any other matter,

594
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,880
we shall take our leave.

595
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,110
Wait.

596
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,350
Shuang.

597
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,680
Isn't today

598
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
your birthday?

599
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,740
If you're willing,

600
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,980
could I join you for a few drinks?

601
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,040
Thank you for your concern,

602
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,490
but it's been a while...

603
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,750
since I've celebrated my birthday.

604
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,510
Besides,

605
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,040
you haven't fully recovered,

606
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,190
so you shouldn't be drinking.

607
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,320
Please rest early.

608
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,730
-Shuang!
-Shuang!

609
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,710
What's wrong?

610
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm probably just tired.

611
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,400
I just need some rest.

612
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,100
I'll take you back.

613
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,080
I'll take you to your room

614
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,400
and then call Lu Xin.

615
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,000
No need to make such a fuss.

616
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,750
I'm fine already.

617
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,920
Now's not the time to put on a brave face.

618
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,300
This is clearly another backlash reaction.

619
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,230
It's all my fault

620
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,630
for losing control today again.

621
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,830
Since I promised you

622
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,610
to take good care of myself,

623
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,960
I'd keep my word.

624
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,880
I'm really fine now.

625
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,020
What's wrong?

626
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,030
I'm scared.

627
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,720
Don't worry.

628
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,510
You won't lose me so easily.

629
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Actually,

630
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,110
I cherish myself

631
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,200
more than anyone else.

632
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,750
As a general,

633
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,240
I absolutely won't

634
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,970
allow meaningless sacrifice.

635
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,200
For you

636
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,030
and for the mission

637
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,360
I carry on my shoulders,

638
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,270
I'll stay strong and live well.

639
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,210
You mean

640
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,800
protecting Changfeng Army

641
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,920
and repaying Grand General Li?

642
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,160
Yes.

643
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,670
But not just that.

644
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,650
Do you remember

645
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,700
why I named you Jin'an?

646
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,030
"May Taijin

647
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,370
enjoy lasting peace."

648
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,440
All my life,

649
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,510
I've practiced martial arts,
not only to repay my father

650
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,800
for raising me,

651
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,739
but also to fulfill my own wish...

652
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,989
That is, for everyone

653
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,340
to enjoy lasting peace.

654
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,110
But now Taijin is

655
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,210
in turmoil.

656
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,080
If matters get out of hand,

657
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,550
bloodshed will be inevitable.

658
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,320
Over the years,

659
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,590
His Majesty has been
obsessed with immortality,

660
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,120
neglecting state affairs.

661
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,679
Except for border matters,

662
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,590
everything else

663
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,920
is handled by Prince Li.

664
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
If someone power-hungry

665
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,500
like Prince Li is given power,

666
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,840
he'll only desire more.

667
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,000
So you're willing to make an enemy of him

668
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,370
to protect Su Muyang.

669
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
The Emperor is incompetent,

670
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,810
and Prince Li is cruel;

671
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,699
neither is fit to rule the nation.

672
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,880
But the Crown Prince is different.

673
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,840
He is benevolent

674
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,840
and kind.

675
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,240
If we do our best to protect him,

676
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,880
Taijin might

677
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,710
still have a glimmer of hope,

678
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,840
and the commoners

679
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,500
will get to lead better lives.

680
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,110
So,

681
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,140
with so many things left to do,

682
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,920
I'll stay strong and live well.

683
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,740
Come with me.

684
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
To think there is

685
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,180
such beautiful scenery

686
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
in these deep mountains.

687
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,760
The water over there

688
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,470
comes from the hot springs
on the mountain,

689
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,310
so it's warm here all year round,

690
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,330
