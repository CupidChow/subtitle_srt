[Episode 31]

3
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,050
Happy birthday, Father.

4
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,080
May you live a long life,
full of happiness and health.

5
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,150
Great!

6
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,560
Wonderful!

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,220
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank you, Father.

8
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,310
Brother-in-Law!

9
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,660
Yes, you.

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,910
What are you waiting for?

11
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,150
Give your birthday wishes.

12
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,100
Three were prepared.

13
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,900
One is for you.

14
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,890
I'm afraid that

15
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,240
mere words can't express
my sincere wishes,

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,579
so I've specially prepared a gift

17
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,840
for the Grand General.

18
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,480
Thank you.

19
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,380
Bravo! Bravo!

20
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,630
Father!

21
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,500
Father!

22
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,160
Jin'an,

23
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,240
protect my father!

24
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,010
B-Brother-in-Law...

25
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,360
Father!

26
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,450
Shuang.

27
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,160
Arrest Jin'an!

28
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Empress Dowager Qin's secret letter

29
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
must've reached the Taijin Palace.

30
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,950
Escort the master away.

31
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,750
Master, you need to leave first.

32
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,310
Our comrades are waiting outside the city.

33
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,710
I'll cover your retreat.

34
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,470
Why?

35
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Why do you want to kill my father?

36
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,830
We'd agreed to leave Yunjing

37
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
together that day.

38
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,290
But you used the birthday visit
as an excuse to keep me here.

39
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
So you planned

40
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,440
to kill my father

41
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,070
right from the beginning.

42
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,870
I really do love you.

43
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,420
But there are things I have to do.

44
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,430
Then let me ask you.

45
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,720
Everything between us—

46
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,230
our promises

47
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,840
and our love—

48
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,880
do they all mean nothing now?

49
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,050
Our meeting,

50
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,480
our love,

51
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,750
our vow to live and die together,

52
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,280
our secret engagement—

53
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,080
they're all real.

54
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,159
But my dearest kin was

55
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,080
killed by Li Wei himself.

56
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,230
That is also true.

57
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,750
My father...

58
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,820
My father would never kill the innocent.

59
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
Who are you, really?

60
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,500
Vengeance has its target,

61
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,230
and debts their debtors.

62
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,320
Blood for blood;

63
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I must make Li Wei pay for what he did.

64
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,330
Although I know it's unlikely,

65
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,690
I still want to ask you this:

66
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,800
Shuang,

67
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,470
will you come with me?

68
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,920
Go with you?

69
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,320
Do you expect that someday

70
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,390
we'll be united as husband and wife...

71
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,100
to turn our swords against my father?

72
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,820

00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,590
A year ago,

176
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,200
when His Majesty
suddenly left the palace,

177
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,590
you sensed something was off

178
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,990
and rushed to the rescue.

179
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,250
But then for some unknown reason,

180
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,630
the court suddenly announced

181
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,690
that you were dead.

182
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,970
We had our doubts,

183
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,140
so we'd been secretly investigating

184
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,090
until recently,

185
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,320
when we tracked your whereabouts

186
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,630
in Taijin territory.

187
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,800
But unexpectedly,

188
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,750
on our way back to court,

189
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,370
we were hunted by Taijin people.

190
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,300
We failed to protect you properly.

191
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,590
Please forgive us,

192
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,570
Prince Annan!

193
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,760
My brother is dead?

194
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,710
One year...

195
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,900
Why can't I remember anything
from this past year?

196
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Prince Annan.

197
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,920
Now, you're severely injured and weak,

198
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,990
and mentally exhausted.

199
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,080
Please just rest well.

200
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,710
In a few days,

201
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,510
you'll surely recover.

202
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,200
Please lie down.

203
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,590
Here.

204
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,880
That day, Consort Qin took my brother out.

205
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,120
She killed him!

206
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,830
It is definitely fishy that
Empress Dowager Qin suddenly

207
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,510
took His Majesty out of the palace.

208
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,440
And everyone present that day said

209
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,470
the one who assassinated His Majesty

210
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,080
was the Grand General of Taijin,

211
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Li Wei.

212
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,870
Li Wei?

213
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,370
Empress Dowager... Qin?

214
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,160
Wang Meng.

215
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,870
This past year...

216
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,280
who reigns in Yao State?

217
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,560
After the late emperor

218
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,200
passed away,

219
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,370
the Qin clan announced

220
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,800
that you'd died of sudden illness.

221
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,430
They then placed the young prince

222
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,830
on the throne as Emperor.

223
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,760
She was honored as Empress Dowager

224
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,630
and took full control of the court.

225
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,280
Your former subordinates

226
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,720
were charged with fabricated crimes

227
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,400
and severely demoted.

228
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,870
Some were killed,

229
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,670
and others exiled.

230
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,660
Anyone in court who raised doubts

231
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,210
was punished the same way.

232
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,470
Those...

233
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,240
Those loyal ministers and generals
who dared to speak up

234
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
have mostly been eliminated by her.

235
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,310
In this court,

236
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,880
someone wants us dead.

237
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,960
Yet we are

238
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,560
still alive.

239
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,030
In that case,

240
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,880
let's send them a grand gift.

241
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,380
Let's return to court.

242
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,290
Yes, Prince Annan.

243
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,350
Yes, Prince Annan!

244
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,550
Our state has voluntarily ceded

245
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,270
our Qingchuan and Helan cities,

246
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,160
signifying our utmost sincerity.

247
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,750
How can Taijin

248
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,230
be so unreasonable and demanding?

249
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,750
My dear ministers,

250
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,730
do you have
any other brilliant strategies?

251
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,070
Ceding territory for peace was
already a disgrace to our Yao State.

252
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,440
The audacity of Taijin to be so arrogant.

253
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,640
Our only option now is

254
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,400
to tear up the peace agreement

255
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,410
to restore the people's faith.

256
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,230
Does Your Majesty

257
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,310
mean

258
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,310
you're abandoning those soldiers?

259
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,030
They've become prisoners of war,

260
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,360
which means they should've
long become martyrs.

261
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,840
Clinging to life

262
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,310
only brings shame to our nation

263
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
and disgrace to our wise ruler.

264
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,230
The late emperor
loved his people like his own.

265
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,470
When Prince Annan was around,

266
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,440
he never committed the sin

267
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,510
of disregarding the captives' lives.

268
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,440
Your Majesty's strategy

269
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,040
seems to be using the Taijin Emperor
to wipe out

270
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,570
Prince Annan's former subordinates.

271
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,620
During the Battle of Lucheng,

272
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,200
Duan Aodeng, as the commander,

273
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,050
abandoned the battlefield
without authorization,

274
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,580
resulting in our army's
devastating defeat.

275
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,270
To preserve
the imperial family's reputation,

276
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,030
I refrained from displaying his corpse
as punishment for his crimes.

277
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,750
Even if his subordinates

278
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,400
survive to return,

279
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,700
they can't escape the death penalty.

280
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,840
So, Your Majesty,

281
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,680
do you intend to punish me as well?

282
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,030
It's been a year since we last met.

283
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,960
Do you all

284
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,010
not recognize me anymore?

285
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,090
It's Prince Annan!

286
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,550
It's Prince Annan!

287
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,420
It's him!

288
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,620
It's Prince Annan!

289
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,790
Prince Annan has returned!

290
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,550
He's back!

291
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,990
It really is him.

292
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,880
Prince Annan,

293
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,120
you're still alive!

294
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,600
A year ago,

295
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,790
I was harmed by traitors

296
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,600
and severely wounded,

297
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,010
barely escaping death.

298
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,640
To avoid complications,

299
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,420
it was announced
that I'd died from illness.

300
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,140
Now that I've recovered,

301
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,510
I naturally must

302
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,640
return to serve the court.

303
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,170
Prince Annan's safe return

304
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,960
is truly a blessing for Yao State.

305
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,690
We ministers

306
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,270
welcome Prince Annan

307
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,990
back to court!

308
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,640
We ministers
welcome Prince Annan back to court!

309
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,640
Yu!

310
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,230
We ministers...

311
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,360
Your Majesty!

312
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,160
This isn't proper!

313
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,880
You've escaped death.

314
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,760
Even after being away for a year,

315
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,560
you still command everyone's loyalty.

316
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,550
With your assistance,

317
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,850
the late emperor's and my son

318
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,880
would surely pacify the realm

319
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,660
and be free of worries.

320
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,150
[In loving memory of
Emperor Wencheng of Yao State]

321
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,400
Somebody.

322
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,750
Here, Your Majesty.

323
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,230
Convey my decree:

324
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,360
Today we rejoice at the safe return
of the Second Prince.

325
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,620
From this day forward,

326
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,220
he shall be reinstated

327
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,070
as Prince Annan.

328
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,990
As you command, Your Majesty.

329
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,160
No need for this pretense.

330
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,990
You don't have to
assert your authority over me.

331
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,520
The court's people
address me as Prince Annan

332
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,570
because I fought in bloody battles

333
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,710
and killed enemies bravely,

334
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,920
which led to

335
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,040
Yao State's prosperity...

336
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,770
and territorial expansion today.

337
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,000
Even if you don't restore my title,

338
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,670
I remain an unshakeable member
of Yao's imperial family,

339
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,370
the one and only Prince Annan of Yao.

340
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,200
If you hadn't taken my brother
out of the palace that day,

341
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,680
there's no way Li Wei would've succeeded.

342
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,550
I should kill you right now

343
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,000
to appease my brother's spirit.

344
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,790
But alas...

345
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,920
The political situation in Yao
has just stabilized.

346
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,490
Shaking things up now would be unwise.

347
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,450
Besides, Yu is

348
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,360
my brother's flesh and blood.

349
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,310
Having lost his father
at such a young age,

350
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,640
that poor child can't lose his mother too.

351
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,840
From now on,

352
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,770
as long as you behave yourself,

353
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,000
I will

354
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,120
spare your life for a couple more days.

355
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,470
Otherwise...

356
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,120
you have to die.

357
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,230
Sit.

358
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,690
I was the one who let Jin'an go.

359
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,750
He wounded my father,

360
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,860
but that is our personal feud.

361
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,910
I won't allow Your Majesty to

362
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,310
falsely accuse him of killing Prince Li

363
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,770
and execute him unjustly.

364
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,500
Swarmed with state affairs,

365
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,400
Your Majesty should not
waste your time with me.

366
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,530
General Li, you're truly forthright.

367
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,600
If Jin'an were

368
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,160
half as honest as you,

369
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,600
he wouldn't have left Taijin alive.

370
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,640
Do you know

371
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,030
whom you actually set free?

372
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,230
He is the younger brother
of Yao State's former ruler,

373
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,880
Prince Annan, Duan Aodeng!

374
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,930
Your Majesty rules this land

375
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,470
and holds power over life and death.

376
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,270
Even if you want Jin'an dead,

377
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
you shouldn't resort to
making up such an absurd story.

378
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,680
I used to think you were

379
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,990
exceptionally intelligent,

380
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
but faced with matters of the heart,

381
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
you're equally useless.

382
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,160
Why do you think

383
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,620
he tried to assassinate the Grand General?

384
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,560
Because Yao State's former ruler,
Duan Aoze,

385
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,230
died by your father's sword.

386
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,150
[But my dearest kin was]

387
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,540
[killed by Li Wei himself.]

388
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,960
[My father would never kill the innocent.]

389
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,910
[Vengeance has its target,]

390
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,200
[and debts their debtors.]

391
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,990
Blood for blood;

392
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,990
I must make Li Wei pay for what he did.

393
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,880
What?

394
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,880
Have you finally understood

395
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,040
the grave disaster you've caused?

396
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,470
Back then,

397
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,230
so many soldiers sacrificed their lives

398
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,120
just for this fragile peace we have today.

399
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,600
You've let the enemy
return to his homebase.

400
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,200
Would he possibly stop here?

401
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,920
This is the result

402
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,600
of your lack of resoluteness.

403
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,570
I haven't thrown you into the dungeon;

404
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,930
just house arrest.

405
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,710
I'm giving you a chance

406
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,230
to redeem yourself.

407
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,010
Time is running out.

408
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,270
Take good care of your health.

409
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,270
Soon, you'll lead troops into battle

410
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,600
to attack the Yao State.

411
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,480
Your Majesty.

412
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,790
Your Majesty.

413
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,760
Your Majesty.

414
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,760
In the several clashes with Yao State,

415
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,670
we barely won.

416
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,600
Our casualties were devastating,

417
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,000
and the people suffered.

418
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,430
We finally have some peace and prosperity,

419
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,320
and Yao State is seeking peace.

420
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,840
Why not take this opportunity

421
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,170
to put an end to this war?

422
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,370
General Li, have you lost your mind?

423
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,900
You care about the people;

424
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,510
I do too.

425
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,530
The former emperor was incompetent,

426
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,250
and Prince Li was cruel.

427
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,400
Only I can

428
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,920
preserve the lasting peace
for the people of Taijin.

429
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Duan Aodeng is a ferocious warrior.

430
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,530
Even your father couldn't defeat him
at his strongest.

431
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,360
The Battle of Lucheng

432
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,120
crippled the Yao State.

433
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,680
The Black Armored Army

434
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,750
has almost been completely disbanded.

435
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,680
If we don't strike
while they're vulnerable,

436
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,550
when they have

437
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,070
regained their strength

438
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
and rebuilt their forces,

439
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,710
it'll truly be a disaster for Taijin.

440
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,950
As your general...

441
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,960
I'll not fail Your Majesty's trust.

442
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,950
I'll attack Yao State

443
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,500
and annihilate...

444
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,100
Prince Annan.

445
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,270
[Do you know]

446
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,560
[whom you actually set free?]

447
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,790
He is the younger brother
of Yao State's former ruler,

448
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,510
Prince Annan,

449
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,600
Duan Aodeng.

450
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Do you know

451
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,070
who our enemy is?

452
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,890
He is the man in black
who helped us defeat the Yao Army,

453
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,640
Jin'an,

454
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,280
who is also Prince Annan of Yao State,

455
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Duan Aodeng.

456
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You can't forget his past kindness.

457
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,720
But personal gratitude

458
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,900
can't outweigh national vengeance!

459
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,470
Capture and execute him.

460
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,470
Show no mercy!

461
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,440
Understood?

462
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,360
Understood!

463
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,680
Understood?

464
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,790
Understood!

465
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,840
Move out!

466
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,610
Kill! Kill! Kill!

467
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,070
Kill! Kill! Kill!

468
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,030
Kill!

469
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,680
Your Majesties,

470
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,040
[Chongzheng Hall]

471
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,360
we've received

472
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,470
news from the border.

473
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,310
Taijin has mobilized its army.

474
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,960
Within 5 days,

475
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,600
they will

476
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,860
reach Qingchuan City.

477
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,510
The situation is critical.

478
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,680
Your Majesties,

479
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,500
a decision to fight or to negotiate
must be made.

480
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,490
What does everyone think?

481
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,750
Your Majesties,

482
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,120
Taijin is coming in full force

483
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,160
this time.

484
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,230
Our army has been severely weakened

485
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,470
after suffering heavy casualties

486
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,550
in the battles at Lucheng.

487
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,440
I believe we should

488
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
reopen peace negotiations

489
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,310
to avoid more bloodshed.

490
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,660
That is too naive.

491
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,030
Previous peace talks have failed.

492
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,270
Bringing it up again

493
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,770
would not only damage Yao's dignity,

494
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,710
but it's also

495
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,240
unlikely that Taijin would agree.

496
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,160
Instead...

497
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,030
Please order an evacuation

498
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,960
to leave Qingchuan empty, Your Majesty.

499
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,710
Then,

500
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,120
our people will be safe,

501
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,270
while Taijin will get the city

502
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,790
and withdraw their troops.

503
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,390
It's the best of both worlds.

504
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Prince Annan, why are you laughing?

505
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,680
Surrendering before fighting?

506
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,940
Isn't that ludicrous?

507
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,750
Since they've started this war,

508
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,840
how could they be content with
such a small gesture of weakness?

509
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,880
This battle

510
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,140
must be fought.

511
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,200
You make it sound so easy, Prince Annan.

512
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,400
If we hadn't lost the Battle of Lucheng,

513
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,210
we wouldn't be
in such a passive position now.

514
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
What was lost on the battlefield

515
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,290
must be reclaimed on the battlefield.

516
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
Your Majesty,

517
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
I request to personally lead the army

518
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,100
and vow to drive Taijin forces

519
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,710
back beyond our borders.

520
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,790
I wish to

521
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,960
follow Prince Annan into battle.

522
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,970
I second the motion.

523
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,470
I wish to join Prince Annan!

524
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,160
I wish to join as well.

525
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,920
I wish to

526
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,180
follow Prince Annan into battle as well.

527
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,880
Me too!

528
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,100
This is a grave matter.

529
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,920
If anything goes wrong,

530
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,090
could you bear the consequences?

531
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,960
I hereby make a military pledge:

532
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,460
If we lose this battle,

533
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,400
I'll offer my head.

534
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,330
Your Highness is

535
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,970
truly a valiant warrior.

536
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,970
Then, as you've proposed,

537
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
I appoint you General of the Cavalry

538
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,659
to lead troops against the enemy.

539
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,260
As you command,

540
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,760
Your Majesty.

541
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:48,980
Prince Annan.

542
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,140
Is that woman

543
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,770
the female general from Taijin,

544
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,480
Li Shuang?

545
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Yes, Prince Annan,

546
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,250
that is correct.

547
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,600
However, her father is

548
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
the General of Cavalry of Taijin,

549
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,010
Li Wei.

550
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,190
The Li family owes Yao a blood debt.

551
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,950
It's time they repay it today.

552
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,810
[Jin'an.]

553
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,940
I'm Prince Annan of Yao State,

554
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,270
Duan Aodeng.

555
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,700
When you're in the depths of hell,

556
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,370
don't forget my name.

557
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,800
Have you really forgotten everything?

558
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,030
Forget?

559
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,000
National and familial grudges

560
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,950
can never be forgotten.

561
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,950
If that's the case,

562
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,780
everything from the past,

563
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,510
be it love or hatred,

564
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,570
ends here.

565
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,380
Prepare to die!

566
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,150
As the lauded female general,

567
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,470
is this all you've got?

568
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,110
The battle flag still stands;

569
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,640
victory is not yet decided!

570
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,030
[Oh no!]

571
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,890
[It's an ambush!]

572
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,640
Luo Teng,

573
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,400
retreat!

574
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,090
Retreat!

575
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,770
General!

576
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,720
General!

577
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,280
Ji Ran!

578
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,700
General!

579
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,510
Let's go!

580
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,030
Go!

581
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,110
General!

582
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,370
General!

583
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,070
Prince Annan.

584
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,640
The Taijin Army has fled.

585
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,990
Why don't we pursue them

586
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,520
to capture them all at once?

587
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,030
We have her.

588
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
It's enough.
