00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,500
[General's Residence]

4
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,759
Miss.

5
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,870
May I ask

6
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,920
if this is General's residence?

7
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Miss.

8
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,310
Could you pass a message for me?

9
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,509
I wish to see General.

10
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,120
Never mind.

11
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,750
Don't trouble yourself.

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,880
I'll find my own way.

13
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,130
By General's orders, I'm to watch you

14
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,060
and not let you move around freely.

15
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,980
What have I done wrong

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,730
to be watched like this?

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
Because you're a man,

18
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,910
a suspicious man.

19
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
Am I going to be kept here?

20
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,310
The female doctor just now

21
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,960
was very curious
about the changes in my body,

22
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,290
which is quite strange.

23
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,850
Could it be

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,430
that this isn't the General's Residence?

25
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,630
Perhaps they and the people
in the stone chamber

26
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,960
are working together?

27
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,770
If that's the case,

28
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,079
I'll just stay here.

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,150
However,

30
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,060
that pot of tea seems to have gone cold.

31
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,920
Could you bring me a fresh hot one?

32
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,960
Sure.

33
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,330
I'm sorry about this,

34
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,630
Miss.

35
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,190
Miss, please spare me.

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,960
Please.

37
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,050
We both lead a life in the jianghu.

38
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,940
Beat him up, Qiao!

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
Beat him up!

40
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,210
Where are you going?

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,470
Qiao, he's there!

42
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,960
General,

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,470
help!

44
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,370
Stop right there!

45
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,020
General.

46
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,390
Come here!

47
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,960
What's all this commotion?

48
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,560
General, he tried to escape.

49
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,920
I didn't know where I was.

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,640
I wanted to see you.

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,660
That's why

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
I rushed out.

53
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,310
Let's go.

54
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,240
Go.

55
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,430
Now that I've seen you,

56
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,340
I feel at ease.

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
I'll be going.

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Is

59
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,430
Huo Du dead?

60
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,060
I didn't mean to kill him.

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,240
I did it to save Li Ting.

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,310
-I...
-I trust you.

63
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,790
But your pulse is irregular,

64
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,470
and your eyes are shifty.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,500
You're hiding something from me.

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,830
I thought

67
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,020
you would be afraid of me.

68
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,150
Why would I fear you?

69
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,510
My body undergoes unpredictable changes,

70
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,360
with my unstable supernatural strength.

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,390
I can be

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,330
as weak as a kitten at times,

73
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,630
but when I snap,

74
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,160
I can kill a man with my bare hands.

75
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,080
The mess

76
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,310
and the bloodstains in the stone chamber

77
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,870
might all be my doing.

78
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,830
If you put it that way,

79
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,430
I'm quite afraid.

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,210
Last time in the stone chamber,

81
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,370
that enchantress seemed to know you.

82
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,090
Do you remember anything?

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
She's actually a corpse

84
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,090
but was manipulated by someone.

85
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,120
The situation

86
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,920
seems identical

87
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,040
to those two soldiers in the camp.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,500
If that's really the case,

89
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,659
I might have

90
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,870
been controlled by

91
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,159
whoever is behind these two incidents.

92
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,159
But something went wrong along the way,

93
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,490
and I narrowly escaped.

94
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,670
Could everything

95
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,560
truly be as Lu Xin said,

96
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,150
connected to Wuling Mountain?

97
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,010
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,160
Why did you punch me?

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,390
Even though you've lost your strength,

100
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,650
for the safety of everyone

101
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,710
in this residence,

102
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,700
I still needed to test you.

103
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,080
In all the time we've known each other,

104
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
when have I ever lied to you?

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,750
Whether you're lying or not
is just what you sayâ€”

106
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,150
how would I know for sure?

107
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,070
Get up.

108
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,520
After all,

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,370
you saved me and Li Ting.

110
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,430
Thank you.

111
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,230
You really don't see me as a monster?

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
The world

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,880
encompasses all things.

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,570
Just stay true to yourself.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
You are who you are.

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,900
You're Jin'an,

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,750
not some monster.

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
These days,

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
you should stay
in the residence for recovery.

120
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Don't wander off.

121
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,190
Next time Lu Xin comes,

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll have her prepare some medicine

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
to improve circulation.

124
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,330
Don't worry.

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
So quick?

126
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,510
Captain is truly blessed.

127
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,950
What a coincidence.

128
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,610
Captain is here.

129
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,190
Captain, Captain.

130
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,380
Here, here.

131
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,870
What they just did...

132
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,840
Thank you.

133
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,600
I just arrived and ran into you.

134
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,799
What a coincidence.

135
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:07,440
We must be destined to meet.

136
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,680
Miss, why are you here

137
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,720
this time?

138
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,790
You're playing dumb.

139
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,510
How many times do I have to tell you?

140
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,960
Flirting.

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,570
This is a military camp,

142
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,510
not a suitable place for a lady to linger.

143
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,640
Please leave, Miss.

144
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,550
Still so shy.

145
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,620
Li Ting has grown up now.

146
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,000
Applying medicine

147
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,260
is better left to me.

148
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,570
He is bad-tempered.

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,670
Qiao and the others were just sent away.

150
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,270
You've never met him before.

151
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't worry.

152
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,620
Time to change your bandages.

153
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,810
Shuang's residence is full of women.

154
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,630
Who are you?

155
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
There's a lot

156
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,150
you don't know.

157
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm General's honored guest.

158
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,440
Not everyone gets to see me.

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,790
Hurry

160
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,910
and change the bandages.

161
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,870
Honored guest?

162
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,360
I think you're just

163
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
a lowly servant.

164
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,680
I won't change them.

165
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,010
Just let me die of pain.

166
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,450
The one who hit me should do it.

167
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,340
You're so eager to see your sister.

168
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,900
Fine,

169
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,790
I'll go get her.

170
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,370
Ouch, ouch.

171
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,040
Gentle, please.

172
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,240
If you don't recover soon,

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
how will you match wits with your sister?

174
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Who cares?

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Easy, easy.

176
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,030
Gentle, please.

177
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Has your sister

178
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,430
always been this fierce?

179
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,790
Who are you

180
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,110
to comment on Shuang's personality?

181
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,720
Say one more bad thing about her,

182
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
and I'll rip your tongue out.

183
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,350
Birds of a feather

184
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,840
flock together.

185
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,870
Besides,

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,790
what's wrong with your sister

187
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,850
being a bit fierce?

188
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
Isn't a tiger fierce?

189
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,270
Yet it's still the king of beasts.

190
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,800
She's no queen of anything.

191
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,720
Huo Du escaped.

192
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,120
And I was going after him.

193
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,170
I was just cleaning up her mess.

194
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,390
She said
I didn't respect her as my sister,

195
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,120
and she used Dad to pressure me.

196
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I think she doesn't treat us

197
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,750
like family.

198
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,080
Such an ingrate.

199
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,460
You won't let me criticize your sister,

200
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,590
yet you're quite enthusiastic
about doing so yourself.

201
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,430
She

202
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,080
was actually very good to me
when I was little.

203
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
When Dad punished me,

204
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,560
she would save her own food

205
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,150
and sneak it to me
in the middle of the night.

206
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,630
I don't know when

207
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,920
but she's different now.

208
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,330
There are many ways to care for others.

209
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,440
Her way of caring for you

210
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,100
has just changed, that's all.

211
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,150
You talk as if you would appreciate

212
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,320
this way of caring if I gave it to you.

213
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,720
If you could give it to me,

214
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,040
I would dare to accept.

215
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,200
Dream on.

216
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,830
Who do you think you are?

217
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,290
Take care of yourself.

218
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
Since you came to apply medicine for me,

219
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
you must be trying to get on my good side.

220
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,850
Why not tell me your name before you go?

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
My name is Jin'an.

222
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,030
Why?

223
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,450
You want to be friends with me?

224
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,420
General.

225
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,790
I just

226
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,750
was afraid applying medicine
would hurt too much,

227
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,320
so I mentioned your name.

228
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,550
Just to distract him.

229
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,480
Well said.

230
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,800
I am fierce.

231
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,670
I love being fierce.

232
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
I'm super fierce.

233
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,650
You

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
are

235
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,040
a good person.

236
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,990
Captain.

237
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,270
Captain.

238
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,270
Captain,

239
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,030
you're back.

240
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,560
Captain.

241
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,390
Captain.

242
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,320
Captain.

243
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
Why are you back so late?

244
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
She's been waiting for you for ages.

245
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,410
Miss Lu is really beautiful.

246
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,480
Isn't she?

247
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,390
I'd love to marry someone like her too.

248
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,120
Keep dreaming.
You'll never get a woman like her.

249
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,150
Captain.

250
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,360
You're so lucky.

251
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,720
After Miss Lu
delivered the herbs yesterday,

252
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,450
she's been waiting for you
in the camp ever since.

253
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,000
Let me tell you,

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,910
I bet

255
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,440
Miss Lu and Captain

256
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,550
will definitely get together this time.

257
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,960
Right.

258
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Great. Great.

259
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,260
What are you doing?

260
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Washing clothes.

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,440
I saw your clothes were dirty,

262
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
so I washed them for you.

263
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
This one

264
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,480
had a hole in it,

265
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,870
so I mended it for you.

266
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,470
She even washed his clothes.

267
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,420
How is it?

268
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,010
Just a bit darker in color.

269
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,290
This is my undergarment.

270
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,480
Have you no shame?

271
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,080
I know.

272
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,840
Why are you being so formal with me?

273
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,910
I'm not.

274
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,570
Come on, I'm not finished yet.

275
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,870
Help her up.

276
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,120
Captain,

277
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,670
give her a hand.

278
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,270
Is Captain bullying Miss Lu?

279
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,120
What's going on?

280
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,320
Help her up.

281
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,990
Won't you help me up?

282
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,500
Men and women should keep their distance.

283
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,170
Watch your manners, Miss.

284
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,550
He left.

285
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,870
Why did he leave?

286
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,630
Ji Ran!

287
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,390
Ji Ran!

288
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,680
Although I came to the camp

289
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,550
to deliver

290
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,640
hemostatic herbs,

291
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,550
the person I want to see most

292
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,550
is you.

293
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,480
All this time,

294
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,090
my feelings for you...

295
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,750
Anyone can see

296
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,960
that I like you.

297
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,110
Why do you

298
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,440
have to be so cold to me?

299
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,460
Is there something

300
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm not doing well enough?

301
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,510
It's not your fault.

302
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,030
It's me.

303
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,270
I've dedicated myself
to serving the country,

304
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,200
with no room for personal romance.

305
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,530
This is a military camp.

306
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,350
Please leave, Miss.

[General's Residence]

308
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,990
[Memorial]

309
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,070
General.

310
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,310
The rebel Huo Du

311
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,720
resisted our siege

312
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,400
and died accidentally.

313
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,110
Send someone

314
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,590
to deliver this memorial,

315
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,310
along with Huo Du's body,

316
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,160
to the capital as quickly as possible

317
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,590
for His Majesty to decide.

318
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,650
The spy is dead. There is no evidence.

319
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,610
If someone tries to make things difficult
in the court,

320
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,340
they'll never let it go easily.

321
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,910
If we want
to completely silence the criticism,

322
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,110
I'm afraid we must...

323
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,440
You mean...

324
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,530
We should hand over Jin'an?

325
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,850
I spoke out of turn.

326
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,910
Everyone only gets to live once.

327
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,800
No life is superior to another.

328
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,920
I will not

329
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,850
let those who are suspicious off easily.

330
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,290
Without real evidence,

331
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,590
we can't falsely accuse anyone.

332
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,790
I understand.

[Imperial Palace, Yao State]

334
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,960
By Emperor's decree,

335
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,790
now, the Five Virtues
alternate to initiate a new era,

336
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,880
and the Three Rectifications
succeed one another to rise.

337
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,510
The realm

338
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,830
has undergone great upheaval.

339
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,920
I

340
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,770
uphold the gracious mandate
bestowed by Heaven

341
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,330
and enter to uphold the ancestral lineage.

342
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,790
Today, I respectfully announce
to Heaven and Earth

343
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,160
my ascension to the imperial throne.

344
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,420
What are you doing?

345
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,610
How dare you intrude on
Prince Annan's guard quarters!

346
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,580
Empress Dowager Qin

347
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,230
is benevolent.

348
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,760
Considering my young age at ascension,

349
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,260
I hereby permit her
to join the court on political matters.

350
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,920
Hereby,
let this be publicly proclaimed to all.

351
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,880
The late emperor has passed away,

352
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,950
and Prince Annan,

353
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,520
overcome with grief,
has died of a sudden illness.

our Yao State
has undergone dramatic changes.

356
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
His majesty is still young.

357
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,960
He will need all ministers

358
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,350
to assist with one heart

359
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
to revitalize the Yao State.

360
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,270
We must

361
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,660
avenge the late emperor
and Prince Annan's deaths.

362
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,370

until death.

Are you happy?

369
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,070
Jin Wujian,

370
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,250
didn't you say he would wake up?

371
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,830
Why is he

372
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,240
still in this condition after so long?

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,230
you're from Wuling Mountain.

383
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,200
You can save him, right?

384
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,510
You asked me to create the shadow puppet.

385
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,400
I beg you.

386
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,900
I beg you to save him, please?

387
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,130
I beg you.

388
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,400
To save His Majesty,

389
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,880
there is only one way.

390
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,030
What is it?

391
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
It is called

392
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,020
Double-Blossom Wine.

393
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,860
If you mix both of your blood into it

394
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
and drink it together,

395
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,110
your lives will be bound together.

396
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,550
You live as one

397
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,410
and die as one.

398
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,640
Just one drop

399
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,720
will bind you two forever.

400
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,440
His Majesty can be brought back to life,

401
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,420
but your life will be tied to his.

402
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,790
Empress Dowager.

403
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,490
Please think twice, Empress Dowager.

404
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,440
We can live and die together

405
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,510
and will never change this resolve.

406
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,420
Isn't that what I want?

407
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,050
General.

408
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,610
The clothes you requested.

409
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,790
But

410
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,720
these clothes are so tattered.

411
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,310
What use could you have for them, General?

412
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,510
The border is ravaged by war,

413
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,510
and nearby villages

414
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,030
have been destroyed beyond recognition.

415
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,880
This time,

416
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,790
I plan to go in disguise

417
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,840
and help rebuild their homes
before returning.

418
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,970
Rest assured, General.

419
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,690
I

420
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,000
would rather risk my life

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,060
than fail to protect your residence.

422
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,080
Come, follow me to see General.

423
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,680
General.

424
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,310
He was lurking outside the door,

425
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,660
eavesdropping for quite some time.

426
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,790
He was sneaking around suspiciously.

427
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,990
Who knows what mischief he's planning.

428
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,960
Tell me,

429
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,030
how long have you eavesdropped?

430
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,960
How long have you eavesdropped?

431
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,720
Actually,

432
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,250
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

433
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,750
I wanted to tell you

434
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,810
Li Ting is much better now.

435
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,510
I see.

436
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,930
Anything else?

437
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,750
You're going out?

438
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,480
I want to go with you.

439
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,440
How dare you!

440
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,440
How dare you!

441
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,340
Where's that echo coming from?

442
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
Why?

443
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,010
Here in the residence,

444
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,550
you're the only one I'm familiar with.

445
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,350
Besides, everyone else here

446
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,410
looks like they want to kill me.

447
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,900
Even if you trust them,

448
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,950
I don't.

449
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,000
His identity remains unclear,

450
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,460
so he's still suspicious.

451
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,480
General's Residence is heavily guarded.

452
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,880
If he truly is a spy,

453
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,590
taking him outside
where he has room to maneuver

454
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,810
might actually make him
reveal his true colors.

455
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,890
Besides, you know,

456
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,880
if my body

457
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,960
undergoes any changes,

458
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,140
and you aren't by my side...

459
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,750
Well...

460
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,030
Indeed.

461
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,240
If he regains his terrifying strength
in my absence,

462
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,170
I'm afraid Qiao couldn't stop him.

463
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,790
Very well.

464
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,370
You can come with me.

465
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,330
Since we're in disguise,

466
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,070
we should pose as a displaced couple,

467
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,670
making it easier
to gain the villagers' trust.

468
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,640
Couple?

469
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,550
General,

470
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
is he worthy?

471
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,550
Are you worthy?

472
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,620
Am I worthy?

473
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,590
However...

474
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,340
That outfit won't work.

475
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
Then what will?

476
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,340
Clothes were torn without hesitation.

477
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,010
You people from the General's Residence
are truly generous.

478
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,920
But you didn't even let me wear them
after tearing them.

479
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,580
I don't know why you tore them.

480
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,640
Qiao is quite impressive.

481
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,830
She actually managed to find

482
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,690
so many different rough fabrics.

483
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,590
Where on earth did she find these?

484
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,680
Miss,

485
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,050
are you from out of town?

486
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,650
Ma'am,

487
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,880
we've traveled for a day,

488
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:52,990
and along the way,

489
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,830
we haven't seen any signs of people.

490
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,030
Could we trouble you for a bowl of water?

491
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,420
During the war,

492
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,140
most people have died.

493
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,430
Have you

494
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,170
ended up stranded here?

495
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,510
I understand

496
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,790
you're cautious.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,530
I didn't want to bother you,

498
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,720
but

499
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,720
my little brother

500
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,380
was born a bit simple-minded.

501
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,880
He kept telling me

502
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,610
he was hungry and thirsty.

503
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,500
He's made a fuss the whole way.

504
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,830
I really have no choice.

505
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,200
Nothing I say worked.

506
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,660
I

507
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,000
am hungry.

508
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,000
Hungry.

509
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,480
All right, come with me.

510
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,350
Follow me.

511
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,250
How come you're so hungry?

512
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,170
Come on.

513
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,070
Auntie Huang,

514
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,270
I notice

515
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,540
there are hardly any men in the village.

516
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,580
They were drafted into the army

517
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,910
and most died in battle.

518
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,870
Auntie Huang,

519
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,330
here's payment for the meal.

520
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,720
That's far too much.

521
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,900
No, I can't take it.

522
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,790
To be honest,

523
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,240
I used to repair houses

524
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,550
in my village.

525
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,680
Later, the village was destroyed,

526
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,320
so I took my simple-minded brother

527
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,880
and my brothers

528
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,920
and fled.

529
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,200
You've been so kind to us today.

530
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,440
If you don't mind,

531
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,640
I have many men working for me,

532
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
and I can help you

533
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,840
rebuild the village.

534
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,230
But

535
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,190
we're just farmers

536
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,570
and can't afford to pay.

537
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,070
Since this is to repay your kindness,

538
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,790
how could I ask for money?

539
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,490
Once the village is rebuilt,

540
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,290
if you get the word out about us,

541
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,750
that would help me build my reputation.

542
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,680
This village is so run-down now.

543
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,950
Apart from a few old lives,

544
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,530
there's nothing much left that matters.

545
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,280
All right.

546
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,310
I'll discuss it with Auntie Li.

547
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,270
Miss,

548
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,810
where are your men?

549
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,420
They'll arrive tomorrow.

550
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,920
Please keep this money for the meal

551
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,750
for now.

552
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,640
All right.

553
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,590
I'll owe you the wages for now,

554
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,110
and when we have a good harvest,

555
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,070
I'll sell the crops and pay you back.

556
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,520
Okay.

557
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,600
I'll be going then.

558
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,180
Take care.

559
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,920
I thought you were a woman of your word.

560
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,590
I never expected

561
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,550
you could lie

562
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,050
without even blinking.

563
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,210
You flatter me.

564
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,290
But there's something I don't understand.

565
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Didn't you say we'd pose as a couple?

566
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,690
Why did you suddenly call me
your little brother?

567
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,880
Why?

568
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,300
You want to pose as my husband?

569
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,920
I just wanted to ask

570
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
why you made me your little brother.

571
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,440
Why can't I be your older brother?

572
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,840
I might be older than you.

573
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,520
When you were discussing clothes
with me that day,

574
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,850
you really lacked masculinity.

575
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,530
I couldn't bring myself

576
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,750
to call you my older brother or husband.

577
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,000
Clothing is just a part
of basic human needs.

578
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,750
How can you judge someone's masculinity

579
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,350
based on that?

580
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,510
You have a point.

581
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,960
When Ji Ran arrives,

582
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,470
you can prove yourself

583
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,010
by working with them.

584
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,690
Fine, I'll do it.

585
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm not afraid.

586
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,370
Wash the dishes.

587
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,890
Okay.

588
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,400
This is perfect to test

589
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,200
if he
has truly lost his supernatural strength.

590
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,550
Can you handle it, young man?

591
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,410
Stop carrying those.

592
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Go up there and fix the roof instead.

593
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,820
A grown man like him is so weak,

594
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,480
collapsing after just this little work.

595
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,540
Let me check on him.

596
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,500
Nothing serious.

597
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,920
It's due to a deficiency of Qi and blood
and overwork.

598
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,400
Some rest and food will fix him up.

599
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,590
Thank you, Auntie Huang.

600
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,000
You know something about medicine?

601
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,930
Just a little.

602
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,030
Back in the village, when sows gave birth,

603
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,560
they looked just like this.

604
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,160
Auntie Li,

605
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
let's go cook something.

606
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,150
Alright.

607
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,510
We're leaving.

608
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,270
Thank you for your help.

609
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,380
Gene...

610
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,750
Miss Li,

611
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,070
well,

612
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,160
I'll go help out now.

613
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,830
Go ahead.

614
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,700
Just need to add some more thatch
to the roof.

615
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,740
Almost done. Almost done.

616
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,130
That's enough.

617
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,920
Don't do it
if you can't handle hard labor.

618
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,980
Why push yourself?

619
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,270
I did what you told me to.

620
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,030
I'm yours.

621
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,640
I'll follow

622
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
whatever you say.

623
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,590
Smooth talker.

624
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,440
I know,

625
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,310
you wanted to test

626
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,680
if I've really
lost all my supernatural strength.

627
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,740
If I had been lazy and had slacked off,

628
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,290
you would've become more suspicious of me.

629
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,360
Alright,

630
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,850
have some rest now.

631
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,550
Can you stay here tonight?

632
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,030
Stay with me,

633
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,020
please?

634
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,680
No.

635
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,920
Why?

636
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,199
But you were out there with them,

637
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,110
sleeping in the open,

638
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,320
and you're a young lady.

639
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,050
What's wrong with being a lady?

640
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,639
I can do hard labor better than you,

641
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,080
and I am stronger than you.

642
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,560
-But...
-But?

643
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,810
We're brothers,
sharing the good times and the bad.

644
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,810
Don't be willful.

645
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Give me your hand.

646
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,239
Hold it out.

647
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,630
Eat it.

648
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,240
Why aren't you sleeping?

649
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,620
Have you been sitting like that for long?

650
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,320
Never mind.

651
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,900
I knew you couldn't leave me alone.

652
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,370
I just remembered,

653
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,350
when I was sick as a child,

654
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
I also wanted someone

655
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,580
to stay by my side, that's all.

656
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,630
Such a tough general

657
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,130
actually has such a vulnerable side.

658
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,820
Everyone has moments of weakness.

659
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Facing your vulnerability

660
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,590
can make you become stronger.

661
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,530
Did you eat the candy I gave you?

662
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,070
When I first arrived at the camp,

663
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,440
you gave me one too.

664
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,710
Why do you always

665
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,040
carry candies with you?

666
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,070
When you can't solve the troubles
of this world,

667
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,940
use a little sweetness

668
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
to dissolve the bitterness inside.

669
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:47,750
Come on,

670
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,340
get up here and sleep first.

671
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,410
Have you lost your mind?

672
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,150
Or is your fever making you delirious?

673
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,150
Why not?

674
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,760
You slept with them

675
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,630
on the floor.

676
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,930
Can't you sleep with me?

677
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,850
Besides,

678
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,960
we've slept together before.

679
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Shut up.

680
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,070
I advise you

681
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,340
to stop talking

682
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,460
before I get angry.

683
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,630
Go to sleep.

684
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,400
Turn around and sleep.

685
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,170
These days,

686
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,190
I've been with her every day,

687
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,510
but I still feel uneasy.

688
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Perhaps, her scent

689
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,920
has mixed with those soldiers'

690
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,270
and isn't pure anymore.

691
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,720
This won't do.

692
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,710
I need to figure out a solution.
