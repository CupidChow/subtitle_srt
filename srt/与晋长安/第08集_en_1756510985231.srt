00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Don't you like biographies?

194
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,310
A bookstore this big

195
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,000
must have everything.

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,510
If you find the ones you like,

197
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,470
you won't have to trouble Su Muyang

198
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,750
to search everywhere.

199
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
I noticed that you didn't even touch the biographies

200
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,440
he gave you last time.

201
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,320
Whether he really betrayed you

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,910
or

203
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,170
was genuinely forced by circumstances,

204
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,260
I guess now

205
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,270
you just don't want anything

206
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,030
to do with him.

207
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,550
It's not that.

208
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Really.

209
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,720
I just...

210
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,010
don't like biographies anymore.

211
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,990
I thought if I bought more biographies,

212
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,910
you could forget the past

213
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,200
and enjoy reading.

214
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,610
But since you don't like them anymore,

215
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,410
just forget it.

216
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,050
It's really a shame.

217
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,720
This bookstore is huge—

218
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,910
there might be many rare editions.

219
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,000
I have a collection of military books

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,980
I've been collecting for years,

221
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,690
but I'm still missing one volume.

222
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,020

The Tale of Mr. Bat, Volume Two.

236
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,080
Such a unique...

237
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,630
Such a unique military book.

238
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,790
I grabbed the wrong one.

239
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,270
[The Beauty of Hell: The Legend of Li Shuang]

240
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,070
So it seems you really are,

241
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,820
as the book says,

242
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,240
cunning

243
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,240
and two-faced.

244
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,000
The Beauty of Hell?

245
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,840
I was wondering

246
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,170
who came up with that name

247
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,270
and who spread

248
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,190
all these stories.

249
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,720
The book also says

250
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,560
you ate many children

251
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,570
to perfect your martial arts.

252
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,870
Is that true?

253
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,200
It's all true.

254
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,120
In fact,

255
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,150
not only do I love eating children,

256
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,390
I also like

257
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,630
eating fair-skinned young men.

258
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,610
Are you scared?

259
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,290
Not at all.

260
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,630
I actually think

261
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,080
these absurd stories

262
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,710
make you even more alive.

263
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,480
Ever since I met you,

264
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
you've always kept a stern face,

265
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,320
being cautious

266
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,960
and thoughtful.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,240
Being serious all the time is exhausting.

268
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,570
I think you could learn from your brother.

269
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,140
Being carefree

270
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,170
and lighthearted

271
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,360
isn't so bad, is it?

272
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,960
Mind your own business.

273
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,690
These bizarre stories…

274
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,810
Some say I kill without mercy,

275
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,860
and some say I care for the people.

276
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,870
Who knows

277
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
I like hiding here,

278
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,380
reading biographies in secret?

279
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,240
You wouldn't understand anyway.

280
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,670
I have things to do.

281
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,070
Look around by yourself.

282
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,190
Read this. I found a book for you.

283
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,920
It suits you.

[Zang Mansion]

285
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,550
The Master probably won't come back today.

286
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,040
You should go back early.

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,630
It's fine.

288
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,670
I'll wait until

289
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,960
Mr. Zang returns,

290
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,450
whether it's tomorrow

291
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,690
or the day after.

292
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
It's just that this pot of tea

293
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,650
has become weak.

294
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,240
Miss,

295
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,680
please get me a fresh pot.

The Legend of Prince Annan?

297
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,230
Duan Aodeng,

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,000
younger brother of Duan Aoze, the Emperor of Benevolence of Yao State.

299
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
He is titled Prince Annan.

300
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,120
He is extraordinarily wise and a masterful commander,

301
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
able to plan strategies in his mind

302
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,640
and win battles thousands of miles away.

303
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,040
Prince Annan,

304
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,000
the Taijin Army

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,480
has reached the gates of Jiyang City.

306
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,510
Commander Lu Qingshan

307
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,960
requests your order

308
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,690
to fight them outside the city.

309
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,109
The Taijin Army has marched a long way

310
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,440
and urgently needs a victory to boost morale.

311
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,300
They will be impatient in battle.

312
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,609
It's the rainy season,

313
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,750
and they're not accustomed to the environment,

314
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,609
which is depleting their forces.

315
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,240
Tell Lu Qingshan

316
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,050
we will only defend,

317
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:42,290
not attack.

318
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,620
We'll wear them down slowly

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,310
until they are exhausted.

320
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,930
In the Battle of Jiyang,

321
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,370
Taijin suffered a crushing defeat,

322
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,340
which soon became legendary.

323
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,090
At court, he excels in both civil and military affairs,

324
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,510
and in private life, he displays remarkable grace,

325
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,920
with refined tastes

326
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,400
and mastery of all six classical arts.

327
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,990
Its spine is as hard as rock,

328
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,110
and its blade is sharp and bright.

329
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,110
It's a fine sword.

330
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,350
But what a pity—

331
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,900
rigid things break easily.

332
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,680
Humans are like this,

333
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,250
and so are swords.

334
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,930
Forgive me, Prince Annan.

335
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,390
Forgive me, Prince Annan!

336
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,660
Your sword-forging skills are not yet up to par.

337
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,990
You should practice more when you return.

338
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,550
Sir,

339
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,420
are you from Yao State?

340
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,880
The Master has quite an unpredictable temperament.

341
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,940
Sometimes he goes out without notice

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,370
and won't return for half a month.

343
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,000
Why do you have to waste your time waiting here?

344
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,750
Is that so?

345
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,880
I heard Ninglan

346
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,440
holds a merchants' assembly

347
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,160
on the first and fifteenth of every month.

348
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,490
Today is the fifteenth.

349
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,030
Just now, when I arrived,

350
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,690
I saw the carriage at the gate.

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,750
The Master must have gone

352
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,550
on foot today for his health.

353
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,240
So that means

354
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,900
Mr. Zang is still in the city.

355
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll go find him.

356
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,210
Miss.

357
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,550
You may leave.

358
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,750
Yes.

359
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,920
General Li,

360
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,310
I didn't show myself simply because I didn't want to see you.

361
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,160
How did you even become a general

362
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,420
with such poor social awareness?

363
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
This way, sir.

364
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you.

365
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,030
After you.

366
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,980
You know me?

367
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,740
You really don't remember me?

368
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,240
Fine.

369
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I've been searching for you in vain.

370
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Do you have

371
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
a flame-shaped mark

372
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,390
on your back?

373
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,800
I served you three pots of tea within two hours.

374
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,440
I've fulfilled my hostly duties.

375
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,270
Now that you've seen me,

376
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,830
please leave.

377
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,000
Mr. Zang,

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,440
you haven't even asked my purpose for coming

379
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,490
and you're already asking me to leave?

380
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,490
You are a general of Taijin.

381
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
You can't possibly be here to do business with me, can you?

382
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,400
Exactly.

383
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,480
That's exactly why I'm here.

384
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,400
For the next three years,

385
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,790
all food, clothing, and supplies for the Changfeng Army

386
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,640
will be purchased from Ninglan.

387
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,750
What do you think?

388
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,200
General Li,

389
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,480
Ninglan may be small,

390
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
but its main business is trade.

391
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Money is the last thing it lacks.

392
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,550
From what I know,

393
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,110
you've always been frugal—

394
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,160
even when staying at an inn.

395
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,110
Three years of procurement—

396
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,830
this profit probably wouldn't even match

397
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,040
the value of your head.

398
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,590
If I had put something in this tea,

399
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,500
you would already have been sent

400
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,150
to the capital of Yao State.

401
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,510
Don't worry.

402
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,270
I have no intention of taking this reward.

403
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,200
I only want to make my stance clear—

404
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,270
Ninglan has always kept to itself

405
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,830
and never involved itself in disputes between the two countries.

406
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,350
Please don't waste your time here.

407
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
You have been implanted

408
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,670
with dark magic.

409
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,510
This magic

410
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,030
is activated by blood.

411
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,350
Once the blood pact is established,

412
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,860
you would gain immense power and serve your master with unwavering loyalty.

413
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
Why should I believe you?

414
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,180
With so many people in Yao State,

415
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,210
why was I chosen?

416
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,590
Because you've had exceptional physical qualities since childhood

417
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,510
and are a rare martial arts prodigy,

418
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,160
you're naturally one in a million.

419
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,780
She keeps you by her side

420
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,660
to use you,

421
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,030
to turn you into

422
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,200
a bloodthirsty beast.

423
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,260
Before, when I was lost in the wild,

424
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,140
it was Li Shuang who saved me.

425
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,330
Besides,

426
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,030
if she really had ulterior motives,

427
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,030
why would she have sent me away back then?

428
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,830
Then why don't you consider why,

429
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,670
when you were lost,

430
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,270
it just so happened that Li Shuang

431
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,150
appeared by your side?

432
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,050
She's the mastermind behind all this.

433
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,650
She knows you are bound by the blood pact

434
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,920
and cannot leave her.

435
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,050
The reason she repeatedly pushes you away

436
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,510
was to tame you,

437
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,870
so you would willingly

438
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
be under her control.

439
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
Isn't that right?

440
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,170
I understand

441
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
you do not

442
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,130
want to bring trouble upon yourself.

443
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,000
But sometimes,

444
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,690
trouble comes to you

445
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,030
whether you want it or not.

446
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,550
As long as I maintain neutrality,

447
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,270
both Yao State and Taijin will be my backers.

448
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,830
I am not afraid of trouble.

449
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,680
General Li,

450
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,310
please leave.

451
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,800
Mr. Zang,

452
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,480
you're well-informed

453
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,380
and good at business,

454
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,400
but you can't protect yourself.

455
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,920
Now that

456
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,040
Yao State has a new ruler,

457
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,000
the whole situation has drastically changed.

458
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,730
If war breaks out in the future,

459
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,960
they won't keep their promises

460
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,220
like Prince Annan did.

461
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,720
The Changfeng Army

462
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,660
can ensure Ninglan's safety.

463
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,960
I won't interfere with your trade.

464
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,510
What I want is simple—

465
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,790
a map of Ninglan

466
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,580
in your hands.

467
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,230
Thank you for telling me.

468
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,150
But Li Shuang and I

469
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,560
have faced death together before.

470
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,400
I know her,

471
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,920
and I trust her.

472
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,480
How ridiculous.

473
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,810
I'm just afraid you've misplaced your trust.

474
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,870
She came to Ninglan

475
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,200
under the pretense of official business,

476
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,590
but in reality, she's investigating your background.

477
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,520
Unfortunately,

478
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,480
you're completely in the dark about it.

479
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,270
You keep claiming that Li Shuang has ulterior motives.

480
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,730
What evidence do you have?

481
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,800
This man is called Zang Budu.

482
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,320
He's a major figure in Ninglan,

483
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,350
with the widest network of information.

484
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,070
Well?

485
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,880
Do you believe me now?

486
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,510
What is his full name?

487
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,960
Does he have any birthmarks

488
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,620
or distinguishing features?

489
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,110
If he did,

490
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,210
I wouldn't need to trouble you.

491
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,350
I found this person in the mountains.

492
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,350
He was injured and lost his memory.

493
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,680
Found in the mountains?

494
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,110
You really do like meddling.

495
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,790
What exactly

496
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,680
are you trying to say?

497
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,440
I just don't want

498
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,330
to see you being manipulated.

499
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,040
Of course,

500
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,310
this matter is

501
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,290
indeed too cruel for you.

502
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,550
But fortunately, you're still alive.

503
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,150
The most important thing now

504
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,370
is to break the blood pact on you.

505
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,960
Can you break it?

506
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,000
But only the one who tied the knot can untie it.

507
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,510
Outside Lucheng,

508
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,120
there's a dense forest.

509
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,720
In three days,

510
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,200
you must find a way

511
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,750
to go there with Li Shuang.

512
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,590
That way,

513
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,000
I might be able to break your blood pact.

514
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Three days?

515
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Why the hurry?

516
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,990
This dark magic

517
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,300
concerns your life.

518
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,160
It must be removed as soon as possible.

519
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,950
Remember,

520
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,410
three days.

521
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,240
Where have you been?

522
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,570
Why are you back so late?

523
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,070
What's wrong?

524
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,470
Where did you go just now?

525
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,760
It concerns military matters.

526
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,740
I can't tell you.

527
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,480
You can't tell me?

528
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,110
Or...

529
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,070
are you afraid to tell me?

530
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,070
What do you mean?

531
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Zang Budu has eyes and ears everywhere.

532
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,640
Surely

533
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,560
he can help you find out my background, right?

534
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,400
You followed me?

535
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,090
I have my reasons

536
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,640
for doing this,

537
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,170
but I cannot tell you right now.

538
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,810
Fine.

539
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
You can't tell me.

540
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,430
So what if I investigate you?

541
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,160
You're in the General's Residence.

542
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,640
Investigating your identity

543
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,750
is my duty.

544
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,190
What's wrong with that?

545
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,590
Fine.

546
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,330
Since that's the case,

547
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,080
I want to ask you a question.

548
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,030
If it turns out I'm of questionable background,

549
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,790
what would you do with me?

550
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,160
Punish me,

551
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,720
kill me,

552
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,310
or abandon me like worthless trash,

553
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,260
leaving me to fend for myself?

554
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,270
General!

555
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,240
General!

556
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,960
Come in.

557
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,720
General,

558
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,660
Military Supervisor Li Zhangyi is almost here.

559
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,550
Greetings, General.

560
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,930
Isn't this

561
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,480
the naked young man

562
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,190
in your tent that day?

563
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,360
This is a military matter.

564
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,490
You shouldn't be present.

565
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,380
Wait at another camp for a moment.

566
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,550
General,

567
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,270
you've traveled all night.

568
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,680
Should we first…?

569
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,610
Get to the point.

570
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,840
That Li Zhangyi

571
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,040
is part of Prince Li's faction.

572
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,930
He has always been at odds with Old General Li in court.

573
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,960
His visit this time

574
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,760
might be disadvantageous to us.

575
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,650
He's an Imperial Military Supervisor, carrying the emperor's authority.

576
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,980
No matter what, we can't fall out with him.

577
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,100
When we meet him,

578
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,480
just cooperate with him.

579
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,280
Handle everything else as the situation demands.

580
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,310
My Lord.

581
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,270
I am Qin Lan, an officer of the Changfeng Army.

582
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,600
I am Luo Teng, a captain.

583
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,310
Greetings, Lord Li.

584
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,510
Lord Li.

585
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,680
Lord Li!

586
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,960
You've had a long journey.

587
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,140
Lord Li,

588
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,670
you must be exhausted.

589
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,370
The general has been waiting for you.

590
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,160
My Lord,

591
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,450
please come in.

592
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,190
Lord Li, thank you for coming here all the way.

593
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,310
Outside,

594
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,180
the mountain wind is cold,

595
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,920
but inside the tent it's as warm as spring.

596
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,550
General Li,

597
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,130
you really know how to enjoy yourself.

598
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,720
The mountain climate

599
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,070
is nothing like Yunjing.

600
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,200
It's rainy all year.

601
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,590
I always

602
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,730
share the same living conditions as my soldiers.

603
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,600
You are the Imperial Military Supervisor.

604
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,270
We dare not

605
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,350
be negligent in hosting you.

606
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,070
Speaking of enjoying oneself,

607
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,240
how could I

608
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,240
compare to you?

609
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,270
This cloak

610
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,310
appears to be made of expensive fabric,

611
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,810
with intricate embroidery.

612
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,890
It's clearly a royal tribute.

613
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,600
It clearly shows that you're most favored

614
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,920
by Prince Li.

615
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,920
On what grounds

616
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,320
are you saying this?

617
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,240
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,480
His Majesty never likes ministers conspiring

619
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,010
or giving gifts privately.

620
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,500
Lord Li,

621
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,350
how could you commit such an offense knowingly?

622
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,500
Servents.

623
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,490
The Purple-Gold Sword granted to me by His Majesty is here.

624
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,860
Criminal Li Shuang, kneel at once.

625
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,440
His Majesty has never condemned me.

626
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,240
I

627
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,200
cannot accept the title of "criminal"

628
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,330
that you place on me.

629
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,160
His Majesty granted me full authority to investigate the Huo Du case.

630
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,350
There are many suspicious points.

631
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,650
It's clear someone

632
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,240
deliberately framed him

633
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,790
to plot against a court minister.

634
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,200
And you, Li Shuang, failed in your investigation,

635
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,510
making you a prime suspect.

636
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,260
Lord Li.

637
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,990
My Lord.

638
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,800
Huo Du

639
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,489
was indeed a spy collaborating with the enemy.

640
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:26,900
I have verified that.

641
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,630
But his death

642
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,880
was truly an accident.

643
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
An accident?

644
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,000
If what you say is true,

645
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,110
then whoever killed Huo Du

646
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,760
must have been silencing a witness.

647
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
If I may, General,

648
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,000
why did you only hand over a corpse

649
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,070
but not the murderer?

650
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Or could it be that

651
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,920
the one who eliminated him

652
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,800
to prevent future troubles

653
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,880
was you?

654
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,370
Since you cannot prove your innocence,

655
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,000
it counts as a confession.

656
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,190
I

657
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,790
carry the emperor's orders.

658
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,360
I must punish you severely.

659
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,840
Guards!

660
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Yes!

661
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,340
Strip her armor

662
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,190
and give her 30 lashes with the military rod.

663
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,920
Yes!

664
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,030
Who dares!

665
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,880
Step back!

666
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,640
Luo Teng!

667
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,000
General!

668
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,880
Step back!

669
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,450
Luo Teng!

670
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,300
My Lord!

671
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,880
Actually, the person who killed Huo Du...

672
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,810
-Was me.
-Was me!

673
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,960
I was the one

674
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,160
who accidentally killed Huo Du.

675
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,610
With the fact before us,

676
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,090
I am willing

677
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,610
to accept any punishment.

678
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,360
Then let me ask you,

679
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,440
who is your blood master?

680
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,620
When you were lost,

681
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,020
why did she just happen to appear?

682
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,920
So what if I investigate you?

683
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,800
You're in the General's Residence.

684
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,710
Investigating your identity

685
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,070
is my duty.

686
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,520
What's wrong with that?

687
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,630
Li Shuang…

688
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,630
is she really that kind of person?

689
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,990
Perhaps...

690
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,390
she didn't intentionally hide it from me.

691
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,360
But if that's the case,

692
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,710
why does she refuse to tell me?

693
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,170
My Lord,

694
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
the Huo Du case has already been settled.

695
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,190
If you have doubts, you can continue a thorough investigation.

696
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,510
Why did you resort to private punishment?

697
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,190
For the sake of

698
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,450
serving in the same court as the General,

699
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,220
please stop here.

700
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,150
Please stop here, My Lord.

701
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,880
My Lord, please reconsider it.

702
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,340
The General is honorable.

703
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,190
She willingly accepted the punishment to prove her integrity.

704
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,650
I heard the Changfeng Army

705
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,530
maintains strict discipline.

706
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,190
The agreed 30 lashes

707
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,480
shall not be reduced by even one.

708
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,370
Lord Li...

709
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,650
How dare you!

710
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,630
Who are you

711
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,700
to interfere with this punishment?

712
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,060
Who allowed you to come out?

713
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,010
Go back!

714
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,550
Li Shuang is the commander of the Changfeng Army.

715
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,590
How dare you petty officials

716
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,760
punish her?

717
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,960
If she is injured

718
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
and word gets out,

719
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,840
Yao State might seize the opportunity to start another war.

720
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,770
Can you bear that responsibility?

721
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,920
General Li herself has admitted

722
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,710
accidentally killing Huo Du.

723
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,400
Our laws are strict.

724
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,280
Even a general cannot escape punishment.

725
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,050
My Lord, you are eager to achieve merit,

726
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,170
yet you cannot even determine who the suspect is.

727
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,030
I killed Huo Du.

728
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,410
I was the only one present when it happened.

729
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,010
I will bear the consequences

730
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,340
of what I did alone.

731
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,920
General Li, you certainly know how to command your subordinates.

732
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,420
Even in such a serious case,

733
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,380
someone rushed to take responsibility.

734
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,470
Very well.

735
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,820
Since that is the case,

736
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:45,210
I shall question you thoroughly.

737
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:45,970
Guards!

738
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,430
Take him away!

739
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,920
Who dares!

740
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,240
Lord Li,

741
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,960
if you wish to provide the court with a resolution,

742
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,630
I will cooperate.

743
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,510
But now, having beaten me,

744
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,710
you still intend to take my subordinate.

745
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,880
The Changfeng Army

746
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,360
is not a place where anyone can do as they please.

747
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,190
Li Shuang,

748
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,800
you are shielding your subordinate.

749
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,110
Do you intend to defy the imperial order?

750
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,530
My Lord, you keep claiming

751
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,650
there is an imperial decree.

752
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,480
Well, I'd like to see

753
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
where it is!

754
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,320
You should know

755
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,840
the punishment

756
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,730
for forging an imperial decree.

757
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,770
My Lord,

758
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,190
this is their territory.

759
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,790
We shouldn't use force here.

760
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,940
If things escalate,

761
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,670

763
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,630
Whatever I witnessed today,

764
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,230

765
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,840
General Li,
