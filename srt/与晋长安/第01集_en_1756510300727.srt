You don't remember your birthday.

4
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,700
My life has been drifting,

5
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,880
so I don't remember mine either.

6
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,750
Why don't we make today

7
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,310
our shared birthday?

8
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,240
We may not have been born on the same day,

9
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,190
but we wish to die on the same day.

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,079
That way,

11
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,630
we would be

12
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,590
born together

13
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,970
and die together.

14
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,470
If only everything

15
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,000
could stay at this moment,

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,470

[Origin of Our Fate]

18
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
The Jade Linglong

19
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,120
is the most evil artifact in the world.

20
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,070
once inside the body,

21
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,390
it can transform a living person
into an obedient shadow puppet.

22
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,720
A shadow puppet acknowledges its master

23
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,630
through a blood contract,

24
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,830
and when nourished with blood essence,

25
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,310
it gains extraordinary power,

26
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,090
able to fight against
10,000 soldiers alone.

27
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,720
Consort Qin,

28
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,560
how dare you?

29
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,310
You're actually trying
to kill the Emperor.

30
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,160
Honey,

31
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,300
I love you so much.

32
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,590
How could I ever bear to kill you?

33
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,560
Once the Jade Linglong enters the body,

34
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,909
the shadow puppet
will lose all previous memories,

35
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,550
becoming mentally connected
with the blood master,

36
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,430
loyal for eternity.

37
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,600

Prince Annan,

49
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,400
the Changfeng Army
really did launch a surprise attack.

Prince Annan.

51
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,620
You predicted it perfectly.

52

The Changfeng Army
has really fallen into our trap.

Li Shuang again!

56
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,840
This time, we must capture her alive!

57
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,940
Our main forces have long

58
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,900
been lying in wait around Lucheng.

Lucheng grows such fine fruit.

69
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,480
Then I'll have to cross the valley

70
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,100

We were no match.

92
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,330

there's no grudge between us.

114
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,320
It was all his instigation

Oh, no.

118
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,300
The Jade Linglong
hasn't formed a blood pact yet,

119

but has forcibly entered the body.

120

Although the Yao Army's attack on Lucheng

149
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,640
caught us off guard,

150

Ridiculous!

153

You think that just because you won,

154
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
you have the leverage

155
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,640
and that His Majesty won't blame us?

Our plan for a night raid on the Yao State

should have been flawless,

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,510
Although you saved me,

192
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,420
I won't tolerate your impudence.

193
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,680
Military supplies are precious.

194
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,280
Since you spilled your food,

195
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,750
no food for you today.

196
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,400
You two,

197
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,240
let's go.

198
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,310
Why did I save her?

199
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,510
Why do I feel

200
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,680
calm and at ease

201
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,870
when seeing her?

202
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,480
Where does this strange power

203
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,830
come from?

204
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
What exactly happened?

205
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,670
Why do I look like this?

206
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,070
Why can't I remember anything?

207
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,750
Never mind.

208
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,490
The situation is unclear,

209
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,110
so survival is the priority.

210
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,120
Given how things are,

211
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,550
I can only live on as a child

212
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,440
and stay by her side.

213
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,530
So this is what I looked like as a child?

214
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,680
Quite handsome, I must say.

215
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,240
Why is this so itchy?

216
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,560
The fabric of these clothes is so rough,

217
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,650
and the style is sloppy and outdated.

218
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,550
General,

219
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,610
why did you believe him so easily

220
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,010
when he said he doesn't remember anything?

221
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,420
That day in the forest,

222
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,400
his eyes were vacant

223
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,150
and his heartbeat rapid.

224
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
He clearly went through something big.

225
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,880
The border is unstable.

226
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
Maybe he was traumatized

227
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,060
and temporarily lost his memory.

228
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,310
I heard his strength is incredible.

229
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,270
But he's just a child.

230
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,600
When he saved me that day,

231
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,960
either he lost his mind

232
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,270
or had ulterior motives.

233
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,790
That's why

234
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,830
we should keep him here.

235
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,720
He's just a child.

236
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
No matter how strong,

237
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,480
if he has hidden intentions,

238
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,790
he will eventually show his true colors.

239
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,510
Very well.

240
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,960
Then we'll just

241
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,550
be extra cautious.

242
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,830
General.

243
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,480
General?

244
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
I was just thinking,

245
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,400
perhaps he's like me,

246
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,110
just someone who has

247
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,190
suffered enough in this war.

248
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,320
It's her.

249
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,070
Why am I so sensitive to her scent?

250
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,810
Do I

251
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,560
have a dog's nose now?

252
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,860
The clothes you gave me were too big,

253
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,120
so I made some adjustments.

254
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,580
They look better this way.

255
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,350
You claimed you've lost your memory,

256
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,680
yet you still care about your appearance.

257
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,640
That day,

258
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,550
when I brought you back from the forest,

259
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,210
your clothes were in tatters,

260
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,510
but they were clearly adult clothes.

261
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,910
Were they your father's?

262
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,110
I'm thirsty.

263
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,770
Get me a cup of water.

264
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,210
Is she afraid that I poisoned her?

265
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,310
Is it too hot?

266
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,000
It is a bit hot.

267
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,260
Let it cool down before drinking.

268
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,120
This sword is so beautiful.

269
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,640
It's so heavy.

270
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,960
I can't even lift it.

271
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,110
Miss,

272
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,790
you're really strong.

273
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
This is the Changfeng Army camp

274
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,920
in Lucheng, Taijin.

275
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,750
I'm Li Shuang,
the general of the Changfeng Army.

276
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,080
You may call me General.

277
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,930
This sword is indeed heavy,

278
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,350
but for someone who could

279
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,030
send a man flying several meters
with one palm,

280
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,100
lifting it should be nothing.

281
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,710
Have you forgotten?

282
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,030
You happened to save me,

283
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,350
and just now pretended to be weak

284
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,880
to cover it up.

285
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,240
Why are you really here

286
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,060
at the Changfeng Army's camp?

287
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,160
I truly have no memory.

288
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm not lying to you.

289
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,030
I don't know

290
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,640
why I was in the forest

291
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,900
that day,

292
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,690
or why I saved you.

293
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,030
I just felt that

294
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,670
you were important to me

295
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,070
and I had to save you.

296
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,050
You're afraid I'm a spy?

297
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,830
If I really had ulterior motives,

298
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,640
wouldn't it

299
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,110
have been easier to just let you die

300
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,400
in the forest that day?

301
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,020
Your words and actions

302
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,820
all seem full of scheming.

303
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,880
Though you're just a child,

304
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,310
it seems you've had some training.

305
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,960
Otherwise,

306
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,130
how could you be so meticulous?

307
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,030
A child?

308
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,650
What's a child supposed to be like?

309
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,480
Am I not convincing enough?

310
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,480
When I was naughty and stubborn,

311
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,830
you didn't give me food;

312
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,060
now that I'm being obedient and smart,

313
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,950
you say I'm calculating.

314
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,200
I just want to survive.

315
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,700
Why am I wrong at every turn?

316
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,440
Since you're a general,

317
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,440
you must be knowledgeable and experienced.

318
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,130
Have you ever heard of
any way to reverse aging?

319
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm a general,

320
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,020
not a charlatan.

321
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,440
Also,

322
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,480
eat this candy

323
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,300
in secret.

324
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,030
I've issued a military order

325
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,290
forbidding you to eat.

326
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,790
What a timely rain this is.

327
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,090
It must be a year of abundant harvest.

328
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,000
I hope there will be

329
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,630
no more wars between the two countries,

330
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,100
and the people won't suffer anymore.

331
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,960
It's too cold today.

332
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,590
The General went to inspect the camp

333
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,440
and hasn't returned yet.

334
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
Let's go have a drink, bro.

335
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,750
Drinking?

336
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,430
If the general finds out,

337
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,720
we'll be beaten with military sticks.

338
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,310
Why do I feel so uncomfortable

339
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,960
and restless?

340
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,030
Why did I

341
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,400
turn back into an adult?

342
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,070
I want to see the General.

343
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:09,679
It's...

344
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,550
So you've walked right into the trap,
haven't you?

345
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,510
Tell me,

346
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,230
with the Changfeng Army camp's
tight guards,

347
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,480
how did you escape?

348
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
Tell the truth.

349
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
So many people

350
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,210
couldn't keep an eye on one child?

351
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,740
That's your incompetence.

352
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,170
Where have you been

353
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,370
all night?

354
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,280
I went to search for my origins.

355
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,070
Isn't that what you want to know the most?

356
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,330
Did you find anything?

357
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Since you ran away,

358
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,870
why did you come back?

359
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
I couldn't remember my past,

360
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,230
so I had nowhere to go.

361
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,400
Besides,

362
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,890
I only feel at ease

363
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,280
when I'm around you.

364
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,320
Kid,

365
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,550
speak properly.

366
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,950
I know this is a military camp

367
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,550
and you don't keep idlers.

368
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,110
I can be your soldier.

369
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,000
With those skinny arms and legs of yours?

370
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,710
You're no taller than a stump,

371
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,440
and you want to be a soldier?

372
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,760
That day in the forest,

373
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,240
you arrived late

374
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,440
and failed to protect her.

375
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,800
I was the one who saved the general.

376
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,590
That was...

377
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,230
just a lucky win.

378
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,590
You took advantage of the situation.

379
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,320
Besides,

380
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,920
if we hadn't arrived in time,

381
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,320
with your amateur skills,

382
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,120
could you have lasted that long?

383
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,510
So what?

384
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,500
It's enough that I can beat you.

385
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,590
You little brat,

386
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,480
you're asking for a beating.

387
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,050
If I beat him,

388
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,010
can I be your soldier?

389
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,590
Okay.

390
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,030
Excuse me.

391
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,740
You better keep your word.

392
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,760
Now that you're in the army,

393
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,920
you must

394
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,710
follow the rules from now on.

395
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,920
If you step out of line,

396
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,210
you'll face military punishment.

397
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,030
Ji Ran,

398
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,030
take him to register his name,

399
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,590
assign him a place to stay,

400
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,020
and issue his clothes.

401
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,440
Yes.

402
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,320
I don't know my name.

403
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,800
With your dirty looks and bare feet,

404
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,030
we'll just call you Cow Dung.

405
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,800
Cow Dung.

406
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,560
Call him Jin'an.

407
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,480
May our Taijin

408
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,020
enjoy lasting peace and prosperity.

409
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,880
I like this name.

410
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,070
General.

411
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,230
There's too much suspicion
surrounding this child.

412
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,670
Precisely because of that,

413
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,800
we should keep him where we can see him.

414
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,320
His fighting skills are impressive
and he's quite clever.

415
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,710
If we can verify his identity

416
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,970
and have him serve in our Changfeng Army,

417
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,920
it will be a huge boost for us.
