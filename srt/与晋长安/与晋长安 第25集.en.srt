[Episode 25]

3
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,039
You grew up with her.

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,229
She sees you as her only brother,

5
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,200
her only friend.

6
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,920
Others might not understand her,

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,979
but don't you understand her either?

8
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,570
Thanks.

9
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,000
But I fear it's all

10
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,570
too late now.

11
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
It's you.

12
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,250
I've long heard
shadow puppets have keen senses,

13
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,310
but I didn't expect

14
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,180
your memory to be so good too.

15
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,470
You've come at a bad time.

16
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,170
We're busy with something today

17
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,430
and have no time for guests.

18
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,829
I'll have to kill you all
and be done with it.

19
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,630
What's going on?

20
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,840
My supernatural strength is gone.

21
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,430
Thank you for your help, Your Highness.

22
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,829
Tell your master

23
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,079
not to forget his promise.

24
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,050
According to Jin Wujian,

25
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,269
we must lure Prince Li
to the secret forest

26
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,430
so he can strike.

27
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,430
Once I leave,

28
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,900
send word at once.

29
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,800
Make sure he comes after me.

30
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,680
I understand.

31
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
Here's the route map.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,930
Please be careful, Your Highness.

33
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,350
Your Highness,

34
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,190
the Crown Prince has escaped
through the back door.

35
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,310
Just as the mysterious person said,

36
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,390
the man in black didn't show up,

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,540
and the Crown Prince left
the General's Residence.

38
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,159
Kill them all.

39
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,920
Leave no one alive.

40
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,530
Yes!

41
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
General,

42
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,540
Jin'an and the Crown Prince

43
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,370
are both gone.

44
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,520
They must have escaped
through the back door.

45
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,540
If we follow the hoofprints,

46
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,670
we should be able to catch up with them.

47
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,480
You really have a death wish,

48
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,760
coming here to get yourself killed.

49
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,850
This place

50
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,710
is the altar specially built
for the heavenly tribulation.

51
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,910
Do you like it?

52
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,430
Are you saying

53
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,510
this is an altar?

54
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,070
Every detail here

55
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,540
was decided by Father
and the Imperial Astrologer.

56
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,620
It took a long time.

57
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,070
Do you see that ice lotus behind you?

58
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,960
Just forging the three-edged spike
in its center

59
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,620
took considerable manpower,

60
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,210
so when you fall upon it,

61
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,950
the spike can instantly
pierce your throat.

62
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm afraid you won't get to
see that spectacle

63
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,720
because I won't let you die on this altar.

64
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,810
You have to die by my hand.

65
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
Jin Wujian,

66
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,480
why did you deceive me?

67
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,870
What?

68
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,310
Are you still hoping
someone will come to save you?

69
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,680
Muli,

70
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,190
we are brothers.

71
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,630
What have I done wrong

72
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,270
for you to treat me like this?

73
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,730
If you must blame someone,

74
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
blame yourself for being the Crown Prince

75
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,860
and standing in my way.

76
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,909
If you must blame someone,

77
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,320
blame me for not trusting you at all.

78
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,830
I'm weak and powerless.

79
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,750
I've already given my all…

80
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,770
just to stay alive.

81
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,250
Su Muli,

82
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,630
you want to kill your own brother—
even more ruthless than a wolf!

83
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,230
Even if I go to hell
and become a vengeful ghost,

84
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,030
I will never let you go!

85
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,480
Fine.

86
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,790
I'll be waiting for you.

87
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,160
How dare you!

88
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,000
Kill her!

89
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,860
Your Highness!

90
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,150
Guard this place.

91
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,470
When the shadow puppet appears,

92
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,450
blood flows everywhere.

93
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,870
The great plan is about to succeed.

94
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,010
Congratulations, Master.

95
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,040
You actually kept the Kongqing Water

96
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,510
for yourself behind my back.

97
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,270
Yes.

98
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,700
But I must thank you, Yin.

99
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,120
Without you,

100
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,160
how could I have pulled it off?

101
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,710
So it really was you.

102
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,170
Back then, Godfather

103
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,180
fell victim to your foul play!

104
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,480
My dear junior,

105
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,960
you've finally figured it out.

106
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,030
Why?

107
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,390
Why do you think?

108
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
If it weren't for you

109
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,600
taking everything
that should have been mine,

110
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,400
why would I have practiced
forbidden techniques?

111
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,730
Guang Yuanming

112
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,450
ignored our bond as father and son,

113
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,070
destroyed my ability
to perform martial arts,

114
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,950
and nearly killed me.

115
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,870
Why could he try to kill me,

116
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,790
but I couldn't take revenge?

117
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,270
Answer me!

118
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,320
Why are you silent now?

119
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,720
Godfather once said

120
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,850
I was inferior to you in every way.

121
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,030
But now,

122
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,780
the shadow puppet is in my hands.

123
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,750
I alone decide

124
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,830
what's right and wrong in this world!

125
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,980
Your Highness.

126
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,180
Your Highness!

127
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,720
Your Highness, wake up.

128
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,990
Your Highness!

129
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,590
Your Highness, don't move.

130
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,360
This is… quicksand.

131
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,530
Your Highness,

132
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,780
we can't waste time.

133
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I'll pull you out.

134
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,950
You want me to save myself

135
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,720
at the cost of your life?

136
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,420
Your Highness,

137
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,060
I am your subject.

138
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,280
Protecting you

139
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,550
is my duty.

140
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,530
We must look at the bigger picture!

141
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,270
I can't do it.

142
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,900
If we delay any longer,

143
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,790
we'll both die here.

144
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,610
If Your Highness died here,

145
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,240
wouldn't that be
just what our enemies want?

146
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,100
Your Highness,

147
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,270
you still have responsibilities
to the country

148
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,510
and the people.

149
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,980
Your Highness.

150
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,550
Your Highness, hurry!

151
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,920
If I can't even protect the one I love,

152
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,270
how can I protect the country
and the people?

153
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,270
Your Highness!

154
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,690
Those times we shared…

155
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,080
I've never forgotten them.

156
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
But we can't live

157
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,870
only for ourselves.

158
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,900
If you make it out of here

159
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,160
and rise again,

160
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,680
you must promise me

161
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,660
to protect the Li family

162
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,510
and the Changfeng Army.

163
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
Your Highness.

164
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,910
Hurry.

165
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,270
Give me your hand.

166
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,250
Your Highness,

167
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,170
hurry!

168
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,060
Your Highness, remember,

169
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,520
you must live with your head held high!

170
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,450
I'll go find help right away.

171
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,250
Yin,

172
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,240
you're the only son Godfather ever loved.

173
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,940
I'll send you to meet him now!

174
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,300

Shuang.

227
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,590
It seems the Kongqing Water they gave you

228
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,880
hasn't worn off yet.

229

If you don't save her,

234
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,340

235

I can save her!

237
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,330
you must come back with me.

How did you…

243
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,370
How did I anticipate this

244
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,650
and lie in wait for you?

245
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,990
My dear brother,

246
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,820
everything that happened today

247
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,750
was all my plan.

248
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,970
You were nothing but a pawn.

249
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,400
How could I rest easy
without seeing your corpse

250
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,120
with my own eyes?

251
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,720
That quicksand was bottomless.

252
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,430
Yet you came out alive alone.

253
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
I suppose Li Shuang sacrificed her life
to save yours.

254
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,490
I thought you were
deeply in love with her,

255
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,400
but when faced with death,

256
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,030
you were just an ungrateful hypocrite.

257
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,240
What's the point

258
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,550
of someone like you
remaining in this world?

259
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,140
This dagger is coated with deadly poison,

260
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,790
made solely

261
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,250
to send you to your grave.

262
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,550
As your brother,
I've gone to such lengths.

263
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,940

It was…

279
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,080
It was Jin'an.

280
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,960
He killed Su Muli.

As your brother,
I've gone to such lengths.

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,300
May you rest in peace

285
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,620
in the underworld.

286
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
Your right hand…

287
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,670
Did you ever think

288
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,110
that a loser like me

289
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,830
could be your downfall?

290
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,550
All these years,

291
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,640
I've gone to great pains to hide the truth
that my right hand is fine,

292
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,650
just to wash away the shame!

293
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,570
Now,

294
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,910
I'm the hunter,

295
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,100
and you're the prey.

296
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,270

299
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,480
I was wrong.

300
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,050
Don't forget,

301
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,390
I am your elder brother.

302
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,450

what are you going to do?

305
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,810
You can't kill your own brother.

306

Brother?

307
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,910
When you humiliated me endlessly

308
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,010
and tried to kill me,

309
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,500
why didn't you remember
you were my brother?

310
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,500
When did you ever treat me
like your brother?

311
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,640
When did you even treat me like a man?

312
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,180
[Wuling Mountain]

313
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,670
For several days now,

314
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,420
you haven't had a drop of water.

315
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,630
Even a god

316
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,990
couldn't survive like this.

317
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,450
Weren't you going
to take Jade Linglong out?

318
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,010
Why haven't you done it yet?

319
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,200
You've just suffered severe injuries,

320
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,400
and the Kongqing Water hasn't worn off.

321
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,080
If you don't recover properly,

322
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,270
I fear you won't live to see the day

323
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,170
when I take Jade Linglong out.

324
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,680
Stop pretending to care.

325
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,260
If you were truly compassionate,

326
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,540
would you have hurt Shuang?

327
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,440
Jade Linglong was out of control then.

328
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,470
The situation was perilous.

329
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,840
I didn't mean it.

330
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,790
I know you care for Li Shuang.

331
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,440
I've given her medicine.

332
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,320
Whether she lives or dies

333
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,750
is up to fate now.

334
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,890
Listen.

335
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,350
If anything happens to Shuang,

336
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,880
I will bathe Wuling Mountain in blood.

337
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,830
Do you think throwing your life away

338
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,680
will keep her safe?

339
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,720
I came to tell you

340
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,270
that everything's ready.

341
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,510
Tomorrow, I'll take Jade Linglong out.

342
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,550
The process

343
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,030
will be unbearably painful.

344
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,360
You need to be prepared.

345
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,220
Once Jade Linglong is out,

346
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,170
I can return to Shuang?

347
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,030
Why are you so obsessed?

348
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
Have you ever thought

349
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,640
that both your love

350
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,200
and loyalty to her

351
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
are because of the blood pact?

352
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,650
Once it's broken,

353
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,270
you will be free.

354
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,420
You won't be restrained by it anymore.

355
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,930
You're just a hermit grinding herbs
in the mountains.

356
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,000
What would you know of love?

357
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,630
If love only means

358
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,280
hurting others and oneself like you do,

359
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,800
I'd rather not understand it.

360
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,590
Other than Father,

361
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,520
you treated me better than anyone.

362
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,320
Your Highness, remember,

363
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,850
you must live with your head held high!

364
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,000
Your Majesty!

365
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,490
Greetings, Your Majesty.

366
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,590
What is the panic?

367
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,830
Your Majesty,

368
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,790
news has arrived from Lucheng,

369
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,480
saying

370
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,920
that Prince Li…

371
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,070
P-Prince Li…

372
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,550
h-he...

373
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,960
Speak clearly.

374
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,310
Prince Li

375
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,680
has passed away.

376
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,000
T-Then...

377
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,010
what about the Crown Prince?

378
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,340
The Crown Prince is safe

379
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
and will return to the capital soon.

380
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,310
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

381
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:08,970
Hurry!

382
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,840
Send for the imperial physicians!

383
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,760
Go! Hurry!

384
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,990
Your Highness,

385
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,510
news from the capital:

386
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,200
His Majesty fell ill upon hearing

387
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,400
of Prince Li's death.

388
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,680
It's time.

389
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,960
I believed Shuang

390
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,570
had forgotten our past

391
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,750
and left me in peril

392
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,990
until that day when she risked her life

393
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,200
to save me.

394
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,210
Only then did I realize—

395
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,930
she never forgot

396
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,310
what we once meant to each other.

397
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,460
General Li saved your life.

398
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,320
She should be properly rewarded.

399
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,790
Indeed.

400
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,270
But tell me,

401
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,910
with what identity am I to reward her?

402
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,300
With Prince Li dead,

403
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,860
his allies and underlings

404
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,230
are like ants on a hot pan,
all fearing for their lives.

405
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,000
The capital is already in chaos.

406
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,680
Now is

407
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,520
the perfect time for Your Highness
to return and seize power.

408
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,670
With Father gravely ill,

409
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,730
I must return to Yunjing ahead of you.

410
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,880
First,

411
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,100
I need to arrange Muli's funeral.

412
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,070
Second,

413
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,510
a country cannot go a day without a ruler.

414
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,440
You stay here

415
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,430
and take good care of Shuang.

416
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,680
Once everything is settled in the capital,

417
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,740
I will send someone to bring her back.

418
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,640
Your Majesty, I wish you

419
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,590
a smooth journey
and success in all endeavors.

420
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,240
Elder Tong,

421
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,450
thank you for your assistance.

422
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,230
[Prime Minister's Mansion]

423
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,710
Father-in-law.

424
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,510
What are you doing, Your Highness?

425
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,880
Thanks to your secret arrangements

426
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,230
along the way,

427
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,710
I managed to escape death

428
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,360
and return safely to the capital.

429
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,820
I cannot thank you enough.

430
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
You've suffered greatly, Your Highness.

431
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,880
Now that Prince Li is dead,

432
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,960
you can rest easy from here on.

433
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,630
Father

434
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,510
won't spare me.

435
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,770
You are now His Majesty's only son.

436
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,440
Why did you say such things?

437
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,590
Years ago,

438
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,070
Father believed the words
of a mystic charlatan

439
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,210
who claimed Mars retrograding near Antares

440
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,740
would threaten the imperial star.

441
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,230
To survive this tribulation,

442
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,480
someone must be

443
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,520
sacrificed in Father's place.

444
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,880
That sacrifice

445
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,660
was me.

446
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,920
Your Highness, don't speak such nonsense.

447
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,720
If you doubt it, Father-in-law,

448
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,370
check it with Father's personal guards.

449
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,860
You can find out the truth.

450
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,440
In Father's eyes,

451
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,710
I was meant to die.

452
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,210
Otherwise,
no matter how arrogant Prince Li was,

453
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,920
he wouldn't have dared
to openly try to kill me.

454
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,840
When Father arranged my marriage,

455
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,150
he wanted me and Tianjiao
to complement each other

456
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,480
and create
the so-called "perfect destiny."

457
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,800
I fear that after I die,

458
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,800
to cover up this scandal,

459
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,930
Tianjiao will meet the same fate.

460
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,960
She is my lawful wife after all.

461
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,000
Even though she never liked me,

462
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,440
I cannot stand by and watch her

463
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,570
be sent to her death.

464
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,620
Nor can I bear to see you
lose your home

465
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,670
and family.

466
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,350
How could this be?

467
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
I thought

468
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,140
once Prince Li was taken down,

469
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,250
I could live a peaceful life.

470
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,220
I never expected

471
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,670
there'd always be
another predator lurking.

472
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,550
I bear the title of heir,

473
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,570
but I can't protect anyone.

474
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,840
How many others know about this?

475
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,760
The others

476
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,100
almost all died in Lucheng.

477
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,900
As for the capital,

478
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,070
you're the only one

479
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,630
I've told.

480
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,870
With Prince Li dead,

481
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,160
His Majesty is overcome with grief
and has fallen ill.

482
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,100
Your Highness,
if you seize this opportunity,

483
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
you might advance even further.

484
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,700
No.

485
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,190
-He is my father after all.
-Your Highness!

486
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,230
When you were in Lucheng,

487
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,400
you knew to join forces with me

488
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,920
to bring Prince Li down.

489
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,110
Now at this critical moment,

490
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,240
you cannot afford to be soft-hearted!

491
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,510
There's

492
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,810
no…

493
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,880
no turning back for us now.

494
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,970
I'll just do as you say, Father-in-law.

495
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,070
Your Highness,

496
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,030
Chancellor Ji has sent word

497
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,690
that Jin Bao

498
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,200
has confessed everything.

499
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,930
He even revealed that Prince Li used him

500
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,300
to poison His Majesty.

501
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,640
He detailed the exact time

502
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,240
and dosage

503
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,580
with perfect clarity.

504
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,090
Prince Li planned to kill me first

505
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,880
and then wait for Father
to die from the poison.

506
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,800
This way,

507
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,190
he could rightfully inherit the throne.

508
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,030
What a brilliant scheme.

509
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,650
Unfortunately, his careful plotting

510
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,250
backfired on him.

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Now, the lives and fortunes
of half the court officials

512
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,630
are in Your Highness's hands.

513
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,710
Once a wolf has the prey between its jaws,

514
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,180
it won't let go.

515
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,530
Finally,

516
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,770
they're the prey,

517
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,790
and I'm the hunter.

518
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,540
Minister Tian,

519
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,800
if you pledge your loyalty
to the Crown Prince,

520
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,380
you will enjoy endless wealth

521
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,820
and glory.

522
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,150
I am willing.

523
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,740
I was foolish to follow Prince Li.

524
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,620
I see my mistake now.

525
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,480
From now on,

526
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,110
I'll serve the Crown Prince

527
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,070
and carry out

528
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,460
his every order.

529
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Lord Zhang,

530
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,800
you've always been Prince Li's loyal dog,

531
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,930
refusing to repent.

532
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,070
Today

533
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,790
is the day you die.

534
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,870
[Reign]
