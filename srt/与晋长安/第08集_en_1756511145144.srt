00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,880
Don't you like biographies?

194
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,310
A bookstore this big

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,000
must have everything.

196
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,510
If you find the ones you like,

197
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,470
you won't have to trouble Su Muyang

198
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,750
to search everywhere.

199
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,240
I noticed that you didn't even touch the biographies

200
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
he gave you last time.

201
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,320
Whether he really betrayed you

202
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,910
or

203
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,170
was genuinely forced by circumstances,

204
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,260
I guess now

205
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,270
you just don't want anything

206
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,030
to do with him.

207
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,550
It's not that.

208
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Really.

209
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
I just...

210
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,010
don't like biographies anymore.

211
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,990
I thought if I bought more biographies,

212
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,910
you could forget the past

213
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,200
and enjoy reading.

214
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,610
But since you don't like them anymore,

215
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,410
just forget it.

216
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,050
It's really a shame.

217
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,720
This bookstore is huge—

218
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,910
there might be many rare editions.

219
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,000
I have a collection of military books

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,980
I've been collecting for years,

221
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,690
but I'm still missing one volume.

222
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,020

The Tale of Mr. Bat, Volume Two.

236
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,080
Such a unique...

237
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,630
Such a unique military book.

238
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,790
I grabbed the wrong one.

239
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,270
[The Beauty of Hell: The Legend of Li Shuang]

240
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,070
So it seems you really are,

241
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,820
as the book says,

242
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
cunning

243
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,240
and two-faced.

244
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,000
The Beauty of Hell?

245
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,840
I was wondering

246
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,170
who came up with that name

247
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,270
and who spread

248
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,190
all these stories.

249
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,720
The book also says

250
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,560
you ate many children

251
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,570
to perfect your martial arts.

252
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,870
Is that true?

253
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,200
It's all true.

254
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,120
In fact,

255
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,150
not only do I love eating children,

256
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,390
I also like

257
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,630
eating fair-skinned young men.

258
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,610
Are you scared?

259
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,290
Not at all.

260
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,630
I actually think

261
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,080
these absurd stories

262
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,710
make you even more alive.

263
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,480
Ever since I met you,

264
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
you've always kept a stern face,

265
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
being cautious

266
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,960
and thoughtful.

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
Being serious all the time is exhausting.

268
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,570
I think you could learn from your brother.

269
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,140
Being carefree

270
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,170
and lighthearted

271
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,360
isn't so bad, is it?

272
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,960
Mind your own business.

273
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,690
These bizarre stories…

274
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,810
Some say I kill without mercy,

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,860
and some say I care for the people.

276
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,870
Who knows

277
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,360
I like hiding here,

278
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,380
reading biographies in secret?

279
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,240
You wouldn't understand anyway.

280
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,670
I have things to do.

281
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,070
Look around by yourself.

282
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,190
Read this. I found a book for you.

283
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,920
It suits you.

284

[Zang Mansion]

285
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,550
The Master probably won't come back today.

286
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,040
You should go back early.

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,630
It's fine.

288
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,670
I'll wait until

289
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
Mr. Zang returns,

290
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,450
whether it's tomorrow

291
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,690
or the day after.

292
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,720
It's just that this pot of tea

293
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,650
has become weak.

294
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,240
Miss,

295
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
please get me a fresh pot.

The Legend of Prince Annan?

297
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,230
Duan Aodeng,

298
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,000
younger brother of Duan Aoze, the Emperor of Benevolence of Yao State.

299
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,480
He is titled Prince Annan.

300
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,120
He is extraordinarily wise and a masterful commander,

301
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
able to plan strategies in his mind

302
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,640
and win battles thousands of miles away.

303
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,040
Prince Annan,

304
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,000
the Taijin Army

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,480
has reached the gates of Jiyang City.

306
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,510
Commander Lu Qingshan

307
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,960
requests your order

308
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,690
to fight them outside the city.

309
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,109
The Taijin Army has marched a long way

310
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,440
and urgently needs a victory to boost morale.

311
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,300
They will be impatient in battle.

312
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,609
It's the rainy season,

313
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,750
and they're not accustomed to the environment,

314
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,609
which is depleting their forces.

315
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:33,240
Tell Lu Qingshan

316
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,050
we will only defend,

317
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,290
not attack.

318
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:39,620
We'll wear them down slowly

319
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,310
until they are exhausted.

320
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,930
In the Battle of Jiyang,

321
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,370
Taijin suffered a crushing defeat,

322
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,340
which soon became legendary.

323
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,090
At court, he excels in both civil and military affairs,

324
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,510
and in private life, he displays remarkable grace,

325
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,920
with refined tastes

326
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,400
and mastery of all six classical arts.

327
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,990
Its spine is as hard as rock,

328
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,110
and its blade is sharp and bright.

329
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,110
It's a fine sword.

330
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,350
But what a pity—

331
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,900
rigid things break easily.

332
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
Humans are like this,

333
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,250
and so are swords.

334
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,930
Forgive me, Prince Annan.

335
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,390
Forgive me, Prince Annan!

336
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,660
Your sword-forging skills are not yet up to par.

337
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,990
You should practice more when you return.

338
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,550
Sir,

339
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,420
are you from Yao State?

340
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,880
The Master has quite an unpredictable temperament.

341
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,940
Sometimes he goes out without notice

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,370
and won't return for half a month.

343
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,000
Why do you have to waste your time waiting here?

344
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,750
Is that so?

345
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,880
I heard Ninglan

346
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
holds a merchants' assembly

347
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,160
on the first and fifteenth of every month.

348
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,490
Today is the fifteenth.

349
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,030
Just now, when I arrived,

350
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,690
I saw the carriage at the gate.

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,750
The Master must have gone

352
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,550
on foot today for his health.

353
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,240
So that means

354
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,900
Mr. Zang is still in the city.

355
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll go find him.

356
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,210
Miss.

357
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,550
You may leave.

358
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,750
Yes.

359
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,920
General Li,

360
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,310
I didn't show myself simply because I didn't want to see you.

361
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,160
How did you even become a general

362
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,420
with such poor social awareness?

363
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,310
This way, sir.

364
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you.

365
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,030
After you.

366
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,980
You know me?

367
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,740
You really don't remember me?

368
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,240
Fine.

369
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I've been searching for you in vain.

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you have

371
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
a flame-shaped mark

372
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,390
on your back?

373
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,800
I served you three pots of tea within two hours.

374
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,440
I've fulfilled my hostly duties.

375
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,270
Now that you've seen me,

376
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,830
please leave.

377
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,000
Mr. Zang,

378
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
you haven't even asked my purpose for coming

379
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,490
and you're already asking me to leave?

380
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,490
You are a general of Taijin.

381
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,080
You can't possibly be here to do business with me, can you?

382
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,400
Exactly.

383
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,480
That's exactly why I'm here.

384
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,400
For the next three years,

385
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,790
all food, clothing, and supplies for the Changfeng Army

386
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,640
will be purchased from Ninglan.

387
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,750
What do you think?

388
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,200
General Li,

389
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,480
Ninglan may be small,

390
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,880
but its main business is trade.

391
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,680
Money is the last thing it lacks.

392
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,550
From what I know,

393
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,110
you've always been frugal—

394
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,160
even when staying at an inn.

395
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,110
Three years of procurement—

396
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,830
this profit probably wouldn't even match

397
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,040
the value of your head.

398
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,590
If I had put something in this tea,

399
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,500
you would already have been sent

400
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,150
to the capital of Yao State.

401
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,510
Don't worry.

402
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,270
I have no intention of taking this reward.

403
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,200
I only want to make my stance clear—

404
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
Ninglan has always kept to itself

405
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,830
and never involved itself in disputes between the two countries.

406
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,350
Please don't waste your time here.

407
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
You have been implanted

408
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,670
with dark magic.

409
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,510
This magic

410
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,030
is activated by blood.

411
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,350
Once the blood pact is established,

412
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,860
you would gain immense power and serve your master with unwavering loyalty.

413
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Why should I believe you?

414
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,180
With so many people in Yao State,

415
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,210
why was I chosen?

416
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,590
Because you've had exceptional physical qualities since childhood

417
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,510
and are a rare martial arts prodigy,

418
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,160
you're naturally one in a million.

419
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,780
She keeps you by her side

420
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,660
to use you,

421
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,030
to turn you into

422
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,200
a bloodthirsty beast.

423
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,260
Before, when I was lost in the wild,

424
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,140
it was Li Shuang who saved me.

425
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,330
Besides,

426
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,030
if she really had ulterior motives,

427
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,030
why would she have sent me away back then?

428
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,830
Then why don't you consider why,

429
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,670
when you were lost,

430
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,270
it just so happened that Li Shuang

431
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,150
appeared by your side?

432
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,050
She's the mastermind behind all this.

433
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,650
She knows you are bound by the blood pact

434
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,920
and cannot leave her.

435
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,050
The reason she repeatedly pushes you away

436
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,510
was to tame you,

437
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,870
so you would willingly

438
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,590
be under her control.

439
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Isn't that right?

440
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,170
I understand

441
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
you do not

442
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,130
want to bring trouble upon yourself.

443
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,000
But sometimes,

444
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,690
trouble comes to you

445
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,030
whether you want it or not.

446
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,550
As long as I maintain neutrality,

447
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,270
both Yao State and Taijin will be my backers.

448
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,830
I am not afraid of trouble.

449
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,680
General Li,

450
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,310
please leave.

451
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,800
Mr. Zang,

452
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,480
you're well-informed

453
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,380
and good at business,

454
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,400
but you can't protect yourself.

455
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,920
Now that

456
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,040
Yao State has a new ruler,

457
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,000
the whole situation has drastically changed.

458
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,730
If war breaks out in the future,

459
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,960
they won't keep their promises

460
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,220
like Prince Annan did.

461
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,720
The Changfeng Army

462
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,660
can ensure Ninglan's safety.

463
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,960
I won't interfere with your trade.

464
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,510
What I want is simple—

465
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,790
a map of Ninglan

466
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,580
in your hands.

467
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,230
Thank you for telling me.

468
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,150
But Li Shuang and I

469
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,560
have faced death together before.

470
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,400
I know her,

471
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,920
and I trust her.

472
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,480
How ridiculous.

473
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,810
I'm just afraid you've misplaced your trust.

474
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,870
She came to Ninglan

475
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,200
under the pretense of official business,

476
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,590
but in reality, she's investigating your background.

477
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,520
Unfortunately,

478
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,480
you're completely in the dark about it.

479
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,270
You keep claiming that Li Shuang has ulterior motives.

480
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,730
What evidence do you have?

481
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
This man is called Zang Budu.

482
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,320
He's a major figure in Ninglan,

483
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,350
with the widest network of information.

484
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,070
Well?

485
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
Do you believe me now?

486
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,510
What is his full name?

487
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,960
Does he have any birthmarks

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,620
or distinguishing features?

489
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,110
If he did,

490
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,210
I wouldn't need to trouble you.

491
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,350
I found this person in the mountains.

492
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,350
He was injured and lost his memory.

493
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,680
Found in the mountains?

494
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,110
You really do like meddling.

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,790
What exactly

496
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,680
are you trying to say?

497
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,440
I just don't want

498
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,330
to see you being manipulated.

499
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,040
Of course,

500
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,310
this matter is

501
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,290
indeed too cruel for you.

502
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,550
But fortunately, you're still alive.

503
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,150
The most important thing now

504
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,370
is to break the blood pact on you.

505
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,960
Can you break it?

506
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,000
But only the one who tied the knot can untie it.

507
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,510
Outside Lucheng,

508
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,120
there's a dense forest.

509
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,720
In three days,

510
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,200
you must find a way

511
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,750
to go there with Li Shuang.

512
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,590
That way,

513
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,000
I might be able to break your blood pact.

514
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Three days?

515
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
Why the hurry?

516
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,990
This dark magic

517
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,300
concerns your life.

518
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,160
It must be removed as soon as possible.

519
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,950
Remember,

520
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,410
three days.

521
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,240
Where have you been?

522
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,570
Why are you back so late?

523
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,070
What's wrong?

524
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,470
Where did you go just now?

525
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,760
It concerns military matters.

526
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,740
I can't tell you.

527
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,480
You can't tell me?

528
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,110
Or...

529
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,070
are you afraid to tell me?

530
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,070
What do you mean?

531
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,880
Zang Budu has eyes and ears everywhere.

532
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,640
Surely

533
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,560
he can help you find out my background, right?

534
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,400
You followed me?

535
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,090
I have my reasons

536
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,640
for doing this,

537
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,170
but I cannot tell you right now.

538
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,810
Fine.

539
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
You can't tell me.

540
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,430
So what if I investigate you?

541
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,160
You're in the General's Residence.

542
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,640
Investigating your identity

543
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,750
is my duty.

544
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,190
What's wrong with that?

545
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,590
Fine.

546
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,330
Since that's the case,

547
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,080
I want to ask you a question.

548
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,030
If it turns out I'm of questionable background,

549
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,790
what would you do with me?

550
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,160
Punish me,

551
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,720
kill me,

552
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,310
or abandon me like worthless trash,

553
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,260
leaving me to fend for myself?

554
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,270
General!

555
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,240
General!

556
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,960
Come in.

557
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,720
General,

558
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,660
Military Supervisor Li Zhangyi is almost here.

559
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,550
Greetings, General.

560
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,930
Isn't this

561
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,480
the naked young man

562
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,190
in your tent that day?

563
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,360
This is a military matter.

564
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,490
You shouldn't be present.

565
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,380
Wait at another camp for a moment.

566
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,550
General,

567
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,270
you've traveled all night.

568
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:40,680
Should we first…?

569
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,610
Get to the point.

570
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,840
That Li Zhangyi

571
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,040
is part of Prince Li's faction.

572
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,930
He has always been at odds with Old General Li in court.

573
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,960
His visit this time

574
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,760
might be disadvantageous to us.

575
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,650
He's an Imperial Military Supervisor, carrying the emperor's authority.

576
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,980
No matter what, we can't fall out with him.

577
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,100
When we meet him,

578
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,480
just cooperate with him.

579
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,280
Handle everything else as the situation demands.

580
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,310
My Lord.

581
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,270
I am Qin Lan, an officer of the Changfeng Army.

582
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,600
I am Luo Teng, a captain.

583
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,310
Greetings, Lord Li.

584
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,510
Lord Li.

585
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,680
Lord Li!

586
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,960
You've had a long journey.

587
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,140
Lord Li,

588
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,670
you must be exhausted.

589
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,370
The general has been waiting for you.

590
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,160
My Lord,

591
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,450
please come in.

592
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,190
Lord Li, thank you for coming here all the way.

593
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,310
Outside,

594
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,180
the mountain wind is cold,

595
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,920
but inside the tent it's as warm as spring.

596
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,550
General Li,

597
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,130
you really know how to enjoy yourself.

598
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,720
The mountain climate

599
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,070
is nothing like Yunjing.

600
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,200
It's rainy all year.

601
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,590
I always

602
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,730
share the same living conditions as my soldiers.

603
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,600
You are the Imperial Military Supervisor.

604
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,270
We dare not

605
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,350
be negligent in hosting you.

606
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,070
Speaking of enjoying oneself,

607
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,240
how could I

608
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,240
compare to you?

609
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,270
This cloak

610
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,310
appears to be made of expensive fabric,

611
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,810
with intricate embroidery.

612
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,890
It's clearly a royal tribute.

613
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,600
It clearly shows that you're most favored

614
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,920
by Prince Li.

615
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,920
On what grounds

616
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,320
are you saying this?

617
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,480
His Majesty never likes ministers conspiring

619
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,010
or giving gifts privately.

620
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,500
Lord Li,

621
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,350
how could you commit such an offense knowingly?

622
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,500
Servents.

623
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,490
The Purple-Gold Sword granted to me by His Majesty is here.

624
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,860
Criminal Li Shuang, kneel at once.

625
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,440
His Majesty has never condemned me.

626
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,240
I

627
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,200
cannot accept the title of "criminal"

628
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,330
that you place on me.

629
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,160
His Majesty granted me full authority to investigate the Huo Du case.

630
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,350
There are many suspicious points.

631
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,650
It's clear someone

632
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,240
deliberately framed him

633
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,790
to plot against a court minister.

634
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,200
And you, Li Shuang, failed in your investigation,

635
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,510
making you a prime suspect.

636
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,260
Lord Li.

637
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,990
My Lord.

638
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,800
Huo Du

639
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,489
was indeed a spy collaborating with the enemy.

640
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,900
I have verified that.

641
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,630
But his death

642
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,880
was truly an accident.

643
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,000
An accident?

644
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,000
If what you say is true,

645
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,110
then whoever killed Huo Du

646
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,760
must have been silencing a witness.

647
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,320
If I may, General,

648
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,000
why did you only hand over a corpse

649
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,070
but not the murderer?

650
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Or could it be that

651
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,920
the one who eliminated him

652
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,800
to prevent future troubles

653
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,880
was you?

654
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,370
Since you cannot prove your innocence,

655
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,000
it counts as a confession.

656
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,190
I

657
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,790
carry the emperor's orders.

658
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,360
I must punish you severely.

659
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,840
Guards!

660
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Yes!

661
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,340
Strip her armor

662
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,190
and give her 30 lashes with the military rod.

663
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,920
Yes!

664
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,030
Who dares!

665
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,880
Step back!

666
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,640
Luo Teng!

667
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,000
General!

668
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,880
Step back!

669
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,450
Luo Teng!

670
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,300
My Lord!

671
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
Actually, the person who killed Huo Du...

672
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,810
-Was me.
-Was me!

673
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,960
I was the one

674
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,160
who accidentally killed Huo Du.

675
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,610
With the fact before us,

676
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,090
I am willing

677
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,610
to accept any punishment.

678
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,360
Then let me ask you,

679
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,440
who is your blood master?

680
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,620
When you were lost,

681
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,020
why did she just happen to appear?

682
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,920
So what if I investigate you?

683
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,800
You're in the General's Residence.

684
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,710
Investigating your identity

685
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,070
is my duty.

686
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,520
What's wrong with that?

687
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,630
Li Shuang…

688
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,630
is she really that kind of person?

689
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,990
Perhaps...

690
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,390
she didn't intentionally hide it from me.

691
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,360
But if that's the case,

692
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,710
why does she refuse to tell me?

693
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,170
My Lord,

694
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,320
the Huo Du case has already been settled.

695
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,190
If you have doubts, you can continue a thorough investigation.

696
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,510
Why did you resort to private punishment?

697
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,190
For the sake of

698
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,450
serving in the same court as the General,

699
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,220
please stop here.

700
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,150
Please stop here, My Lord.

701
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,880
My Lord, please reconsider it.

702
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,340
The General is honorable.

703
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,190
She willingly accepted the punishment to prove her integrity.

704
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,650
I heard the Changfeng Army

705
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,530
maintains strict discipline.

706
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,190
The agreed 30 lashes

707
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,480
shall not be reduced by even one.

708
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,370
Lord Li...

709
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,650
How dare you!

710
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,630
Who are you

711
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
to interfere with this punishment?

712
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,060
Who allowed you to come out?

713
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,010
Go back!

714
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,550
Li Shuang is the commander of the Changfeng Army.

715
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,590
How dare you petty officials

716
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,760
punish her?

717
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,960
If she is injured

718
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
and word gets out,

719
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,840
Yao State might seize the opportunity to start another war.

720
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,770
Can you bear that responsibility?

721
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,920
General Li herself has admitted

722
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,710
accidentally killing Huo Du.

723
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,400
Our laws are strict.

724
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,280
Even a general cannot escape punishment.

725
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,050
My Lord, you are eager to achieve merit,

726
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,170
yet you cannot even determine who the suspect is.

727
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,030
I killed Huo Du.

728
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,410
I was the only one present when it happened.

729
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,010
I will bear the consequences

730
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,340
of what I did alone.

731
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,920
General Li, you certainly know how to command your subordinates.

732
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,420
Even in such a serious case,

733
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,380
someone rushed to take responsibility.

734
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,470
Very well.

735
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,820
Since that is the case,

736
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,210
I shall question you thoroughly.

737
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,970
Guards!

738
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,430
Take him away!

739
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,920
Who dares!

740
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,240
Lord Li,

741
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,960
if you wish to provide the court with a resolution,

742
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,630
I will cooperate.

743
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,510
But now, having beaten me,

744
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,710
you still intend to take my subordinate.

745
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,880
The Changfeng Army

746
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,360
is not a place where anyone can do as they please.

747
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,190
Li Shuang,

748
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,800
you are shielding your subordinate.

749
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,110
Do you intend to defy the imperial order?

750
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,530
My Lord, you keep claiming

751
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,650
there is an imperial decree.

752
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,480
Well, I'd like to see

753
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,320
where it is!

754
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,320
You should know

755
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,840
the punishment

756
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,730
for forging an imperial decree.

757
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,770
My Lord,

758
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,190
this is their territory.

759
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,790
We shouldn't use force here.

760
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,940
If things escalate,

761
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,670

762
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,150

763
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,630
Whatever I witnessed today,

764
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,230
I shall report to the court in full detail.

765
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,840
General Li,

00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,050
you'd better act wisely.
