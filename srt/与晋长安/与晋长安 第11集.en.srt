00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 11]

3
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,870
Are you alright?

4
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm glad you're alive.

5
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,829
We lost?

6
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,400
We could've

7
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,360
annihilated the Changfeng Army

8
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,590
with your approach.

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,590
However,

10
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,079
a man in black just showed up

11
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,120
out of nowhere.

12
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,310
He has extraordinary martial skills.

13
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,079
He not only bailed Lucheng out,

14
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,870
but also killed General Shi Du

15
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,030
in collaboration with Li Shuang.

16
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,930
Who is this man?

17
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,010
He doesn't seem

18
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,630
to be from the Changfeng Army.

19
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,280
Besides,

20
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,960
the spies we planted in Lucheng

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,470
don't know anything about him,

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,280
as if he just

23
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,829
appeared out of thin air.

24
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,960
A man in black...

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,900
That was indeed beyond my expectations.

26
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,079
Counsellor,

27
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,490
General Shi Du already died.

28
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,190
What can we do now?

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,630
Shall we retreat?

30
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,080
This a must-win battle.

31
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,250
We can't go home without triumphs.

32
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,010
I will petition the court to appoint

33
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,470
a new military commander.

34
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,400
Hard though it is,

35
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,970
we must conquer Lucheng.

36
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,220
Stop!

37
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,630
My Lord.

38
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,030
I'm reduced

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,570
to this situation
because of that hateful Li Shuang.

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,240
When I'm back to the capital,

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll definitely lodge a serious complaint

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
against her to Prince Li!

43
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,420
My Lord,

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,840
we'd better hurry.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,180
I've had fast horses arranged ahead.

46
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,900
Let's go.

47
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,420
Go.

48
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,360
Lord Li!

49
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,160
It's quite late now.

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,120
Where

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,800
are you two heading?

52
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,280
Lord Li would like a night stroll.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,680
You're a mere military advisor.

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,250
How dare you question
an imperial military supervisor?

55
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,360
I dare not.

56
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,960
However,

57
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,220
I'm afraid I might have to
ruin the night for you.

58
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,310
Lord Li,

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,070
the general requests your presence.

60
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,420
General.

61
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,210
You should be grateful
that you were captured by me

62
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,500
instead of Li Zhangyi.

63
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,310
Otherwise, you would've died by now.

64
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,210
Kill me if you want.

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,740
Why the gibberish?

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,100
As someone brave enough to sneak in
and burn our granaries alone,

67
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,670
you'd never fear death, would you?

68
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,790
Other than you, how many people

69
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,920
are on death missions in Lucheng?

70
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,060
Why did the Yao State send you here?

71
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
What exactly

72
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,080
is your relationship with Li Zhangyi?

73
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,670
Since you know I don't fear death,

74
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,240
I bet you're also aware

75
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,690
that you can't get

76
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,250
any information from me.

77
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,190
Resistance won't bring you any good.

78
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,100
I know people like you

79
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,500
aren't dreaded by death,

80
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,500
but survival.

81
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,090
I just came back
from the Fragrance Garden.

82
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,500
In order to catch you,

83
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,940
Li Zhangyi ordered
all the people there to be killed.

84
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,280
Twenty-odd living souls just perished,

85
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,130
including Yanzhi.

86
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,940
There's a sachet.

87
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,370
You recognize it, don't you?

88
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,070
All of you are evil.

89
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,210
Take my life now, I dare you!

90
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,690
Don't move!

91
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,370
Kill me!

92
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,660
The herbs in this sachet have

93
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,860
nerve-soothing and sleep-inducing effects.

94
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,790
I guess you have trouble sleeping.

95
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,330
So, Yanzhi put such herbs in this sachet

96
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,450
for you to carry it around.

97
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,990
That shows she truly cared for you.

98
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,620
But it didn't occur to her

99
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,570
that this very gesture of kindness

100
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,720
would cost her life in the end.

101
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,770
I was trained to sacrifice myself
for missions in childhood.

102
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,430
Crawling out from piles of corpses,

103
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,310
I've long forgotten
what it feels like to be a human.

104
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,300
Why on earth
would there be such a silly girl?

105
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,500
She sympathized with me,

106
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,890
trusted me and cared for me.

107
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,860
She gave me the only bit

108
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,690
of genuine love
I've ever got in these 20 years.

109
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,330
Now that you know
Yanzhi's affection for you,

110
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,330
you should avenge her unjust death!

111
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,810
Unjust deaths happen every now and then,
don't they?

112
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,260
How foolish of Yanzhi,

113
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,330
for choosing me
to be her inseparable confidant.

114
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,059
She always looked forward

115
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,650
to us leaving the brothel

116
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,330
and leading a carefree life.

117
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,850
To this day, I still don't understand

118
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,730
how much courage it'd take

119
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,200
for someone
to completely trust another person

120
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,970
in such chaotic times.

121
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,490
But it's fine.

122
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,260
I'll ask Yanzhi myself.

123
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,130
Before Miss Yanzhi died,

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,330
she still believed you were innocent.

125
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,860
You've already failed her.

126
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,180
Committing suicide

127
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,980
will only let her down even more!

128
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,240
Spill out Li Zhangyi's evildoing

129
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,910
to avenge your dead bosom friend now.

130
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,930
You've already completed the mission

131
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,720
assigned by the Yao State.

132
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,330
Li Zhangyi

133
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,760
refused to open the city gate
just to cover up

134
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,210
his mistakes,

135
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,580
resulting in the numerous deaths
of Lucheng soldiers!

136
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,340
I swear to drag him...

137
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,610
down to hell.

138
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,450
Li Zhangyi confessed
that he lost his token

139
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,380
as a result of staying overnight

140
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,570
in the Fragrance Garden.

141
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,210
Plus Yunge's testimony,

142
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,570
this time,

143
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,300
he won't get away.

144
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,720
For such a despicable man,

145
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,710
even death can't redeem his sins.

146
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,210
Have Li Zhangyi escorted

147
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,810
to the capital by a troop.

148
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,540
I've written

149
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,690
a memorial detailing this incident.

150
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,690
Deliver it to the capital, together with

151
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,810
these two testimonies,

152
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,020
for His Majesty to make a ruling.

153
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,490
Yes.

154
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,290
By the way,

155
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,740
has Yunge's funeral been taken care of?

156
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,390
Miss Yanzhi's and her bodies
have been buried together.

157
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,850
But, General,

158
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,180
she was a spy
from the Yao State after all.

159
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Is what we've done

160
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,940
somewhat inappropriate?

161
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,340
In such turbulent times,

162
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,740
does anyone truly
have control of their lives?

163
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,840
All are unfortunate beings.

164
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,660
Mr. Ji,

165
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,550
there's a visitor for you.

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
You shouldn't have come here, Miss.

167
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,180
Please leave.

168
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,700
Don't take it wrong.

169
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,190
I'm not here to pester you.

170
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,950
Hearing you got wounded
on the battlefield,

171
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,230
I just wanted to bring you some medicine.

172
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,730
How has

173
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,330
the general been?

174
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,240
She's doing great.

175
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,970
But now,

176
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,280
she's busy sending people

177
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,940
to look for Jin'an in the city.

178
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,570
I don't think she'd have time

179
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,950
to worry about you now.

180
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,660
A loyal aide though you are,

181
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,300
you end up in prison.

182
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Is it worthwhile?

183
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,490
I've followed the general for years.

184
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,350
Whether this is worthwhile or not

185
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,670
can't be explained in just a few words.

186
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,260
Indeed.

187
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,420
Over these years,

188
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,900
you've never

189
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,540
disobeyed Shuang.

190
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,060
Knowing clearly

191
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,570
that Jin'an has her complete trust,

192
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
you still made that hasty decision.

193
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,330
Is Jin'an really

194
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,080
an unbearable eyesore to you?

195
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,180
As head of the Guardians' Unit,

196
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,810
I'm obligated to protect the general.

197
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,940
I can't help but suspect

198
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,670
that man's peculiar identity.

199
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,180
Is it suspicion or jealousy?

200
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,020
Maybe

201
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,820
you envy him for sharing Shuang's worries

202
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
and solving problems

203
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,060
for her.

204
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,140
Do you remember

205
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,060
how we first met three years ago?

206
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,900
That day,

207
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,420
I was collecting herbs alone
on a mountain.

208
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,940
I made a blunder

209
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,970
and early fell off a cliff.

210
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,690
Grab tight!

211
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,550
Careful.

212
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,950
I always remember

213
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,500
how gallant you looked
when you saved my life.

214
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,420
General,

215
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,490
this lady says she has medical skills

216
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,150
and the herbs
that can purge your body of toxins.

217
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,600
Of course, I also remember

218
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,610
the panic and worry in your eyes,

219
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,270
when Shuang was poisoned.

220
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
At that moment,

221
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,810
I should've realized

222
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,020
that was the way you look

223
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,160
when you truly love someone.

224
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,180
She's the general I work for.

225
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,900
I have nothing for her

226
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,580
but lifelong loyalty

227
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,560
and sworn allegiance.

228
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,490
No other feelings are involved.

229
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,490
Miss, I must ask you to refrain

230
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,350
from saying those remarks again,

231
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,160
in case those with ill intentions
hear them

232
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,000
and tarnish the General's reputation.

233
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,180
You know what?

234
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,330
One's fondness for another person

235
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,590
is like running waters

236
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,090
that can't be stopped,

237
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,370
even if it's left unsaid.

238
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,140
I'd better get back to my patients

239
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
at the clinic now.

240
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,290
Don't forget to
regularly apply the ointment.

241
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,560
I'll get you out of the prison.

242
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,810
I must repay you

243
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,400
for saving my life.

244
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,180
[General's Residence]

245
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,460
Miss Lu.

246
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,170
Where have you been?

247
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,310
Shuang had her people
look for you everywhere.

248
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,130
She was worried sick.

249
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,260
Did you get injured?

250
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,490
No, I'm fine.

251
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,260
The Changfeng Army entered the city.

252
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,970
People swarmed the streets
to welcome them.

253
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,690
I was separated

254
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,730
by the hustling crowds,

255
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,810
but I managed to find my way back.

256
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,670
That was a serious matter,

257
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,090
yet you're still smiling.

258
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,780
I thought

259
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,440
you were harmed by Li Zhangyi.

260
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,740
I'm perfectly fine.

261
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,180
Are you okay?

262
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,340
Of course I am.

263
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,050
I'm glad you're fine.

264
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,040
It's good news.

265
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,730
I heard on my way back

266
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,410
that Ji Ran had been thrown into prison.

267
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,780
Were you loitering

268
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
for that matter?

269
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,670
I did come here to plead with Shuang.

270
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,869
I pondered it over and over,

271
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,609
but just couldn't bring myself
to utter a word.

272
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,869
Now that you're safe and sound,

273
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,760
would you please do me a favor?

274
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Can you ask Shuang

275
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
to release Ji Ran?

276
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,770
If you're mad,

277
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,630
then beat me up.

278
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,860
Vent your anger

279
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
right at me, okay?

280
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,860
Miss Lu,

281
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,420
I doubt

282
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
if Ji Ran will appreciate your help.

283
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,580
Is it worthwhile

284
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,340
to go to so much trouble
for a man who always gives you

285
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,400
the cold shoulder?

286
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,150
Whether it's worthwhile or not
doesn't matter.

287
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,820
When you love someone,

288
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,250
you're ready to do anything
for him or her.

289
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,730
You'd put yourself in their shoes.

290
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,420
Their concerns are your concerns.

291
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,970
A simple smile of Ji Ran's is enough

292
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,940
to make my day.

293
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,620
What's more,

294
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,180
he once saved my life.

295
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,330
If I can do something for him,

296
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,660
I'll be content.

297
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,290
Ji Ran did make a mistake.

298
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,310
But he behaved that way

299
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,180
only out of concern
for the general's safety.

300
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,900
As you said,

301
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,900
pursuing this matter further

302
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,180
when I'm safe and sound

303
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,280
would only make me seem petty.

304
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,380
Does it mean you've agreed to help?

305
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,260
Actually, I owe him a thank you.

306
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,870
I gained something important
thanks to his acts.

307
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,660
Come in.

308
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,970
Waiting for someone?

309
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,180
Yes, I am.

310
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,910
You're smirking. Seriously?

311
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,230
You broke into the city tower

312
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,890
and held an official hostage.

313
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,780
You wanted to die or what?

314
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,230
I offered unsolicited advice
at the military camp that day.

315
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,060
Then

316
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,140
an accident kept me

317
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,690
from returning to the General's Residence.

318
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,620
I thought you'd find me suspicious.

319
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,750
But now it seems like

320
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,550
you're worried about my safety instead.

321
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm just happy.

322
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,340
Happy?

323
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,530
Only living people get to feel that.

324
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,260
You fell off the cliff
when fighting Ji Ran.

325
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,520
Yet you didn't get hurt at all?

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
I was lucky enough

327
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,740
to have landed on a tree under the cliff.

328
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,490
Do you not believe me?

329
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,620
I'll undress for you to see my body.

330
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,900
You've seen it already.

331
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,560
Never mind!

332
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,660
You've come back safely anyway.

333
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,950
Now that I'm safe and sound,

334
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,010
will you

335
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,990
just drop the matter

336
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,960
and release Ji Ran?

337
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,530
There is strict discipline
in the Changfeng Army.

338
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,290
For taking action without permission,

339
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,690
he deserves punishment.

340
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
But my identity does seem peculiar.

341
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,010
It raises suspicion,
especially from his perspective.

342
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,690
It'll be a huge loss

343
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,100
to fail a devoted warrior

344
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,970
for this matter.

345
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,510
Every time I was in danger,

346
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,210
you always showed up.

347
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,640
and rescued me from peril.

348
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,940
Why can't I choose you over him?

349
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,580
General.

350
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,590
With the enemy confronting us,

351
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,570
I shouldn't have put you in detention.

352
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,410
After working with me for years,

353
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,550
you still went for that reckless action.

354
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,100
Do you admit you did wrong?

355
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,860
Yes, I do.

356
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,050
My fault

357
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,880
was acting against Jin'an

358
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,290
without orders

359
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,480
and nearly causing his death.

360
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,340
That said,

361
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,050
General,

362
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,840
camouflage often looks real.

363
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,000
Jin'an can't be cleared of suspicion

364
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,810
until his identity is verified.

365
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,270
I admit I did wrong,

366
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,760
but I don't regret taking action.

367
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,670
See you later, General.

368
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,530
To this day, I still don't understand

369
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,460
how much courage it'd take

370
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,810
for someone
to completely trust another person

371
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,970
in such chaotic times.

372
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,590
He's honest about everything,

373
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,210
except for his real identity.

374
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,320
Perhaps he has his own reason.

375
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,190
Even if I keep probing,

376
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
I might not get the truth.

377
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,580
Maybe sometimes,

378
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,850
trust

379
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,250
is the greatest truth of all.

380
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,250
General!

381
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,290
Word from our scouts

382
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,580
says the Yao Army hasn't withdrawn.

383
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,290
Instead,

384
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,420
they've set up camp 20 li from Lucheng.

385
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,930
Reportedly,

386
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,590
they have a new commander now,

387
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,860
named Zhao Jingyuan.

388
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,620
These vile creatures

389
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,210
won't stop haunting us.

390
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,210
We'll run out of

391
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,170
supplies in four days.

392
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,930
They can starve us out

393
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,870
simply by putting us under siege.

394
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,580
Qin Lan,

395
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,100
take three soldiers with you and set out

396
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,900
for Yongcheng

397
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,500
right now to ask for help.

398
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,490
Yongcheng is nearest to Lucheng.

399
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,770
Reinforcements and supplies

400
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,100
can reach us in two days.

401
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,100
All we need to do
is hold out for two days.

402
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,530
Then there will be a turning point.

403
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,460
Got it, General.

404
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,730
To General Zhao!

405
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,580
To General Zhao!

406
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,940
Everybody,

407
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,380
drink up!

408
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,820
General Zhao is the best
military commander of the Yao State.

409
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,940
Under your leadership, General Zhao,

410
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,490
I believe

411
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,700
our army will be an unstoppable force.

412
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,050
You're just being modest, Counsellor.

413
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,650
It is known to all that you are

414
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,420
a brilliant military strategist

415
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,830
with unmatched intelligence.

416
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,550
This time,

417
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,900
with our joint efforts,

418
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,360
we'll definitely conquer

419
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,210
Lucheng

420
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,900
with ease.

421
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,530
General,

422
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,220
I wish you every success.

423
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,210
We wish you every success!

424
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,480
The general is dead!

425
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,250
Counsellor...

426
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,100
Scram!

427
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,950
Greetings, My Lord.

428
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,100
The battle in the south
was proven a failure.

429
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,730
You lost the Battle of Lucheng as well.

430
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll make up for it with hard work.

431
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,290
Make up for it?

432
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,930
Your life is worth nothing.

433
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,730
Forgive my ignorance.

434
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,730
Considering my loyal service
to the Empress Dowager,

435
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,530
would you enlighten me, My Lord?

436
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,450
Rise.

437
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,750
Thanks, My Lord.

438
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,370
I came here

439
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,460
to give you an opportunity
to redeem yourself.

440
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,530
You've seen that man in black.

441
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,490
Do you find him

442
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,070
familiar?

443
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,940
He...

444
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,120
He does resemble someone I know of.

445
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,000
But Prince Annan already died, didn't he?

446
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,340
How is it possible...

447
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,580
Good news, General.

448
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,050
At dawn today,

449
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,510
the Yao Army's general

450
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,290
was killed.

451
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,340
The killer has even placed a flag

452
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,770
in the center of the battlefield.

453
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,490
Now,

454
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,340
the Yao Army

455
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,180
is fluttered.

456
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,450
Who's the killer?

457
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,940
It's not clear yet.

458
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,140
Report!

459
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:13,950
General,

460
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,970
someone dropped this box

461
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,140
at the entrance to the office,

462
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,270
along with a letter.

463
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,130
Open it up.

464
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,400
[This head is a gift for you]

465
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,450
Could this

466
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,540
have been done by the man in black?

467
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,730
Report!

468
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,770
Military Advisor Qin,

469
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,030
a carrier pigeon brought back a message.

470
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,950
The Yao Army stormed Ninglan.

471
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,180
Ninglan has fallen.

472
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,140
How can we not fight them?

473
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,970
We have to wait.

474
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,800
Do you have a better plan?

475
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,770
-Are you getting cold feet?
-We have to preserve our strength!

476
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,580
Zhao Jingyuan's head

477
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,140
is still hanging outside,

478
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,180
dripping blood!

479
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,620
Who led the Yao Army to attack Ninglan?

480
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,400
Enough.

481
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,460
What's the use of bickering?

482
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,860
Ninglan
is the most important transportation hub

483
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,490
connecting Yongcheng and Lucheng.

484
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,580
Military Advisor Qin has to pass through

485
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,970
that city when he brings back

486
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,900
weapons, horses,

487
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,530
reinforcements,

488
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,290
and supplies.

489
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,580
Now, we've lost Ninglan.

490
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,530
Military Advisor Qin
must be in a tough spot.

491
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,060
Besides,

492
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,820
I'm afraid all our deployments

493
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,620
are within the enemy's expectations.

494
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,860
Now, our provisions can only

495
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,660
sustain the army for three days.

496
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,170
We must recapture Ninglan,

497
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,300
or we will be doomed.

498
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,250
I'm worried

499
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,110
we might lose Lucheng too.

500
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,140
Easy for you to say.

501
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,050
The Yao Army stormed Ninglan
with 20,000 soldiers.

502
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,660
We can merely match that number

503
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,900
only if we commit all our forces.

504
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,940
How do we fight them?

505
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,770
What's more,

506
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,770
it's already hard for us
to keep Lucheng intact.

507
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,860
If we divide up our forces now,

508
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,210
by the time the reinforcements arrive,

509
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,620
Lucheng will have been lost!

510
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,020
Then what do you suggest?

511
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,250
Sitting back and waiting for doom?

512
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,200
At least we get to live longer that way!

513
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,330
Listen up,

514
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,820
Changfeng warriors
would rather die fighting

515
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,970
than die waiting!

516
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,730
That's right!

517
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,420
Enough!

518
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,210
Liu Yun coped brilliantly

519
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,340
when the military commander

520
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,010
was replaced at a critical time.

521
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,130
He's no ordinary man.

522
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,890
This is

523
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,880
the map of Ninglan?

524
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,310
How did you get hold of this treasure?

525
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,010
This will

526
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,860
largely increase our chances

527
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,140
of recapturing Ninglan!

528
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,420
Right.

529
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,450
Yes. Things are looking up now.

530
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,100
Indeed.

531
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,980
We have to take Ninglan back.

532
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,860
Lucheng

533
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,580
must remain ours too.

534
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,620
How visionary of you, General.

535
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,970
We all admire you!

536
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:31,970
Cheers!

537
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,900
Drink up, guys!

538
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,660
Absolutely!

539
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,440
What a delight!

540
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,490
Drink up!

541
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,380
Let's drink!

542
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,330
Sure!

543
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,730
Stop eating!

544
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,370
Have a drink!

545
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:42,890
Come on.

546
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,350
Here it goes.

547
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,130
Fill it up.

548
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,140
Guys,

549
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,620
conquering Ninglan

550
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,290
is equal to sounding the death knell
for the Taijin Army.

551
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,090
Next,

552
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,380
all we have to do is wait and observe.

553
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,770
By simply besieging them and waiting

554
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,770
till they run out of supplies,

555
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,940
we can easily

556
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,720
conquer Lucheng,

557
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,940
even if we don't launch attacks.

558
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,940
Victory is within reach!

559
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,490
Come on.

560
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,490
Drink up!

561
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,100
Guys,

562
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,340
the credit goes to our counsellor,

563
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,620
this wise strategist

564
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,010
who turned the tables!

565
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,970
We swear to

566
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:14,860
faithfully

567
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,940
follow

568
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,770
the counsellor's lead!

569
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,140
We swear to
faithfully follow the counsellor's lead!

570
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,420
Hubris

571
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,100
leads to downfall.

572
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,670
I dare not be your sole leader.

573
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,110
Captain Jiang,

574
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,570
why not share this responsibility with me?

575
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,860
Under the influence of liquor,

576
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,920
I got carried away.

577
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,250
Please forgive me, My Lord.

578
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,660
Why the panic, Captain?

579
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,890
It's an honor to be a general.

580
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,100
I dare not.

581
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,500
I dare not play this role.

582
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,460
But the army
desperately needs a new general.

583
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,900
Well then...

584
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,670
What about the rest of you?

585
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,530
Greetings, General.

586
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,450
Greetings, General.

587
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,970
General Shi Du and General Zhao Jingyuan

588
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,830
died heroically for our country.

589
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,180
His Highness has decreed

590
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,340
enormous support for the bereaved

591
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,590
in honor of the departed.

592
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,920
Our army lost two generals consecutively

593
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,980
all because of the man in black.

594
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,330
But we're not daunted

595
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,530
by his trivial stunts.

596
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,260
Look at our formidable forces.

597
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,860
How is that man alone able to

598
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,580
shake our 50,000 valiant Yao soldiers?

599
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,900
To boost the morale,

600
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,100
His Majesty decided to

601
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,030
promote Tian Daweng

602
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,390
to Guardian General,

603
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,690
who shall command all the troops.

604
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,820
Hopefully,

605
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,970
under the new general's guidance,

606
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,860
our army will capture Lucheng

607
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,900
and bring triumphs to the Yao State!

608
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:47,380
Capture Lucheng
and bring triumphs to the Yao State!

609
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,470
Capture Lucheng!

610
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,860
General.

611
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,760
The Yao Army

612
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,500
has selected a new general?

613
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,860
Strong though their momentum is,

614
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,440
after losing two generals,

615
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,770
they've been frustrated.

616
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,970
Boosting morale is their priority.

617
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,250
They must've picked this new general

618
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,580
with extreme prudence.

619
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,860
But given that they're making

620
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,920
quite a splash now,

621
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,100
I think they're up to something.

622
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,920
At this moment,

623
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,050
it's the best for the Yao Army

624
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,100
to take no action.

625
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,110
They're only making these noises

626
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,530
to attract the man in black.

627
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,590
General, you think

628
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,190
this is a trap for that man?

629
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,820
Liu Yun is indeed a marvelous strategist.

630
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,280
He calculates every step.

631
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,900
He has anticipated each of

632
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
our moves.

633
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,730
The only thing he couldn't expect

634
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,050
was the appearance of the man in black.

635
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,100
If I were him,

636
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,050
I'd also like to eliminate that guy soon

637
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,250
to clear all menaces.

638
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,100
Ji Ran!

639
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,860
Yes.

640
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,250
Have 2,000 elite soldiers

641
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,860
follow me to Ninglan with light gear.

642
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,720
You and Luo Teng

643
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,530
will stay put.

644
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,340
General,

645
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,290
this is not a good idea.

646
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,100
The Yao Army has

647
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,660
laid siege to the entire Ninglan.

648
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,380
Though we have the map of Ninglan,

649
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,040
we're still no match for them.

650
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,990
Please think twice about it, General.

651
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,820
The Yao Army

652
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,719
is determined to win this battle.

653
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,900
We have to fight them
till our last breath.

654
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,050
Select 2,000 soldiers.

655
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,570
Record

656
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,570
their names

657
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,340
and family backgrounds.

658
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,900
Send the registry
to the General's Residence.

659
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,300
They'll all be rewarded.

660
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,010
General...

661
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,940
No more talking.

662
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,960
Do as I said.

663
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,219
Even sky-reaching wings

664
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,420
won't save me from impending danger.

665
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,260
At this point,

666
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,909
I only wish to devote my life

667
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,650
to Taijin

668
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,510
and to the Changfeng Army.

669
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,090
Please

670
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,910
send my corpse to my father.

671
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,040
This undutiful daughter

672
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,450
wishes her father and her brother Ting

673
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,380
lifelong safety and tranquility.

674
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
I'm not even

675
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,860
mentioned in your last words.

676
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,700
You're taking

677
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,780
only 2,000 soldiers
to the besieged Ninglan.

678
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,450
If the Yao Army learns of it,

679
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,170
they'll strike at you

680
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,970
and hunt you down.

681
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,510
General, are you planning

682
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,100
to use yourself as bait?

683
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,650
I am a general.

684
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,220
There are

685
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,670
certain duties I have to fulfill.

686
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,990
Moreover, I promised Zang Budu

687
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,470
to protect Ninglan,

688
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,420
once the war broke out.

689
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,900
I'm a woman of my word.

690
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,090
However slim the chances are,

691
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,950
I have to take this gamble.

692
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,170
What if you lose?

693
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,290
If I lose,

694
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,210
the blood pact between us will break.

695
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,550
Then you'll be free.

696
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,050
At this point,

697
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,370
you still think that so-called freedom

698
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,380
is what I value most?

699
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,790
My life is bound with yours.

700
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,190
If you are to gamble your life,

701
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,110
I'll make sure you don't lose.

702
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,300
Take 10,000 soldiers with you
to recapture Ninglan.

703
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,430
I'll stall the main Yao forces for you.

704
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,700
You figured it out long ago, didn't you?

705
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,900
Are you waiting for me to tell the truth?

706
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,130
I'm sorry...

707
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,010
I kept it secret from you for so long.

708
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,660
The Yao Army has taken action.

709
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,800
They remain resolute

710
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,100
in capturing Lucheng and Ninglan.

711
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,160
Whether you show up or not,

712
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,450
they won't easily back off.

713
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,370
I'd hate to see anyone die in vain again.

714
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,390
I also resent the idea

715
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,490
of you risking your life.

716
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,530
The moment I went on the battlefield

717
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,780
and barged into the enemy's camp

718
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,420
to slay their general,

719
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,600
I already left myself no way out.

720
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,030
You hate for me to risk my life.

721
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,350
I bet you surely understand

722
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,160
I care about you...

723
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:38,850

Yes.

763
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,290
Ninglan is easy to defend,
but hard to attack.

764
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,940
There are 20,000 Yao soldiers there.
