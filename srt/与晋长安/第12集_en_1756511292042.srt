00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,910
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,039
Attention, all forces!

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,479
March to Ninglan!

5
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,590
Destroy the Yao Army!

6
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,759
Destroy the Yao Army!

7
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,560
-Kill them!
-Kill them!

8
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,870
Ninglan's fortifications are solid,

9
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,200
which puts us at a disadvantage.

10
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
To minimize casualties,

11
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,470
we need to be strategic.

12
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,400
Inside Ninglan,

13
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,590
there is a secret tunnel
connecting the inside and outside,

14
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,560
enough for an elite unit to slip through.

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,590
To take Ninglan by surprise,

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,670
we'll split into three forces,

17
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,200
attacking from inside and outside
together.

18
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,840
Notify Qin Lan

19
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
to lead an elite squad

20
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,800
to the south gate
at 7 PM to challenge them.

21
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,520
Luo Teng, Lyu Yi, Qin Wu—

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,030
each of you will take a squad to wait

23
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,230
in the forests by the other three gates.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,190
Prepare torches and horses.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
I'll lead an elite squad

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,870
through the secret tunnel

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,750
into Ninglan.

28
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,910
Though the Yao Army is large,

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,160
their elites are few.

30
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,000
Liu Yun certainly won't position

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
all his main forces at the north gate.

32
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
So in this battle, General,

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,080
you're going to win by strategy.

34
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,280
When Qin Lan challenges them
at the south gate at 7 PM,

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,740
the Yao Army will think our forces
are too few

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
and open the gate to fight.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,030
Open the gate!

38
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,800
Fight!

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,400
[Ninglan]

40
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,860
Yes!

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,870
Tell Qin Lan to light the signal flare

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,710
once they open the gate.

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,590
At the sight of the flare,

44
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,960
the three forces in the three forests
outside the city will light torches

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
and run horses
to create commotion immediately,

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,180
making it appear
as if tens of thousands are attacking.

47
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,630
Move out.

48
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,910
Charge!

49
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,870
The elite squad inside the city

50
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,329
will strike the south gate
at the same time,

51
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,190
creating an inside-out assault.

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,590
The Yao Army

53
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,710
will certainly fall into chaos,

54
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,490
and we

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,030
will take Ninglan in one decisive move.

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,680
My Lord!

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
My Lord!

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,750
My Lord,

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,460
My Lord,

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,280
the Taijin Army

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
is attacking from the east!

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,430
My Lord!

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,840
My Lord,

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
the west is in danger!

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
There might be tens of thousands
of enemies outside the walls!

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
My Lord!

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,840
My Lord!

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,360
There are even more in the north!

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,150
Right now,
our soldiers' morale is unstable.

70
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,240
My Lord, please decide

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,000
how we should defend as soon as possible!

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,030
This can't be.

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,510
How many men do they have exactly?

74
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,480
It looks like

75
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:24,720
there are

76
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,510
around 45,000 men in total, I'm afraid.

77
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,310
My Lord!

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,430
My Lord, bad news!

79
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,190
An elite squad of Taijin Army
appeared in the city

80
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,480
and is heading this way. How many?

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,270
How many men do they have?

82
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm afraid there are hundreds of them—

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,270
no,

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
thousands!

85
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,490
Close the city gate!

86
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,870
Let's eliminate the enemies
inside the city first!

87
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,360
But My Lord,

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,560
our main forces
are still outside the city!

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,690
Close the city gate!

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
General!

91
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,159
The commander of the Taijin Army,
Li Shuang,

92
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,240
is personally leading 10,000 troops

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
to attack Ninglan!

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,800
The man in black,

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,240
capable of killing a hundred
single-handedly,

96
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,190
is unstoppable.

97
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,120
But once he's separated from Li Shuang,

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
his power

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,870
loses its source

100
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,200
and can't be sustained.

101
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
If this drags on,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,270
that power

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
will gradually fade

104
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,600
until it disappears completely.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
So you're saying,

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,870
if we can find a way to separate them,

107
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,330
our army can turn the tide?

108
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,270
If Ninglan falls,

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,070
Li Shuang

110
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,830
will be stretched too thin.

111
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,630
Then the man in black

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,240
will have to

113
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,120
fight alone, won't he?

114
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,480
Of course,

115
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,270
you understand military strategy

116
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,000
better than I do.

117
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,480
Right?

118
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
Just one thing:

119
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,800
he must not die,

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,800
and no one can know that he's alive.

121
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,190
General,

122
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,440
everything has gone as you predicted.

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
Li Shuang couldn't hold back

124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
and recklessly redeployed troops.

125
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,360
Now

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
is the perfect time for us
to launch a counterattack

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,480
and take Lucheng.

128
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,900
Give the order.

129
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,600
Attack.

130
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,510
Attack.

131
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,330
It seems

132
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,500
I've underestimated you.

133
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,280
It must have taken you effort
to pull off such a lousy act.

134
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,610
Counsellor, you really

135
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,440
went to some trouble courting death.

136
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,830
You knew it was a trap.

137
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,800
If you weren't desperate,

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,430
you wouldn't have come alone.

139
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,390
To kill you,

140
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,070
I alone am enough.

141
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,610
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

142
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,810
Can you kill them all?

143
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,920
Kill!

144
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,550
Kill!

145
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,669
Kill.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080

193
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,240
General!

194
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,910
The Yao Army has surrendered completely.

195
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,510
We've won

196
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,040
a decisive victory!

197
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,030
Bravo! Bravo!

198
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,910
Luo Teng,

199
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
stay here to guard the city,

200
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,480
handle the aftermath
and treat the wounded.

201
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,050
Yes.

202
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,150
Qin Lan,

203
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
take the supplies

204
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,000
and return to Lucheng immediately.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,480
Yes.

206
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,670
Notify the female spies in Lucheng

207
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,070
to prepare everything.

208
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,080
Jin'an,

209
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,140
you must hold on.

210
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,080
Today we captured the man in black alive.

211
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,150
Lucheng is now within our grasp.

212
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,790
This is a great victory.

213
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,440
Everyone,

214
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,720
let's celebrate!

215
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,670
Counsellor, your plan was brilliant!

216
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,270
Cheers!

217
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,150
Cheers!

218
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,480
Come on!

219
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,540
Drink up!

220
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,960
Come here.

221
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,430
Greetings, My Lord.

222
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,860
Spare me, My Lord!

223
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,910
-What a beauty.
-Please spare my life!

224
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,040
Can you use a dagger?

225
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,080
No worries.

226
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,910
Today,

227
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,470
I'll teach you how to use one properly.

228
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,710
Here.

229
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,450
See that man?

230
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,200
Use this dagger

231
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,050
to stab him hard.

232
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,670
One stab,

233
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,070
and you'll be rewarded with 10,000 coins.

234
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,120
If you refuse,

235
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
the one who gets stabbed will be you.

236
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,770
Kill him!

237
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,330
Kill him!

238
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,240
Go!

239
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,550
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

240
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,030
Do it!

241
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,790
Hurry up!

242
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,670
Kill him!

243
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,270
Kill him!

244
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,000
The once-arrogant man in black

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,910
is now being tortured by a dancing girl.

246
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,000
How utterly ridiculous!

247
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,450
Reward her!

248
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Well done!

249
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,310
Well done!

250
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
Servants! Bring her reward!

251
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,000
Assassin!

252
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Protect the Counsellor!

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,760
I am Li Shuang of the Changfeng Army.

254
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,890
Who dares approach?

255
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,830
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

256
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,860
If you kill me, how do you think

257
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,230
you'll escape the camp?

258
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,620
General...

259
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,830
General Li, spare me!

260
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,670
General Li...

261
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,230
After her!

262
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,620
Go!

263
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,970
Kill!

264
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,590
Jin'an!

265
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,920
How are you feeling?

266
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,410
I'm so tired.

267
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,830
I don't think I can walk anymore.

268
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,860
They're catching up to us.

269
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,030
You go first.

270
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,550
Didn't you say

271
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,790
our lives are bound together?

272
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,100
How could I leave you behind?

273
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,340
But they're closing in.

274
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,160
Wait for me.

275
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,750
General!

276
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,450
We're here!

277
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,840
Protect the General!

278
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,230
Attack!

279
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,130
Your Highness,

280
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
please calm down.

281
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,920
I have failed you.

282
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,550
A tiny city like Lucheng

283
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,540
has cost us several of our best generals.

284
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,720
A battle we were sure to win

285
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,930
was completely lost
because of that shadow puppet.

286
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,850
You think saying you've failed me

287
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,880
is enough to cover this up?

288
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,680
Your Highness,

289
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
the jade Linglong

290
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,760
inside the shadow puppet

291
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,820
has merged with the blood master.

292
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,400
Its power is not to be underestimated

293
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,960
and is very difficult to deal with.

294
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,290
Difficult to deal with?

295
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,410
If it were easy,
what would I need you for?

296
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,890
I don't care what methods you use.

297
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,440
I want you to bring him back alive

298
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,580
at any cost!

299
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,000
As you command.

300
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,630
Today, I was supposed to give you
the antidote

301
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,430
to the Brain-Devouring Powder.

302
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
But you're too useless.

303
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,960
No wonder Wuling Mountain threw you out.

304
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,330
Today is just a minor punishment
to teach you a lesson.

305
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,010
From now on,

306
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,880
I don't want to hear you say

307
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,960
"difficult to deal with" again.

308
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,640
Okay.

309
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,830
This half dose of antidote

310
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,420
is enough to keep you alive.

311
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,790
However,

312
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,600
you'll inevitably taste the agony
of thousands of insects eating your brain.

313
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,950
I'm curious whether,

314
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,350
given your great powers,

315
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,180
you can survive it.

316
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,370
Thank you for the antidote, Your Highness.

317
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,850
[General's Residence]

318
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,990
Your Majesty,

319
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,960
there's an urgent report from Lucheng.

320
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,440
Li Shuang, General Zhenbei,

321
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
led the Changfeng Army

322
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,010
and defeated 50,000 soldiers
of the Yao Army.

323
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,380
Take a look.

324
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,240
This Li Zhangyi.

325
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,100
He actually committed such an act,
bringing harm to our country.

326
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,510
I failed to judge him correctly.

327
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,880
Father, please punish me.

328
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,020
You were the one
who strongly recommended him

329
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,510
as the military supervisor.

330
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,480
Now he has caused such a calamity.

331
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,340
How do you think

332
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,540
we should handle him?

333
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,060
Li Zhangyi, as an imperial official,

334
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,400
succumbed to lust and abused his power,

335
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
nearly committing treason.

336
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,920
I believe

337
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,880
he should be dismissed and investigated,
never reinstated,

338
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,350
with his family exiled to Yaizhou,

339
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,550
to uphold the proper conduct of Taijin.

340
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,590
He is your right-hand man.

341
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,310
Are you willing to let him go?

342
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,440
Everyone at court serves you, Father.

343
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
Like them, I only wish

344
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,280
to share your burdens.

345
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,680
Please judge wisely.

346
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,090
Let Yang take a look.

347
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,520
Yes.

348
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,000
Though brief in words,

349
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,260
it shows

350
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,750
how arduous this battle was.

351
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,550
Fortunately,

352
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,720
the entire Changfeng Army fought bravely,

353
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,480
and the Li family
served loyally and heroically,

354
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
allowing our country

355
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,210
to achieve this great victory.

356
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,000
Previously, Li Wei was unwell,

357
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,910
but he should be fully recovered now.

358
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,430
Starting tomorrow,

359
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,790
he should resume his duties

360
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,210
and attend the morning court as usual.

361
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,500
Your Majesty, you are wise.

362
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,300
I noticed this report

363
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,280
also mentions

364
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
a man in black.

365
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,110
Yang,

366
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,690
what's your opinion?

367
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,850
This person...

368
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,800
deliberately conceals his identity.

369
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,190
I'm not sure

370
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,400
if there's a reason.

371
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,440
Perhaps

372
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,790
we should reward him first

373
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,790
to gain his favor,

374
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,980
and then

375
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,040
carefully investigate the cause.

376
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,030
If we can ease his worries

377
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,430
and recruit him to the court,

378
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,690
our army would be greatly strengthened.

379
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,650
If he's willing, that would be ideal.

380
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,370
But what if he refuses?

381
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,550
Such strength

382
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,750
must never fall into another's hands.

383
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,590
If he refuses,

384
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,540
we must kill him

385
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,930
to eliminate future trouble.

386
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,420
Alright. You may rise.

387
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,670
Thank you, Father.

388
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,950
I was foolish.

389
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,470
I didn't think it through.

390
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,220
Yang, as the Crown Prince,

391
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,210
how can you belittle yourself?

392
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,640
I know well

393
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,140
that my intelligence

394
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,550
is far beneath my brother's.

395
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,830
Because of your favor, I was granted
the position of Crown Prince.

396
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,440
Only through diligence and self-correction

397
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,430
can I be worthy of your grace.

398
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,150
It's nearly time
for the Grand Tutor's examination today.

399
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,950
Well,

400
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,240
I

401
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,990
shall take my leave.

402
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,920
[General's Residence]

403
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,660
You're awake?

404
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,850
Don't move.

405
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,200
You might tear open your wound.

406
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,680
While I was unconscious,

407
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,570
it was you who took care of me all along?

408
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,190
Your identity is sensitive.

409
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,950
The fewer who know, the better.

410
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,940
If it were anyone else,

411
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,840
I wouldn't feel at ease.

412
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,280
How long have you been taking care of me?

413
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,960
You don't look well.

414
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,850
Take your medicine first.

415
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,680
My hands have gone numb under your weight.

416
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,590
I can't move them.

417
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,790
Why don't you feed me?

418
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,200
Actually,

419
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,110
I didn't mean to deceive you.

420
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,630
It's just that my body
has changed too much.

421
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,820
Even I

422
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,310
had trouble accepting it.

423
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,550
Now that you know,

424
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,590
however

425
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,920
you want to deal with me,

426
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,160
I will accept.

427
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,830
When I was young,

428
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,830
my father adopted me

429
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,690
and taught me martial arts.

430
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,760
One day,

431
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,000
Madam

432
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,810
was cornered by a hunting dog.

433
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,730
To save her,

434
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,080
I killed the dog.

435
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,070
I didn't expect that

436
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,590
she would grow

437
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,150
increasingly distant from me after that.

438
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,170
She even urged Father

439
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,130
to send me away,

440
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,520
saying I possessed

441
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,630
incredible strength

442
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,159
and was no ordinary person.

443
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,030
But Father told me

444
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,850
that sometimes,

445
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,370
having extraordinary abilities

446
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,370
isn't a bad thing.

447
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,210
As long as one follows the righteous path,

448
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,510
even in darkness,

449
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,000
one can tread through hell.

450
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,400
You saved me,

451
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,480
saved the Changfeng Army,

452
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,540
and saved Lucheng.

453
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,239
Sometimes, good and evil

454
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,699
aren't defined by others,

455
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,040
but by your own heart.

456
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,400
Your blood nourishes my power

457
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,840
in ways beyond measure.

458
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
But gaining such fearsome strength

459
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,330
must come with a price.

460
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,280
Lately,

461
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,400
you've been weak.

462
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,130
I don't know if it's because of me.

463
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,510
Don't make

464
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,510
baseless guesses.

465
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,670
Then promise me,

466
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,280
no matter what happens,

467
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,760
you'll never hurt yourself for me.

468
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,320
I promise.

469
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,230
Now that you're awake,

470
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,590
I'll go handle
some military matters first.

471
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,320
I'll check on you when I'm back.

472
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,000
Wait.

473
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,010
Since I've revealed my identity,

474
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,800
well,

475
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,710
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

476
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,760
Actually, the man in black

477
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,460
not only possesses supernatural strength,

478
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,910
but can also heal his own wounds.

479
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,840
If you don't believe me,

480
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,320
you can unwrap the bandages
and see for yourself.
