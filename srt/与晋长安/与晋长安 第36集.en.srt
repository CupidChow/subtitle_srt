[Episode 36]

3
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,010
That day in the golden palace,

4
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,560
why did you admit to being
the man in black?

5
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,030
When Qin questioned me,

6
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,530
many images flashed through my mind.

7
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,030
Those images told me

8
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,750
that I am the man in black.

9
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,200
What else do you remember?

10
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,120
It's okay.

11
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,570
Let bygones be bygones.

12
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,470
Never mind.

13
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,510
I remember I fell in love

14
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
with a woman in Taijin.

15
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,430
You are the Prince Annan of Yao State.

16
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Falling in love with a woman from Taijin

17
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,079
will not end well.

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,730
What if I were not the Prince Annan?

19
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,750
Prince Annan, may I ask you

20
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,660
where Empress Dowager Qin is now?

21
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,590
She drank the Double-Blossom Wine
with my brother.

22
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,800
So we can't hurt her,

23
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,630
but lock her up in the Imperial Prison.

24
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,800
May I see her?

25
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,150
Let me out.

26
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,910
Let me out!

27
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,030
I want to see Yu.

28
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,870
Free me!

29
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,490
I knew

30
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,210
that Duan Aodeng would eventually
make his move.

31
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Did he

32
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,100
send you over to finish me?

33
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,730
The grudges within your Yao State

34
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,089
have nothing to do with me.

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,070
I'm just here to see

36
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,040
the person
responsible for my father's death.

37
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm satisfied to see you

38
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,020
live worse than death.

39
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,050
You think I'm the one
who killed your father?

40
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,490
You're wrong.

41
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,890
It was Duan Aodeng.

42
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,590
If he hadn't repeatedly stood in my way

43
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,870
and messed with me,

44
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
it wouldn't have come to this point.

45
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,870
And you!

46
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,000
If you hadn't been so soft-hearted

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
for a man,

48
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,320
your father wouldn't have had to come
all this way to die.

49
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
You brought it all

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,830
upon yourself.

51
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,210
You schemed meticulously

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,160
and did so much,

53
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,300
yet look at your miserable state now.

54
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,980
Was it worth it?

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,040
When I was 17,

56
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,930
I saw Honey for the first time.

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
That day,

58
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,740
he came in person to propose to my sister.

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,360
I hid behind a rockery,

60
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,270
taking a peek at him.

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
Just one peek,

62
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,230
and my heart had no room
for anyone else after that.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,830
I knelt in the ancestral hall
for five whole days,

64
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,450
begging my parents to let me marry him

65
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,310
even as a concubine.

66
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,270
For him, I kept lowering myself.

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,310
I was even willing to give up

68
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,370
my reputation and dignity as a woman.

69
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
But why couldn't he

70
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,680
show me

71
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,750
even a little bit of love?

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,360
Since he doesn't love me,

73
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,510
I'd rather make him hate me instead.

74
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,900
Having drunk
the Double-Blossom Wine with him,

75
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,409
you hold his life in your hands now.

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,350
If you were truly so resentful,

77
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,190
why wouldn't you just end your life?

78
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,040
This way, you could take him with you
to the grave.

79
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,800
I've thought about it,

80
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,110
but I can't die.

81
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,950
I still have Yu.

82
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,480
My boy.

83
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,680
I beg you.

84
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,870
Please take me to see Yu.

85
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,920
Yu is too young

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
to lose me, his mother.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,410
I'm begging you.

88
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,930
Please take me to see Yu.

89
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,720
You've gone to such lengths

90
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,990
to ruin your life for
someone who doesn't love you.

91
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Your husband,

92
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,190
your son,

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,550
and everyone else you care about

94
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,630
will enjoy their lives peacefully

95
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,830
under the sun,

96
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,720
slowly getting rid

97
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,870
of the shadow inside.

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,720
But you

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,190
will end up being forgotten by everyone

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,070
and living a wretched life

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,480
in this dark dungeon.

102
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,680
You have no right to judge me!

103
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,240
You're no better than me.

104
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,000
Your beloved Jin'an

105
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
has forgotten you, hasn't he?

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,330
All grudges and bonds have to end someday.

107
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,390
He and I are even now.

108
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,350
Since he's forgotten me,

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I'll let go.

110
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,510
At least

111
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,789
he once loved me deeply.

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
But you

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
have never been loved.

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,270
You must continue to survive

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,670
right here,

116
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,670
living a long, long life

117
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,390
with all your sins.

118
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
Because only this way

119
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,870
can you pay for my father's death.

120
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,850
This leg's been injured for too long.

121
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm afraid it's impossible

122
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,660
for you to stand again.

123
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,670
This doesn't matter much to me.

124
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,240
It's just that whenever I go out,

125
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,810
I'll need them to push my wheelchair.

126
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,460
They're the ones who will suffer.

127
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,600
Your Majesty, we have long been blessed
by your grace before.

128
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,150
Now,

129
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,670
being able to serve at your side again
is our greatest fortune.

130
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,390
From now on,

131
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,790
we will serve you wholeheartedly

132
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,190
without any complaints!

133
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,890
You may rise now.

134
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,530
You're truly a good emperor

136
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,200
who cares about your servants.

137
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
Seems like saving you was the right call.

138
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,120
But in the future,

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,630
can you discipline your younger brother

140
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,080
and stop him from waging wars recklessly

141
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,320
for the peace
of the people from both states?

142
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,650
Miss Lu, aren't you from Wuling Mountain?

143
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,270
How can you be so impertinent

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,660
when speaking to His Majesty?

145
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,270
Miss Lu, I will carefully consider

146
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,630
what you said.

147
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,150
Aodeng,

148
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,080
you really need

149
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,160
to do something about your bad temper.

150
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,600
His Majesty needs rest.

151
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,520
Sir and miss,

152
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,860
may we talk in private?

153
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,510
How is my brother's condition?

154
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,480
There's no antidote
to the Double-Blossom Wine.

155
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,270
I'm afraid

156
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,870
you can't kill that woman.

157
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,470
As for His Majesty's health,

158
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,820
he just needs a gradual recovery.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
You two saved my brother's life.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,790
I can't express my gratitude enough
for your great favor.

161
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,990
If you ever need anything in the future,

162
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,970
I will do my utmost to repay you.

163
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,240
No need to help him up.

164
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
He's right.

165
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,390
We indeed have done him a great favor.

166
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,200
Moreover,

167
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,980
he's got more than one life-saving favor

168
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,080
to be grateful for.

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Having survived to see your brother again,

170
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,310
you still owe a debt of gratitude

171
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,580
to someone besides us.

172
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,410
Mr. Mo,

173
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,060
you come and go freely
in the Yao State's imperial palace

174
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,300
as if it's your place.

175
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,630
I suppose

176
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,910
the one
who trespassed into my mansion last time

177
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,670
was also you.

178
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,600
Just some paintings copied from elsewhere.

179
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,480
Prince Annan,

180
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,270
if you like them, just take a look.

181
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,100
If not,

182
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,630
feel free to tear them up.

183
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,750
But some paintings

184
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,870
are already engraved in one's heart

185
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
and cannot be destroyed.

186
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,030
He's really stubborn.

187
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,090
I thought he had recalled something.

188
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,630
He's definitely remembered

189
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,910
a lot more

190
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,370
than you think.

191
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,480
From when we met him again

192
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,870
in the court

193
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,320
until just now,

194
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,150
have you

195
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,870
or I

196
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,080
ever mentioned our names to him?

197
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,870
"Mr. Mo."

198
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,870
"Miss Lu."

199
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,870
Then why didn't he admit it?

200
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,570
Everyone in the mundane world

201
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,030
has their own struggles.

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,150
Let it be.

203
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,670
You've just started feeling better,

204
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,630
yet you're already
reviewing so many memorials.

205
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,200
You should avoid overexertion

206
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,460
and get some good rest.

207
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,840
That's why I need you

208
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,390
to share my burden.

209
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
Servants, you may leave.

210
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,630
The officials have been requesting

211
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,090
to execute the Taijin General, Li Shuang,
as soon as possible.

212
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,920
Li Wei was sent over
to negotiate peace,

213
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,560
but ended up being shot dead

214
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,840
by our troops right outside the city.

215
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,620
Right now,

216
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,300
Li Shuang is Taijin's

217
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,780
only capable military commander.

218
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,310
The officials want this

219
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,450
to eliminate future threats for good.

220
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,790
I don't know what you've been through
over the past year,

221
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,870
but I can tell

222
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
that you have some special feelings

223
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,320
for General Li.

224
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,240
My loyalty to Yao State is absolute

225
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,150
and pure.

226
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,500
No need to explain.

227
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,960
I trust you, of course.

228
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,960
Taijin and our state

229
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,480
have been at war for many years,

230
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,080
with countless casualties,

231
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,720
and neither side has gained any advantage.

232
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,120
Now Taijin has a new ruler

233
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,040
who cares about his people
and puts them first.

234
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,410
This peace negotiation

235
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,650
might be foreboding the beginning
of a peaceful and prosperous era.

236
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,790
Aodeng,

237
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,650
you've been free-spirited since childhood.

238
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,000
No matter what you do,

239
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,840
you never care about the rules,

240
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,900
acting recklessly

241
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,960
and refusing to be influenced by others.

242
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,910
Perhaps in the past year,

243
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,360
with so much on your shoulders

244
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,560
and too many worries,

245
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,730
you've learned to be overly cautious.

246
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,460
As your elder brother,

247
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,520
I hope you can return
to how you used to be

248
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,760
and follow your heart
in what you believe is right.

249
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,050
Today's your birthday.

250
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I've ordered them

251
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,590
to get you an amulet.

252
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,170
Now that everything has settled,

253
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,510
it's time for you, me, and this kingdom

254
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,150
to have a new beginning.

255
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,930
At a time like this,

256
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,690
you still feel like drinking with me?

257
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,890
You're away from home.

258
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,610
At a time like this,

259
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,500
you also need company.

260
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,910
Today, fireworks and firecrackers

261
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,440
have been going off all day.

262
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,020
Is there some celebration?

263
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,750
My brother's return to the throne

264
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,960
has been announced across the state.

265
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,220
He has always been beloved by the people,

266
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,640
so they're spontaneously celebrating

267
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,810
the great ruler's return to court.

268
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,260
Peace and prosperity.

269
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,400
How rare indeed.

270
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
I wish that in the future,

271
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,369
the whole world could be like this.

272
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,800
How wonderful that would be.

273
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,750
My brother and I have talked it over.

274
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,810
We will release you

275
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,640
along with the other Taijin prisoners
of war.

276
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,990
We've also sent word
to the Changfeng Army.

277
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,790
Someone should come to pick you up soon.

278
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,530
I am a general of Taijin.

279
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,370
Are you really letting me go this easily?

280
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,880
I once thought our vendetta

281
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,810
was inevitable.

282
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,550
But now that the truth has come to light,

283
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,810
the grudges between us

284
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,000
should come to an end.

285
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,650
Before your father died, he told me

286
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,750
that he hoped our two states
could cease fighting

287
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,210
and build peace together.

288
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,030
And I

289
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,680
don't want to see
any more innocent people die either.

290
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,340
Besides, when I was in Taijin,

291
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,930
you guys also never mistreated me.

292
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,750
Your Highness,

293
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,510
the imperial palace sent word

294
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,130
that because today is your birthday,

295
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,110
His Majesty has arranged a feast
at the palace,

296
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,820
requesting you to head over quickly.

297
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,750
Tell His Majesty

298
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,750
that it's getting late,

299
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,310
so there's no need to make it a big deal.

300
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,360
Early tomorrow morning,

301
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,960
I'll go express my gratitude in person.

302
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,590
But...

303
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,680
Do as I say.

304
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,240
Yes, Your Highness.

305
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,960
You don't remember your birthday.

306
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,570
Likewise, I've been a drifter,

307
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,320
so I don't know mine either.

308
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,750
How about we make today

309
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,310
our shared birthday?

310
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,270
So today

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,110
is your real birthday.

312
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,050
Since it's your birthday,

313
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,080
I should show you some respect.

314
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,690
This cup of wine

315
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,640
is to wish you a long life.

316
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,810
I may not be so talented,

317
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,980
but today I'll perform

318
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,750
a dance to celebrate.

a long journey ahead.

403
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,180
I've prepared some food for you.

404
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,130
You can eat when you're hungry.

405
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,230
Thank you.

406
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,850
Belated kindness.

407
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,130
Thank you.

408
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,830
You can stay in Yao State

409
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,550
if you want to.

410
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,040
I can settle you down

411
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,750
somewhere else.

412
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,590
And about the fireworks that day,

413
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,440
if you liked them...

414
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,070
That day,

415
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,440
I was drunk and behaved inappropriately.

416
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,890
Please forgive me, Prince Annan.

417
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,720
Now that everywhere is at peace,

418
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,440
just let bygones

419
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,000
be bygones.

420
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,440
Jin'an is already dead.

421
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,660
I should have realized it.

422
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,030
Wait.

423
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,720
Since you're leaving,

424
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,080
I'll return this hairpin

425
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
to its owner.

426
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,490
Since it's over between us,

427
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,680
what's the point

428
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,160
of keeping such stuff?

429
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,150
Take care, Prince Annan.

430
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,260
Welcome back, Grand General, General Li.
Let's head back to the capital.

431
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,590
Are you and Mo Yin

432
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,920
planning to return to Wuling Mountain?

433
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,160
So there's nothing I can hide from you.

434
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,160
It's been a while

435
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,690
since we left the mountain.

436
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,480
As the Master of the Mountain,

437
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,770
he has more important things
to deal with, of course.

438
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,160
I can't be too selfish.

439
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,640
We're already in Taijin territory now.

440
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
With Ji Ran and others escorting you,

441
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,300
I can rest assured.

442
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,850
Seems like Mo Yin

443
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,510
has been taking good care of you.

444
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,350
You're so caring about him.

445
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,680
Who's caring about him?

446
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm just

447
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,640
taking this opportunity

448
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
to go back

449
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,730
to replenish my herbal stock.

450
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,480
How are things going

451
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,810
between you and Jin'an?

452
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,860
You once promised to accompany each other

453
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,260
and grow old together.

454
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,929
Don't you think it'll be a shame

455
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,790
if you don't give it another shot?

456
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,590
We once fell deeply in love
with each other.

457
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,530
It's true.

458
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,659
But he remembers neither the past

459
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,480
nor me.

460
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,630
This is also true.

461
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,400
In this world,

462
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,840
gatherings

463
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,510
and partings

464
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,920
are all part of fate.

465
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,590
It's just fate playing with us.

466
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,670
If that's the case,

467
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,880
let me take this away.

468
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,340
So it won't remind you of him,
giving you heartache.

469
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,980
The emotional ties

470
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,930
are intertwined and complicated.

471
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,630
You should at least give me some time

472
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,760
to cut them off one by one.

473
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,610
Since you've decided to let go,

474
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,670
you should do it decisively.

475
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,360
You're a general.

476
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,140
Where's that decisive warrior
you once were?

477
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,570
It's getting late.

478
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,340
I'll take my leave.

479
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,550
Shuang,

480
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,060
take care of yourself.

481
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,590
Shuang.

482
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,150
Actually, Jin'an has already...

483
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,150
You should go now.

484
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,420
Don't keep Mo Yin waiting.

485
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,630
I made your favorite pear-blossom pastries

486
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,690
and wanted to bring them here
while they're still warm.

487
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,660
I remember I fell in love

488
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,480
with a woman in Taijin.

489
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,940
You are the Prince Annan of Yao State.

490
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,230
Falling in love with a woman from Taijin

491
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,820
will not end well.

492
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,960
What if I were not the Prince Annan?

493
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,180
[Here rest the Yao warriors

His Majesty has returned.

The Empress Dowager Qin
has fallen from power.

496

The people are safe.

498
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,180
Being buried here,

499
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,460
you will be able to witness

500
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,960

00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,000
have escorted my father, Li Wei, back.

509
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,710
Despite the unsuccessful peace negotiation
this time,

510
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,170
Emperor Duan Aoze
has reclaimed the throne.

511
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,650
He's benevolent and not fond of wars.

512
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,670
Perhaps there's hope for peace

513
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,530
between our two nations.

514
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,670
Grand General Li Wei

515
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,140
sacrificed himself for the greater good

516
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,520
and died for his state.

517
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,130
He's hereby posthumously granted

518
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,140
the title of Duke of Loyalty and Courage

519
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,270
to honor his virtue.

520
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,480
Please allow me to express my gratitude

521
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,340
for your grace
on behalf of my father, Your Majesty.

522
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,160
You may rise now.

523
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,670
A wise ruler should be fair

524
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,070
with rewards and punishments.

525
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,760
Given

526
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,960
Li Wei's contributions,

527
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
he's already been rewarded.

528
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,440
However,

529
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,280
Li Shuang committed a grave crime.

530
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,480
Your Majesty, please

531
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,590
punish her with no mercy.
