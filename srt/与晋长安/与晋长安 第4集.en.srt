[General's Residence]

4
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,759
Miss.

5
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,870
May I ask

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,920
if this is General's residence?

7
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,280
Miss.

8
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,310
Could you pass a message for me?

9
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,509
I wish to see General.

10
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,120
Never mind.

11
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,750
Don't trouble yourself.

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,880
I'll find my own way.

13
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,130
By General's orders, I'm to watch you

14
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,060
and not let you move around freely.

15
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,980
What have I done wrong

16
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,730
to be watched like this?

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
Because you're a man,

18
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,910
a suspicious man.

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Am I going to be kept here?

20
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,310
The female doctor just now

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,960
was very curious
about the changes in my body,

22
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,290
which is quite strange.

23
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,850
Could it be

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,430
that this isn't the General's Residence?

25
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,630
Perhaps they and the people
in the stone chamber

26
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,960
are working together?

27
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,770
If that's the case,

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,079
I'll just stay here.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,150
However,

30
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,060
that pot of tea seems to have gone cold.

31
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,920
Could you bring me a fresh hot one?

32
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,960
Sure.

33
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,330
I'm sorry about this,

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,630
Miss.

35
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,190
Miss, please spare me.

36
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,960
Please.

37
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,050
We both lead a life in the jianghu.

38
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,940
Beat him up, Qiao!

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Beat him up!

40
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,210
Where are you going?

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,470
Qiao, he's there!

42
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,960
General,

43
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,470
help!

44
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,370
Stop right there!

45
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,020
General.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,390
Come here!

47
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,960
What's all this commotion?

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
General, he tried to escape.

49
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,920
I didn't know where I was.

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
I wanted to see you.

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,660
That's why

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,800
I rushed out.

53
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,310
Let's go.

54
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,240
Go.

55
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,430
Now that I've seen you,

56
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,340
I feel at ease.

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
I'll be going.

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Is

59
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,430
Huo Du dead?

60
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,060
I didn't mean to kill him.

61
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,240
I did it to save Li Ting.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,310
-I...
-I trust you.

63
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,790
But your pulse is irregular,

64
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,470
and your eyes are shifty.

65
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,500
You're hiding something from me.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,830
I thought

67
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,020
you would be afraid of me.

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,150
Why would I fear you?

69
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,510
My body undergoes unpredictable changes,

70
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,360
with my unstable supernatural strength.

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,390
I can be

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,330
as weak as a kitten at times,

73
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,630
but when I snap,

74
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,160
I can kill a man with my bare hands.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
The mess

76
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,310
and the bloodstains in the stone chamber

77
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,870
might all be my doing.

78
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,830
If you put it that way,

79
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,430
I'm quite afraid.

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,210
Last time in the stone chamber,

81
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,370
that enchantress seemed to know you.

82
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,090
Do you remember anything?

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,120
She's actually a corpse

84
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,090
but was manipulated by someone.

85
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,120
The situation

86
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,920
seems identical

87
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,040
to those two soldiers in the camp.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,500
If that's really the case,

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,659
I might have

90
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,870
been controlled by

91
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,159
whoever is behind these two incidents.

92
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,159
But something went wrong along the way,

93
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,490
and I narrowly escaped.

94
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,670
Could everything

95
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,560
truly be as Lu Xin said,

96
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,150
connected to Wuling Mountain?

97
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,010
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,160
Why did you punch me?

99
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,390
Even though you've lost your strength,

100
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,650
for the safety of everyone

101
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,710
in this residence,

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,700
I still needed to test you.

103
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,080
In all the time we've known each other,

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,800
when have I ever lied to you?

105
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,750
Whether you're lying or not
is just what you sayâ€”

106
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,150
how would I know for sure?

107
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,070
Get up.

108
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,520
After all,

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,370
you saved me and Li Ting.

110
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,430
Thank you.

111
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,230
You really don't see me as a monster?

112
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,800
The world

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
encompasses all things.

114
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,570
Just stay true to yourself.

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
You are who you are.

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,900
You're Jin'an,

117
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,750
not some monster.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
These days,

119
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
you should stay
in the residence for recovery.

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Don't wander off.

121
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,190
Next time Lu Xin comes,

122
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I'll have her prepare some medicine

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
to improve circulation.

124
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,330
Don't worry.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
So quick?

126
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,510
Captain is truly blessed.

127
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,950
What a coincidence.

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,610
Captain is here.

129
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,190
Captain, Captain.

130
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,380
Here, here.

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,870
What they just did...

132
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,840
Thank you.

133
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,600
I just arrived and ran into you.

134
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,799
What a coincidence.

135
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,440
We must be destined to meet.

136
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,680
Miss, why are you here

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,720
this time?

138
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,790
You're playing dumb.

139
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,510
How many times do I have to tell you?

140
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,960
Flirting.

141
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,570
This is a military camp,

142
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,510
not a suitable place for a lady to linger.

143
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,640
Please leave, Miss.

144
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,550
Still so shy.

145
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,620
Li Ting has grown up now.

146
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,000
Applying medicine

147
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,260
is better left to me.

148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,570
He is bad-tempered.

149
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,670
Qiao and the others were just sent away.

150
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,270
You've never met him before.

151
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't worry.

152
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,620
Time to change your bandages.

153
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,810
Shuang's residence is full of women.

154
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,630
Who are you?

155
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
There's a lot

156
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,150
you don't know.

157
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,870
I'm General's honored guest.

158
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,440
Not everyone gets to see me.

159
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,790
Hurry

160
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,910
and change the bandages.

161
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,870
Honored guest?

162
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,360
I think you're just

163
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
a lowly servant.

164
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,680
I won't change them.

165
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,010
Just let me die of pain.

166
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,450
The one who hit me should do it.

167
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,340
You're so eager to see your sister.

168
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,900
Fine,

169
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,790
I'll go get her.

170
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,370
Ouch, ouch.

171
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,040
Gentle, please.

172
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,240
If you don't recover soon,

173
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
how will you match wits with your sister?

174
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
Who cares?

175
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Easy, easy.

176
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,030
Gentle, please.

177
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,120
Has your sister

178
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,430
always been this fierce?

179
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,790
Who are you

180
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,110
to comment on Shuang's personality?

181
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,720
Say one more bad thing about her,

182
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
and I'll rip your tongue out.

183
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,350
Birds of a feather

184
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,840
flock together.

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,870
Besides,

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,790
what's wrong with your sister

187
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,850
being a bit fierce?

188
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
Isn't a tiger fierce?

189
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,270
Yet it's still the king of beasts.

190
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,800
She's no queen of anything.

191
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,720
Huo Du escaped.

192
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
And I was going after him.

193
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,170
I was just cleaning up her mess.

194
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,390
She said
I didn't respect her as my sister,

195
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,120
and she used Dad to pressure me.

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I think she doesn't treat us

197
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,750
like family.

198
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,080
Such an ingrate.

199
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,460
You won't let me criticize your sister,

200
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,590
yet you're quite enthusiastic
about doing so yourself.

201
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,430
She

202
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,080
was actually very good to me
when I was little.

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
When Dad punished me,

204
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,560
she would save her own food

205
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,150
and sneak it to me
in the middle of the night.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,630
I don't know when

207
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,920
but she's different now.

208
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,330
There are many ways to care for others.

209
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,440
Her way of caring for you

210
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,100
has just changed, that's all.

211
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,150
You talk as if you would appreciate

212
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,320
this way of caring if I gave it to you.

213
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,720
If you could give it to me,

214
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,040
I would dare to accept.

215
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,200
Dream on.

216
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,830
Who do you think you are?

217
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,290
Take care of yourself.

218
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,320
Since you came to apply medicine for me,

219
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,520
you must be trying to get on my good side.

220
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,850
Why not tell me your name before you go?

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
My name is Jin'an.

222
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,030
Why?

223
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,450
You want to be friends with me?

224
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,420
General.

225
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,790
I just

226
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,750
was afraid applying medicine
would hurt too much,

227
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,320
so I mentioned your name.

228
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,550
Just to distract him.

229
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,480
Well said.

230
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,800
I am fierce.

231
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,670
I love being fierce.

232
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm super fierce.

233
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,650
You

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
are

235
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,040

238

239
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,030

Why are you back so late?

244

She's been waiting for you for ages.

245
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,410
Miss Lu is really beautiful.

246
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,480
Isn't she?

247
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,390
I'd love to marry someone like her too.

248
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,120
Keep dreaming.
You'll never get a woman like her.

249
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,150
Captain.

250
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,360
You're so lucky.

251
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,720
After Miss Lu
delivered the herbs yesterday,

252
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,450
she's been waiting for you
in the camp ever since.

253
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,000
Let me tell you,

254
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,910
I bet

255
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,440
Miss Lu and Captain

256
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,550
will definitely get together this time.

257
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:57,960
Right.

258
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,760
Great. Great.

259
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,260
What are you doing?

260
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Washing clothes.

261
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,440
I saw your clothes were dirty,

262
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
so I washed them for you.

263
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
This one

264
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,480
had a hole in it,

265
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,870
so I mended it for you.

266
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,470
She even washed his clothes.

267
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,420
How is it?

268
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,010
Just a bit darker in color.

have to be so cold to me?

299
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,460

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm not doing well enough?

I hereby permit her
to join the court on political matters.

350
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,920
Hereby,
let this be publicly proclaimed to all.

351
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,880
The late emperor has passed away,

352
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,950
and Prince Annan,

353
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,520
overcome with grief,
has died of a sudden illness.

354
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,880
In the blink of an eye,

355
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,920
our Yao State
has undergone dramatic changes.

356
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,400
His majesty is still young.

357
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
He will need all ministers

358
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,350
to assist with one heart

359
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,080
to revitalize the Yao State.

360
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,270
We must

361
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,660
avenge the late emperor
and Prince Annan's deaths.

362
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,370
We'll serve with utmost loyalty
until death.

363
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,570
[Bai Kun, Vice Minister of the Yao State]

364
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,170
[Zuo Chengzhi,
Prime Minister of the Yao State]

365
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,460
Your Majesty.

366
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,310
Our son

367
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,000
has become the emperor.

368
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,200
Are you happy?

369
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,070
Jin Wujian,

370
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,250
didn't you say he would wake up?

371
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,830
Why is he

372
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,240
still in this condition after so long?

373
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,590
The Jade Linglong's integration
was interrupted.

374
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,270
I've tried every remedy,

375
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,240
but can't reverse his fate.

376
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,920
You're lying!

377
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,230
His Majesty can't die.

378
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,030
He can't die.

379
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,540
I don't want him to die.

380
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,800
I don't want him to die.

381
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,570
Jin Wujian,

382
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,230
you're from Wuling Mountain.

383
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,200
You can save him, right?

384
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,510
You asked me to create the shadow puppet.

385
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,400
I beg you.

386
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,900
I beg you to save him, please?

387
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,130
I beg you.

388
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,400
To save His Majesty,

389
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,880
there is only one way.

390
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,030
What is it?

391
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
It is called

392
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,020
Double-Blossom Wine.

393
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,860
If you mix both of your blood into it

394
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
and drink it together,

395
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,110
your lives will be bound together.

396
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,550
You live as one

397
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,410
and die as one.

398
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,640
Just one drop

399
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,720
will bind you two forever.

400
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,440
His Majesty can be brought back to life,

401
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,420
but your life will be tied to his.

402
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,790
Empress Dowager.

403
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,490
Please think twice, Empress Dowager.

404
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,440
We can live and die together

405
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,510
and will never change this resolve.

406
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,420
Isn't that what I want?

407
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,050
General.

408
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,610
The clothes you requested.

409
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,790
But

410
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,720
these clothes are so tattered.

411
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,310
What use could you have for them, General?

412
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,510
The border is ravaged by war,

413
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,510
and nearby villages

414
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,030
have been destroyed beyond recognition.

415
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,880
This time,

416
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,790
I plan to go in disguise

417
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,840
and help rebuild their homes
before returning.

418
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,970
Rest assured, General.

419
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,690
I

420
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,000
would rather risk my life

421
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,060
than fail to protect your residence.

422
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,080
Come, follow me to see General.

423
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,680
General.

424
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,310
He was lurking outside the door,

425
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,660
eavesdropping for quite some time.

426
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,790
He was sneaking around suspiciously.

427
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,990
Who knows what mischief he's planning.

428
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:45,960
Tell me,

429
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,030
how long have you eavesdropped?

430
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,960
How long have you eavesdropped?

431
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
Actually,

432
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,250
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

433
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,750
I wanted to tell you

434
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,810
Li Ting is much better now.

435
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,510
I see.

436
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,930
Anything else?

437
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,750
You're going out?

438
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,480
I want to go with you.

439
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,440
How dare you!

440
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,440
How dare you!

441
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,340
Where's that echo coming from?

442
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,520
Why?

443
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,010
Here in the residence,

444
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,550
you're the only one I'm familiar with.

445
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,350
Besides, everyone else here

446
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,410
looks like they want to kill me.

447
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,900
Even if you trust them,

448
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,950
I don't.

449
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,000
His identity remains unclear,

450
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,460
so he's still suspicious.

451
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,480
General's Residence is heavily guarded.

452
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
If he truly is a spy,

453
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,590
taking him outside
where he has room to maneuver

454
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,810
might actually make him
reveal his true colors.

455
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,890
Besides, you know,

456
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,880
if my body

457
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,960
undergoes any changes,

458
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,140
and you aren't by my side...

459
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,750
Well...

460
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,030
Indeed.

461
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,240
If he regains his terrifying strength
in my absence,

462
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,170
I'm afraid Qiao couldn't stop him.

463
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,790
Very well.

464
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,370
You can come with me.

465
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,330
Since we're in disguise,

466
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,070
we should pose as a displaced couple,

467
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,670
making it easier
to gain the villagers' trust.

468
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,640
Couple?

469
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,550
General,

470
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
is he worthy?

471
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,550
Are you worthy?

472
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,620
Am I worthy?

473
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,590
However...

474
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,340
That outfit won't work.

475
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,000
Then what will?

476
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,340
Clothes were torn without hesitation.

477
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,010
You people from the General's Residence
are truly generous.

478
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,920
But you didn't even let me wear them
after tearing them.

479
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,580
I don't know why you tore them.

480
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,640
Qiao is quite impressive.

481
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,830
She actually managed to find

482
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,690
so many different rough fabrics.

483
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,590
Where on earth did she find these?

484
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,680
Miss,

485
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,050
are you from out of town?

486
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,650
Ma'am,

487
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,880
we've traveled for a day,

488
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:27,990
and along the way,

489
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,830
we haven't seen any signs of people.

490
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,030
Could we trouble you for a bowl of water?

491
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,420
During the war,

492
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,140
most people have died.

493
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,430
Have you

494
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,170
ended up stranded here?

495
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,510
I understand

496
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,790
you're cautious.

497
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,530
I didn't want to bother you,

498
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,720
but

499
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,720
my little brother

500
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,380
was born a bit simple-minded.

501
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,880
He kept telling me

502
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,610
he was hungry and thirsty.

503
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,500
He's made a fuss the whole way.

504
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,830
I really have no choice.

505
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,200
Nothing I say worked.

506
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,660
I

507
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,000
am hungry.

508
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,000
Hungry.

509
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,480
All right, come with me.

510
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,350
Follow me.

511
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,250
How come you're so hungry?

512
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,170
Come on.

513
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,070
Auntie Huang,

514
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,270
I notice

515
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,540
there are hardly any men in the village.

516
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,580
They were drafted into the army

517
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,910
and most died in battle.

518
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,870
Auntie Huang,

519
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,330
here's payment for the meal.

520
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,720
That's far too much.

521
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,900
No, I can't take it.

522
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,790
To be honest,

523
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,240
I used to repair houses

524
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,550
in my village.

525
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,680
Later, the village was destroyed,

526
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,320
so I took my simple-minded brother

527
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,880
and my brothers

528
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,920
and fled.

529
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,200
You've been so kind to us today.

530
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,440
If you don't mind,

531
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,640
I have many men working for me,

532
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
and I can help you

533
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
rebuild the village.

534
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,230
But

535
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,190
we're just farmers

536
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,570
and can't afford to pay.

537
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,070
Since this is to repay your kindness,

538
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,790
how could I ask for money?

539
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,490
Once the village is rebuilt,

540
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,290
if you get the word out about us,

541
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,750
that would help me build my reputation.

542
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,680
This village is so run-down now.

543
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,950
Apart from a few old lives,

544
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,530
there's nothing much left that matters.

545
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,280
All right.

546
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,310
I'll discuss it with Auntie Li.

547
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,270
Miss,

548
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,810
where are your men?

549
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,420
They'll arrive tomorrow.

550
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,920
Please keep this money for the meal

551
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,750
for now.

552
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,640
All right.

553
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,590
I'll owe you the wages for now,

554
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,110
and when we have a good harvest,

555
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,070
I'll sell the crops and pay you back.

556
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,520
Okay.

557
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,600
I'll be going then.

558
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,180
Take care.

559
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,920
I thought you were a woman of your word.

560
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,590
I never expected

561
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,550
you could lie

562
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,050
without even blinking.

563
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,210
You flatter me.

564
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,290
But there's something I don't understand.

565
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Didn't you say we'd pose as a couple?

566
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,690
Why did you suddenly call me
your little brother?

567
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,880
Why?

568
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,300
You want to pose as my husband?

569
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,920
I just wanted to ask

570
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
why you made me your little brother.

571
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,440
Why can't I be your older brother?

572
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,840
I might be older than you.

573
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,520
When you were discussing clothes
with me that day,

574
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,850
you really lacked masculinity.

575
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,530
I couldn't bring myself

576
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,750
to call you my older brother or husband.

577
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,000
Clothing is just a part
of basic human needs.

578
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,750
How can you judge someone's masculinity

579
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,350
based on that?

580
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,510
You have a point.

581
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,960
When Ji Ran arrives,

582
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,470
you can prove yourself

583
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,010
by working with them.

584
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,690
Fine, I'll do it.

585
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm not afraid.

586
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,370
Wash the dishes.

587
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:58,890
Okay.

588
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,400
This is perfect to test

589
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,200
if he
has truly lost his supernatural strength.

590
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,550
Can you handle it, young man?

591
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,410
Stop carrying those.

592
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Go up there and fix the roof instead.

593
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,820
A grown man like him is so weak,

594
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,480
collapsing after just this little work.

595
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,540
Let me check on him.

596
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,500
Nothing serious.

597
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,920
It's due to a deficiency of Qi and blood
and overwork.

598
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,400
Some rest and food will fix him up.

599
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,590
Thank you, Auntie Huang.

600
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,000
You know something about medicine?

601
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,930
Just a little.

602
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,030
Back in the village, when sows gave birth,

603
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,560
they looked just like this.

604
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,160
Auntie Li,

605
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,560
let's go cook something.

606
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,150
Alright.

607
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,510
We're leaving.

608
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,270
Thank you for your help.

609
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,380
Gene...

610
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,750
Miss Li,

611
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,070
well,

612
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,160
I'll go help out now.

613
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,830
Go ahead.

614
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,700
Just need to add some more thatch
to the roof.

615
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,740
Almost done. Almost done.

616
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,130
That's enough.

617
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,920
Don't do it
if you can't handle hard labor.

618
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,980
Why push yourself?

619
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,270
I did what you told me to.

620
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,030
I'm yours.

621
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,640
I'll follow

622
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,160
whatever you say.

623
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,590
Smooth talker.

624
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,440
I know,

625
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,310
you wanted to test

626
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,680
if I've really
lost all my supernatural strength.

627
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,740
If I had been lazy and had slacked off,

628
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,290
you would've become more suspicious of me.

629
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,360
Alright,

630
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,850
have some rest now.

631
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,550
Can you stay here tonight?

632
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,030
Stay with me,

633
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,020
please?

634
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,680
No.

635
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,920
Why?

636
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,199
But you were out there with them,

637
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,110
sleeping in the open,

638
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,320
and you're a young lady.

639
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,050
What's wrong with being a lady?

640
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,639
I can do hard labor better than you,

641
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,080
and I am stronger than you.

642
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,560
-But...
-But?

643
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,810
We're brothers,
sharing the good times and the bad.

644
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,810
Don't be willful.

645
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Give me your hand.

646
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,239
Hold it out.

647
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,630
Eat it.

648
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,240
Why aren't you sleeping?

649
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,620
Have you been sitting like that for long?

650
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,320
Never mind.

651
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,900
I knew you couldn't leave me alone.

652
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,370
I just remembered,

653
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,350
when I was sick as a child,

654
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,920
I also wanted someone

655
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,580
to stay by my side, that's all.

656
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,630
Such a tough general

657
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,130
actually has such a vulnerable side.

658
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,820
Everyone has moments of weakness.

659
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Facing your vulnerability

660
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,590
can make you become stronger.

661
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,530
Did you eat the candy I gave you?

662
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,070
When I first arrived at the camp,

663
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,440
you gave me one too.

664
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,710
Why do you always

665
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,040
carry candies with you?

666
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,070
When you can't solve the troubles
of this world,

667
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,940
use a little sweetness

668
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
to dissolve the bitterness inside.

669
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,750
Come on,

670
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,340
get up here and sleep first.

671
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,410
Have you lost your mind?

672
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,150
Or is your fever making you delirious?

673
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,150
Why not?

674
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,760
You slept with them

675
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,630
on the floor.

676
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,930
Can't you sleep with me?

677
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,850
Besides,

678
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
we've slept together before.

679
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,800
Shut up.

680
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,070
I advise you

681
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,340
to stop talking

682
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,460
before I get angry.

683
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,630
Go to sleep.

684
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,400
Turn around and sleep.

685
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,170
These days,

686
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,190
I've been with her every day,

687
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,510
but I still feel uneasy.

688
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Perhaps, her scent

689
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,920
has mixed with those soldiers'

690
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,270
and isn't pure anymore.

691
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,720
This won't do.

692
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,710
I need to figure out a solution.
