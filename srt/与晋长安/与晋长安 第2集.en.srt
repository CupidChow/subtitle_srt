00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,620
[The Imperial Palace of Taijin]

4
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,860
Your Majesty.

5
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,310
Li Wei,

6
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,870
do you admit your guilt?

7
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,710
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,430
I do.

9
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,910
You launched a night attack,

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,750
yet the Yao Army ambushed us precisely.

11
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,470
Either they were too cunning,

12
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,360
or you're unfit to command.

13
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Or worse, there's a spy in your army.

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,470
Besides,

15
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,400
your daughter Li Shuang...

16
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,710
charged in on her own.

17
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,430
If Lucheng had fallen,

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,079
even executing you all

19
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,310
wouldn't be enough
to calm the people's rage.

20
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,110
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,190
I authorized Li Shuang
to lead the troops into battle.

22
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,910
It was a desperate move
in a moment of crisis.

23
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,590
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

24
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,050
A desperate move, you say?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
How dare you Li family

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,329
gamble with my Taijin land!

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,320
[Su Muyang, Crown Prince of Taijin]

28
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,150
Father.

29
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,750
General Li has led
the Changfeng Army for years.

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,430
He's brought home countless victories.

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,240
Fortunately,

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,220
we won this battle

33
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,680
and Lucheng still stands.

34
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,450
Please, Father, don't be angry.

35
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,800
[Su Muli, Prince Li of Taijin]

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,750
Five thousand soldiers died in the valley,

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,280
and you call that a victory?

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,150
Are you defending the Li family

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,130
because of your past with them?

40
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,470
[Prime Minister of Taijin, Ji Lan]

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,910
Your Majesty,

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,400
in my opinion,

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,240
the Battle of Lucheng resulted in heavy losses,

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,750
but General Li

45
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,710
has long defended Taijin's border

46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,870
has long defended Taijin's border

47
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,360
with the Changfeng Army.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
His service is beyond doubt.

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,400
I urge Your Majesty to reconsider.

50
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,430
Enough.

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,079
Li Wei,

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
for your past service,

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
I'll let this go, for now.

54
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,870
You have half a month to find

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,600
the traitor.

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,430
Yes, Your Majesty!

57
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,400
You've fought hard on the front lines.

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,079
Rest at home for now.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,400
Let Li Shuang lead the investigation.

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
If she finds the traitor,

61
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,800
your faults may be redeemed.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
If not,

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,290
the rest of you,

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,620
tell me what punishment he deserves.

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,450
Your Majesty,

66
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,110
if we fail to find the traitor,

67
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,440
I'll accept full responsibility.

68
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,290
Just as you predicted, General.

69
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,610
We looked into strange movements

70
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,870
among the soldiers' families,

71
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,390
then we found that
only one fled the capital,

72
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,910
and has now gone missing.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,130
It's the Deputy General

74
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,120
Huo Du's family.

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,120
On the day of the Battle of Lucheng,

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,430
after planning the surprise attack,

77
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,160
Huo Du

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,950
pretended to be sick to avoid the battle,

79
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,950
yet the Yao Army was fully prepared.

80
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,500
These two things

81
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,390
are a bit too coincidental.

82
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,909
We can't wait any longer.

83
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,409
The half-month deadline is approaching.

84
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,140
The sooner we find the traitor,

85
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,920
the safer my father will be.

86
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,580
Stop!

87
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,710
Who goes there?

88
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,680
We have the travel permit.
Let us pass quickly.

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,270
You think we'll let you pass
just because you say so?

90
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,610
The checkpoint is on high alert today.

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,940
All people must be thoroughly inspected.

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,740
Greetings, Your Highness!

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,420
We didn't know it was you.

94
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,770
Please forgive us.

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
Your vigilance

96
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,860
speaks well of your duty.

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,520
There's no need to apologize.

98
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,540
May I proceed now?

99
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,390
Safe travels, Your Highness.

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,650
To put it nicely,
we call him "Your Highness",

101
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,870
but you know what people really say...

102
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,550
Shut up!

103
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,020
Gossiping about the Crown Prince?

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,820
You want to get yourself killed?

105
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,060
Report this to Lord Li immediately.

106
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,700
Yes, sir.

107
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,190
Be careful.

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,120
Are you alright?

109
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,830
Hold on.

110
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,480
Muyang,

111
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,160
we're not fugitives.

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,350
[Tai Jin Li Ting]

113
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,010
Why did we sneak out
of the city like that?

114
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,190
General Li is still under house arrest,

115
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,390
and His Majesty is wary of the Li family.

116
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,680
If they catch you leaving the capital
without permission,

117
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,140
it will bring you trouble.

118
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,680
That house arrest is awful!

119
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,270
Father watches me all day,

120
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,070
and I can't even slip out for fun.

121
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,040
Ting,

122
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,970
your father

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,950
sent you to see Li Shuang in Lucheng,

124
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,800
so you'd stay out of politics.

125
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,000
I've already sent word to your sister.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,750
Stay cautious and keep a low profile.

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,350
Don't expose your identity.

128
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,040
The road to Lucheng is long and bumpy,

129
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,730
and Shuang is so fierce.

130
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,550
If Father and you hadn't planned this,

131
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,340
I wouldn't even bother going.

132
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,909
This was your sister's

133
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,640
favorite biography.

134
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,190
Please give it to her for me.

135
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,120
Just tell her...

136
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,110
Never mind.

137
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,080
No need to say anything.

138
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,260
Muyang,

139
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,750
since you miss her so much,

140
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,490
why not come with me?

141
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,630
I'm afraid...

142
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,370
I no longer have the right to see her.

143
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,500
It's getting late,

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,750
you should go now.

145
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Stay safe.

146
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,000
I've been here for days

147
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,630
and never heard

148
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,690
birds singing in this military camp.

149
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,030
This is your reward for delivering intel

150
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,840
during the Battle of Lucheng.

151
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,110
If you want a good life,

152
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,630
just keep following orders.

153
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,870
Don't worry,

154
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,220
I have a bigger gift for you.

155
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,270
No wonder Li Shuang was so wary of me.

156
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,390
So there really is

157
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,710
a traitor in the Changfeng Army.

158
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,270
General,

159
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,660
Huo Du is cunning.

160
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,710
I tracked him to the woods,
but lost his trail.

161
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,630
I planned to wait outside his tent,

162
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,690
but unexpectedly,

163
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,650
someone else returned with Huo Du.

164
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,710
Was it Jin'an?

165
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,170
I always knew that boy was suspicious.

166
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,460
I'll drag him in,

167
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,680
and interrogate him along with Huo Du.

168
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,870
Lord Huo,

169
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,820
what brings you here this late?

170
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,460
Nothing.

171
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,530
You may leave now.

172
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,060
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,440
General,

174
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,950
I request an audience.

175
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,090
Come in.

176
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,280
The other day, when I asked
if you feared I was a spy,

177
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,750
I meant no harm,

178
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,210
but you got so defensive.

179
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,090
So I kept an eye out for you.

180
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,200
You kept an eye out,

181
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,020
or were you in cahoots with them?

182
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,080
Even Mr. Ji, an adult, didn't catch him,

183
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,270
and you, with your tiny arms and legs,

184
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,330
say you managed it?

185
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,510
I've always been better than all of you.

186
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,270
Don't forget you lost to me once.

187
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,870
Remember?

188
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,190
That never happened. Don't talk nonsense.

189
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,860
Why did you do all this?

190
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,830
Because I want you to know

191
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,090
that keeping me around

192
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,350
was the right choice.

193
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,210
You did very well

194
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,720
on this.

195
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,130
Ji Ran, Luo Teng.

196
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
Huo Du leaked intel

197
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,560
and colluded with the illegitimate Yao.

198
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
Now we have the proof.

199
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,550
Go arrest him.

200
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Yes, General.

201
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,620
All the valuables are gone.

202
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
He must have fled.

203
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,840
He won't get far.

204
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,600
Go after him.

205
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,280
Remember,

206
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,600
I want him alive.

207
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,150
Yes, General.

208
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,500
Report!

209
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,510
General.

210
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,800
Young Master was kidnapped by bandits
on his way to our camp.

211
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,030
The bandits sent this jade pendant,

212
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,230
asking you to meet them on the mountain.

213
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,290
Why did Ting come here?

214
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,900
Ji Ran,

215
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,720
take a squad

216
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,160
and follow me to rescue Li Ting.

217
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,620
The rest of you stay at camp,

218
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,140
keep searching for Huo Du!

219
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,990
Make sure to catch him alive.

220
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,030
Yes, General!

221
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,860
I'll go with you.

222
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,300
It's dangerous.

223
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,280
No matter how strong you are,
you're still a kid.

224
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,140
Just stay here.

225
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,340
Since you're my soldier,

226
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,820
you must follow my orders.

227
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,490
Go back.

228
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
Brothers.

229
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,270
Here are the last two dishes.

230
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,270
We're all set now!

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,070
Come on, try this.

232
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,790
Share some with them.

233
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,240
Alright, thanks, boss!

234
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,790
Eat up.

235
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Dig in, everyone!

236
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,630
Okay, boss!

237
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,320
Brothers!

238
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,240
Boss, sit here, come on.

239
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,270
Here, try this dish.

240
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,080
It's amazing!

241
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,120
Sure, thanks, boss!

242
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,910
Cheers!

243
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,750
Let's drink, brothers.

244
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,410
Bottoms up!

245
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,750
You bandit! Let me go!

246
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,120
Do you know who I am?

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,510
Let me go! You...

248
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,870
-Starve me to death!
-It'll be worthless if you're dead.

249
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,200
Try starve me to death if you dare!

250
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,360
Do you know who I am?

251
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,550
Ouyang!

252
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,840
-Bandit!
-You're so good at cooking.

253
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,390
Bandit!

254
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:46,960
Come on.

255
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,440
If you've got the guts,
just starve me to death!

256
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,060
[Leader of Feiyun Stronghold, Ouyang Jun]

257
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,270
Brothers.

258
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,150
Listen up, all of you.

259
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,790
Tonight,

260
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,840
eat and drink well,

261
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,680
so you'll have the strength to work later.

262
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Understand?

263
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,550
Understood!

264
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,680
Cheers.

265
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,950
-Cheers!
-Drink up!

266
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,440
Come on, fill it up.

267
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,270
General Li has been
guarding the border for years.

268
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,560
She's quite a figure.

269
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,770
Are you sure...

270
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,880
she'd dare come here,
risking her own life?

271
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,710
Don't worry.

272
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,310
That girl

273
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,810
has never been afraid of risking her life.

274
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,490
Shuang!

275
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,270
Don't move.

276
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,890
Not hiding underground like a rat

277
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,240
was the worst decision you ever made.

278
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,920
Well, well,
what a grand entrance, General Li.

279
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,830
Huo Du.

280
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,200
Taijin has treated you well,

281
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,870
why did you betray your country?

282
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,800
Treated me well?

283
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,120
In the Changfeng Army,

284
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,600
to put it nicely,

285
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,820
I'm a Deputy General.

286
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,440
But to put it bluntly,

287
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,030
I'm no different from those minions

288
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,150
behind you.

289
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,120
If I don't take my chance now,

290
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,080
how will I ever gain

291
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
wealth and glory?

292
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,240
So...

293
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,030
you sacrificed

294
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,170
five thousand of our brothers for money?

295
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,200
It's war.

296
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,720
People always die.

297
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,360
Enough nonsense.

298
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,660
If you want your brother to live,

299
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,850
tell your men to drop their weapons

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,120
and surrender.

301
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,440
A mere bandit

302
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,920
dares to threaten the Changfeng Army?

303
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,550
It seems that Deputy General Huo

304
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
promised Yao State my head as a gift.

305
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,310
So you'll take the credit

306
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,920
and he'll get the money?

307
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,840
But did you know

308
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,760
the person you're holding

309
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,200
isn't even related to me?

310
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,370
What did you say?

311
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,630
Shuang...

312
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,450
Everyone in Taijin knows

313
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm General Li's adopted daughter.

314
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,270
Do you really think I'm stupid enough

315
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,540
to trade my life

316
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,290
for his?

317
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,320
If he dies,

318
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,350
I'd be the rightful heir

319
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,630
to the Changfeng Army.

320
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,900
When General Li comes for revenge,

321
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,220
he'll slaughter everyone here.

322
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,390
And that has nothing to do with me.

323
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,150
Li Shuang!

324
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,240
What are you talking about?

325
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,870
Be quiet!

326
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,110
Is she telling the truth?

327
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,120
Ouyang.

328
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,240
Don't listen to her.

329
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
She's saying this

330
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,550
just to buy some time.

331
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,630
I don't believe

332
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,200
you could watch him die without helping.

333
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,040
If you don't dare to kill him,

334
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,490
I'll do it myself.

335
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,910
Everyone, escort Li Ting back to camp!

336
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,480
How dare you fool me?

337
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,040
Is Li Shuang in danger?

338
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,270
What are you waiting for?

339
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,270
Attack them! Now!

340
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,000
Attack!

341
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,960
Earlier I accidentally
hit the spiritual acupoint,

342
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,620
and gained tremendous power.

343
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,400
This time, I'll try again.

344
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,770
♪ In my chest ♪

345
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,940
♪ A raging sea of fire burns ♪

We can't stay here long.

403
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,360
Let's go.

404
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,450
You go ahead,

405
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,530
I still have unfinished business.

406
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,720
I can't let Huo Du slip away.

407
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,970
It's so quiet.

408
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,680
Are they all dead?

409
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,920
Be careful, it could be a trap.

410
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,240
Go check.

411
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,040
Yes, sir!

412
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,000
Boss.

413
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,010
They're gone.

414
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,970
Follow this path down the mountain.

415
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,010
The Changfeng Army camp

416
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,450
is less than an hour away.

417
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,930
I saved your life,

418
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,050
yet you hold a knife to my throat.

419
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,680
Is this how you repay kindness?

420
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,810
I never mentioned

421
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,160
I was going to the Changfeng Army camp.

422
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,960
How did you know my destination?

423
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,500
Who exactly are you?

424
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,450
When the time is right,

425
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,830
I will tell you.

426
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,430
If you won't tell me,

427
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,070
I'll bring you back

428
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,190
and interrogate you myself.

429
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,460
You...

430
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Blood.

431
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Blood...

432
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,360
Captain.

433
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,520
Deputy General Huo,

434
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,080
he...

435
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,450
Why is it just Huo Du?

436
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,490
Where's the General?

437
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,440
You two,

438
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,070
take him in custody.

439
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,930
The rest of you,

440
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,830
follow me.

441
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,680
Yes, sir!

442
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,110
General, are you alright?

443
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,020
I'm fine.

444
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,450
Take some men up the mountain,

445
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,340
and capture all the bandits up there.

446
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,940
Remember,

447
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,310
I want them alive.

448
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,550
Yes, General.

449
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,640
Young Master has been safely returned.

450
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,960
Huo Du has been locked up

451
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,030
and is under heavy guard,

452
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,630
awaiting General's orders.

453
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,740
What about Jin'an?

454
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,830
I never expected my body

455
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,760
would have
such incredible healing power.

456
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,080
General, General.

457
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,120
General.

458
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,530
-General.
-General.

459
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,680
Jin'an.

460
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,920
I'm going to sleep.

461
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,830
If you have something to say,
let's talk tomorrow.

462
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,160
Your voice sounds strange.

463
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,360
Are you feeling unwell?

464
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,710
I'm just tired.

465
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,190
Please go back, General.

466
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,830
Let me see.

467
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,120
Why are you sleeping without clothes?

468
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,590
What are you doing?

469
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,560
I'm asking,
why are you sleeping without clothes?

470
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,430
I'm used to it.

471
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,050
But General,

472
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,230
have you ever heard of
keeping a distance between men and women?

473
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,560
This is a military camp.

474
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,130
Everyone here is a brother-in-arms.

475
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,960
Besides,

476
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,850
you're just a kid.

477
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,310
Jin'an.

478
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,070
Jin'an.

479
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,030
Tell me,

480
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,090
how did you get that mark on your back?

481
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,770
I never paid much attention to it.

482
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,440
Maybe...

483
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,750
I was born with it.

484
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,190
Do you know anyone else

485
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,600
with the same mark as you?

486
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,180
Today at the bandit stronghold,

487
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,980
I met someone.

488
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,800
He helped me escape,

489
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,720
and he had the same mark

490
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
on his back as yours.

491
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,160
What a coincidence.

492
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,490
It's such a unique mark,

493
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,450
and I've never seen it before.

494
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
But I've been seeing it a lot lately.

495
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,480
Now that I look closely,

496
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,570
you two even share

497
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,050
similar facial features.

498
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,920
Could he possibly be...

499
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
your father?

500
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,760
Then why didn't he ask me about you?

501
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,030
Did he leave you in my camp on purpose?

502
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,830
Was it because...

503
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,790
The man you're talking about,

504
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,790
I don't really know him.

505
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,120
The world is a big place,

506
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,550
it's not strange
that some people may look alike.

507
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,440
In my opinion,

508
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,390
if he risked his life to save you,

509
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,220
then maybe...

510
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,580
he meant you no harm.

511
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,280
General.

512
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:26,920
General.

513
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:27,970
Something's wrong!

514
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,030
Young Master is making a scene again.

515
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,600
You should get some rest now.

516
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,210
I'll come see you tomorrow.

517
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,990
That was so close.

518
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,510
Stay out of my way!

519
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,640
Young Master!

520
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
Stop him!

521
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,810
Get out of my way!

522
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,440
-Stop him!
-Young Master.

523
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,170
Stop him!

524
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,960
Young Master!

525
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
Let go! Stay away!

526
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,750
I don't want to stay here another day!

527
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,400
I want to go home!

528
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,440
Young Master, Young Master.

529
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,590
General hasn't returned yet,

530
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,880
we can't let you go
without her permission.

531
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
If she finds out,

532
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,310
she'll definitely get angry at us.

533
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,410
So what if she gets angry?

534
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,550
At worst she can just kill me.

535
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,550
That's what she did earlier anyway!

536
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,470
General.

537
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,710
you are finally here.

538
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,430
Why did you suddenly come to the border?

539
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,030
Did something happen in the capital?

540
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,310
It's all because of the defeat at Lucheng.

541
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,030
Father took all the blame himself

542
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,180
and is now under house arrest.

543
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,550
He had no choice

544
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,410
but to ask Muyang to escort me out.

545
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,400
How is Father doing?

546
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,920
He's doing incredibly well,

547
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,350
eating, sleeping,

548
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,630
skipping all his morning courts.

549
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,390
As for me,

550
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,680
the moment I just arrived
at this godforsaken place

551
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,880
and my dear sister shot me with an arrow.

552
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,030
If I hadn't been wearing that chest guard,

553
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,160
I'd be dead already!

554
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,510
Good thing you wore the chest guard.

555
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,390
Ting,

556
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,680
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,140
If you don't dare to kill him,

558
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,510
I'll do it myself.

559
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,710
What I did was just a strategy.

560
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,350
You should trust me.

561
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,140
After what you just said and did,

562
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,000
how can you expect me to trust you?

563
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,360
I've always treated you like real family,

564
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,120
never thought you could be so ruthless.

565
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,650
Father always favored you,

566
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,160
but I'm his biological son!

567
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,820
He took you in off the streets,

568
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,910
yet he gave you the Changfeng Army.

569
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,280
Have you captured Huo Du?

570
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,580
Yes.

571
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,770
Where are you going?

572
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,970
I'm going to kill him!

573
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,960
If it weren't for him,

574
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,240
Father wouldn't be under house arrest,

575
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,160
I wouldn't have been forced to come

576
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,960
to this godforsaken place,

577
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,620
and got kidnapped by bandits.

578
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,590
You just said you wanted him alive, right?

579
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,350
Then I'll go with them

580
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,460
and escort Huo Du back to the capital.

581
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,270
Go ahead.

582
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,030
This journey will be challenging.

583
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,830
There might be

584
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,460
more bandits and outlaws,

585
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,920
or Huo Du's remaining men.

586
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,800
Since you want
to command the Changfeng Army,

587
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,130
this is your best chance

588
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,780
to earn some credit.

589
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,010
Shuang, you think I can't do it?

590
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,630
Do you know why Father

591
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,830
never taught you to lead the troops?

592
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,290
Because you're impulsive

593
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,200
and arrogant.

594
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,680
So in your eyes,

595
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,110
I'm completely useless?

596
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,480
Right,

597
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,000
you're meticulous,

598
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,550
and Father is brave and mighty.

599
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,270
So what?

600
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,400
In the end,
there was still a traitor in the army,

601
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,550
and he still got punished by His Majesty.

602
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,000
You!

603
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,960
If you're that capable,

604
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,050
then go ahead, do it again.

605
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,380
Stab me rght here!

606
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,930
This time, I'm not wearing a chest guard.

607
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,520
Do it!

608
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,120
General.

609
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,150
Why didn't you report

610
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,510
before entering?

611
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,620
I heard you
and the Young Master were arguing.

612
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,810
I was worried, so I came to check on you.

613
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,100
I acted rashly.

614
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
Please forgive me, General.

615
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,310
Tonight,

616
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,580
you intercepted key evidence
of Huo Du's treason,

617
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,910
so you deserve a reward.

618
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,240
Thank you, General.

619
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,320
He's just a low-ranking soldier,

620
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,090
and you treat him with kindness.

621
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,590
But when it comes to me,
it's always scolding.

622
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,750
So in your eyes,

623
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,920
am I worse than him?

624
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
That's right.

625
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,880
The Changfeng Army
has no place for idlers.

626
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,940
I only value people

627
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,180
with real talent.

628
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,130
He's just a kid.

629
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,060
If he's wrong,
you should teach him a lesson.

630
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,410
Why are you reluctant to discipline him?

631
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
You're a kid too.

632
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,070
There are things

633
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,720
you don't understand yet.

634
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,550
Being young

635
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,150
doesn't mean we don't feel things.

636
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,219
If you truly despised him

637
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,489
as you said,

638
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,330
you wouldn't have
risked your life to save him.

639
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,380
I understand this,

640
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,540
and so does he.

641
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,440
It's just that, sometimes,
the closer you are to someone,

642
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,400
it's hard

643
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,090
to say how you really feel.

644
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,480
I see.

645
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,060
You may go now.

646
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,429
What's wrong?

647
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,889
It's burning up.

648
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,760
Help!

649
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,810
Fetch the army physician!
