[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,940
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,960
I was so immature before.

4
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,140
Big Brother, thanks to

5
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,310
your guidance yesterday,

6
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,759
I've got it all straight now.

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,620
"Big Brother"?

8
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,680
I've heard everything.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,920
That day when Huo Du held me hostage,

10
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,690
it was you who risked your life

11
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,570
to save me.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,750
Big Brother, your kindness

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,870
saved both my life and soul.

14
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,870
I'm here today

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,840
in the hope of becoming

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,590
sworn brothers with you.

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,610
I appreciate it.

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,100
But there's no need to.

19
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,410
Ever since I was little,

20
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,430
despite how my father and sister

21
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,750
cared about me,

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,329
they've never really talked to me kindly.

23
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,470
They always speak harshly,

24
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,960
making the home feel unwelcoming.

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,880
But after our conversation yesterday,

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,800
I finally felt a bit of warmth.

27
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,310
You and Li Shuang

28
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,470
are siblings.

29
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,590
If we become sworn brothers,

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,890
then she and I...

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,360
What does our brotherhood
have to do with her?

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
Besides, I'm absolutely honest

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,630
with my brothers.

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,520
If you're interested in my sister,

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,120
feel free to ask me anything.

36
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,590
Come on, brother.

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,840
Heaven above and Earth below,

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
please be our witnesses.

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,150
Today,

40
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,310
I, Li Ting,

41
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,530
and Jin'an

42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,520
solemnly swear brotherhood.

43
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,590
From now on, we'll

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,680
respect and care for each other,

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,810
never parting ways.

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,470
Big Brother,

47
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,570
let me drink to you.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
From today on,

49
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,690
I can finally say I have a family.

50
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,870
By the way,

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,940
I want to ask about your sister...

52
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,940
Fairy Physician's medicine

53
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,399
is incredibly effective.

54
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,320
You're really something.

55
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,770
This medicine is very potent,

56
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,670
yet you've come around so fast.

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,740
Where are we going?

58
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,200
We're heading back to the capital.

59
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,650
You went through all this trouble

60
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,650
just to take me back to the capital?

61
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,250
Although you saved my life,

62
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,770
you're still the murderer
who killed Huo Du.

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,720
I don't know why Shuang

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,580
is being so indecisive this time.

65
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,510
But I know

66
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,390
only by handing you over to the court

67
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,750
can we quell
His Majesty's suspicions of the Li family

68
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,150
and the Changfeng Army.

69
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,470
Some matters take priority.

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,690
Big Brother, I'll repay

71
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,840
your favor in the next life.

72
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,790
You've seen it clearly?

73
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,159
That shadow puppet

74
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,480
was indeed in a coma.

75
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,440
That young man from the Li family

76
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,150
smuggled him
out of the General's Residence.

77
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,070
The two of them

78
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,020
are now on their way to the capital.

79
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,510
Master,

80
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,159
you once said

81
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,530
that shadow puppets
should be immune to all poisons.

82
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,650
According to this,

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,020
no knockout drug is supposed
to work on him.

84
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,680
But given today's situation,

85
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,070
something's fishy about it.

86
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,360
Seems like

87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Jade Linglong hasn't smoothly integrated

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,870
into the shadow puppet's body,

89
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,160
making his power

90
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680
unstable and beyond his control.

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,310
Moreover,

92
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,070
in the stone chamber and secret forest,

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,870
he recklessly used his power,

94
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,800
causing severe damage.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,430
If he hasn't been nourished

96
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,430
by the blood master's blood in time,

97
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,750
then he should be

98
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,270
at his weakest right now.

99
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,830
In this case,

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,330
isn't it like
luck is on your side, Master?

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,310
I'm serious.

102
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,630
The trap was real,

103
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,370
but so was our sworn brotherhood.

104
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,190
As those six incense sticks burned out,

105
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,050
our oath has reached the heavens.

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,980
This time, I betrayed your trust.

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Whatever the consequences,

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,830
I'm willing to bear them alone.

109
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,030
If you really see me as your Big Brother,

110
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,240
then please hear me out.

111
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,390
I never intended to shirk responsibility

112
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,120
for what happened to Huo Du.

113
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,970
Right now,
I can't leave your sister at will,

114
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,680
or my life would be in danger.

115
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,390
If I die on the way,

116
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,290
your Li family would only face

117
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,390
more accusations with no way
to defend yourselves.

118
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,270
Nonsense!

119
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,430
What do you mean you can't leave her?

120
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,800
Even though you're my Big Brother,

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,460
I can't let you
tarnish my sister's reputation.

122
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,390
If you're going to act,
at least make it convincing.

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,050
Who are you?

124
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,170
How dare you block
the Li family's carriage?

125
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,100
A silver needle?

126
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,280
You're the ones who stirred up trouble
in the military camp!

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,790
As expected of a shadow puppet.

128
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,450
You're really quick-witted.

129
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,360
Leave now.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,950
If you die,

131
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,710
the Li family is done for.

132
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,590
Last time, I failed to transform

133
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,790
and lost all my power.

134
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,190
But that day,
under the flowering tree with Li Shuang,

135
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,320
my wounds miraculously healed again.

136
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,289
Now with life hanging by a thread,

137
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,250
no matter what,

138
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,750
I have to try.

139
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,880
No matter what happens later,

140
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,789
I won't hurt you.

141
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,650
Don't tell your sister

142
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,680
about what happened today.

143
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,840
A-Are you

144
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,140
a demon or a god?

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,750
Don't be afraid.

146
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,010
Why should I be afraid?

147
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,600
I can't admire you more.

148
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,260
Had I known you were this powerful,

149
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,600
I wouldn't just call you Big Brother.

150
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
I'd worship you as my god.

151
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,970
G-Give me a punch.

152
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,550
Transformation is something

153
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,080
that comes from within.

154
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,560
It's still treacherous here.

155
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,670
Let's return
to the General's Residence first.

156
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,200
Okay.

157
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,030
Let's go.

158
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,630
How did you get changed just now?

159
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,430
Want to learn?

160
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
Both of them are missing?

161
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,900
Have you searched carefully?

162
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,050
We've searched everywhere.

163
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,270
But they're still nowhere to be found.

164
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,150
He must have been

165
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,910
taken away by the Young Master.

166
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,320
It was my negligence.

167
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,160
Please punish me, General.

168
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,440
Both of them?

169
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,550
Both of them.

170
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,510
Could it be...

171
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,080
Bring our men

172
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,840
and go after them with me!

173
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,640
Don't bother.

174
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,270
I've already brought him back.

175
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,590
He's in the side room.

176
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,320
Sorry, I was wrong.

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
We have failed your trust, Master.

178
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,910
We're willing to accept harsh punishment.

179
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,310
We're willing to accept harsh punishment.

180
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,560
Master.

181
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,910
Jade Linglong entered
his body by accident.

182
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,120
He's not a perfect shadow puppet.

183
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,980
Yet he can control such formidable power.

184
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,800
It must be his growing intimacy
with the blood master

185
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,140
that has allowed Jade Linglong

186
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,070
to merge with him even better.

187
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,620
Seems like it's not a good idea

188
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,840
to seize it by force.

189
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,460
You took Jin'an away without permission

190
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,800
to hand him over to the court

191
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,270
and save our father.

192
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,240
But Jin'an saved your life.

193
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,570
If something happened to him,

194
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
you'd bear all consequences

195
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,630
by yourself,

196
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,680
even at the cost of your life,

197
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,940
right?

198
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,170
How could you put yourself in danger
with no regard for your own safety?

199
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,950
It was dangerous, and that was exactly why

200
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,070
I must do it.

201
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,580
Father is imprisoned,

202
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,870
and you, Shuang, are constantly on alert,

203
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,010
unable to rest well at night.

204
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,320
As Young Master Li,

205
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,320
how could I stand by and do nothing?

206
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,970
I just wanted to do something for you all.

207
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm just glad to see you back
safe and sound.

208
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,200
Shuang,

209
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
aren't you going to scold me?

210
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,440
Ting.

211
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,890
You've grown up.

212
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,940
I'm very happy about that.

213
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,720
But some things

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,860
aren't as simple as you think.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Now His Majesty

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,330
is wary of our Li family.

217
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Our future is dim.

218
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,430
It's not something you can solve
by mere audacity.

219
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,120
Besides,

220
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,100
Father sent you to Lucheng

221
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,550
so that I could protect you.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,930
If something were to happen to you,

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
I would fail Father's entrustment.

224
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,840
Since I was little,

225
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,450
no matter what happened in our family,

226
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,480
you and Father
have always kept it secret from me.

227
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,790
I understand

228
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,550
that you both want to protect me.

229
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,530
But I'm also a member
of the honorable Li family.

230
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,390
I don't want to be a useless loser,

231
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,800
living under the protection

232
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,910
of you and Father throughout my life.

233
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,960
Ting.

234
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,170
In my heart,

235
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,960
you've always been that little boy

236
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,470
following me

237
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,760
and asking for candy.

238
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,390
I forgot

239
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,270
that you've grown up

240
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,240
into a real man.

241
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,720
That's my fault.

242
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,550
I know

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm still not full-fledged yet.

244
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,870
But someday,

245
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,750
I'll be as strong

246
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,020
and capable as you,

247
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,410
protecting our state and people.

248
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,210
When that day comes,

249
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,150
Shuang, you can live

250
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,000
for yourself

251
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,110
the way you like it.

252
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,510
Okay.

253
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,080
Good!

254
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,480
Stop crying.

255
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,360
Stop.

256
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,540
Do your knees hurt?

257
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,120
Nope.

258
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,960
Really?

259
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,750
Then give me a smile if it doesn't hurt.

260
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,320
Why should I?

261
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,790
Just give me a smile. Come on.

262
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,480
Who cries and smiles at the same time?

263
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,870
So I'm your big sister.

264
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,040
I said, smile.

265
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,630
You're annoying.

266
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,150
-Give me a smile!
-Don't touch me.

267
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,670
I'm leaving!

268
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,720
Stop there!

269
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,890
Leave me alone!

270
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,240
Stop chasing me!

271
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,870
I said, stop!

272
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,510
No!

273
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,630
I won't stop!

274
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,510
Stop there!

275
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,150
Li Ting!

276
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,870
That's enough.

277
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,000
Just smile.

278
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,870
So annoying.

279
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,550
Is it so hard to smile?

280
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,640
Li Ting?

281
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,710
Given Ting's stubborn character,

282
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,510
he wouldn't change his mind easily.

283
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
Did you persuade him?

284
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,080
He's not as unreasonable

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
as you think.

286
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,150
He acted on impulse today

287
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
and offended you.

288
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,610
I hope you can forgive him.

289
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,910
Also,

290
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,160
you were right.

291
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
Some things, if not said,

292
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
will never be heard.

293
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,800
Thank you.

294
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,010
Esteemed Immortal,

295
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,800
please forgive us
for not greeting you sooner.

296
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,150
I'm just a medicine deliverer,

297
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,210
not some immortal.

298
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,830
Thank you
for the medicine from Wuling Mountain.

299
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,980
Immortal,

300
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,720
are there
any special instructions this time?

301
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
Just take it. That's all.

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,160
Your Highness,

303
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
everything has been arranged.

304
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,950
Please rest assured.

305
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,810
Were it not for Father's obsession
with immortality

306
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,870
and his desperate search for elixir,

307
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,620
we wouldn't have gotten this opportunity.

308
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,690
After taking the medicine, His Majesty

309
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,770
appears more energetic,

310
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
but his health deteriorates day by day.

311
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,830
The imperial physicians

312
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,760
would never figure out the reason.

313
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,080
Control the dosage carefully.

314
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,920
I need my dear younger brother

315
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,670
to die before Father does.

[The Imperial Palace of Taijin]

317
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,070
By order of His Majesty,

318
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,650
[Xianyang Palace]

319
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,310
the court is dismissed today.

320
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,750
Your Excellencies,

321
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,200
you may leave.

322
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,790
I've heard

323
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,310
about the Crown Prince
attending to Father frequently

324
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,570
with great diligence.

325
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,270
No wonder Father
has started seeking your counsel.

326
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,030
You're quite the actor,

327
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
good at winning people over.

328
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,690
Brother, you've got me wrong.

329
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
I know

330
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,720
I cannot ease Father's burdens,

331
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,590
so all I can do is

332
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,760
attend to him by his side

333
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,040
to show my care.

334
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,160
Is that so?

335
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
Then why did you use
your audience with Father

336
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,590
to constantly speak up

337
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,030
for the Li family?

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,720
Brother,

339
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
your concern for the state

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
and fear of the Li family's military power
overshadowing the throne

341
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,270
are understandable.

342
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,790
But you shouldn't

343
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,810
fixate on persecuting the Li family

344
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,140
and constantly make things hard for them.

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The entire Li family

346
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,330
is devoted to our state.

347
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,070
Your actions

348
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,470
will only discourage

349
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,640
the loyalty of our subjects.

350
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,240
Just because you're the Crown Prince

351
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,440
doesn't mean you can ascend the throne.

352
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,990
You're a cripple.

353
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,770
Let me see how long your glory can last.

What are you doing?

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,250
That's the third plate?

358
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,200
It's all your fault!

359
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,240
You must make it up to me!

360
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,110
Make up for my pastries!

361
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,790
If you want pastries,
have someone else make them.

362
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,250
Why go to all this trouble?

363
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,940
Why did you put
so much charcoal in the pot?

364
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,110
Stop talking nonsense.

365
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,510
You know nothing.

366
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
These are
Shuang's favorite pear-blossom pastries.

367
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,020
Your sister likes these?

368

Before I leave,

370
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,430
I should do something for her

371
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,200
to make amends.

372
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,550
Leave?

373
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,630
Yes,

Even if I can't do much,

378
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,550
I should stay by my father's side

379
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,880
through thick and thin.

380
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,770
I'm sorry for what I did

381
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,750
to you.

382
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,750
I once thought

383
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,720
that for the greater good,

384
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,200
I could disregard everything else.

385
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,400
But how can it be called the greater good

386
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,530
if it means
sacrificing the lives of others?

387
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,050
You've saved me twice.

388
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,040
I'll definitely

389
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,470
repay your favor one day.

390
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,720
Okay.

391
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,920
I'll wait for that day to come.

392
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,840
But before that, you should

393
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,200
promise me something.

394
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
Haven't you got this backwards?

395
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
Aren't you supposed to repay me?

396
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,920
I don't care.

397
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,070
You boast exceptional martial skills
and supernatural strength.

398
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,350
If Shuang ever encounters any danger,

399
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,440
you must do everything in your power
to protect her

400
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,270
and make sure she doesn't get hurt.

401
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,200
Otherwise,

402
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,140
I'll widely

403
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,170
spread the word about your secrets!

404
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,680
Your sister is a general after all.

405
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,280
She can take care of herself.

406
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,340
Father has always been stern.

407
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,640
Since childhood,

408
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,000
be it studying or training,

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,200
she's never been allowed
to slack off for a bit.

410
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,350
Shuang never had the chance

411
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,830
to be pampered or spoiled

412
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,290
like other young ladies.

413
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,480
She was taught from childhood

414
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,440
to spare no effort to protect

415
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
everyone and everything around her.

416
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,030
But no one has ever told her

417
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,750
that she could also be protected.

418
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,160
Shuang

419
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,070
once had a chance

420
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,960
to be cared for by someone.

421
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,270
Unfortunately,

422
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,720
fate played a cruel trick,

423
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,980
and she and Muyang ended up splitting up.

424
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,110
Muyang?

425
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,970
The Crown Prince,

426
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,920
Su Muyang.

427
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,750
He and Shuang grew up together

428
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,720
as childhood sweethearts

429
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,830
with unwavering feelings

430
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,640
deeper than any ordinary ones.

431
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,790
Then why didn't he

432
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,770
come to your sister in person?

433
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,000
He

434
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,790
certainly has his reasons.

435
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,590
Anyway,
Muyang treats my sister really well.

436
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,460
They've been apart for three years,

437
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,130
but he misses her every day.

438
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,950
If so,

439
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,040
why did they split up?

440
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,060
He obeyed His Majesty's order

441
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,750
and married someone else.

442
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,270
But

443
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,480
Muyang also had no choice.

444
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,590
Besides,

445
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,010
knowing my sister's love for biographies,
he's sent people

446
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,740
to search for them everywhere.

447
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,100
Why are you laughing?

448
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,470
It should be a piece of cake

449
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,720
for him, the Crown Prince,

450
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,520
to get some biographies, right?

451
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,750
Also, forget about

452
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,920
his talk of missing her.

453
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,000
Everyone can say

454
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,550
such sweet words.

455
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,830
In my opinion,

456
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,480
truly caring for someone

457
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,210
is more like what you're doing.

458
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
Despite your incompetence,

459
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,590
you're showing genuine care.

460
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,200
We're willing to give our all

461
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,460
for those we hold dear.

462
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,980
Even if I'm genuinely caring for her,

463
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,610
what's the point if I can't do it well?

464
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,350
Whether it works or not

465
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,480
is beside the point.

466
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,850
The sun is about to set.

467
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,790
If you still can't pull it off,

468
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,950
Shuang might lose her appetite.

469
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,880
Are you going to help me?

470
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,350
Didn't you ask me to make up
for your pastries?

471
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,000
Besides,

472
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,440
you can consider this

473
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,500
the condition for keeping my secret.

474
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,510
What brings you here?

475
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,240
Li Ting sent me over.

476
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,830
He also had me bring you

477
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,030
your favorite pear-blossom pastries.

478
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,000
Where is he?

479
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,880
He got shy,

480
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,140
saying it was too mushy

481
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,970
and too embarrassing to come.

482
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,960
Did he make these?

483
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,400
Of course
they didn't look like this at first.

484
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,110
I followed his recipe

485
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,750
and made some adjustments.

486
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,030
Try them and see

487
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,090
if they taste good.

488
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,250
Also, here are

489
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,160
some biographies
Li Ting asked me to give you.

490
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,880
He said

491
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,400
Muyang

492
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
entrusted him to pass them on to you.

493
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,400
Li Ting really has a big mouth,

494
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,130
spilling everything he knows.

495
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,750
Since you two share such a deep bond,

496
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,640
then

497
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,080
why didn't you stick it out till the end?

498
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,790
Perhaps

499
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,850
you would've ended up a loving couple.

500
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,650
Life rarely offers perfect endings.

501
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,070
I was an orphan.

502
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,640
My father brought me
back to the General's Residence.

503
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,970
Only then did I get
a new identity and name.

504
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,550
Besides,

505
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,880
a war is about ot break out
between Taijin and Yao State.

506
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,080
I have no mind to think of anything else.

507
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,750
You once said

508
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,530
you couldn't leave me.

509
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,070
If you truly want to stay,

510
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,150
you have no choice
but to get dragged into this mess.

511
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,950
The battlefield shows no mercy.

512
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,770
Are you sure about this?

513
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,520
You're willing to keep me here?

514
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,080
Since I can't leave you,

515
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,800
actually,

516
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,760
I've long been ready for this.

517
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,510
No matter what happens,

518
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,070
I swear I will protect you.

519
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,640
I think

520
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,230
you remind me of someone.

521
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,550
Get some rest early.

522
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,890
[Xianyang Palace]

523
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
Father,

524
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
the case of Huo Du

525
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,310
has been open for over a month.

526
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,110
But Li Shuang

527
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,270
still hasn't turned in the person

528
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,270
who killed Huo Du.

529
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,350
I'm afraid

530
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,070
there's more behind it.

531
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,680
Prince Li, please speak with caution!

532
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Your Majesty,

533
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,720
Li Shuang's thoroughly investigated
Huo Du's remaining accomplices.

534
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,030
Huo Du secretly colluded with Yao State.

535
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,270
There's solid evidence for it.

536
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,750
And Li Shuang already used fake maps

537
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,400
to lure the enemy
deep into the trap at the border

538
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,590
and defeated the Yao Army.

539
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,050
But Father, the matter of accomplices
cannot be proven as the suspects are dead.

540
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Your Majesty,

541
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,200
the Li family
has guarded the border for years

542
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,060
and would never dare deceive you.

543
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,650
Father, I'd like to report to you

544
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,680
the recent memorials

545
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
from numerous imperial censors,

546
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,020
all impeaching Li Shuang for deceiving

547
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,870
the court, colluding with Yao State,
and framing loyal officials,

548
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,550
with the intention

549
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,440
of exonerating her father, Li Wei.

550
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,550
I believe

551
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,030
it's imperative and urgent to send
Imperial Censor Li Zhangyi to Lucheng

552
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,430
as a Military Supervisor

553
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,920
to conduct a thorough investigation.

554
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,350
By my decree,

555
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,880
Li Zhangyi shall

556
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,310
head for the border immediately

557
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,400
and take over as Military Supervisor
of the Changfeng Army.

558
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

559
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,210
Father, you are so wise.

560
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,330
[General's Residence]

561
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,520
Go back and tell Father

562
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,910
that everything is fine here.

563
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,110
Tell him not to worry.

564
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,900
Father and I can definitely do better

565
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,300
in the capital than here.

566
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,110
And Muyang will be taking care of us.

567
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,440
So don't worry, Shuang.

568
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,030
But you're

569
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,720
far away at the border,

570
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,270
always sharing good news, never the bad.

571
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,160
Remember,

572
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,010
we all worry about you.

573
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,450
I'll take good care of myself.

574
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,070
Well,

575
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm such a burden. Now that I'm leaving,

576
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,370
will you feel more at ease, Shuang?

577
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,720
You're not a burden.

578
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,110
You're my weakness.

579
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,980
I'll be going then.

580
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,810
Have a safe trip.

581
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,130
Big Brother.

582
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,080
This is the recipe
for pear-blossom pastry.

583
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,610
If my sister gets homesick,

584
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,230
please make some for her.

585
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,160
Also,

586
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,700
remember

587
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,120
that you've promised me

588
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
to protect her well.

589
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,290
Thank you, Big Brother.

590
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,610
Don't worry.

591
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,920
Have a safe journey.

592
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,470
I'll be waiting for you in the capital.

593
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,730
Be careful on your way!

594
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,540
"Big Brother"?

595
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,590
When did you two become so close?

596
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,270
Before he headed
back to the capital last time,

597
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,730
we became sworn brothers.

598
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,870
He was the first friend

599
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,210
I made after losing my memory.

600
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,660
I'll remember him forever.

601
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,160
Why are you laughing?

602
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
I'm laughing because you don't know

603
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,480
how long "forever" actually is.

604
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,590
Indeed.

605
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,810
Perhaps in the past, I also thought

606
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,990
there would be many things

607
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,720
I'd remember forever and ever.

608
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,320
General,

609
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,310
I've finished investigating.

610
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,350
The Ninglan Commercial Guild Master

611
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,160
is called Zang Budu.

612
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,070
Zang Budu

613
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,640
has dominated this area for years

614
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,720
with a very high reputation,

615
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,270
but...

616
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,400
But in recent years,

617
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,640
Ninglan

618
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,550
has been caught between the two states,

619
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,810
forming its own force.

620
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,890
He must be difficult to deal with.

621
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,690
The Yao Army is on the move now.

622
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,920
The area around Lucheng is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

623
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,180
To gain the upper hand,

624
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,510
Ninglan

625
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
is the key.

626
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,110
General, do you intend

627
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,440
to get the map of Ninglan

628
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,680
from Zang Budu?

629
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,750
In this case,

630
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,310
we should bring more troops

631
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,970
to prepare for any accidents.

632
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,550
If we have spies,

633
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,550
the Yao Army can have theirs too.

634
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,770
This time when we go,

635
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,250
we must keep a low profile.

636
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,350
You're right, General.

637
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,920
Then I'll go pack my things

638
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,440
to go with you, General.

639
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,650
No need for that.

640
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,070
I have

641
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,570
other plans this time.

642
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,580
Go prepare something for me.

643
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,350
You're taking me to Ninglan?

644
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,720
Ninglan

645
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,680
is located at the junction
of Taijin and Yao State.

646
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,080
Though it's a small town,

647
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,440
it's still a commercial hub
of great importance.

648
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,270
Therefore,

649
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,320
it's bustling and crowded

650
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,720
with all sorts of people.

651
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,480
We must be very careful
during our stay there

652
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,030
and avoid causing any trouble.

653
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,830
Understand?

654
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,700
Why are you so happy?

655
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,320
It's clearly official business,

656
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,950
yet you insist on bringing me along,
an unrelated person.

657
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,200
You must fear
that the long distance between us

658
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,040
would cause me

659
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,110
to suffer great pain, right?

660
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,890
You must've

661
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,510
thought about me

662
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,970
out of concern, right?

663
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,570
You talk too much.

664
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,380
Hold on.

665
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,850
I carefully selected this.

666
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,100
It's for you.

667
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,040
You look quite idle!

668
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,880
Go to the backyard

669
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,210
and chop some firewood.

670
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,850
How can you be so unreasonable?

671
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,449
In the General's Residence,

672
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,360
I call the shots.

673
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,429
Yes,

674
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,630
General.

675
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,770
Did you get shy just now?

676
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,950
On my way to chop wood.

677
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,170
Is everything packed and ready?

678
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,920
Thank you for your care, Your Highness.

679
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,470
[Li Zhangyi,
Military Supervisor of Taijin]

680
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,630
Everything has been arranged properly.

681
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,840
We can set off early tomorrow morning.

682
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,280
I will not

683
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,960
disappoint you
on this mission, Your Highness.

684
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,960
I have given the Li family

685
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,070
so many chances, both openly and secretly.

686
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,730
Not only did they ignore them,

687
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,380
but they also secretly joined
Su Muyang's clique.

688
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,050
This time,

689
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,240
I'll definitely teach them a lesson.

690
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,370
Yes, Your Highness.

691
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,490
By all rights,

692
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,030
you are His Majesty's eldest son, versed

693
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,130
in both literature and military affairs,
respected by all officials.

694
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,530
Everyone expected you

695
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,760
to succeed the throne.

696
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,190
Yet three years ago,
when His Majesty named his heir,

697
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,230
why did he choose Su Muyang instead?

698
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,510
Father must have

699
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,240
his reasons for doing this.

700
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,980
Yes.

701
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,190
Besides,

702
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,500
there's no telling

703
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,690
if a cripple
can secure his position as Crown Prince.

704
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,400
Remember,

705
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,440
during your stay in Lucheng,

706
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,680
you should both show mercy
and put pressure.

707
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,920
If Li Shuang insists
on not changing her mind,

708
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,630
then...

709
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,130
Yes, Your Highness.
