00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,250
[General's Residence]

4
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,200
By the General's command,

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,590
we must ensure the Crown Prince's safety.

6
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,320
Understood!

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,210
Such a big fuss just to walk a few steps
from the carriage.

8
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,040
How bold!

9
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,870
How dare you not kneel
before the Crown Prince!

10
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,079
His Highness said there's no need

11
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,820
for formalities.

12
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,310
You!

13
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,100
Huai'en.

14
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,640
We had never met before.

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Why do you show me such hostility

16
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,240
every time I see you?

17
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,730
The General was wounded because of you,

18
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,860
and you're only feeling my hostility.

19
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,750
I'm already going easy on you.

20
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,560
Insolent!

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,710
His Highness risked his precious life

22
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,710
taking a blow meant for General Li

23
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,360
and got a graver wound!

24
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
I don't care.

25
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:04,960
I serve only the General.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,550
I only care about her safety.

27
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,280
Your loyalty to Shuang is impressive.

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,190
I'm pleased to see it.

29
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,320
I heard that you killed the spy, Huo Du.

30
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,250
Is that true?

31
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,470
What?

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
Are you looking for an excuse

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,360
to punish me?

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
As sinful as Huo Du was,

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
he deserved death.

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,820
I'm rewarding the troops,

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,900
and you deserve a reward, too.

38
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,500
Huai'en.

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,870
Come in!

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,680
It's all nice stuff.

41
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,570
Is that all?

42
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,360
That's fine.

43
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,470
Sir, please

44
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
tell all the ladies in the residence

45
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,640
that these items

46
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,870
are distributed to them.

47
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,750
If they don't like

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,910
these extravagant things,

49
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,280
they can trade them for weapons

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,610
to keep for themselves.

51
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,800
They're rewarded by His Highness!

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,000
You...

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,380
The things His Highness gave me

54
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,750
should be mine to dispose of, right?

55
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,120
I...

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,800
Huai'en,

57
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
Jin'an has lost his memory

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,840
and forgotten most of the etiquette.

59
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,100
We should be tolerant.

60
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes, Your Highness.

61
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,870
How did you know I lost my memory?

62
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,480
Someone

63
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,430
told me, of course.

64
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,490
Shuang?

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,970
This afternoon,

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,300
I'm going fishing.

67
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,190
Would you like to join me?

68
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,630
It's been a while
since I went fishing last time.

69
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,720
I remember

70
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,800
Shuang loved eating the fish
I caught for her.

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,650
She loves fish?

72
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,430
I didn't expect such picturesque scenery

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,000
in this border region,

74
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,840
let alone such substantial fish catches.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,990
I wonder if Shuang

76
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,330
has ever visited here.

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,370
I'm surprised

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,440
at your leisurely mood, Your Highness.

79
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,830
I thought you'd be busy
with state affairs.

80
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,120
Should I call you

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
a jack of all trades

82
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,360
or

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,830
simply an idle man?

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,950
Everyone has their own place
in this world.

85
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,420
It's like
how Shuang has so many people around her,

86
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,350
each eager to serve her devotedly.

87
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,470
But if she doesn't need them,

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
getting too close

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,380
would only cause trouble.

90
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,120
Despite the abundant fish,

91
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
the amazing scenery,

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,510
and such a lovely day,

93
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
no one else is

94
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,040
fishing here other than us.

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,120
Do you know why, Your Highness?

96
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,870
Because these fish

97
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,430
have struggled to reach this clean water.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,070
Day after day,

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,680
they've grown accustomed to this life.

100
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,480
One more

101
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,720
or one less,

102
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,680
and their balance would be disrupted.

103
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,190
The fish understand this,

104
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,320
and so does everyone

105
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,400
but you,

106
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,480
Your Highness.

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,430
See?

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,460
No matter how you mess around,

109
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,680
what's meant to be mine

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,210
will eventually come to me.

111
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,720
It's a hectic day in the army today.

112
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,440
Shuang will surely return late.

113
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,780
Dining alone would be rather dull for me.

114
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,750
Would you like

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,680
to join me

116
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,290
for a drink tonight?

117
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
What do you think?

118
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,850
I'm also quite busy.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,670
I've grown up with Shuang.

120
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,950
I treat her friends

121
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,130
as my own.

122
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,350
Besides,

123
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,390
she's been straightforward
since childhood.

124
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,680
She must've offended you

125
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,280
quite a bit during this time.

126
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,950
I'd like to apologize

127
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,950
on her behalf.

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,940
That's not necessary.

129
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,950
Your Highness, you don't know me well.

130
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,000
I actually like women
who are candid and straightforward.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,560
Whatever Shuang says to me,

132
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,790
I take it with pleasure.

133
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,680
Let's set

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,610
these fish free.

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Your Highness,
since you know Shuang so well,

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,570
you must know

137
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,170
she has a benevolent heart.

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,040
She'd surely

139
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
want these fish to return home, too.

[Sixu Clinic]

141
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,120
What on earth are you doing?

142
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,830
You've been acting weird
since you walked in,

143
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,560
almost messing up all my herbs.

144
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,430
Today, I caught

145
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,030
an unusual medicine scent
on the Crown Prince.

146
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,549
The medicine he's been using lately
doesn't smell like that.

147
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,200
So

148
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,679
I came here to check.

149
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,000
What unusual medicine scent?

150
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,510
There are only a few types
of external wound medicines.

151
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,170
You must've smelled it wrong.

152
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,750
What you smelled

153
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,280
was probably the special wound medicine
I prescribed.

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
Shuang asked me for it.

155
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,840
Of course I'd give it to her.

156
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
Don't be jealous.

157
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,220
His Highness took that hit for her anyway.

158
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,780
Show me.

159
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,000
Give it to me.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,910
It's not this one.

161
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,320
What do you mean?

162
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,720
I think you're just too jealous

163
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,870
to have your nose function properly.

164
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,930
Wait, why are you all siding with him?

165
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
He invited me to fish today,

166
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
acting arrogant and showing off.

167
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,630
It was irritating just to watch.

168
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,790
And now,

169
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,970
even you're backing him up.

170
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,550
When did I back him up?

171
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,190
I just did what a physician should do.

172
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,480
What's there to be upset about?

173
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,960
Isn't Shuang's feelings what matters most?

174
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,910
As a physician,

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,300
you should be fair.

176
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,940
I don't care!

177
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,820
Whatever medicine he gets,

178
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,640
I want it, too.

179
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,320
Are you insane?

180
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,300
Why take medicine
when there's nothing wrong with you?

181
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,920
Does poor alcohol tolerance
count as an illness?

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,630
Pardon?

183
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,150
The Crown Prince
invited me for drinks tonight.

184
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,950
You know what a lightweight I am.

185
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,240
He's already beaten me in fishing today.

186
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,700
I can't lose a second time.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,390
It's a matter of pride,

188
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,240
so please help me.

189
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,570
Do you have any medicine

190
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,820
that can prevent me from getting drunk?

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,120
Are all you men this childish?

192
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,450
I don't know whose side you're on.

193
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,550
Are you still my friend?

194
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,800
I do have something.

195
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,770
Something to keep you from getting drunk.

196
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,530
Nanxing.

197
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,390
Get me my medicine box.

198
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,720
Isn't that the medicine
for growing beards?

199
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,240
I'm still looking for it.

200
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,570
What's the rush?

201
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,570
Does this really work?

202
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,050
One packet will help you handle one catty.

203
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,910
It smells pretty potent.

204
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,270
Give me two more packets.

205
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,800
But still drink less, okay?

206
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,360
Lu Xin.

207
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,550
Thank you.

208
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,010
My good friend.

209
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,910
Good

210
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,240
friend.

211
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,930
Don't drink too much! Okay?

212
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,270
Boss.

213
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,550
Isn't that just digestive Xiaoyao Pills?

214
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,800
How can that keep someone
from getting drunk?

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,040
I had to find some way to send him off,

216
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,200
or he'd have kept messing around.

217
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,110
Never get drunk...

218
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,790
If he believes he can stay sober,

219
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,150
then he won't get drunk.

220
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,790
It's a psychological trick,

221
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,390
you know?

222
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Awesome, Boss.

223
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,030
I merely invited you
for a few drinks together.

224
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,690
But judging by your attitude,

225
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,020
you seem ready for a drinking contest.

226
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,070
We've only met a few times,

227
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,960
and we didn't hit it off.

228
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,710
So what's there to drink about?

229
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,390
If I'm not mistaken,

230
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,320
you want to play

231
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,720
the same trick
as when we were fishing today,

232
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,050
beating around the bush

233
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,910
and jeering at me, right?

234
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,950
You're not only smart

235
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,560
but also straightforward.

236
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,480
You're close to Li Shuang.

237
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,080
You have her full trust,

238
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
but not mine.

239
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,600
Besides,

240
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
your identity remains unclear,

241
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,170
and you claim to have lost your memory.

242
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,390
Who knows

243
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,940
if you're after something

244
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,100
from her?

245
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,600
My devotion to Shuang

246
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,860
is self-evident.

247
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,690
It's not your place to question it.

248
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,330
No matter how much
she loved fishing before,

249
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,200
that was back then.

250
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,000
No matter how skilled you are,

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,130
it's all pointless.

252
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,910
Three years have passed.

253
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,750
Things remain,

254
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,000
but people have changed.

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,470
She's into drinking now.

256
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
If you want to win against me,

257
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,630
you should cater to her current interests.

258
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,480
Seems like

259
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,030
you're quite confident.

260
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,870
But I remember

261
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,840
when you drink,

262
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,740
your face appears quite twisted,
doesn't it?

263
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,830
I simply have

264
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,370
a sharper sense of smell.

265
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,000
Come on.

266
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,480
Fill it up.

267
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,180
We use bowls.

268
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,330
Good wine!

269
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,250
Are you drunk?

270
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,010
I'm alright.

271
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,750
Good,

272
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,270
that's good.

273
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,770
Good wine!

274
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,270
One more.

275
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,840
Good wine.

276
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,530
Why do these grapes look like this?

277
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,910
Why isn't the fish swimming?

278
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,030
Are you

279
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,080
alright?

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,080
Don't tease me.

281
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,510
Nice wine!

282
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,960
Muyang,

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
Li Shuang must be

284
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,480
hopelessly in love with me.

285
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,390
But you—

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,460
don't be too heartbroken.

287
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,000
It's been so many years.

288
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,870
It's time to let go.

289
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Just forget

290
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,010
about the past.

291
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,560
Accept your loss and move on.

292
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,330
Cheers.

293
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,070
[General's Residence]

294
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,750
Welcome back, General.

295
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,870
I brought you some date cake.

296
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,330
Really?

297
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,600
Well.

298
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
At your command, General.

299
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,820
At your command, General.

300
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,330
Ouyang Jun.

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,020
You've had a long day as well.

302
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,600
Stay

303
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,890
and have dinner with Qiao and the others.

304
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,640
Thank you, General.

305
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,170
Where is Jin'an?

306
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,260
He's drinking with the Crown Prince.

307
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,060
Drinking with the Crown Prince.

308
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,510
Muyang, your bed isn't as comfy as mine,

309
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,349
though it's still quite soft.

310
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,670
Now you know

311
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,380
who the General favors, huh?

312
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, no!

313
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,270
Here comes a wave!

314
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,069
Swim faster!

315
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,690
I am an aquatic dragon!

316
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,970
Your Highness.

317
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,240
Shuang!

318
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,350
Welcome back.

319
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,810
Jin'an.

320
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,680
Shuang!

321
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,930
The water here is deep.

322
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,790
Don't come over.

323
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,510
Get up quickly.

324
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,340
I'm coming to you.

325
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,540
Alright, I'm coming.

326
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
Look at this pretty hairpin!

327
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,750
Who gave it to you?

328
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,580
Was it me?

329
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,760
Stop it.

330
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,480
Let's go back.

331
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,610
Yes, I gave it to you.

332
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,460
Your Highness,

333
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,000
he was drunk today,
behaving inappropriately

334
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,060
and offending you.

335
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,270
When he sobers up tomorrow,

336
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,880
I'll bring him to apologize to you.

337
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,110
I was the one
who invited him to drink tonight.

338
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,240
I just didn't expect

339
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,790
he would have such a lightweight.

340
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,440
Thank you for your understanding,

341
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,730
Your Highness. I'll take him back now.

342
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,130
He can't hold his liquor.

343
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,430
Six sixes.

344
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,000
Six sixes.

345
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,350
Let's go.

346
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,950
Six sixes.

347
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,700
Hold on.

348
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,880
Muyang,

349
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
you're drunk.

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,750
Don't go that way.

351
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,530
The water there is deep.

352
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,750
It's dangerous!

353
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,830
Shuang.

354
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,650
If you want to fly to the sky,

355
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,020
just hop on my back.

356
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:41,830
I don't want to.

357
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,750
If you get on my back, I'll...

358
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,280
No.

359
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,000
Swoosh!

360
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,030
I'll fly to the moon.

361
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,790
I just want to go back to the room now.

362
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,720
I-If you want to go underground...

363
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,970
Forget it.

364
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,190
Fairies don't land on the ground.

365
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,010
-Let's go back.
-Flowers!

366
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,560
So beautiful.

367
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,400
Let's go.

368
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,970
Let's go.

369
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,400
Mind the steps.

370
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,070
Be careful.

371
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,730
(Drinking game chant) Five chiefs.

372
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,860
Six, six, six.

373
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,420
Be careful.

374
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,750
Come on!

375
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,440
Come drink here!

376
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,750
Five chiefs.

377
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,080
Eight Immortals crossing the sea.

378
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,680
So impressive.

379
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,640
Why on earth would you

380
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,900
challenge the Crown Prince in drinking?

381
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,830
His Highness has an incredible tolerance

382
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,030
and never gets drunk.

383
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,960
Why did you compete with him in drinking?

384
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,920
He never gets drunk?

385
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,590
Listen,

386
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,680
if you lose to me this time,

387
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,550
you must...

388
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,950
You must stay away from Shuang!

389
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
Shuang is mine.

390
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,510
You lost!

391
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,890
Go away. Leave now.

392
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,500
Shuang is mine now.

393
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,530
I'll deal with you properly tomorrow.

394
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,550
Fish.

395
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,420
Do you like eating the fish he catches?

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,720
Yes, I do.

397
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,410
You've known him for so long

398
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,790
and share so many memories with him.

399
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
He's better at fishing than I am,

400
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
and he can even drink more than I can.

401
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,810
How is he better than me at everything?

402
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,920
You even brought him
medicine for his wounds.

403
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,040
Lu Xin gave me medicine, too.

404
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,400
But the meds she offered me
turned out to be fake.

405
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,590
Eat fish.

406
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,160
Fish is good.

407
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,650
It's good for the eyes.

408
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,180
I can close my eyes
and rest in peace, too.

409
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,890
No, I can't rest in peace.

410
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,020
Your Highness.

411
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,130
All these dishes

412
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,920
were Li Shuang's favorites.

413
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,680
Especially

414
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,770
this pear-blossom pastry.

415
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,990
I specifically ordered them

416
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,240
to add some more sugar.

417
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,440
She'll definitely like it.

418
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,300
Your Highness,

419
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,280
why put yourself through this?

420
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,830
General Li escorted Jin'an
back to his room last night

421
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,260
and

422
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,200
hasn't come out yet.

423
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,970
If she doesn't come out,

424
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,550
I will wait until she does.

425
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,550
Can you let go of me now?

426
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,470
Why are you in my room?

427
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,130
We didn't do anything, did we?

428
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,410
Seems like you don't remember.

429
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,830
It's okay if you

430
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,160
can't recall anything.

431
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,270
Just remember

432
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,800
to look in the mirror later.

433
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,310
Look at the tear stains

434
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,110
all over your face.

435
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,280
Maybe they will jog your memory.

436
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,240
By the way,

437
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,730
nice crying.

438
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,960
Let's do it again sometime.

439
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,090
I really enjoyed it.

440
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,300
Share so many memories with him.

441
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,170
You even brought him
medicine for his wounds.

442
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,130
Your Highness.

443
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,550
You traveled all the way here,

444
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,950
yet I've been a poor host.

445
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,400
You really didn't need
to go to so much trouble.

446
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,440
Three years ago,

447
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,510
I promised

448
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,120
to take good care of you.

449
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,880
But things were beyond my control.

450
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,400
I unwillingly broke that promise.

451
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,110
Now,

452
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,350
you've grown so distant from me.

453
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,040
If I still don't do something,

454
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,550
I'm afraid that in your heart,

455
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,880
there will be no place for Muyang anymore.

456
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,610
Take it easy.

457
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,670
Actually, I'm doing all this

458
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,790
just to please myself.

459
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,640
As for whether you can get this treat,

460
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,900
that remains unknown.

461
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,750
The old rule applies.

462
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,150
You must defeat me first.

463
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,170
Your Highness,

464
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,110
I was once ignorant and unruly.

465
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,720
Yet you were kind and easy-going enough

466
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,160
to practice martial arts with me.

467
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,830
But now you and I are lord and subject.

468
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,550
I cannot

469
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,790
and dare not do it.

470
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,730
General Li cannot do it,

471
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,880
but Shuang can.

472
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,920
If I win,

473
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
you should give me

474
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,310
that plain jade hairpin you're wearing.

475
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,840
How's it?

476
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,860
Your Highness,

477
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,160
this plain jade hairpin

478
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
may not be that valuable,

479
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,180
but I wear it every day,

480
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,600
and I've been used to it.

481
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,480
I'm afraid...

482
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,950
Win against me first.

483
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,650
I apologize for my offense.

484
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,270
It's fine.

485
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,960
You won.

486
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,960
Your hairpin

487
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,830
is safe.

488
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,270
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

489
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,680
Your Highness.

490
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
General Li, how bold you are!

491
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,110
His Highness is injured,

492
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,040
yet you still went to such lengths!

493
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
It smells like that day,

494
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,180
but more potent.

495
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,680
Something's wrong.

496
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,480
If anything happens to His Highness,

497
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,440
can your Changfeng Army

498
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,680
bear such responsibility?

499
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,060
It was just a hit by a branch,

500
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,220
yet he's so delicate.

501
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,990
You lackey,

502
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,800
you have no place to speak here!

503
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,480
Excuse me.

504
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,570
How dare you!

505
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,260
Your Highness!

506
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,450
Your Highness!

507
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,370
Your Highness.

508
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,820
Knowing His Highness was injured,

509
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,320
you still insisted
on drinking with him last night.

510
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,200
You wretch, can you afford

511
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,260
the consequences?

512
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,200
You've been around the Crown Prince enough
to see many things.

513
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,260
You should know
this is clearly a symptom of poisoning.

514
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,050
We checked all weapons beforehand

515
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,400
and detected no poison,

516
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
yet somehow this one

517
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,980
shows signs of toxins now.

518
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,830
I'm afraid

519
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,450
it was coated with some rare poison

520
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,580
that could activate over time.

521
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,440
But this is weird.

522
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,740
Those bandits from Taiping Mountain

523
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,480
were wiped out by us long ago.

524
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,330
How did these people come out of nowhere?

525
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,810
Though bandits did all sorts of evil,

526
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,760
they usually only sought fortune.

527
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,960
These people,

528
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,640
though dressed as bandits,

529
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,000
showed signs

530
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
of years of professional training,

531
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,720
and their assassination attempt

532
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
was well-organized.

533
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,080
They were obviously no ordinary ruffians.

534
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,070
If they intended to kill someone,

535
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,790
why did they poison only one blade?

536
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,200
It doesn't make sense.

537
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,640
Look, the calluses on this man's hands

538
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,240
are thicker than the others.

539
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
The blade that wounded His Highness

540
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,340
was held in his hand.

541
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,510
Are you suggesting

542
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,110
that this man
differs from the other assassins

543
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,640
with a special identity?

544
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,820
I also can't figure it out for now.

545
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,880
But there must be

546
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,420
something fishy here.

547
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,160
Go find a coroner

548
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,480
to examine these bodies carefully

549
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,280
and write a detailed report

550
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,050
to submit to me.

551
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,710
Make sure nothing is omitted.

552
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,470
And you go to the scene of the incident

553
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,000
to look for any other clues.

554
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,840
Remember,

555
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,790
don't let a single word get out.

556
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,640
Yes.

557
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,480
Quack!

558
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,840
If anything happens to His Highness,

559
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,440
you all

560
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
will pay with your lives!

561
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,070
You know nothing!

562
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,370
His Highness has been poisoned
with something fierce and special

563
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,700
that silently attacked his vital organs.

564
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,510
Were it not for this wine

565
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,590
stimulating his blood circulation,

566
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,440
were it not for Jin'an

567
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,620
detecting it promptly,

568
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,620
His Highness would die a sudden death

569
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,020
upon the poison's onset.

570
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,700
Take good care of him.

571
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,560
Lu Xin!

572
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,090
How is His Highness?

573
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
The assassin's blade was poisoned.

574
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,070
Thank goodness you're alright.

575
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,880
Fortunately,
His Highness took the blow for you.

576
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
If you were the one lying in there,

577
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,420
I'd be worried like crazy.

578
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,670
Are you saying

579
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,510
His Highness's poison

580
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,770
cannot be detoxified?

581
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,640
That day, you rushed to my clinic,

582
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,790
saying you smelled

583
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,680
an unusual scent on His Highness.

584
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,730
Is it this one?

585
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,590
Very similar.

586
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,940
But something seems to be missing.

587
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,740
That's right.

588
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,850
I made this
based on His Highness's poison.

589
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,200
I can counteract
all the other toxic components,

590
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,590
but one ingredient is missing,

591
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,790
which must be the one you smelled.

592
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,400
However, this poison is so rare

593
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,720
that even I have never known it before.

594
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,510
Just now,

595
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,030
I used acupuncture on His Highness

596
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,510
to save his life.

597
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,270
The only solution now...

598
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,640
Shuang,

599
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,040
let's move His Highness to my place.

600
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,280
If anything happens,

601
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,600
we can respond immediately.

602
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,680
Perhaps I can even find a way
to detoxify him.

603
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,280
Are you sure you can cure him?

604
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,790
I can only try my best.

605
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,510
No.

606
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,640
If we can't cure His Highness,

607
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,050
Lucheng will be in big trouble.

608
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,210
As his physician,

609
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,440
your entire family will be executed.

610
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,370
How can you say it that way?

611
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,410
I may not be able to fight with you
on the frontlines,

612
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,720
but I've always been treating the wounded
in the rear.

613
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,350
After all these years of friendship,

614
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,070
am I just

615
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,640
a coward in your eyes?

616
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,790
I'm the only one left in my family

617
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,720
and in my entire clan, anyway.

618
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,980
I have nothing to fear.

619
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,730
I'll go back, set things up,

620
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,660
and wait for you.

621
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,960
See you.

622
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,130
I know you're worried about him,

623
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,060
but I'm worried about you as well.

624
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,200
I don't want to see you frowning.

625
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,410
This is a critical situation now.

626
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
If we don't get through this,

627
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,920
the Li family

628
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,370
and the Changfeng Army

629
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,120
will face catastrophes.

630
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,440
Besides,

631
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,270
His Highness and I grew up together.

632
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,110
By the way,

633
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,120
Lu Xin just mentioned

634
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,440
that you could smell the poison
on His Highness.

635
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
How come?

636
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,170
Actually, right from when you

637
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,420
brought me home,

638
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,270
I discovered that I had

639
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,880
extraordinarily sharp senses.

640
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,680
I could hear the faintest sounds

641
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,960
and detect

642
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,390
barely perceptible scents.

643
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,960
I didn't tell you before

644
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,560
because after the case
about the witch in the secret chamber,

645
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,490
these abilities

646
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,360
disappeared along with my power.

647
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,520
I only gradually regained them later.

648
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
That makes sense.

649
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,810
You could hear Li Zhangyi's whispers.

650
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,710
I should have realized that.

651
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,990
This is the evidence

652
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,600
I found in the morgue today.

653
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,510
The blade is coated with poison.

654
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,270
Take a sniff

655
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,110
and see if it smells the same
as the poison

656
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,040
on His Highness.

657
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,840
You're really using me like a bloodhound.

658
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,900
Whatever makes you happy.

659
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,929
Have you considered

660
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,280
who could be behind poisoning

661
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,190
the Crown Prince?

662
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,070
Prince Li has always been

663
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,719
on bad terms with the Crown Prince.

664
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,320
As His Majesty's eldest son,

665
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,510
he's supported

666
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,070
by many court officials.

667
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,070
The position of heir

668
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,270
should have been his.

669
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,670
But somehow,

670
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,320
three years ago,

671
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,230
His Majesty suddenly issued an edict

672
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,389
and made Muyang

673
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,560
the Crown Prince.

674
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,070
Is this money pouch

675
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,060
also something found on the assassin?

676
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,600
What's wrong with it?

677
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,630
The patterns and threads on this pouch

678
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,120
are way too luxurious

679
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
for an assassin to keep for himself.

680
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,810
Besides.

681
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,730
Don't you find the scent

682
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,690
quite familiar?

683
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,290
The Crown Prince

684
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,280
has always had trouble sleeping.

685
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,220
When his mother was alive,

686
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,100
she made him a special incense

687
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,110
to help him sleep.

688
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,670
Every night before bed,

689
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,150
he'd burn this incense.

690
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,590
But why?

691
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,550
If this were a trick
of self-inflicted harm,

692
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,110
the poison

693
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,570
would be far too potent
and dangerous for it.

694
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,960
Let's set aside the court affairs for now.

695
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,930
We should take His Highness

696
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,190
to Lu Xin's clinic first.
