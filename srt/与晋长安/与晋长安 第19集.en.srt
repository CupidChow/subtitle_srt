[Sixu Clinic]

4
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,590
I'll first slow down
the flow of blood and qi

5
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,350
in Your Highness with acupuncture.

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,479
I need some time to figure out

7
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,350
the one last ingredient

8
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,509
of this poison.

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Your Highness,

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,300
sorry for the discomfort.

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,140
This is going to hurt a bit.

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,490
The therapy has provided some relief.

13
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm feeling better now.

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,960
You two may leave.

15
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,750
This assassination attempt

16
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,010
was not arranged by me.

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,910
I only bribed the assassin.

18
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,630
Despite the thorough plan I made,

19
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,230
an accident still happened.

20
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,520
Will you forgive me?

21
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,370
As a humble subject

22
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
of Your Highness,

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,720
who am I to give forgiveness?

24
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,750
I know...

25
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,630
over the past 3 years,

26
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,690
you've always blamed me for failing you.

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,750
But, Shuang,

28
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
how do you know

29
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,750
I didn't beg my father

30
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,440
for you?

31
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,630
Father,

32
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,820
my heart belongs to another woman.

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,150
I can't marry Chancellor Ji's daughter.

34
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,150
So, Father,

35
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,360
please withdraw the decree.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,760
A king must keep his word.

37
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,640
I can't revoke that command
just because you say so.

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Marriage is a lifelong commitment.

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,470
Don't I even

40
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,240
have the right to marry

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,170
the woman I love?

42
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,290
You would have that right,
if you were a commoner's son.

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,200
But you're the Crown Prince.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,590
Even your marriage has to

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,040
serve the kingdom's interests.

46
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,750
Father,

47
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm neither capable nor knowledgeable.

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,710
People are not convinced of my competence.

49
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm hardly qualified
for the role of Crown Prince.

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,230
If being the Crown Prince means

51
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,150
I must give up on my beloved woman,

52
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,310
then

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
I beg for your imperial edict

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,050
to relieve me from this position.

55
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,630
You're throwing away the throne

56
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,210
just for a woman?

57
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm well aware

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,680
that you're in love with Li Shuang.

59
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,360
But don't forget that you're my son

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
and my liege.

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,950
You don't get to decide

62
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,920
your future spouse

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,130
or your own dismissal.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,159
But, Father...

65
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,830
A father's love runs deep.

66
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,600
If you defy my orders,

67
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,040
I won't kill you,

68
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,390
but I will definitely kill Li Shuang.

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
As a royal member,

70
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,850
I have to do things against my own will.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,830
I failed you

72
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,240
only to protect you.

73
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,700
For me,

74
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,159
that decision

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,070
also tore my heart apart.

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,590
Prince Annan?

77
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,230
Prince Annan...

78
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,800
Who's there?

79
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,420
Prince Annan...

80
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,680
Prince Annan...

81
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,250
That man is clearly Prince Annan.

82
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,210
Why is he

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,040
with the Crown Prince of Taijin?

84
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,680
I must bring this message

85
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
back to Yao State.

86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,870
Who are you?

87
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,270
After following you guys
all the way here,

88
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,610
I still can't find Jade Linglong.

89
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
What's worse,

90
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,980
the trail has entirely gone cold.

91
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,170
Why did you kill him?

92
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,110
Mister,

93
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
that's not a fair judgement.

94
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,070
There is no roof or wall around.

95
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,390
All the animals here

96
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,320
can come and go as they please,

97
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,410
let alone humans, don't you think?

98
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,960
You smell the poison
that the Crown Prince was inflicted with.

99
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Was it you
who meant to poison His Highness?

100
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,390
How come you accuse me of

101
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,870
a new crime with each move I make?

102
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,480
Can't you be reasonable?

103
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
You must come with me.

104
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,170
If you're innocent,

105
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,940
you'll have your chance
to defend yourself.

106
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,270
I have urgent matters to attend to.

107
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,270
I'm done with you.

108
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,190
Stop it! I yield!

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,350
You're so reckless, Mister.

110
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,510
This hurts yourself and others.

111
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,170
Please refrain from doing so.

112
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,790
I'll go with you

113
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,870
to wherever you want.

114
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
The flame patterns...

115
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,050
He is exactly

116
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,300
the shadow puppet.

117
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,980
Your Highness,

118
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
I've never blamed you

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
during these 3 years.

120
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,870
Now,

121
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,040
all has been decided for us.

122
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,910
Let's

123
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,730
put the past behind.

124
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,910
But why?

125
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,270
How could we just erase

126
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,970
those beautiful memories?

127
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,670
Your Highness...

128
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,940
You're right, though.

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,060
My life is coming to an end.

130
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,360
What can I hold onto now?

131
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,470
It was no secret to you

132
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,680
that I bribed the assassin,

133
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,660
yet you never questioned me about it.

134
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,030
I don't know

135
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,610
why Your Highness did that,

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,260
but I have faith in you.

137
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,350
I believe you had your own reason

138
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,620
for making such a move.

139
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,380
My brother wanted to kill me.

140
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,200
I thought I could escape that fate

141
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,870
by bribing the assassin.

142
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,150
But to my surprise,

143
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,080
my brother already saw me through.

144
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,840
I had a messenger come over

145
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,240
to tell you not to attend the reception

146
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,630
because I hoped

147
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,540
you could stay away from this strife.

148
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,390
Little did I expect

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,910
that

150
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,170
you'd still be dragged into it in the end.

151
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,910
Shuang,

152
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,870
I know

153
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,590
I can't do much for you,

154
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,150
though I owe you a lot.

155
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,550
This time,

156
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,910
I'm finally relieved from guilt.

157
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,610
Your Highness.

158
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,610
Your Highness!

159
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,060
Your Highness!

160
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,390
Lu Xin!

161
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,700
Your Highness!

162
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,960
His Highness fainted.

163
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,680
How is he?

164
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,030
Shuang,

165
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,830
embrace yourself for the worst.

166
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,550
It's not a dead end yet!

167
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,170
Ladies,

168
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
nice to see you again.

169
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,800
You know each other?

170
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,510
What's

171
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
going on here?

172
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,750
An assassin appeared,

173
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,950
so I chased after him.

174
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,870
But by the time I caught up,

175
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,960
he had been killed.

176
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
This man was on the scene.

177
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,410
I also smelled the scent

178
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,600
of that mysterious poison on him.

179
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,630
Give us the antidote now.

180
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,200
Then I'll implore the king to spare you

181
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,660
from capital punishment.

182
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Did you hear that?

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,510
You two make quite a great couple,

184
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,910
as you falsely accuse someone

185
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,960
in the exact same manner.

186
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,270
It's too late.

187
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,750
The Crown Prince is at death's door.

188
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,790
Even if there is an antidote,

189
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,840
there won't be time for it to take effect.

190
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,670
Arsenic.

191
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,860
Curculigo.

192
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,030
Ruojian.

193
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,120
Toxic toads.

194
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,830
Whoever poisoned him

195
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,810
must have nefarious motives.

196
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,870
How do you know the ingredients?

197
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,070
I can tell the formula

198
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,750
of any poison with a simple glimpse

199
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,630
of the symptoms.

200
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,550
Nonsense.

201
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,320
Except those from Wuling Mountain,

202
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,380
nobody in the world is able to do that.

203
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,550
So you're from Wuling Mountain?

204
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
In just a moment,

205
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,960
His Highness will be gone forever.

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Instead of probing into my origins,

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,510
why not let me save his life first,
General?

208
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,040
Under such circumstances,

209
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,200
we might as well let him try.

210
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,510
A guiding drug of this poison

211
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,870
is called Snow Golden Lotus,

212
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,400
which carries rare toxins.

213
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,150
Fortunately,
everything has its antagonist.

214
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,240
This Icy Jade Worm of mine

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
specifically feeds on that lotus.

216
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,360
What you smelled earlier

217
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,950
was the scent of this worm.

218
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,430
Why didn't you explain it?

219
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,550
Did you give me a chance to speak?

220
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,480
How did I not?

221
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,010
Hold his arms! Don't let him hurt my worm.

222
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,030
Your Highness...

223
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,740
Now my worm is finally fed.

224
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,420
The toxins have really been cleared.

225
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,360
His Highness will recover
after a few days' rest.

226
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,120
Thank you.

227
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,000
Sir, for your commendable contribution,

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,030
the Crown Prince will surely

229
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,500
reward you when he wakes up.

230
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,440
It was a small favor.

231
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Don't mention it.

232
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,630
How noble of you.

233
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,050
I'd deeply impressed.

234
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,480
But I'm afraid
you'll be troubled with the Crown Prince's

235
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,320
medication

236
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,750
before His Highness recovers.

237
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,000
If you don't mind,

238
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,270
why not stay a few days at my place?

239
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,080
It can also be a chance for me

240
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,680
to repay your generous help.

241
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
General, young though you are,

242
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,390
you're already an expert in telling lies.

243
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,910
You're not being hospitable,

244
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,550
but seeking

245
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,150
an excuse to interrogate me.

246
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,320
That's right.

247
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,600
You'll be interrogated.

248
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,860
It's non-negotiable.

249
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,440
The grand General's Residence

250
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
must be magnificent.

251
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,970
Not everyone gets to see it.

252
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,830
Given your cordial invitation,

253
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,440
General,

254
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,370
I'd like to accept this kind offer.

255
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,660
What's that guy's background?

256
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,390
Shuang,

257
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
you're a general,

258
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,030
and Jin'an is too aggressive.

259
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,240
Why not let me

260
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,610
talk to that man?

261
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,810
Sounds nice.

262
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,750
Have Cuiyun accompany you.

263
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,610
Stay cautious.

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,870
This way, sir.

265
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,080
Miss Li appears rough.

266
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,630
But who would know

267
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,820
she actually has such good taste?

268
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,670
General Li told us

269
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,750
that you're a distinguished guest,

270
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,880
to whom we must offer the best service.

271
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,510
You're not needed here.

272
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,480
Go get some rest.

273
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,690
May I have a look

274
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,750
at your worm?

275
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,520
It bites.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,109
It really amazes me

277
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,040
that you're from Wuling Mountain.

278
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,130
Since we both practice medicine,

279
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,690
why not exchange

280
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,820
opinions on our expertise more often?

281
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,330
You must be thirsty.

282
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,700
Have some tea.

283
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,060
Are you really going to stay here?

284
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
Why not?

285
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,060
I've never had a stay
at the General's Residence.

286
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,260
All seems fresh to me.

287
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,440
What's more,

288
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,220
I'm an honored guest here now.

289
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,220
I wonder if you're genuinely naive

290
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,620
or just pretending to be.

291
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,410
They call you an honored guest

292
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,510
only to sugarcoat

293
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,120
their real purpose of confining you here.

294
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,520
If the Crown Prince's conditions worsen,

295
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,000
you'll be the first one to be held liable.

296
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,680
The silver lining is,

297
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,350
I can put in a good word
for you with Shuang

298
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,810
and plead for leniency.

299
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,760
Then all problems will go away.

300
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,230
However, as you know,

301
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I am a renowned physician after all.

302
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,240
Acting as someone's advocate

303
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,040
is beneath me.

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,310
How about you teach me
some of your medical skills?

305
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,370
Then we'll be even. What do you think?

306
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,010
Miss, is this

307
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,550
a threat?

308
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,030
You can put it that way.

309
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,510
Medical practitioners

310
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,880
must have moral probity.

311
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm impressed by the fact
that you completely ignore

312
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,200
the code of ethics, Miss Lu.

313
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,450
You're the one lacking morals.

314
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,590
To be honest,

315
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,310
I slipped deadly poison

316
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,720
into the tea you just drank.

317
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,480
If you want to live,

318
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,470
you'll have to ask me for the antidote.

319
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,130
You call that speck of dust

320
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,450
poison?

321
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,680
In fact, Miss Lu,

322
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,000
don't you feel

323
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,880
itchy and prickly in the throat,

324
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,800
and pain in the stomach now?

325
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,920
Not at all.

326
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
Are you not feeling sick?

327
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,610
How despicable of you.

328
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,650
Let's see...

329
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,590
Let's see how long it'll take...

330
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,720
b-before you collapse...

331
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,550
Miss Lu,

332
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,580
when you poison someone next time,

333
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,420
try not using laxatives again.

334
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,600
Master,

335
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,650
Mo Yin is staying at
the General's Residence now.

336
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,590
What a resourceful junior I have.

337
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,200
He managed to enter
the impenetrable General's Residence

338
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,000
with such ease.

339
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,500
The credit goes to
your marvelous strategy, Master.

340
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,560
Mo Yin has become part of the game now.

341
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,790
But I'm afraid...

342
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,920
the Empress Dowager's patience
is wearing thin.

343
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,750
What should

344
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:50,970
we do next?

345
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,190
Qiao is remarkably strong.

346
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,200
Although I managed to weather through

347
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,910
all adversities by transformation,

348
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,600
Shuang would be hurt

349
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,510
every time I resorted to
the supernatural strength.

350
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,830
It'll be perfect

351
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,440
if I can protect Shuang

352
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,170
without changing forms.

353
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,350
Thanks.

354
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,410
Qiao,

355
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
you have extraordinary skills

356
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,550
and limitless strength.

357
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,310
I am

358
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,070
truly in awe.

359
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,310
Now that you know I'm good,

360
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,410
you'd better go away.

361
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,810
Or you might get hurt

362
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,270
and have no one to blame.

363
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,800
I have an idea.

364
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,510
Look,

365
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,750
you're an amazing martial fighter.

366
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,240
Could you be my tutor?

367
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,960
Think about it.

368
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,640
If I'm half as formidable as you are,

369
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,040
the General's Residence

370
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,200
will be much safer, won't it?

371
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,510
Are you doing this
to protect the General's Residence,

372
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,170
or just to please the general?

373
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,000
What...

374
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,070
What's the difference?

375
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,920
The Crown Prince is visiting Lucheng.

376
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,390
The general is with him all the time.

377
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,480
Your provocative moves aren't working now.

378
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,610
So you're looking to learn new tricks?

379
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,720
Look how frivolous he is.

380
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,770
You must've said it right.

381
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,200
A rat! Qiao!

382
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
Qiao!

383
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,040
It's okay.

384
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,400
I'm not afraid.

385
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,160
Indeed.

386
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,590
You all have excellent skills,

387
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,870
but you're not vigilant enough.

388
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,440
I stood back there for a long time,

389
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
yet you didn't notice me at all.

390
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,980
How about this?

391
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,130
Let's make a trade.

392
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,350
You teach me martial skills,

393
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,550
and I'll instruct you

394
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,160
on sharpening your 5 senses.

395
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,750
Okay.

396
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,370
The first lesson for you

397
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,920
is to defeat me.

398
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,160
Help...

399
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,400
He sure knows how to keep his cool.

400
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
He shows no curiosity

401
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,440
about his origins at all.

402
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,590
Come in.

403
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,840
You're in luck, Mister.

404
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,000
I've specially brewed
a nice pot of tea for you.

405
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,420
Why not sit down

406
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,650
and enjoy it with me?

407
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,920
It seems you've anticipated my visit.

408
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,000
You didn't plan for
the assassination attempt

409
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
or poison the Crown Prince,

410
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,590
but you oddly appeared
beside that dead assassin.

411
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,030
What exactly are you up to?

412
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,490
Don't be so tense, Mister.

413
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,590
I'm interested in no one,

414
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
but you

415
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,250
and the flame patterns on you.

416
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,920
You're thirsty for blood

417
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,230
and loyal to your master,

418
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,000
with the abilities to transform
and heal automatically.

419
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,830
Am I right

420
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,210
about all that?

421
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,680
A shadow puppet's power

422
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,440
is really something to be reckoned with.

423
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,500
You claim to be from Wuling Mountain.

424
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,160
You also know perfectly well about

425
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,290
my peculiar traits.

426
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,170
So, I'm sure this state I'm in

427
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,680
is somewhat related to you.

428
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,920
Is it correct?

429
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,210
Don't be so rude.

430
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,590
Since you know of Wuling Mountain,

431
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,830
haven't you also heard of

432
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,000
the treasure of it,

433
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,310
named Jade Linglong?

434
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,880
Are you saying

435
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,110
these anomalies are associated with

436
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,910
the Jade Linglong in me?

437
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,740
Yes.

438
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,570
It is both a medicine and a poison.

439
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,180
Once it is planted inside a human,

440
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,910
this person

441
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,120
will become a shadow puppet,

442
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,190
with infinite strength

443
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,640
and self-healing ability.

444
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,030
But Jade Linglong's power

445
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,440
is sustained by blood.

446
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,710
The blood provider

447
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,170
becomes the blood master.

448
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,750
The blood pact
formed between the puppet and the master

449
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,920
makes the former
completely obedient to the latter,

450
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,030
with an instinctive urge for intimacy.

451
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,440
Being well aware of

452
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,480
Jade Linglong's terrifying power,

453
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
those in Wuling Mountain

454
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,400
made a rule
that this item must be strictly guarded.

455
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,860
Unexpectedly, years ago,

456
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,000
Jade Linglong was stolen.

457
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,980
We searched extensively
but couldn't find it,

458
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,000
until recently,

459
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,630
we heard a man in black
showed up in Lucheng.

460
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,150
That was what led us here.

461
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,790
If I'm not mistaken,

462
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,230
Miss Li

463
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,320
is your blood master, right?

464
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,200
The blood pact between me and Li Shuang

465
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,210
was formed entirely by accident.

466
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,300
I understand that, of course.

467
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,720
I bet the person who stole Jade Linglong

468
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,270
intended to turn you into a shadow puppet

469
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,200
for his or her own use.

470
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
However, something went wrong.

471
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,920
You lost control, fled,

472
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,380
and took Li Shuang as your master
by mistake.

473
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,620
If what you're saying is true,

474
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,790
this person will go after Shuang

475
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,620
in order to regain control

476
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,410
of Jade Linglong.

477
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,400
You've lost all your memories.

478
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,110
Shouldn't you be curious
about your own origins first?

479
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,350
I was curious before.

480
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,070
But now...

481
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,270
My home is

482
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,550
wherever Shuang is.

483
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,720
It's good enough
if I can protect her for a lifetime

484
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,320
with my current abilities.

485
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,310
I'm afraid
it's just wishful thinking on your part.

486
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,480
The anomalies happening to you

487
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,310
are still evolving till this day.

488
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,350
Can you deliver any lifelong commitment?

489
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,210
As Jade Linglong merges with you,

490
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,090
it'll gradually corrode your will.

491
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,130
Eventually,

492
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,640
you'll completely lose control

493
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,240
and become a killing machine
without feelings.

494
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,400
When that happens,

495
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,440
not only will you forget Li Shuang,

496
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,830
but also probably hurt her,

497
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,940
or even kill her.

498
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,070
I'd sooner end my own life

499
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,960
than cause any harm to her.

500
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,590
I understand your overconfidence,
since the worst is yet to happen.

501
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,310
But I doubt if you can take your own life

502
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,560
with Jade Linglong in your body.

503
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,220
That aside, I have a question.

504
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,920
Every time
you released the power of Jade Linglong,

505
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,650
did Li Shuang

506
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,080
feel unwell and fatigue?

507
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Her blood and qi

508
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,880
are the very source
of Jade Linglong's power.

509
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,270
The deeper
you integrate with Jade Linglong,

510
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,880
the worse her health will be.

511
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,060
Even without you killing her,

512
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,570
she'll inevitably perish
due to depletion of blood and qi.

513
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,510
How is she?

514
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,400
How long have you been experiencing
these dizzy spells?

515
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,510
Probably...

516
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,860
since the Battle of Lucheng.

517
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,590
You're suffering from melancholy,

518
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,510
combined with deficiency
in both qi and blood.

519
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,350
Shuang!

520
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
If this continues,

521
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,920
there will be serious consequences.

522
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,180
You really need to recuperate properly.

523
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,400
Leave with me

524
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,060
for the removal of Jade Linglong.

525
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,040
Only in that way

526
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
will she and you
stand a chance of survival.

527
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,790
You think this supernatural nonsense

528
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,680
can fool me?

529
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,680
Overestimating yourself, aren't you?

530
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,000
I saw your good nature,
so I decided to tell you the truth

531
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,270
instead of pushing you into anything.

532
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,870
But you misinterpreted what I said
with that petty mind of yours.

533
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,640
Suppose you did tell me the truth—

534
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,240
I swear

535
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,010
I won't transform anymore,

536
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,030
or use the power

537
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,030
of Jade Linglong.

538
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,370
It seems

539
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,260
you've finally got the gist.

540
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,050
In our previous fight,

541
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,130
you were already much stronger

542
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,070
than ordinary people

543
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,720
even without transforming.

544
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,240
This is proof that Jade Linglong

545
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,770
is becoming a whole with your body.

546
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,970
Before long,

547
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,790
you'll entirely
morph into a shadow puppet

548
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,420
that can harness
Jade Linglong's power anytime

549
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,510
without pressing acupoints
to induce transformation.

550
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,710
When that comes true,

551
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,810
every simple movement of yours

552
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,530
will cause harm

553
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,760
to your blood master.

554
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,400
The facts are right in front of you,

555
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,880
yet you wouldn't accept them.

556
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,020
Or is it
because you simply refuse to admit

557
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,970
the close bonds
between you and Li Shuang now

558
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,830
are merely attributed to
Jade Linglong's effects?

559
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,680
Provoking me will get you nowhere.

560
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,590
Besides,

561
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,450
Jade Linglong

562
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,760
originated from Wuling Mountain,

563
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,120
which you're part of.

564
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,970
So you're not innocent.

565
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,960
Unless...

566
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,950
Unless you find

567
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,440
the one who started all this,

568
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,170
I have no reason to believe you.

569
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,920
In addition,

570
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,680
I'm sure you're aware

571
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,640
that the power I have now

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,130
is strong enough to protect Shuang

573
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,000
and to crush you.

574
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,750
So, rid your mind of shady ideas.

575
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,610
Do not wag your tongue

576
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,790
at Li Shuang.

577
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
If you're in for a losing battle,

578
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,110
I'll oblige you to the end.

579
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,440
What a stubborn man.

580
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,550
The firewood is ready.

581
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,350
Send it to Cuiyun.

582
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,400
Got it, Qiao.

583
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,550
The changes of my power

584
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,820
had better be kept secret.

585
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Jin'an...

586
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,910
Qiao,

587
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,810
Jin'an is here!

588
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,000
Why sneak around?

589
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,310
Qiao.

590
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,320
Don't try to butter me up.

591
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,470
Did you do your morning practice?

592
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,160
He didn't.

593
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,240
I saw it.

594
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,790
The martial training

595
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,310
is just too arduous.

596
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,350
I don't think I can keep it up.

597
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,950
I'm terribly sorry.

598
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:45,930
Goodbye.

599
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,110
Fine, I'll stay. Alright?

600
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,140
Why the rush?

601
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,270
The key to martial practice
is perseverance.

602
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,460
Once the process begins,

603
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,020
you can't quit halfway.

604
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,160
That's right.

605
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,400
Beat him up!

606
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,500
Yeah. Go at him!

607
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,590
Dodging?

608
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,050
Strike him!

609
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,110
As expected of the elite guardians
of the General's Residence,

610
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,240
you all started your martial practice
in early morning.

611
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,000
Miss, you're full of vigor and strength.

612
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,880
I'm impressed.

613
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,720
I...

614
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,030
You're not bad yourself.

615
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,490
The air is filled with spring chills,

616
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,160
yet you're strolling with a fan.

617
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,090
Aren't you worried to catch a cold?

618
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,590
I happen to know a bit about martial arts.

619
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,050
Jin'an, if you don't mind,

620
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,800
shall we have a friendly match?

621
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm not interested.

622
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,850
What do you want?

623
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,180
Are you not fighting back

624
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,920
out of fear of giving yourself away?

625
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,520
I'd love to see
how long your disguise can last.

626
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,960
Qiao!

627
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,630
Though you're the general's guest,

628
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,510
as an outsider,

629
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,320
you're not allowed to bully Jin'an,

630
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,920
since he's one of us
on the general's team.

631
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,150
Honored guest,

632
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,790
watch your behavior.

633
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,239
You're right, Miss.

634
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
That was rude of me.

635
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,270
I shall take my leave.

636
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,630
My back...

637
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,710
Jin'an,

638
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,810
are you alright?

639
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,020
Qiao, Ling,

640
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,790
despite your harsh words,

641
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,160
you're big softies.

642
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,080
Why that gaze?

643
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,720
Pick up the firewood

644
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,290
and send it to the woodshed.

645
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,880
Get a move on!

646
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,840
General,

647
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,170
word from the capital

648
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,270
says Prince Li is on the way.

649
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,340
He will reach Lucheng

650
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,450
in just a few days.

651
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,020
That assassination attempt
on the Crown Prince was a serious matter.

652
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,070
I knew it'd be revealed sooner or later.

653
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,550
Why didn't

654
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,760
His Majesty assign

655
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,120
someone else than Prince Li

656
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,450
to ascertain the truth?

657
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,040
General,

658
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,400
does His Majesty really not see

659
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,550
the hidden reality?

660
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,330
It's a power struggle.

661
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,590
What's between His Majesty and the princes

662
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,250
is beyond our understanding.

663
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,480
Now that Prince Li
is coming here with a fanfare,

664
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,840
we might as well get ready
to welcome His Highness.

665
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,700
As for the rest,

666
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,000
we'll do what we can

667
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,030
under specific circumstances.

668
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,400
Yes.
