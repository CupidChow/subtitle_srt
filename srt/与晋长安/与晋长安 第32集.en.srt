00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 32]

3
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,840
I didn't expect

4
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,690
the mighty General of Cavalry

5
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,190
of Taijin

6
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,430
to be such a craven coward,

7
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,870
too afraid to lead the campaign himself.

8
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,840
Instead, he sent his daughter

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,750
to her death.

10
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,829
Why use a butcher's blade
to kill a chicken?

11
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,220
You should be grateful
that it was me who came.

12
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,420
Otherwise, you would

13
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,610
already be in the ground,

14
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,250
keeping your emperor company by now.

15
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,530
You talk boldly
even with death staring you in the face.

16
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,680
You do have some nerve.

17
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,050
If you wanted to kill me,

18
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,120
you would've done it

19
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,329
before the armies to assert your power.

20
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,329
You wouldn't have waited until now.

21
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,400
It seems
you're not entirely without merit.

22
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,750
You've got a quick mind.

23
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,050
But don't let that cleverness
be your downfall.

24
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,470
The timing of your death

25
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
significantly

26
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,240
impacts the outcome.

27
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,490
Write a letter of surrender.

28
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,930
Have Taijin release Yao State's prisoners.

29
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,680
Then I will show mercy

30
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,590
and spare your life.

31
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,820
Trading my life

32
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,430
for thousands of prisoners—

33
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,480
if it were you,

34
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,310
would you agree?

35
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,800
It might not work if it's someone else.

36
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,270
But I heard

37
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,430
you share a deep relationship

38
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,380
with Taijin's emperor.

39
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,090
I imagine he wouldn't want

40
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
his beautiful companion

41
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,470
to die at his enemy's hands.

42
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,520
You...

43
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,410
And mind you,

44
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,660
even without you,

45
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,180
I can still get what I want.

46
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,980
I'll march on Taijin one day

47
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,880
and trample every camp.

48
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,030
I can still rescue my men.

49
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,390
I'm only giving you a chance to live

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,830
because

51
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,920
I see there's some spirit in you.

52
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,750
With you captured,

53
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,409
I doubt your useless subordinates

54
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,630
would dare attack the city on their own.

55
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,960
There's plenty of time.

56
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,490
Think carefully.

57
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,120
I wanted to take this opportunity
to get rid of him once and for all,

58
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,180
but unexpectedly,

59
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,720
he actually won the battle.

60
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,900
Though Prince Annan is arrogant,

61
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,570
he has considerable talent
in leading troops.

62
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,350
This victory, after all,

63
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,430
has resolved our immediate crisis.

64
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,990
Are you implying

65
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,240
Yao State has no one else left to rely on?

66
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,560
I misspoke.

67
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,740
Duan Aodeng is of royal blood.

68
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,360
His prestige at court
remains undiminished.

69
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,230
Now he's earned military merit.

70
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,950
Those old ministers

71
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,620
are all opportunists.

72
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,670
With a few whispers in their ears,

73
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,540
they might waver in loyalty.

74
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,940
I will not allow anyone

75
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,300
to threaten Yu's throne.

76
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,450
Duan Aodeng

77
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,890
must die.

78
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Your Majesty,

79
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,180
Li Shuang, General of the Changfeng Army,

80
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,380
is currently held in the prisoner camp.

81
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,060
If we use her properly,

82
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,010
perhaps

83
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,620
she can help us

84
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,200
eliminate Prince Annan.

85
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,770
You mean

86
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,450
that female general from Taijin
who was once close to him?

87
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,700
Old love and past favors
are not easy to forget.

88
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,770
But why would she help us?

89
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,770
Before, perhaps not.

90
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,450
But before Prince Annan left Taijin,

91
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,140
he plotted an assassination attempt
against Li Wei.

92
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,000
A rift already lies between them.

93
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,690
Besides,

94
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,490
Li Shuang comes
from a military background.

95
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,890
She is no ordinary woman.

96
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,059
Now with the 2 armies facing off,

97
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,539
amid national enmity and personal grudges,

98
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,299
if someone

99
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,330
gives her an opportunity,

100
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
she will certainly seize it

101
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,140
to kill her powerful enemy.

102
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,900
But Prince Annan

103
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,090
has already forgotten

104
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,940
his years spent in Taijin.

105
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,710
Would he lower his guard

106
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,780
before a female general of the enemy?

107
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,850
That is why
someone must be behind the scenes

108
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,420
to stir the waves.

109
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,420
I was right to place my trust in you.

110
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,090
I promise you

111
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,580
a high ministerial position.

112
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,090
If this matter is handled well,

113
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,190
there will be additional rewards.

114
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,520
I will not fail this mission.

115
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,330
I'll ease your burdens, Your Majesty.

116
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,140
Remember,

117
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,130
when putting on a show,
make it convincing.

118
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,690
When the time comes, show no mercy.

119
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,900
Just make sure Li Shuang

120
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,650
is left with a breath of life.

121
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,660
As you command.

122
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,780
General Li,

123
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,970
how have you been?

124
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,980
How could they treat you
with such disrespect?

125
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,570
You've suffered greatly, General.

126
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,420
Stop the act.

127
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,300
If you're here
to persuade me to surrender,

128
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
don't waste your time on me.

129
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,110
The Changfeng Army's soldiers
would rather die fighting.

130
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,780
We will never surrender.

131
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,480
Why must you be so stubborn, General?

132
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,220
We each serve our own ruler.

133
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,780
I don't wish
to make things difficult for you.

134
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,780
If you just write a letter of surrender,

135
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,490
I

136
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,570
will vouch for your safety.

137
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,690
You curs!

138
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,180
You bunch of damned curs!

139
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,610
What other tricks you've got—

140
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,940
just bring them on!

141
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,450
Kneel!

142
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,660
Bring them on!

143
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,730
Lyu Yi! Qin Wu!

144
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,430
General!

145
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,250
General!

146
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,510
What are you going to do?

147
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,810
They were captured with you.

148
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,310
I heard
you care about your soldiers very much.

149
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:01,950
I assume

150
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,520
you'll surely care about their lives.

151
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,420
You're a clever woman, General.

152
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,940
You know what must be done.

153
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,690
You...

154
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,840
I'll ask you one more time.

155
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,460
The letter of surrender—

156
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,740
will you write it

157
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
or not?

158
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,660
Let them go!

159
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,180
If you've got the guts, come at me!

160
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,730
Don't hurt innocent people!

161
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,730
Release them!

162
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,730
You cur!

163
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,320
Your complacency won't last long.

164
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,260
Taijin's formidable army
will tear you limb from limb!

165
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,900
Lyu Yi!

166
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,590
You cur! You'll die a horrible death!

167
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,300
Lyu Yi!

168
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,730
Lyu Yi.

169
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,570
Will you

170
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,490
write it or not?

171
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,060
Let him go.

172
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,850
Release him!

173
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,180
General,

174
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,730
I am just a soldier.

175
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,810
I was honored by your trust and promotion.

176
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,450
I can never
repay your kindness in this life.

177
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,140
Now,

178
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,730
to die for my country

179
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,420
is my greatest honor!

180
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,810
I

181
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,790
must take my final journey now.

182
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,250
They're dead.

183
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,060
Bai Kun.

184
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,730
I will kill you.

185
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,540
I swear I will kill you!

186
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,330
Don't blame me, General.

187
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,470
It's Prince Annan's order.

188
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,930
Who dares to disobey?

189
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,630
My patience is limited.

190
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,310
You'd better decide soon,

191
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,420
unless you want more suffering.

192
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,350
If you have the nerve, just kill me!

193
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,130
Stop wasting time.

194
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,960
What a Beautiful Lord of Hell.

195
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,260
Let's see how long you can hold out.

196
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,610
Torture her!

197
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,980
The wounded soldiers

198
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,180
must be properly taken care of.

199
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,910
The families of the fallen

200
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,330
should receive compensation without delay.

201
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,540
No embezzlement is permitted.

202
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,140
Please rest assured, Prince Annan.

203
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,270
I will personally oversee the matter.

204
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,850
But there is one thing I don't understand.

205
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,610
Since we've captured Li Shuang,

206
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,140
why not just kill her?

207
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,240
It could strike fear into Taijin.

208
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,430
Though we won this battle,

209
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,970
our supplies and troops
have been severely depleted.

210
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,380
Recovery will take time.

211
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,060
The soldiers

212
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,420
also need rest.

213
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,850
Rather than
seeking immediate satisfaction,

214
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,450
it's better to keep her alive

215
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
to use her as a check against Taijin.

216
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,330
Since she's a member of the Li family,

217
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,330
Li Wei certainly won't abandon her.

218
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,570
And only when Li Wei shows himself

219
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,730
can I avenge my brother.

220
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,090
Understood.

221
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,020
Has she agreed to surrender?

222
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,660
She is unyielding.

223
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,220
She's been on a hunger strike for days.

224
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,480
If this continues,

225
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,410
she'll starve herself to death.

226
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,390
It seems I underestimated her.

227
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,380
Perhaps some suffering will do her good.

228
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,300
Otherwise,

229
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,730
she can't see
the reality of her situation.

230
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,330
Prince Annan, you're right.

231
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,300
But...

232
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,570
But Bai Kun went to the camp today.

233
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,060
As you know,

234
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,940
he's always been ruthless.

235
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,420
No matter how strong-willed Li Shuang is,

236
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm afraid

237
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,160
she can't withstand his methods.

238
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,420
Bai Kun?

239
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,060
General, why are you so stubborn?

240
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,290
Just write a letter of surrender

241
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,410
and you'll regain your freedom.

242
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,610
After that,

243
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,590
even if you don't want
to return to Taijin,

244
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,780
I can speak for you

245
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,190
and guarantee you
a life of wealth and honor.

246
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,380
You want me to surrender? Fine.

247
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,380
I want every official of Yao State

248
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,660
to bow their heads,

249
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,420
the royal family to kneel in submission,

250
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
and you...

251
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,420
to be torn into pieces.

252
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,920
I'd like to see

253
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,020
if there will ever be a time
when you beg for mercy.

254
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,300
Everyone,

255
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,730
she's the mighty General of the North
of Taijin.

256
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,850
Today,

257
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm giving her to you all
as a reward!

258
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,510
-Thank you, My Lord.
-Thank you, My Lord.

259
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,110
-Prince Annan.
-Prince Annan.

260
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,960
Torturing and killing prisoners
in the camp without authorization—

261
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,670
what do you take military discipline for?

262
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,500
Jin'an.

263
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,640
You... You...

264
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,940
I came to interrogate her
under the Empress Dowager's order.

265
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,100
Prince Annan,

266
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,940
why are you interfering?

267
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,670
Using the Empress Dowager to threaten me?

268
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,050
Have I ever been afraid?

269
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,950
You bypassed my authority

270
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
to torture her without permission.

271
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,140
In the army,

272
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,120
that's a capital offense.

273
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,340
Jin'an.

274
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,380
Jin'an.

275
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,340
Why do I feel uneasy

276
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,250
whenever I hear this name?

277
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,180
Who is

278
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,380
this Jin'an?

279
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,460
You're awake.

280
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,900
Those prison guards

281
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,730
have been dealt with
according to military law.

282
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,140
There are no women in the army.

283
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,940
You'll have to

284
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,350
tend to your wounds yourself.

285
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,180
If you want to avenge your brother,

286
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,070
you can simply kill me.

287
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,580
If you want to harm me,

288
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,010
I advise you to save your strength.

289
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,540
In your current condition,

290
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,580
you can't so much as scratch me.

291
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,960
Besides, each debt has its owner.

292
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,860
One day, I will take Li Wei's life myself,

293
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,390
but I won't involve others.

294
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,440
You want to die now?

295
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,660
I won't allow it.

296
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,180
What happened today

297
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,250
will not happen again.

298
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,410
I will have medicine delivered regularly.

299
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,990
Rest and recover here.

300
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,770
Don't think about dying for honor.

301
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,420
If you die,

302
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,470
those soldiers of yours

303
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,280
will be buried with you.

304
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,820
Prince Annan, please wait!

305
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,860
I haven't reported
to the Empress Dowager yet!

306
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,320
This...

307
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,130
This is against the rule!

308
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,700
Your Majesty.

309
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,580
Prince Annan, you're so bold.

310
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,500
How dare you enter the harem

311
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,970
without permission?

312
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,140
You only care about

313
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,350
my intrusion into your chambers.

314
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
You don't care about his life at all.

315
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,290
I suppose

316
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,080
you already know why I'm here.

317
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,010
Defying me is nothing new for you.

318
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,940
When the late emperor was alive,

319
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,220
there was always someone
to clean up your mess.

320
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,050
Now that he is gone,

321
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,020
aren't you worried one imperial decree

322
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,620
could cost you your life?

323
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,290
If I'm afraid,

324
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,740
I wouldn't have come here today.

325
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,580
I command the army by imperial decree.

326
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,380
Military law is stern and absolute.

327
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,310
It brooks no outside interference

328
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,380
or insolence.

329
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,820
I believe

330
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,520
you know that better than anyone.

331
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,220
Though the emperor is young,

332
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,820
in matters of governance and law,

333
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,350
he has entrusted ministers

334
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,250
like Zuo Chengzhi and Qiu Tai

335
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,730
to assist him.

336
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,600
There's no need for external intervention.

337
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,210
Your Majesty, please

338
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,780
remain peacefully in the harem

339
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,740
and take good care of yourself.

340
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,580
Your Majesty.

341
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,620
Shut up!

342
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,720
-Prince Annan.
-Prince Annan.

343
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,490
Does she still refuse to eat or drink?

344
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,530
She ate a little

345
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,650
but soon vomited everything up.

346
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,180
The imperial physician you sent

347
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,660
already came to examine her this morning.

348
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,730
The imperial physician said

349
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,340
it was because of her grief.

350
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,620
Bai Kun has been dealt with
according to military law.

351
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,490
Consider it my explanation to you.

352
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,660
Stop pretending.

353
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,210
Bai Kun told me himself

354
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,100
he did all that under your orders.

355
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,900
But now you are putting on an act.

356
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,450
So hypocritical.

357
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,190
I don't need to explain to you,

358
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,260
but I have always been aboveboard.

359
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,140
I'll never

360
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,880
let anyone slander me.

361
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,270
Since childhood, I've always earned

362
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,600
what I want through my own abilities.

363
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,970
If I'm the same type of person as Bai Kun,

364
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,040
do you think you'd still be alive?

365
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,660
We are both commanders.

366
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,090
The soldiers who serve under us

367
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,350
fight alongside us on the battlefields.

368

That bond is one of life and death.

369

How could I stoop so low

370
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,660

"Rise with the sun,
work hard and study diligently."

She's far away now. Master, rest assured.

512
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,140
This little trick
of moving without a sound—

513
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,470
have I mastered it well?

514
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,210
You've nearly worn out
all the ancient books here.

515
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,620
What exactly are you looking for?

516
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,050
I just want to know—

517
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,100
if the Jade Linglong is so dangerous,

518
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,050
why keep it in this world

519
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,310
to bring endless harm?

520
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,380
The Jade Linglong
can greatly enhance one's power.

521
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,910
Its existence isn't wrong.

522
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,970
What's wrong lies with those
who harbor ill intent

523
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,140
and want to use its power

524
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,400
to do terrible things.

525
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,940
But this kind of power

526
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,660
requires another person

527
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,320
to pay the price with his life.

528
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,430
That can never be a good thing.

529
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,340
I'm wondering

530
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,010
if there's any way

531
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,690
to break the backlash
between the shadow puppet

532
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,100
and the blood master.

533
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,940
You can keep talking,

534
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,270
but don't stop working.

535
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,330
Honor your word. Pay your debt.

536
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,050
At this rate,

537
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,540
how long will it take you

538
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,219
to finish pounding 1,000 bundles of herbs?

539
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,820
My medical skills are exceptional.

540
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,010
I can bring the dead back to life.

541
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,900
I can also
argue with the King of Hell for a soul.

542
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,010
In yesterday's contest,

543
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,570
the topics were child's play.

544
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,100
I simply didn't care to win.

545
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,260
Child's play?

546
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:46,050
Do you have any idea
ailments like presbyopia, tooth decay,

547
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,820
back pain, diarrhea,

548
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,420
and menstrual cramps—

549
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,900
though not critical—

550
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,030
are exactly
what ordinary people suffer from most?

551
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,250
If they're so common,

552
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,340
surely remedies already exist
among the people.

553
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,860
The existing prescriptions among them

554
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,860
can only ease symptoms.
They can't cure them.

555
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,570
Backed by the resources
of the Wuling Mountain,

556
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,450
instead of focusing on
curing rare diseases,

557
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,050
you're obsessed
with studying common ailments.

558
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,510
Isn't that a waste of time?

559
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,450
As long as my prescriptions are accurate

560
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,490
and work quickly enough,

561
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,820
it's not a waste of time.

562
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,900
Stop wasting time

563
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,960
and keep pounding.

564
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,170
You can bring the dead back to life.

565
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,740
I can help people
live free of pain and illness.

566
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,270
Both are worthy of respect,

567
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,310
don't you agree?

568
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,260
These are all common herbs.

569
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,650
Even for research purposes,

570
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,450
you surely don't need this many.

571
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,540
Just pound the herbs.

572
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,260
Honor our bet first.

573
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,170
I...

574
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
have my own plans.

575
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,530
I'm the master.

576
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,490
Naturally, I need to know

577
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,750
where the herbs in my mountain are going.

578
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,530
You're hiding it from me.

579
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,660
You're becoming more and more unruly.

580
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,740
When I first came up the mountain,

581
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,050
you didn't teach me all these rules.

582
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,620
You spoiled me yourself.

583
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,690
Just pound the herbs.

584
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm going to eat...

585
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,030
To take a nap.

586
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,220
From now on,
every time we do something together,

587
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,620
we'll plant a new flower,

588
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,050
until the mountain is covered
with flowers.

589
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,510
They'll be our witnesses.

590
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,090
What do you think?

591
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,500
Prince Annan.

592
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,410
The Empress Dowager
went to Li Shuang's villa.

593
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,570
The Empress Dowager went there?

594
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,170
Yes.

595
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
I'm afraid they might be conspiring

596
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,250
against you.

597
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,280
Prepare a meal box.

598
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,700
I

599
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,970
will deliver it to Li Shuang myself.

600
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,090
You can't do that.

601
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,820
If we don't give her the opportunity,

602
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,880
how can we watch her dig her own grave?

603
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,370
Duan Aodeng is warmongering and ruthless.

604
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,450
Without someone to control him,

605
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,300
he will never cease war easily.

606
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,750
Do you really want to see this world

607
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,740
drown in blood

608
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,010
and endless war?

609
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,250
This is called the Brain-Devouring Powder.

610
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,670
It can help you

611
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,530
get rid of Duan Aodeng.

612
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,430
Have your wounds improved?

613
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,960
Prince Annan, don't waste your time.

614
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,460
I will not sign the letter of surrender.

615
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,540
What is the meaning of this?

616
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,050
I'm worried
you might find dining alone dull.

617
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,610
I've had a long day,

618
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,130
so I don't want to bother

619
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,130
to eat elsewhere.

620
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,650
Sit.

621
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,820
It seems something is missing.

622
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,740
Guards.
