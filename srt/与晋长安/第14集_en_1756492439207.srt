00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,930
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,150
Timing is key when using

4
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,870
the dragon blood herb in medicine.

5
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,039
It must be simmered

6
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,640
over low heat for four hours,

7
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,130
not a moment less.

8
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,200
Otherwise,

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,790
it'll lose all efficacy.

10
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,730
The medicine is ready.

11
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,470
I've tasted it.

12
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,900
Not bitter at all.

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,150
Really.

14
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,630
You liarâ€”

15
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,070
Right?

16
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,390
I didn't lie, huh?

17
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,000
Isn't this candy really sweet

18
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,590
and not bitter at all?

19
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,300
Time for your medicine.

20
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,280
What tricks do you have today?

21
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,150
No tricks today.

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Finish the medicine,

23
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
and I'll perform

24
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,970
anything you want,

25
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,840
as you command.

26
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
Chew on Chinese goldthread dry!

27
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,270
Jin'an.

28
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,720
Hey, brother.

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,270
Wait!

30
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,000
I need to talk to you.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Come on.

32
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,310
You need me?

33
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,070
Let's have a chat.

34
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,430
Sit.

35
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,740
Good wine and food.

36
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,750
Is this a trap?

37
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,120
You've been getting along

38
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
well with General, yeah?

39
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,000
Sort of.

40
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,740
Teach me your ways.

41
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,390
T-Teach you?

42
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,600
Teach you w-what?

43
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,560
There's a girl I'm interested in.

44
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,940
But I thought Lu Xin was

45
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,870
already spoken for?

46
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,980
It's not Lu Xin.

47
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,270
-You like her too?
-You like her too?

48
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,920
You go first.

49
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,530
Qiao!

50
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,230
Good taste.

51
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,460
I thought...

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,630
So you like Qiao?

53
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,220
Yes.

54
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Isn't she wonderful?

55
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,560
The first time I saw her,

56
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,480
she lifted a carriage with her bare hands.

57
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,740
She's stronger than me

58
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,400
and eats way more than I do.

59
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,710
She's all I can think about.

60
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,750
It's true

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,600
that she has

62
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,270
quite a temper,

63
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,090
always hitting and kicking me
for no reason,

64
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,920
but...

65
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,120
but she's

66
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
really wonderful

67
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,740
and very kind.

68
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,870
I really like her.

69
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,870
Sorry about that.

70
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
You're such a go-getter.

71
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,870
Don't worry.

72
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,270
Count on me.

73
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,130
You have a plan?

74
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
What strong legs!

75
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,690
What are you doing?

76
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,700
There are rain,

77
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:39,920
grass,

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,120
flowers,

79
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,190
and sheep;

80
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,800
delightful.

81
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,770
Miss, you know,

82
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,150
I've recently

83
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,909
fallen in love with reading.

84
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,900
Are you sick in the head?

85
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,970
What do you need?

86
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,650
No, nothing.

87
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,420
Your practice is more important.

88
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,210
Go on.

89
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,760
Switching on and off;

90
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,560
darting in the river;

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,790
my fair maiden;

92
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,070
your gentleman...

93
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,420
Your gentleman...

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,400
What nonsense are you reciting?

95
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,710
This is a poem I wrote for you.

96
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,700
Do you like it?

97
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,680
A poem?

98
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Yes.

99
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,630
Then tell me

100
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,720
what this poem

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,510
is supposed to mean.

102
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,680
What it means?

103
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,250
What it means is...

104
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,720
It means

105
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm...

106
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,580
i-inviting you to a river stroll

107
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
and then a meal together.

108
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
What kind of meal?

109
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,750
Gentle meat and mushroom stew.

110
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Didn't I just mention it?

111
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,750
Plus a pot of wine.

112
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,430
A hearty meal of meat and wine,

113
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,490
now that's heaven.

114
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,200
Here you go.

115
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,150
Yes.

116
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,169
Come on,

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,390
you too.

118
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,030
Time for your medicine.

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,810
Time for your medicine.

120
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,870
Seriously? You're always

121
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,330
making me drink medicine.

122
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,750
Even my hiccups smell like medicine now.

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
The last dose.

124
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,830
You said the same thing yesterday.

125
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,440
It seems this medicine
really works wonders.

126
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,960
Just a few days and you already

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,560
have the energy to talk back.

128
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,000
You're recovering better and better,

129
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,630
and I no longer experience
any strange symptoms.

130
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,490
Seems you won't

131
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,410
have to suffer from
the backlash anymore.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,460
This trip to Cang Mountain

133
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,040
has truly been worthwhile.

134
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,200
There's fresh osmanthus cake
at the market.

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
They're really good.

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,150
Once you finish this,

137
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,280
I'll take you there.

138
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,270
No!

139
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,960
Just one sip.

140
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,320
Nope.

141
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,350
Come on. Just one sip.

142
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,650
Half a sip?

143
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,780
Come on now.

144
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,160
I-I'll drink it myself.

145
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,380
When I was sick,

146
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,590
you took care of me like this.

147
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Now, it's my turn.

148
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,220
Here.

149
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,030
Did you...

150
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,030
add honey?

151
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,920
Not so bitter, is it?

152
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,730
By the way,

153
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,390
we've been so busy in battle

154
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,200
that I hadn't thought about this,

155
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,480
but the man who held me hostage
at the hot springs

156
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,120
was desperate to draw you out.

157
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,150
Perhaps he's connected to
whomever caused your memory loss.

158
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,000
If we find him,

159
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,310
all our problems could be solved.

160
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,290
But that person is so elusive.

161
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,410
If he doesn't show up voluntarily,

162
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,750
we have

163
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,750
no way to track him down.

164
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
I remember what he looks like.

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,320
People can search for him

166
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,250
with a portrait.

167
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,480
Since he failed,

168
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,610
he wouldn't have gone far.

169
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,200
Then it's settled.

170
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,480
Go get some paper and brushes,

171
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,880
and I'll do the painting.

172
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,750
Meet me

173
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,830
by the stream.

174
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,230
Have you ever heard of Wuling Mountain?

175
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,750
Nope.

176
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,320
Lu Xin told me

177
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,630
there are geniuses there
adept at using unusual methods

178
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,830
with healing stones.

179
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,510
In this world,

180
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,150
perhaps only they can effect

181
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,000
such changes in humans.

182
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,670
If we locate this place,

183
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
would I be able to

184
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,030
get leads about my origins?

185
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,410
I've sent people to locate it,

186
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,250
but it might take some time.

187
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,200
Knowing my origins would be good.

188
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,730
I'd feel more whole

189
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,840
to know I have roots.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,730
It'd also give me some closure.

191
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,560
But it's fine if we find nothing either.

192
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,890
Because no matter who I am,

193
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,870
I prefer being Jin'an.

194
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,860
When you retire,

195
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,910
let's find

196
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,530
an idyllic abode away from the world,

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,140
enjoying every day

198
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,530
drinking wine,

199
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,880
practicing swordplay,

200
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,690
and ignoring worldly affairs in peace.

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
Who said I want to spend my life with you?

202
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,600
Ouyang Jun has many friends
among the outlaws.

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,320
Get him to seek him out

204
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,450
with this portrait.

205
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,850
What's this smell?

206
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,750
Seek...

207
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,470
Go on.

208
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,120
Seeking him out

209
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,880
with this painting of yours...

210
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,440
What's wrong with my painting?

211
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,300
I've never been good at painting.

212
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,140
It's more or else accurate.
That's good enough.

213
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,810
You do it if you're so capable.

214
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,520
I'll give it a go then.

215
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,480
Jin'an really has a way with her.

216
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,120
When Shuang gets angry,

217
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
she usually draws her sword,

218
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,960
but now she's actually being coy.

219
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,550
That rascal Jin'an is always

220
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,570
clinging to General.

221
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,630
Who knows what he's really scheming.

222
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,750
They're clearly in love with each other.

224
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,000
What a perfect match.

225
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,880
Ridiculous!

226
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,390
General is extraordinary and worldly.

227
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,360
She wouldn't fall for
this weak, pretty boy's

228
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
cheap tricks.

229
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,030
If you ask me,

230
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,480
only that righteous masked hero

231
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,960
barely qualifies

232
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,380
to be with our general.

233
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,390
Choosing a lifetime partner

234
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,200
isn't picking soldiers for battle.

235
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,480
You should pick one

236
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
with a pretty face

237
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,270
and a sweet tongue

238
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,520
to keep by your side.

239
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,910
Your future days

240
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,850
will be much more enjoyable.

241
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,390
The man in black is incredibly strong

242
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,520
and admired by many.

243
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,760
I'm very strong too.

244
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,720
That man in black...

245
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,240
Where is he?

246
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,750
That man in black

247
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,600
always appears with
a mask over his face.

248
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,150
He could be

249
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
super ugly with pockmarks all over.

250
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,370
But handsome men are never reliable.

251
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,610
Nonsense!

252
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,630
Anyway,

253
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,280
I know Shuang best.

254
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,670
If you don't believe me,

255
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,720
want to make a bet?

256
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,150
If Jin'an wins,

257
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,550
you'll have to

258
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,670
grind 15 kg of herbs for me.

259
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,030
Deal.

260
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,260
If the man in black wins,

261
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,750
I want the biggest sword

262
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,520
from Wang's Blacksmith.

263
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,330
It's a deal.

264
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,830
Your painting is...

265
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,870
quite decent,

266
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,240
but compared to mine,

267
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
it's not much better.

268
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,600
You're right, General.

269
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,550
Various painting styles have been
recorded in history.

270
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,160
Your painting and mine are

271
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,290
just of different styles.

272
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,590
Your painting is...

273
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,990
exceptionally wild.

274
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,480
Are you mocking me?

275
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,220
What a strong push!

276
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,000
Sorry,

277
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,070
I keep assuming you are
as formidable as the man in black.

278
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,830
I forgot that you're a weak kitten now.

279
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,680
Am I really

280
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,960
that inferior to him?

281
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,610
Yes.

282
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,880
Don't go!

283
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,640
Did I say anything wrong?

284
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,700
Enjoying the smell of pickles?

285
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,490
Nice to run into you!

286
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,350
It smells good and tastes good.

287
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,880
Try some.

288
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,240
Weren't you two just making a bet?

289
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,110
I want in too.

290
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,970
All-in on Jin'an!

291
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,750
Just like me!

292
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,220
Impulsive people sure are big spenders.

293
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,930
Ouyang Jun.

294
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,200
Lady Li.

295
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,110
Make copies of this

296
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,750
and distribute them to your buddies.

297
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,950
Seek this person out.

298
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:18,960
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,560
Remember,

300
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,310
this mystery man's unbelievably skilled.

301
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,200
Don't confront him head-on.

302
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,190
Safety comes first.

303
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,850
Yes, ma'am.

304
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,640
Lu Xin.

305
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,760
Don't you find the pickles smelly?

306
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,160
Not at all!

307
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
I like it as much as the flies.

308
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,720
Alright.

309
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,790
Master.

310
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,380
I just received news

311
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,000
that a team has secretly
departed from Yao State,

312
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,550
apparently sent by Zuo Chengzhi

313
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,990
to search for Prince Annan.

314
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,310
If the shadow puppet's identity
is exposed,

315
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,510
it'll be disastrous.

316
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Should we make our move now?

317
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,240
If we kill this team,

318
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,400
they'll just send more people.

319
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,190
Then what do you suggest?

320
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,240
They've reached Taijin's border,

321
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,140
so they won't dare
cause too much commotion.

322
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,960
Keep an eye on them secretly.

323
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,530
When we find out
who they're in contact with,

324
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,750
we'll strike.

325
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,110
Understood.

326
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,680
Master.

327
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,480
The shadow puppet is formidable
to begin with.

328
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,040
Even if punishment is necessary,

329
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,970
the Empress Dowager's methods
seem far too extreme.

330
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,110
You may go.

331
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes, sir.

332
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

333
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,880
Does Your Majesty remember

334
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,030
that today is my birthday?

335
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,750
Where is Aodeng?

336
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,320
What have you done to him?

337
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,160
Your Majesty is being difficult again,

338
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,790
always bringing up

339
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,720
people who aren't relevant.

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
I risked my life to save Your Majesty,

341
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,160
only to be with you

342
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,880
as equals in marriage

343
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,140
and share our lives together.

344
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,110
But Your Majesty

345
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,800
only thinks about your brother.

346
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,160
Doesn't that make

347
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,560
all my efforts in vain?

348
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,000
I suppose for the next three days,

349
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,420
Your Majesty won't even need
to drink water.

350
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,140
[Cangyun Pavilion]

351
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,480
So?

352
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Recall anything?

353
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
I told you

354
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,090
this condition isn't easy to cure.

355
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,920
No matter how eager you are,

356
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,880
you can't go against medical principles.

357
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
This won't do.

358
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,640
Again!

359
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Again?

360
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,210
You think this is a game?

361
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,000
Honestly,

362
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,790
why are you suddenly

363
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,110
so impatient to recover your memory?

364
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,910
Oh, please, it's as clear as day.

365
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,000
During the battle at Lucheng,

366
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,070
you stormed the tower alone
and captured Li Zhangyi

367
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,160
so impressively.

368
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,570
But who would've thought

369
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,550
a mysterious man in black would appear

370
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,440
and fight alongside Shuang,

371
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,440
totally stealing your thunder.

372
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,680
If it were me, I'd be anxious too.

373
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,660
Am I really that petty?

374
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,880
You think he's better than me too?

375
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,430
What I think doesn't matter.

376
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,430
What matters is what Shuang thinks.

377
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,430
You only came to me

378
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,880
because you're worried
you're not worthy of Shuang

379
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
with your memory loss, right?

380
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,310
But what if

381
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,000
you recall everything

382
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,410
and realize that

383
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,030
you're just average?

384
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,110
I'd rather be average,

385
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,070
as long as I know who I am.

386
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,120
By the way,

387
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,750
Shuang told me...

388
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,240
Who?

389
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,100
You told her...

390
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:52,830
By the way,

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,880
General told me

392
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,570
that you told her about Wuling Mountain.

393
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,930
What else do you know?

394
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,070
I only know rumors.

395
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,400
People talk about that place
as if it's magical,

396
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,860
but no one has ever seen it.

397
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,110
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

398
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,790
So everything you told me was a lie,

399
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,640
including your promise

400
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,510
to cure me?

401
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,440
You can doubt my medical skills,

402
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,960
but don't question my medical ethics!

403
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,880
This is

404
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,750
my latest concoction,

405
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,480
specifically for amnesia.

406
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,540
It's not identical

407
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,980
to your condition,

408
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,880
but it might still be of use.

409
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,420
If you've got the guts,

410
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,590
give it a try.

411
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,510
I've tried everything else.

412
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,570
This won't kill me!

413
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,720
How do you feel?

414
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,000
My mouth feels numb.

415
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,640
Numb mouth...

416
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,270
My chest feels warm.

417
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,710
Warm chest...

418
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,830
My face is a bit itchy.

419
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,360
Itchy face...

420
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,750
And...

421
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I think that's it.

422
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,720
I hope that's it

423
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
for the side effects.

424
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,400
No, let me check again.

425
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,240
Medicine

426
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,270
needs time to take effect.

427
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm suddenly so tired.

428
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,940
I'm going for a nap.

429
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,400
If you need anything,

430
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,750
don't bother calling me.

431
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,810
Alright, go ahead.

432
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,350
Jin'an.

433
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,960
Jin'an!

434
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
The food is ready.

435
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,660
What are you doing?

436
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm...

437
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,430
not eating. You all go ahead.

438
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,440
Are you not feeling well?

439
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Let me take a look.

440
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,480
No!

441
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,950
I've caught a cold.

442
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,120
What's with the blanket?

443
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,060
I don't want to pass it to you.

444
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Oh, please, I take tonics every day.

445
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,590
A mere cold is nothing to me.

446
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,110
Let me see.

447
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,590
No.

448
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,520
-Let me see!
-No!

449
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,520
Go eat dinner.

450
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,930
I know my limits.

451
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,360
I won't neglect myself.

452
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,280
Fine then.

453
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,830
In that case,

454
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,540
you should rest up.

455
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,610
You got me worried for nothing.

456
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,350
I'm used to seeing you
clean-shaven and fresh,

457
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,680
but this rugged look

458
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,960
actually

459
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,510
has its own charm.

460
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,030
I asked Lu Xin for help

461
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,900
to speed up my memory recovery

462
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,040
and for info on Wuling Mountain.

463
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,270
But after taking her medicine,

464
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,400
I ended up like this.

465
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,050
What's wrong with this?

466
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,920
Now, you look

467
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,350
quite manly.

468
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,360
I think it really suits you.

469
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,600
So you do prefer masculine men.

470
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,240
Like...

471
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,470
the man in black.

472
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,570
You don't have a fever.

473
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,590
Mister,

474
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,560
aren't you the man in black?

475
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,790
Right.

476
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,270
But also not.

477
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,240
You don't get it.

478
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,990
What's not to get?

479
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,680
Come, follow me.

480
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,810
Go have dinner. Don't worry about me.

481
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,160
I can ignore the man in black,

482
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,200
but not you.

483
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,400
It's just a bit of a beard.

484
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,790
At worst,

485
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,750
I'll shave it for you.

486
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,030
You will?

487
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,690
A freshly-sharpened blade,

488
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,770
sharper than a tiger's fangs.

489
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,370
Dear lord.

490
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,610
I've been saying I'd teach you,

491
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,590
but things kept getting in the way.

492
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,270
Now,

493
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,480
while we're out sightseeing,

494
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,340
let's catch up on all the missed lessons.

495
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,680
Taking lessons while sightseeing

496
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,880
doesn't sound right.

497
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,360
Doesn't sound right?

498
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,640
You really think so?

499
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,640
Fine.

500
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,350
Today,

501
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,510
we'll start with something useful.

502
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,510
Was this...

503
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,780
painted by you?

504
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,720
May the bright clouds and moon

505
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,350
carry my longing to my dear ones far away.

506
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,110
I didn't expect you
to have such good handwriting.

507
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,200
Who knows? Perhaps I was

508
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,790
a somewhat educated teacher before.

509
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,680
Look,

510
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,270
your handwriting

511
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,590
is strong and powerful,

512
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,750
bold and heroic.

513
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,350
As they say, your handwriting
reflects who you are.

514
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,350
I believe you must

515
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,470
have an extraordinary background.

516
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,960
If I'm not mistaken,

517
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,430
this must be the Double Dragons Formation
from The Art of War.

518
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,700
As they say, warfare is
the art of deception.

519
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,960
My forces are now moving to surround you,

520
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,590
so be careful.

521
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,490
As they say,
the student surpasses the master.

522
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,100
Passable.

523
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,300
Anything else?

524
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,190
Stop!

525
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,970
What kind of technique is that?

526
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,670
Buddy, you don't know this,

527
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,000
but martial artists

528
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,920
prefer to be spontaneous.

529
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,820
Spontaneous, indeed.

530
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,960
But

531
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,350
the guqin

532
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,510
has its own rules.

533
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,590
Sit properly.

534
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,920
Hands in position.

535
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,940
Curl your fingers.

536
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,790
Good.

537
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,130
Let's begin.

538
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,570
Oh, my mighty general,

539
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,310
your music pierces the ears.

540
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,270
Perhaps it could drive away enemies
on the battlefield.

541
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:17,960
Stop!

542
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,690
Take a break.

543
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,310
Must you

544
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,640
be that harsh?

545
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,640
Our Shuang's music

546
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,880
may not be as sublime as the classics

547
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,640
or very aesthetically pleasing,

548
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,160
but

549
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,040
it's at the very least
music that lingers.

550
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,590
How is it noise

551
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,990
to repel enemies?

552
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,630
What a flirt.

553
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,440
If that's the case,

554
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,590
I'll play another piece.

555
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,360
-I'm good.
-I'm good.

556
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,830
It seems what you want

557
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,880
isn't just spices.

558
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,790
You're straightforward, Mr. Zang.

559
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,390
Since we're asking for help,

560
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,310
there's no point in hiding our intentions.

561
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,330
We've come today

562
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,400
to inquire about someone.

563
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,550
Who?

564
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,400
You have extensive connections
and access to information.

565
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,110
Please help us find someone.

566
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,180
Have you seen this person?

567
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,320
Though you two are disguised as merchants,

568
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,610
the people around you,

569
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,200
with their posture and bearing,

570
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,130
clearly come from military ranks.

571
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,410
Ninglan has always been
a neutral territory.

572
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,070
Today's battle has just ended,

573
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,440
and Taijin hasn't withdrawn
its forces yet.

574
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,639
Those who need to sneak into the city now

575
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,150
are probably

576
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,360
only the Yao Army.

577
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,280
You're really perceptive, Mr. Zang.

578
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,320
No wonder nothing
in the cities beyond the border

579
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,670
escapes you.

580
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,550
We'll have to trouble you

581
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,330
to locate this person.

582
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,920
These today are

583
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,530
just a down payment.

584
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,310
If you find any leads,

585
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,040
I guarantee the reward

586
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,070
will be no less than threefold.

587
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,540
If it were just one box,

588
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,030
I'd be happy to help.

589
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,630
But this generosity...

590
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,790
I dare not take on

591
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,130
such life-threatening business.

592
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,320
What do you mean?

593
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,400
I'm afraid a young man

594
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,800
of this age and build,

595
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,030
worth millions of taels,

596
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,110
and in command of Yao Army

597
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,480
such that the Yao soldiers
travel all the way

598
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
from the Yao State border to Ninglan
in search of him

599
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,280
can only be Prince Annan, Duan Aodeng!

600
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,250
Since you've already figured it out,

601
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,590
you must understand
the weight of this matter.

602
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,440
Will you

603
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,390
help me with this

604
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,140
or not?

605
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,710
If I fail,

606
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,210
I'll take triple the treasure.

607
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
But if I succeed,

608
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,150
I fear I won't be able to
stay in Ninglan anymore.

609
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,000
Then I'll have to become
an official in the Yao State,

610
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,380
living off taxes for the rest of my life.

611
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,630
Can you promise me that?

612
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,760
It's a deal.

613
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,670
Deal.

614
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,320
Deliver this letter secretly into Lucheng

615
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,150
and hand it to General Li Shuang
personally.

616
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
You must tell her

617
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,080
that the person she found is

618
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,340
none other than Duan Aodeng,
Prince Annan of the Yao State.

619
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,200
Didn't you just make a deal with
those Yao soldiers?

620
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,920
That was just a delaying tactic.

621
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,120
In the previous battle,

622
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,110
the Yao people entered the city
and slaughtered our civilians.

623
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,510
Fortunately, General Li kept her promise

624
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,230
and her Changfeng Army arrived in time,

625
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,840
securing Ninglan.

626
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,190
I, Zang Budu, am not a greedy person.

627
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,280
This kindness

628
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,690
must be repaid.

629
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,640
Go along now.

630
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,200
Yes, sir.

631
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,870
Master,

632
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,070
everyone in the Zang Mansion
has been eliminated.

633
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,040
We can't handle the shadow puppet,

634
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,280
so we need outside help.

635
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,670
You must now

636
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,130
make sure
the people on Wuling Mountain know

637
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,800
they're responsible for

638
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,760
this massacre at Zang Mansion.

639
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,150
[Cangyun Pavilion]

640
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,130
Where's everyone?

641
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,080
I sent them back to Lucheng.

642
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,710
We need to go on a trip.

643
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,920
Where?

644
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,490
Ninglan?

645
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,150
I asked Zang Budu
to investigate your background,

646
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,480
but we haven't heard from him.

647
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,080
Ninglan isn't far from here.

648
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
Let's pay him a visit.

649
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:27,900
[Zang Mansion]

650
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,550
A massacre?

651
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,020
Yes.

652
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,190
The incident was reported by

653
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,510
a local farmer who regularly

654
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,000
delivers vegetables to the Zang Mansion.

655
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,840
This time, he found the gates tightly shut

656
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,970
and no one answered.

657
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,840
Zang Budu, his wife and children,

658
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
and his servants and stewardsâ€”

659
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,300
all 13 members of the household
were killed.

660
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,920
Was it a robbery?

661
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,050
I'm afraid not.

662
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,760
There are

663
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,880
no valuables missing from the mansion.

664
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,960
We even found a chest of jewelry

665
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,490
bearing the Yao State seal.

666
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,140
In the battle of Ninglan,

667
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,720
thanks to Zang Budu providing the map,

668
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,690
our army barely managed to win.

669
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,980
If it was truly the Yao State's doing,

670
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
they must be harboring resentment.

671
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,480
But that day,

672
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,990
he was under my coercion.

673
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,760
You did nothing wrong.

674
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,660
If you hadn't planned ahead,

675
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,630
the death toll of civilians
would've skyrocketed,

676
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,100
Ninglan would've fallen to Yao,

677
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,760
and Lucheng

678
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,010
couldn't have been saved.

679
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,110
This happened because of me.

680
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,070
I should take full responsibility.

681
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,810
Rest assured, Mr. Zang.

682
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,400
From now on...

683
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,660
I'll protect Ninglan for you.

684
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,730
[Mo Yin of Wuling Mountain]

685
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,280
Master.

686
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,360
We've received news

687
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,960
of a man in black in Lucheng.

688
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,150
He's extraordinarily powerful,

689
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,670
akin to thousands of troops,

690
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,800
and helped Changfeng Army
repel the Yao army.

691
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,460
He's basically indomitable.

692
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,070
Do you know where he comes from?

693
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,920
No one knows.

694
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,150
Also,

695
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,240
a tragic incident has occurred
in Ninglan City.

696
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,970
It seems to be his doing as well.

697
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,560
This matter sounds suspicious.

698
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,850
It must be related to the Jade Linglong.

699
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,880
I guess

700
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,800
I'll have to make a trip there.
