00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,930
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 3]

3
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,710
Are you feeling better?

4
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,760
It's so late

5
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,820
and you're still not sleeping.

6
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,080
Are you thinking about Li Ting?

7
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,730
I heard about what happened
at the stronghold today.

8
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,030
I understand
you weren't trying to kill him

9
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
but instead
were confident you could save him.

10
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,740
You're sick yourself,

11
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,590
yet you're still worrying about
someone else?

12
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,990
You're not someone else.

13
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,750
You saved me

14
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,800
and gave me shelter.

15
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,240
Do you know

16
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,030
why I brought you back with me?

17
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,120
When I was young,

18
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,530
I was just like you,

19
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,960
homeless and displaced.

20
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,560
If the Grand General hadn't taken me in

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,329
and given me a place to stay,

22
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,430
I would have starved to death long ago.

23
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,000
So the sibling relationship

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
between Li Ting and I

25
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,080
is in name only.

26
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,960
If that's the case,

27
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,490
it's even more important that you
explain everything clearly to him.

28
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,330
The Grand General always taught me

29
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,150
not to over-explain

30
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,630
the things I've said

31
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,800
or done.

32
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,480
People sometimes

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,920
only care about results.

34
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,020
Whether the process was good or bad,

35
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,090
right or wrong...

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,079
depends entirely on
their quick judgment.

37
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,840
As long as we rescued Ting,

38
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,000
nothing else

39
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
matters.

40
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,870
Since you care about him so much,

41
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,630
yet he misunderstands you like this,

42
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,960
don't you feel wronged?

43
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,910
That's the biggest difference
between us two.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,710
We were both taken in as orphans,

45
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,120
but you

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,190
are bold

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,079
and dare to take what isn't yours,

48
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,630
while I must be cautious

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,690
and can't afford to feel sorry for myself.

50
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,680
Alright,

51
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,560
since you're not feeling well,
get some rest.

52
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Come on, scoot in.

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,210
Scoot in.

54
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,430
going to sleep in the bed too?

56
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,560
Of course.

57
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,280
Do you expect me,

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,310
a general, to sleep on the floor for you?

59
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,990
Hurry up.

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,170
Get in, quickly.

61
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,430
Lie down properly

62
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,310
and tuck in.

63
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,579
Be good and go to sleep.

64
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,260
Got it?

65
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,540
What's with this weather?

66
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm freezing to death.

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,380
I'd rather die
than do night watch again.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Tomorrow, we'll really need to
grease some palms

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,530
and properly pay our respects
to Deputy General Luo.

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,210
What's wrong? Move along.

71
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,690
Who are you?

72
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,480
What do you mean?

73
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm Jin'an.

74
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,310
I...

75
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:10,980
I really am Jin'an.

76
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,100
If you don't believe me,
look at my clothes.

77
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,010
Don't move.

78
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,660
If you dare act improperly again,

79
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,050
I'll kill you with one strike of my sword.

80
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,270
But I really am Jin'an.

81
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,310
Think about it.

82
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,830
This is the general's quarters.

83
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,190
It's heavily guarded outside,

84
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,520
and you're so cautious.

85
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,630
If someone really broke in at night,

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
how could you possibly not know?

87
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
If you still don't believe me,

88
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,950
look at my pants.

89
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,430
Cover up.

90
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,240
Anyway, I am Jin'an.

91
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,520
If you don't believe me,

92
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,210
just kill me then.

93
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,800
Speak.

94
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
Why did you become like this?

95
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,310
Speak!

96
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,920
I...

97
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,870
I don't know either.

98
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,390
It's strange indeed.

99
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,159
Although I don't know why,

100
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,520
you have to believe me.

101
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,680
General.

102
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,040
I have something to report.

103
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,370
Someone's calling you.

104
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,130
Don't make a sound.

105
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,720
If anyone finds out

106
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
there's a half-naked man in my room,

107
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,390
I'll cut you into a thousand pieces.

108
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:49,980
Hide well.

109
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,020
Hurry.

110
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,310
Who are you people?

111
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,010
Hide!

112
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm glad you're alright.

113
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,910
Jade Linglong,

114
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,290
I've finally found you.

115
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Why do I have no strength?

116
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,630
Gen...

117
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,550
General!

118
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,600
General!

119
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,030
General!

120
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,000
Save me, General!

121
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,880
General!

122
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,360
General!

123
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,240
Strike between his eyebrows.

124
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,300
He's not dead.

125
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,160
His pressure points were sealed.

126
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,270
Someone actually controlled the soldiers

127
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,570
and infiltrated our ranks.

128
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,780
It's such a bizarre method.

129
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,900
Could they be deliberately creating chaos

130
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,260
to rescue Huo Du?

131
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,790
Tonight's assassination attempt

132
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,790
wasn't just

133
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,590
targeting you, General, was it?

134
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,200
Could they be after
the person in your tent?

135
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,030
General,

136
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,110
that person wasn't properly clothed

137
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,310
and his behavior was truly suspicious.

138
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,840
Why are you coughing?

139
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
Isn't he suspicious?

140
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,390
It's the General's lover.

141
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,480
Shut up.

142
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,390
Luo Teng.

143
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,240
Take those two soldiers

144
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
to Lu Xin's clinic.

145
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
All strategic locations in the camp

146
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,240
must be heavily guarded.

147
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,080
Don't give the enemy an opportunity.

148
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,630
Also,

149
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,630
keep Huo Du under close watch.

150
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,080
Yes.

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,750
Yes.

152
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,270
A child with extraordinary fighting skills

153
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
turned into an adult overnight

154
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,480
and somehow lost all his strength?

155
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,100
Since this is the case,

156
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,160
then I pose no threat to you.

157
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,330
Whether as a child or an adult,

158
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,890
have I ever harmed you?

159
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
How did you know we had to

160
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,330
strike them between the brows?

161
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,090
I saw a needle at the back of their heads

162
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,850
and thought it was strange,

163
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,790
so

164
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,410
I figured that must be the key.

165
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,670
Those two

166
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,940
were clearly coming after you.

167
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,690
Who are you really?

168
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
So you noticed too?

169
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
They wanted to capture me

170
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,480
but didn't dare to hurt me.

171
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,670
It's quite strange.

172
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,530
I want to know who I am
even more than you do.

173
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,180
Do you remember that day

174
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,730
when I escaped from the camp

175
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
and then came back?

176
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,000
I was exhausted then

177
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,440
and some images flashed through my mind.

178
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,300
I think there was a stone chamber.

179
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,870
That place must be

180
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,750
near where I found you.

181
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,320
Whether it's true or not,

182
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,850
I'll take you to look for it.

183
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,290
If I find anything suspicious about you,

184
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,380
I'll show no mercy.

185
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,120
You saved my life in the first place.

186
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
If you want to,

187
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,430
feel free to reclaim it anytime.

188
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,770
Someone actually managed to undo
Master's acupoint-sealing needle.

189
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,310
He not only undid
my manipulation,

190
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
but also gained the protection
of the Changfeng Army.

191
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,120
Prince Annan

192
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,810
has become a shadow puppet,

193
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,670
but he remains cunning and untamable.

194
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,800
It's Li Shuang and that shadow puppet.

195
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,900
This direction...

196
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,300
They're heading to the Barren Forest.

197
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,730
Since they want to walk into our trap,

198
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,770
we should graciously oblige them.

199
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,610
You ride quite well.

200
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,400
My limbs are about to fall off.

201
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm guessing you escaped

202
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,410
through this forest that day, didn't you?

203
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,390
There might be danger inside.

204
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,550
Everyone,

205
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,170
dismount and enter the forest. Stay alert.

206
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,930
Don't overlook anything suspicious.

207
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,770
-Yes.
-Yes.

208
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,200
Master.

209
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,470
This shadow puppet
never leaves Li Shuang's side.

210
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,760
How can we capture him?

211
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,190
Naturally, I have my ways.

212
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,270
You can barely ride a horse.

213
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,600
Stop trying to show off.

214
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
At least I'm an adult.

215
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,610
If nothing else,
I can serve as a human shield.

216
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,740
These branches were broken recently.

217
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,050
Couldn't have been more than 10 days ago.

218
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,840
A child

219
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,720
couldn't have caused such a disturbance.

220
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,890
Could it be

221
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,400
he was in adult form at that time?

222
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,130
General,

223
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,640
there's a tunnel entrance over there.

224
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,700
Did you think of something?

225
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,270
It feels so familiar.

226
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,800
Ji Ran.

227
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,200
I'll go down and take a look.

228
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,650
I'll go with you.

229
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,320
Very well,

230
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,010
let's go.

231
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,160
General,

232
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,030
be careful of traps.

233
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
I'm well aware.

234
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,510
Let's split into two groups

235
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,589
to cover for each other.

236
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,109
Okay.

237
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,510
Prison break!

238
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,700
Follow me

239
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,460
and fight our way out!

240
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,720
Huo Du has been rescued!

241
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,380
After them!

242
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,390
Sir, this way.

243
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,710
Let's go!

244
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
It's Huo Du!

245
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Quick! After him!

246
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Catch him!

247
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,480
Hurry!

248
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,830
They're over there!

249
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,630
Go after them!

250
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,070
It seems

251
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,880
there's been a fierce battle here.

252
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,500
She's dead.

253
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,440
That's his scent.

254
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,420
It's you!

255
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,890
It seems to be coming from the tunnel.

256
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,360
I hope General's side is safe.

257
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,890
Let's go!

258
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,630
Jin'an!

259
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,910
General,

260
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,410
are you alright?

261
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,070
I'm fine.

262
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,190
Chase them.

263
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,280
Chase them!

264
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,190
Quickly!

265
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,250
Search over there.

266
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,190
They couldn't have gone far.

267
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,870
Find them!

268
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,510
Yes.

269
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,040
Huo Du.

270
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,460
Huo Du!

271
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,860
Do you dare?

272
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
Surround him!

273
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,000
Huo Du,

274
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,000
release Li Ting

275
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,310
and I'll spare your life.

276
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,680
Spare my life?

277
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,010
Will the imperial court agree to that?

278
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,510
I'm giving you two options.

279
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,350
Either let me go,

280
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,670
or watch your brother

281
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,750
die with me!

282
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,160
Li Ting.

283
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,710
Li Ting.

284
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,950
Li Ting?

285
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,090
Li Ting?

286
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,640
He's dead.

287
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Take Huo Du's body

288
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,060
back to the military camp.

289
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,590
Yes.

290
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,130
What about him?

291
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,990
Secretly take him back
to the General's Residence.

292
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,400
Yes.

293
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,000
This Jade Linglong

294
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,110
was planted in
the shadow puppet's body recently

295
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,590
and is clearly unstable,

296
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,200
but even so,

297
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,960
it can still exert such terrifying power.

298
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,270
Master,

299
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,230
I think we should just find an opportunity

300
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,710
to kill that female general.

301
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,730
Once the blood master dies,

302
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,860
the shadow puppet will
naturally be ours for the taking.

303
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,440
Right now, the connection between
the blood master and puppet is unstable.

304
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,990
Even if we kill the blood master,

305
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,510
it will be of no use.

306
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,330
So you're saying

307
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,990
we need to target him directly?

308
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,110
Seems that without complete confidence,

309
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,570
we'll have to wait
for another opportunity.

310
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,660
[Lucheng]

311
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,430
[General's Residence]

312
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,310
Line up!

313
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
Greetings, General.

314
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,720
The person sent from the army
has been placed in the side room.

315
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,680
Strengthen the security in the mansion

316
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,830
and make sure
not a word of this leaks out.

317
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,270
Yes.

318
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,470
Who are you?

319
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,310
Where am I?

320
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,270
Who are you?

321
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm...

322
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,030
Aren't you in pain?

323
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
Asleep again?

324
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,470
Then I'll prick you awake.

325
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,150
That won't be necessary.

326
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,610
With so many injuries,

327
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,120
you can still move freely.

328
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,780
That's truly extraordinary.

329
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,350
I heard them say

330
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,900
that you not only have amnesia,

331
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,030
but you also transformed from a child.

332
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,530
How did you transform?

333
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,630
Transform for me.

334
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,550
Just once.

335
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,460
I want to see it.

336
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,570
Is it starting already?

337
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,810
Is it dangerous?

338
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,940
How long does it take?

339
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,920
You're done?

340
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,140
The supernatural strength
and heightened senses disappeared again.

341
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,070
Why on earth did I become like this?

342
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,890
It's none of your business.

343
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,790
Then drink this medicine
to strengthen your body first.

344
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
You really think you can move freely now?

345
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,630
Shuang entrusted you to me,

346
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,970
so you're my patient now.

347
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,640
How can you run off
without being properly treated?

348
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,350
General?

349
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,540
Is she alright?

350
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,790
She's fine.

351
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,880
Where is she?

352
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,290
Why don't you worry about yourself first?

353
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,270
Don't you want to know

354
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,310
why you have this strange condition?

355
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,200
Don't you want to find out

356
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,730
about your own background?

357
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,430
Can you really cure me?

358
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,630
Interesting.

359
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,350
When it comes to medical skills,

360
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,350
in all of Lucheng,

361
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,590
if I, Lu Xin, claim to be second best,

362
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,320
no one dares to claim they're first.

363
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,000
First, drink this medicine
to strengthen your body.

364
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,840
As for your strange condition,

365
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,100
we'll treat it slowly.

366
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,090
Weren't you moving around quite freely?

367
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,270
I had a close call.

368
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,200
Shuang, with that look on your face,

369
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,660
I might as well
have let that villain kill me.

370
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,120
From what you're saying,

371
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,450
you don't think
you did anything wrong at all.

372
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,960
Huo Du escaped,

373
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,530
and I caught up with him.

374
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,540
If I don't get credit, so be it.

375
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,940
What did I do wrong?

376
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,160
Have you lost your mind?

377
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,290
This first lash is because

378
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,050
you don't even know what you did wrong!

379
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,590
Acting recklessly,

380
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
obsessed with glory,

381
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,910
putting yourself in danger,

382
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,350
and complicating Father's rescue.

383
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,690
Were you wrong or not?

384
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,550
Have you ever hit me before in my life?

385
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,010
Is this really necessary?

386
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,670
This second lash is because

387
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,530
you don't deserve your position!

388
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,030
Since you joined the Changfeng Army,

389
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,310
you've done nothing but complain

390
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,110
and bark orders at the soldiers.

391
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,110
As the son of the Li family,

392
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,490
your every word and action

393
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,010
is under public scrutiny.

394
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,280
Throwing childish tantrums

395
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,390
and bringing shame to our family,

396
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,560
were you wrong or not?

397
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Whipping my arms and legs, fine!

398
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,310
Go ahead, whip me.

399
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,340
Whip me to death!

400
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,190
If I've done anything else wrong,

401
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,320
just punish me for everything at once.

402
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,010
The third lash

403
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,510
is for your disrespect toward your elders.

404
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm indeed
not Father's biological daughter,

405
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,120
but I am still his daughter.

406
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,770
You don't have to accept me,

407
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,680
but you must respect Father's decisions.

408
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,440
Were you wrong or not?

409
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,750
No,

410
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,160
I seek glory,

411
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,160
but I also hope

412
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,040
that you can think highly of me.

413
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,270
Fine.

414
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,750
Since you think

415
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,550
I'm such a disloyal and unfilial person,

416
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,160
you might as well beat me to death

417
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
and rid the Li family of this menace!

418
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,370
This fourth lash...

419
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,480
I deserve it myself.

420
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,090
You grew up with me since childhood

421
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,840
and turned out like this.

422
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,850
Clearly, I didn't guide you properly.

423
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,310
It's my fault.

424
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,510
That brother of yours is a grown man

425
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,440
and still doesn't know any better.

426
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,670
He really needs to be taught a lesson.

427
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,200
But while it's one thing
to discipline him,

428
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,260
why did you discipline yourself too?

429
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,720
You just came from Jin'an's place.

430
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,750
How is he now?

431
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,310
He's quite the special case.

432
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,640
In all my years,

433
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,720
I've never seen such a strange condition.

434
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,120
It's not even documented in medical texts.

435
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,070
I need to study him thoroughly.

436
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,110
But his body is too weak right now,

437
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,960
so the most urgent thing

438
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,270
is to help him recover.

439
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,350
First, there were soldiers
with acupuncture points blocked,

440
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,110
moving mindlessly.

441
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Then, there was a woman
who had been long-dead

442
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,160
but could still kill people.

443
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,480
And now, there's Jinan

444
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,270
who can change his size.

445
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,400
If I didn't know you so well,

446
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,710
I would seriously wonder

447
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,110
if that's Changfeng Army
or Wuling Mountain you're running.

448
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,679
Wuling Mountain?

449
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,340
What place is that?

450
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,360
It's like a sacred pilgrimage site

451
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,030
for medical practitioners.

452
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,070
They say

453
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,560
their medical skills there are miraculous,

454
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,159
able to revive the dead
and grow flesh on bones.

455
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,260
From what you're saying,

456
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,120
if we find Wuling Mountain,

457
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,560
we might be able to figure everything out.

458
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,280
But Wuling Mountain

459
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,800
operates with integrity

460
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,320
and would never harm people
through shady means.

461
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,110
Besides,

462
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,110
to avoid worldly conflicts,

463
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,580
they've been isolated
from the outside world for decades.

464
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,150
Don't worry.

465
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,760
Though his condition is unusual,

466
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,800
I believe

467
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,230
it's not incurable.

468
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Once I heal him

469
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
and he remembers everything,

470
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,400
the truth will come to light.

471
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,960
In that case,

472
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,690
we'll have to leave it at that for now.

473
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,590
Thank you for today.

474
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,350
I'll have someone escort you back.

475
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,930
I don't want to go back.

476
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,590
If you have nothing to do
when you get back,

477
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,590
I just remembered

478
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,070
our camp is running low

479
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,280
on hemostatic herbs.

480
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,960
Go deliver some.

481
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,200
Just give them to Ji Ran.

482
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,190
You're so kind, General.

483
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,850
The Changfeng Army
is truly blessed to have you.

484
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,620
Here.

485
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,550
Premium medicine

486
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,700
for that precious brother of yours.

487
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,810
Keep an eye on Jin'an for me.

488
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,920
I'll be back in a couple of days.

489
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,150
I'm off, General Shuang.
