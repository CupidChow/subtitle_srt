We may not have been born on the same day,

it can transform a living person
into an obedient shadow puppet.

22

through a blood contract,

24
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,830
and when nourished with blood essence,

25
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,310
it gains extraordinary power,

the shadow puppet
will lose all previous memories,

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,200
Untie him.

175
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,980
-Yes.
-Yes.

176
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,440
Who are you?

177
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,550
Where am I?

178
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,810
I haven't even spoken yet,

179
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,630
and you're already taking charge.

180
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,440
Let me ask you,

181
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,250
why were you in the forest?

182
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,740
And why did you save me?

183
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,110
You're just a kid,

184
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,100
how do you have such strength?

185
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,350
If I say

186
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,650
I don't remember,

187
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,960
will you believe me?

188
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Well then,

189
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,320
take your time to recall.

190
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,960
This is my territory.

191
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,510
Although you saved me,

192
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,420
I won't tolerate your impudence.

193
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
Military supplies are precious.

194
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,280
Since you spilled your food,

195
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,750
no food for you today.

196
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,400
You two,

197
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,240
let's go.

198
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,310
Why did I save her?

199
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,510
Why do I feel

200
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,680
calm and at ease

201
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,870
when seeing her?

202
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,480
Where does this strange power

203
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,830
come from?

204
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,680
What exactly happened?

205
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,670
Why do I look like this?

206
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,070
Why can't I remember anything?

207
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,750
Never mind.

208
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,490
The situation is unclear,

209
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,110
so survival is the priority.

210
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,120
Given how things are,

211
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,550
I can only live on as a child

212
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,440
and stay by her side.

213
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,530
So this is what I looked like as a child?

214
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,680
Quite handsome, I must say.

215
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,240
Why is this so itchy?

216
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,560
The fabric of these clothes is so rough,

217
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,650
and the style is sloppy and outdated.

218
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,550
General,

219
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,610
why did you believe him so easily

220
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,010
when he said he doesn't remember anything?

221
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,420
That day in the forest,

222
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,400
his eyes were vacant

223
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,150
and his heartbeat rapid.

224
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,600
He clearly went through something big.

225
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,880
The border is unstable.

226
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
Maybe he was traumatized

227
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,060
and temporarily lost his memory.

228
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,310
I heard his strength is incredible.

229
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,270
But he's just a child.

230
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
When he saved me that day,

231
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
either he lost his mind

232
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,270
or had ulterior motives.

233
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,790
That's why

234
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,830
we should keep him here.

235
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
He's just a child.

236
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
No matter how strong,

237
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
if he has hidden intentions,

238
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,790
he will eventually show his true colors.

239
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,510
Very well.

240
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
Then we'll just

241
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,550
be extra cautious.

242
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,830
General.

243
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,480
General?

244
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
I was just thinking,

245
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,400
perhaps he's like me,

246
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,110
just someone who has

247
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,190
suffered enough in this war.

248
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,320
It's her.

249
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,070
Why am I so sensitive to her scent?

250
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,810
Do I

251
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,560
have a dog's nose now?

252
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,860
The clothes you gave me were too big,

253
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,120
so I made some adjustments.

254
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,580
They look better this way.

255
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,350
You claimed you've lost your memory,

256
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,680
yet you still care about your appearance.

257
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,640
That day,

258
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,550
when I brought you back from the forest,

259
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,210
your clothes were in tatters,

260
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,510
but they were clearly adult clothes.

261
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,910
Were they your father's?

262
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,110
I'm thirsty.

263
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,770
Get me a cup of water.

264
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,210
Is she afraid that I poisoned her?

265
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,310
Is it too hot?

266
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,000
It is a bit hot.

267
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,260
Let it cool down before drinking.

268
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,120
This sword is so beautiful.

269
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,640
It's so heavy.

270
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,960
I can't even lift it.

271
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,110
Miss,

272
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,790
you're really strong.

273
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,680
This is the Changfeng Army camp

274
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
in Lucheng, Taijin.

275
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,750
I'm Li Shuang,
the general of the Changfeng Army.

276
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,080
You may call me General.

277
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,930
This sword is indeed heavy,

278
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,350
but for someone who could

279
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,030
send a man flying several meters
with one palm,

280
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,100
lifting it should be nothing.

281
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,710
Have you forgotten?

282
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,030
You happened to save me,

283
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,350
and just now pretended to be weak

284
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,880
to cover it up.

285
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,240
Why are you really here

286
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,060
at the Changfeng Army's camp?

287
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,160
I truly have no memory.

288
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm not lying to you.

289
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,030
I don't know

290
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,640
why I was in the forest

291
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,900
that day,

292
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,690
or why I saved you.

293
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,030
I just felt that

294
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,670
you were important to me

295
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,070
and I had to save you.

296
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,050
You're afraid I'm a spy?

297
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,830
If I really had ulterior motives,

298
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,640
wouldn't it

299
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,110
have been easier to just let you die

300
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,400
in the forest that day?

301
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,020
Your words and actions

302
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,820
all seem full of scheming.

303
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,880
Though you're just a child,

304
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,310
it seems you've had some training.

305
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,960
Otherwise,

306
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,130
how could you be so meticulous?

307
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,030
A child?

308
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,650
What's a child supposed to be like?

309
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
Am I not convincing enough?

310
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
When I was naughty and stubborn,

311
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,830
you didn't give me food;

312
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,060
now that I'm being obedient and smart,

313
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,950
you say I'm calculating.

314
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,200
I just want to survive.

315
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,700
Why am I wrong at every turn?

316
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,440
Since you're a general,

317
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,440
you must be knowledgeable and experienced.

318
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,130
Have you ever heard of
any way to reverse aging?

319
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm a general,

320
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,020
not a charlatan.

321
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,440
Also,

322
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,480
eat this candy

323
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,300
in secret.

324
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,030
I've issued a military order

325
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,290
forbidding you to eat.

326
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,790
What a timely rain this is.

327
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,090
It must be a year of abundant harvest.

328
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,000
I hope there will be

329
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,630
no more wars between the two countries,

330
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,100
and the people won't suffer anymore.

331
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,960
It's too cold today.

332
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,590
The General went to inspect the camp

333
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,440
and hasn't returned yet.

334
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
Let's go have a drink, bro.

335
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,750
Drinking?

336
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,430
If the general finds out,

337
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,720
we'll be beaten with military sticks.

338
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,310
Why do I feel so uncomfortable

339
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,960
and restless?

340
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,030
Why did I

341
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,400
turn back into an adult?

342
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,070
I want to see the General.

343
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,679
It's...

344
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,550
So you've walked right into the trap,
haven't you?

345
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,510
Tell me,

346
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,230
with the Changfeng Army camp's
tight guards,

347
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,480
how did you escape?

348
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,360
Tell the truth.

349
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
So many people

350
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,210
couldn't keep an eye on one child?

351
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,740
That's your incompetence.

352
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,170
Where have you been

353
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,370
all night?

354
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,280
I went to search for my origins.

355
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,070
Isn't that what you want to know the most?

356
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,330
Did you find anything?

357
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
Since you ran away,

358
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,870
why did you come back?

359
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
I couldn't remember my past,

360
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,230
so I had nowhere to go.

361
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,400
Besides,

362
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,890
I only feel at ease

363
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,280
when I'm around you.

364
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,320
Kid,

365
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,550
speak properly.

366
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,950
I know this is a military camp

367
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,550
and you don't keep idlers.

368
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,110
I can be your soldier.

369
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,000
With those skinny arms and legs of yours?

370
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,710
You're no taller than a stump,

371
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,440
and you want to be a soldier?

372
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,760
That day in the forest,

373
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,240
you arrived late

374
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,440
and failed to protect her.

375
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
I was the one who saved the general.

376
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,590
That was...

377
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,230
just a lucky win.

378
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,590
You took advantage of the situation.

379
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,320
Besides,

380
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,920
if we hadn't arrived in time,

381
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,320
with your amateur skills,

382
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,120
could you have lasted that long?

383
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,510
So what?

384
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,500
It's enough that I can beat you.

385
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,590
You little brat,

386
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,480
you're asking for a beating.

387
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,050
If I beat him,

388
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,010
can I be your soldier?

389
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,590
Okay.

390
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,030
Excuse me.

391
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,740
You better keep your word.

392
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,760
Now that you're in the army,

393
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,920
you must

394
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,710
follow the rules from now on.

395
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,920
If you step out of line,

396
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,210
you'll face military punishment.

397
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,030
Ji Ran,

398
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,030
take him to register his name,

399
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,590
assign him a place to stay,

400
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,020
and issue his clothes.

401
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,440
Yes.

402
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,320
I don't know my name.

403
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,800
With your dirty looks and bare feet,

404
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,030
we'll just call you Cow Dung.

405
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,800
Cow Dung.

406
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,560
Call him Jin'an.

407
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,480
May our Taijin

408
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,020
enjoy lasting peace and prosperity.

409
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,880
I like this name.

410
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,070
General.

411
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,230
There's too much suspicion
surrounding this child.

412
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,670
Precisely because of that,

413
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,800
we should keep him where we can see him.

414
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,320
His fighting skills are impressive
and he's quite clever.

415
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,710
If we can verify his identity

416
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,970
and have him serve in our Changfeng Army,

417
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,920
it will be a huge boost for us.
