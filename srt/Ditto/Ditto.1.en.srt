Eun-sung is in a cast?

15
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,102
He annoyed me,
so I pushed him away.

16
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,385
Who will fill in for him
in the basketball tournament?

17
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,469
I guess I have to do it.

18
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,719
Dropouts can't play.

19
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,139
What?

20
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:18,168
You said you would drop out
to pursue your dreams.

21
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,052
Aren't you here
to drop out?

22
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,369
I was drunk.
Don't take it seriously.

23
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:28,836
I knew it.
Great job man,

24
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,452
School of Engineering will be
good for your future.

25
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,684
Oh, we have
17 new female students.

26
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,952
- Don't lie to me.
- It is the truth.

27
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:42,219
Even the top student
of the entire school is a girl.

28
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:45,268
- That is really something.
- You are right.

29
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:48,284
But I don't know
if she exists.

30
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:51,035
She registered, but she didn't
show up for orientation.

31
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,202
The professor is
really worried.

32
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:57,335
Someone should bring her
to the meet-up tonight.

33
00:03:57,418 --> 00:03:58,469
Huh?

34
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:03,119
She is an important asset
to our department.

35
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:07,869
We should make sure
she stays here.

36
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:11,952
But someone injured
the student council president.

37
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,452
Who was it again?

38
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:19,936
We need someone else
to fill his shoes.

39
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,118
What is her name?

40
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:24,418

41
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,352

- Yeah!

Hello, Ms. Seo Han-sol.

45
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:03,751
I am a junior.
My name is Kim Yong.

46
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,436
Welcome to the department
of mechanical engineering.

47
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,806
Please come to the meet-up
at 6 p.m.,

48
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,836
held at Jinmi Bar.

49
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:13,839
By the way...

50
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:16,852
Ms. Han-sol.

51
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,402
Everyone is worried
because no one can reach you.

52
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:24,336
I would like to escort you safely
to the meeting place myself.

53
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,101
It would be best if you ask
questions about university life.

54
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:31,269
I am a kind person,
so feel free to ask.

55
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:33,969
I am not a bad person at all.

56
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:35,753
Please leave me a message!

57
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,019
Hey there.

58
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,336
Why are you already
at school?

59
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,936
Today is an important day.

60
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,585
Don't talk about dying.

61
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:51,771
You should live and study.

62
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,319
- Yo!
- Hey.

63
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,852
- Man-su broke up?
- How did you know?

64
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,685
His face tells it all.

65
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,801
Cheer up, Park Man-su.

66
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:12,102
Let's play Starcraft
before the meet-up.

67
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,852
You can take
Kim Eun-sung's place.

68
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,385
- I am busy.
- Why?

69
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,819
Because I am.

70
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,002
Hey...

71
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:22,584
Are you...

72
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,652
Dating someone?

73
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:31,119
I am hearing things now.

74
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:33,411
Is dating all you think about?

75
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,969
Why are you suddenly talking
about dating?

76
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:37,569
It is not like that.
Go back to sleep.

77
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:40,719
People who deny dating start
dating soon.

78
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,885
Good morning, sir.

79
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:47,785
Time for a roll call...

80
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:52,952
Should we take a quiz today?

81
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:58,152
It is an open-book quiz.

82
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:04,536
Hello, I am Seo Han-sol.

83
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,552
You must be in class.

84
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:14,719
I would like to ask you a favor
before the meet-up.

85
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,536
(Student Council Building)

86
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,869
I will wait outside
the student council building.

87
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,831
I am wearing a cross-body bag

88
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,219
and a pink shirt.

89
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,185
Are you...

90
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,285
Yes, I am Seo Han...

91
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,919
I am Seo Han-sol.

92
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:41,885
I see...

93
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:52,119
- You are getting a call.
- What?

94
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:54,352
Call.

95
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,619
Oh...

96
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,536
Hello?

97
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:07,002
It is your best friend.

98
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:08,202
This number is...

99
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,536
Bring me a comic book...

100
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,937
No longer in service.

101
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,939
Hey!

102
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:19,536
Hiya, nice to meet you.

103
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,919
Hiya.

104
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:25,069
Do you have a favor to ask me?

105
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:26,918
I want to join a club,

106
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,452
but I missed orientation.

107
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:34,419
Could you show me
around campus?

108
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,007
Oh, of course!

109
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,041
Let's go.

110
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,207
Go, go!

111
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:03,207
This is not for you, right?

112
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:09,707
I won't die,
no matter what.

113
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:12,491
Die, die, die!

114
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:17,791
Die, die!
Die, die!

115
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:18,907
Let's leave.

116
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,907
We only meet at night.

117
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,893
Stars are out
during the day, too.

118
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:26,924
(Astronomy Club)

119
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:28,235
But they are too close

120
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:29,236
to see.

121
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,374
It is because the sun is
too bright.

122
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,927
Right?

123
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,707
Oh, a Ham radio!

124
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,907
Are you interested?

125
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,741
I have always wanted to try it.

126
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:52,941
Just like Kim Eun-sung.

127
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,427
Huh?

128
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,341
It is nothing.

129
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:09,107
- Ow, static.
- Static.

130
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:17,741
Jinx!

131
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:21,261
Unjinx.

132
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,759
Is anyone into Ham radios
in our department?

133
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:37,907
There must be someone
in the School of Engineering.

134
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,527
What if there is?

135
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:49,241
I would like to learn from them.

136
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,341
Is there anyone?

137
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:58,441
No, of course not.

138
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:00,859
Everyone is too busy studying.

139
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:03,724
Freshmen are already using
the library.

140
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,258
It is a crazy world.

141
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:09,107
And apparently, the world will end
on December 31st.

142
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,975
Getting a job is still difficult.

143
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,758
College seniors...

144
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,624
The cafeteria serves
delicious food.

145
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:19,058
Black bean noodles and...

146
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:22,007
- Japchae rice.
- They are extra good.

147
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,474
Why are they here?

148
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:29,074
Why would they choose
such a difficult path?

149
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,924
I have a question.

150
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,141
What can we do
after graduation?

151
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,542
Well, let's see...

152
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:45,674
Something to do
with machines.

153
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:49,811
Anyways, congrats on getting in!

154
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,158
Thank you!

155
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:53,241
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

156
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,291
You are really drunk.

157
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:06,474
You are the top
of the entire school?

158
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,208
You are so dumb.

159
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:11,084
Why did you choose
this department,

160
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,507
out of all the others?

161
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,707
Because I was interested.

162
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,695
Don't lie,

163
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:22,374
no one is interested
in mechanical engineering.

164
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:24,874
You are a funny one.

165
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:30,041
Did you know that
there are three types of people?

166
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,642
First, men.

167
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:35,407
Second, women.

168
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:37,108
Third...

169
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,374
Women in the engineering field!

170
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,992
Hey, let's go get ice cream.

171
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:52,524
Why would I go get ice cream
with you?

172
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:53,858
Kim Yong!

173
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,074
Act like a proper junior.

174
00:13:56,774 --> 00:14:00,607
Treat us properly,
or we will haze you.

175
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,658
Hey, you can't haze
freshmen anymore.

176
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,991
You might get arrested.

177
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:10,224
There is no hazing.

178
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,875
What the heck
are you talking about?

179
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:14,992
Am I a criminal?

180
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:18,725
Tell me, am I a criminal?

181
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,974
This is too lame to watch.

182
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:23,707
What did you say?

183
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,607
Lame?

184
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:28,374
You are so rude.

185
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,308
Freshmen, get up.

186
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:32,841
Get up!

187
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,649
This is why engineering students

188
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,474
are called OFFs.

189
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,041
I hate that nickname.

190
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,008
Obnoxious, foolish...

191
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:46,475
Faggot.

192
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:48,607
Faggot.

193
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:51,592
- Faggot?
- Calm down.

194
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:55,125
Faggot?
Let me go!

195
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,274
She called me a faggot!

196
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:02,107
I need to go.
My dorm has a curfew.

197
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,774
Why is it so quiet?

198
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,208
Hey, I am the Teaching Assistance.

199
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:21,492
- Hello.
- Hi.

200
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:24,408
- What is wrong?
- Nothing.

201
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,708
Wow...

202
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:29,924
Did someone scold you?

203
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:32,158
Let's catch up later.

204
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,092
You are playing basketball
in Eun-sung's place.

205
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:35,108
Okay.

206
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,507
Hi.

207
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,241
I am the Teaching Assistance.

208
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,408
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

209
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,107
What took you so long?
I was scared.

210
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:54,708
Let's hurry.

211
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:58,607
Okay,
I should have come out sooner.

212
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:03,541
What if I made you unpopular, too?

213
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:06,924
I am already unpopular.

214
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,074
Seniors hate people like me.

215
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:13,675
Why not?
I like your type.

216
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,508
Really?

217
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,141
Me, too.

218
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:30,074
Why do you keep smiling?

219
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,841
Oh, am I smiling?

220
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:40,142
That is my dorm.

221
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:42,508
That was fast.

222
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:46,642
- I will go in.
- Okay, bye.

223
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:52,308
Yong...

224
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,575
Yeah, I am here.

225
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:57,241
There is a lunar eclipse tonight.

226
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,741
Oh, really?

227
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,842
Han-sol...

228
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,974
Will you...

229
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,741
Have lunch with me tomorrow?

230
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:32,474
Who is going to buy that meal?

231
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:33,662
Reflection!

232
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:38,424
Automatic reflection!
Rainbow reflection!

233
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,175
I mean...

234
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,791
Of course, lunch is on me!

235
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:48,208
Freshmen should not take out
their wallets.

236
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,207
See you tomorrow.

237
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,542
Okay.

238
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:11,241
Are you for real?

239
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,741
You should not seduce
a freshman.

240
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,374
Can't freshmen date?

241
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,858
They should not date you.

242
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:21,875
Okay, it is 2-0.

243
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,442
What is wrong with me?

244
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:27,442
No point.

245
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:32,707
3-0!

246
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:39,225
Eun-sung, do you still have Ham?

247
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:40,807
It is not something you eat.

248
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:43,641
I need to borrow it.
Don't ask me why.

249
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:45,725
Selling it won't get you
much money.

250
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,142
Is it in your dorm room?

251
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,459
My locker.

252
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,307
Can you even use it?

253
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:54,125
A little.
I have seen you use it.

254
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,974
- I will borrow it.
- Whatever.

255
00:18:58,074 --> 00:18:59,142
I am off.

256
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:05,959
Hey, how is Mok-man?

257
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,459
He is fine, so just get out
of the hospital.

258
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,059
People think I injured you.

259
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,725
It was your fault.

260
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:14,224
You saved him instead of me.

261
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,492
A turtle startled you so much,

262
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,842
you fell down the stairs.

263
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,874
Anyways,
take good care of him.

264
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:24,441
- They like lettuce too.
- Bye.

265
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,341
Oh, right.

266
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:30,508
Han-sol says
there is a lunar eclipse tonight.

267
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,208
Bye!

268
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:49,142
At least he will stay
in school.

269
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:01,359
Mok-man, I am home.

270
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,175
Why is this so heavy?

271
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,359
Mok-man...

272
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,008
Mok-man...

273
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:14,608
Mok-man.

274
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:18,441
I met someone amazing today.

275
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:24,275
I will celebrate
just a little bit.

276
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,108
Han-sol...

277
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:41,475
Are you looking
at the same thing right now?

278
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:43,259
What a terrible thing, darling

279
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:48,208
Just imagining becoming
a grown-up

280
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:56,492
Brings me so much pain

281
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:59,159
Ooh, help me
Please understand

282
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:02,092
I like you

283
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:03,635
And my love, I love you

284
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:06,674
But I can't make up my mind

285
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:12,942
Maybe a guy who will prepare
special events for you

286
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:17,308
Might be better for you

287
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:22,425
Sometimes, I want a day off

288
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,259
Ooh, ooh
Oh my love

289
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:30,192
You won't leave me alone

290
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:33,407
But when I am by myself

291
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:38,524
Everyone, the end is nigh!
The apocalypse is coming!

292
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,242
A nuclear explosion
will wipe out humanity!

293
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:46,408
The world will end
someday, right?

294
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,592
It can't end now.

295
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:53,742
I have not even dated
a girl properly yet.

296
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:55,941
That is surprising.

297
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,507
You seem like the popular type.

298
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:00,507
I...

299
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,341
Have high standards.

300
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:18,459
(Government Worker Exam Notice)

301
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:20,574
I will be a senior next year.

302
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:25,408
Maybe we will be better off
with the apocalypse.

303
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:29,208
The IMF crisis has everyone
on edge.

304
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:32,475
It is like we are cursed.

305
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:35,054
My dad's factory shut down

306
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,208
because of the IMF crisis.

307
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,175
My dad told me...

308
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:46,659
'Han-sol, get employed
at a big corporation.'

309
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:50,642
'That is the road to success.'

310
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,497
But those big corporations ruined

311
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:56,208
my dad's business.

312
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,642
I am really interested
in mechanical engineering.

313
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,508
This school is investing a lot
in robotics.

314
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,807
I want to build
a manufacturing system

315
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,875
for small factories
like my father's.

316
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:14,742
Small changes could improve
efficiency.

317
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:19,208
But people are scared
of change.

318
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:23,042
I want to help them.

319
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:25,408
So they don't go out
of business, like my dad.

320
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:33,808
Why are you silent?

321
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:36,075
Is my dream too unrealistic?

322
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:40,275
No, it is just that...

323
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:49,775
You are so confident
in your dreams.

324
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,408
What about you?

325
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,242
Is there anything
you want to do?

326
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:00,975
Kissing you.

327
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,308
What did I just say?

328
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:16,475
Han-sol, it is not that...

329
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,975
Don't misunderstand.

330
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:20,693
The end is nigh!

331
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:23,892
Everyone, the end is nigh!

332
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:25,508
The end is nigh...

333
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,395
What are you doing?

334
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:36,259
Hey, what took you so long?

335
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,925
Han-sol, I made plans
with my friend.

336
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:40,875
I need to go, bye.

337
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:47,525
Let's go.

338
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:51,043
Ouch, my leg!
Slow down!

339
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,994
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:54,959
Hurry up.

341
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,275
My leg has not healed yet!

342
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:14,208
Why did I mention kissing?

343
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:17,942
Die, Kim Yong!
Just die!

344
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,708
Mok-man...

345
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:28,875
What should I do now?

346
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:31,376
Damn it...

347
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,342
Can anyone hear me?

348
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:55,025
- Hello?
- Yes, I can hear you.

349
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:58,026
Wow, it really works.

350
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:01,025
Is this your first time
using a Ham radio?

351
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:02,242
Yes.

352
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:09,025
I think we have to introduce
ourselves first.

353
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,775
That is what it says
in this book, too.

354
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,359
What book?

355
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:16,342
Ham radio Beginner's Guide.

356
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,892
Do you have a book like that?

357
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:22,476
My parents hoard
all kinds of things.

358
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,442
I see.

359
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:30,859
My name is Kim Yong.
A student of Hanguk University.

360
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,526
OMG,
I go to Hanguk University too.

361
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:34,725
Pardon? OM.. what?

362
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:38,360
I am a sociology major.
My name is Kim Mu-nee.

363
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:41,204
I need to interview a stranger

364
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,992
for an assignment.

365
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,342
But I did not think
this would actually work.

366
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:47,975
Oh...

367
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:53,525
I will help you
with your assignment

368
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:57,108
if you lend me your book.

369
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:00,976
Really?
I would be so thankful.

370
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,675
I would like to ask you
something, too.

371
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:11,675
What is it?

372
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:18,642
I would like to ask in person.

373
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:19,884
Let's meet tomorrow,

374
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,908
at the pay phone in front
of the student council building.

375
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:24,893
Do you mean the old building?

376
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:27,142
Okay, what time?

377
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:31,008
Um, at noon!

378
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:40,843
Yes!

379
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,992
Mok-man?

380
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:45,043
Mok-man...

381
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,476
Young-ji...

382
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:07,642
This is the student
council building, right?

383
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:11,542
Yeah, the old one.

384
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:15,018
Your makeup is running.

385
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:16,808
I guess it is not waterproof.

386
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:20,425
It is suddenly raining.

387
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:23,009
Don't I look
like a movie character?

388
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:25,842
You will catch a cold.

389
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,775
Nice umbrella.

390
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:39,292
This is so annoying.

391
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,609
Do you want some ramyun?

392
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:42,976
Are you going to treat me?

393
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,108
Let's go.

394
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:50,608
The weather is so weird.

395
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:01,460
Why did not he come?

396
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:02,860
He could not be bothered.

397
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:03,862
Look up.

398
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,208
Because of the rain, right?

399
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,375
All better.

400
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:16,909
You did a clean job.

401
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,508
Let's eat.

402
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,877
Isn't it amazing

403
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,593
that we go to the same university?

404
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:29,742
I don't believe in fate,
but it felt strange.

405
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:33,443
- Me, too.
- It is so hard to believe.

406
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:35,692
I don't believe in fate.

407
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,035
If fate exists,

408
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:38,518
my future will be bleak

409
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,625
no matter what.

410
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,608
I don't want
to think about it.

411
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:45,209
Why do you think that way?

412
00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:48,660
I have student loans,
living expenses, and debt.

413
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:51,175
My youth is hopeless.

414
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:53,709
I have had a different start
from others.

415
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:59,675
Still, we are all
on different paths.

416
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:04,643
Young-ji, we studied hard

417
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:07,209
to come to the same university.

418
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:11,342
If you just hang in there...

419
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,275
Never mind.

420
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:18,676
I should not tell you
how to live your life.

421
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:22,809
I am crossing a line, right?

422
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:26,009
You crossed
that line a long time ago.

423
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,592
What?

424
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:32,476
Friends can say things
like that to each other.

425
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:35,676
Right, friends.

426
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:39,275
Yeah, we are such close friends.

427
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,992
Mu-nee, I have to go.

428
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,693
I can't miss
another group meeting.

429
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:48,276
You should hurry, then.

430
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,192
You have a fever.

431
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,943
Take cold medicine
before you sleep.

432
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:07,776
I know you will be fine
on your own.

433
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:53,160
You did not even show up.

434
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:54,988
That is my line.

435
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:56,908
Is this voice phishing?

436
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,825
Voice what?

437
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:00,709
You are so...

438
00:35:01,842 --> 00:35:03,742
Come on.

439
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,826
Don't cough into the mic.
Mind your manners.

440
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:11,576
I waited two hours
in the rain for you.

441
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:16,159
Just apologize.
Why are you lying?

442
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:17,992
Did it rain today?

443
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,459
It was hot as heck!

444
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,925
Damn it, I can't believe

445
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:24,475
you were accepted
to Hanguk University.

446
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,143
It is still raining,
can't you hear it?

447
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,909
Is that sizzling meat?

448
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,043
Meat?

449
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,243
You are a tween, aren't you?

450
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,542
What?

451
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,296
Huh?

452
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:53,276
- Hello?
- What is wrong with this?

453
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:55,543
Did I scare him off?

454
00:35:57,408 --> 00:36:00,242
What the hell!

455
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:08,476
It is not raining at all.

456
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:12,876
What does tween mean?

457
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:15,143
Is it some kind of food?

458
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:22,709
It is not raining at all.

459
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:29,206
(Kim Young is Liar)

460
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,676
I worked hard
without causing problems.

461
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:35,275
I can't believe
I am getting fired.

462
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:40,193
I have worked here
for 20 years.

463
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:42,176
You are the first person
to come see me.

464
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:44,876
I am grateful
for this experience.

465
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:49,276
Soon, he must leave
our university.

466
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:53,273
The school informed him

467
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:56,026
that they would not renew
his contract.

468
00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:00,443
The same goes
for the cafeteria workers.

469
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,793
Contract workers face
a serious problem.

470
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:07,809
It must be solved
on a fundamental level.

471
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,293
That was our presentation.

472
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,176
Thank you.

473
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:19,843
Good job.
I liked the content.

474
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,908
- Next, Kim Mu-nee?
- Yes.

475
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:27,025
You did not hand
in your presentation plans.

476
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:28,860
Did you decide
on an interviewee?

477
00:37:28,943 --> 00:37:31,343
Well...

478
00:37:32,076 --> 00:37:33,408
Not yet.

479
00:37:34,176 --> 00:37:37,909
You are flying solo,
make it hurry.

480
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:44,843
- That is it for today.
- Thank you, professor.

481
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:51,360
Want something tasty?

482
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:54,276
You have read my mind.

483
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,743
Not showing up is so rude.

484
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:05,608
Don't interview someone
like him.

485
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:10,276
- Let's eat.
- Let's enjoy the food!

486
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:13,225
Should I drop the class?

487
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:15,909
No, just interview a passerby.

488
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:18,759
That is so boring.

489
00:38:18,842 --> 00:38:20,643
What about the owner
of this place?

490
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:23,276
It is too much.

491
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:28,176
- What is wrong?
- What is happening?

492
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:31,309
It is your friend
in the Korean department.

493
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,176
Not friends, right?

494
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:44,842
Guess not.

495
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,109
I am talking about you two.

496
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,409
It is not like that.

497
00:38:55,109 --> 00:39:04,176
I wish I could erase
my memories of you

498
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:11,360
I am crossing the basketball court
to be with you

499
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:13,009
The left hand slightly helps out!

500
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:16,893
Hey, do you know
what tween means?

501
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:19,009
Is it some kind of food?
Shoot.

502
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:30,709
Hi, going home?

503
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:33,243
We are going to the library.

504
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:35,260
Freshmen can't use the library.

505
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,893
Oh, really?

506
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,250
Goodbye,

507
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,760
I will let you go now

508
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,043
Kim Yong,
where are you going?

509
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,793
I have a quiz to study for.

510
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:50,017
Aren't you going
to practice basketball?

511
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,426
The quiz is not important!

512
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:55,309
Basketball is not that important.
See you tomorrow.

513
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,343
Bye.

514
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:02,626
(Raising Turtles)

515
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:05,460
(Ramyun)

516
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:08,476
So, you have been
avoiding her?

517
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,175
Escaping reality works
sometimes.

518
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,626
She must be disappointed.

519
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,475
She probably didn't have
high expectations, anyway.

520
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:32,376
I have decided.

521
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:33,909
I will ask her
to be my girlfriend.

522
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:43,093
I will meet her gaze...

523
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:44,226
What?

524
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,509
I can't just kiss her.

525
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:47,909
Of course, you can't.

526
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:51,876
Want to be my girlfriend?

527
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:53,976
Are you insane?

528
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,909
You are rushing.

529
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:04,326
They say when you are
in a rush, slow down.

530
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:07,376
No, I need to rush.

531
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,243
You are crazy.

532
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,326
You have seen Han-sol.

533
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:14,743
Of course, I am crazy!

534
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:16,709
I guess she is cute.

535
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,376
Hey...

536
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,309
She is mine,
so don't try anything.

537
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:33,743
Interested in school now?

538
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:35,543
What did you say?

539
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:37,809
You are an idiot.

540
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:53,876
Hey, what are you doing?

541
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:56,609
Oh, hello.

542
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:59,943
What are you up to?

543
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,020
I was supposed to meet someone,

544
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:07,909
but I guess we missed each other.

545
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:15,276
Then, try the pay phone.

546
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:23,943
You might find something.

547
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:47,943
(Jung-min, Let's meet
at the gates at 2 p.m.

548
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:55,376
(Come to the basketball court.)

549
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,876
(English Majors, Stay strong!)

550
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:10,309
(Su-yeon,
I waited for you here.)

551
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:21,745
I was harsh last time,

552
00:43:21,828 --> 00:43:24,109
but I really waited for 2 hours.

553
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:27,009
I waited for over 2 hours as well.

554
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:29,543
How strange.

555
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,461
Do you want
to use a messaging app?

556
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:37,776
What? What is an app?

557
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:39,043
OMG...

558
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,176
Don't you have
a smartphone?

559
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:45,193
Why are you keep saying
'OMG'?

560
00:43:45,276 --> 00:43:47,410
You have never even heard it
before?

561
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:49,093
No.

562
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:51,576
I have never heard it
in my life.

563
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,176
How is this possible?

564
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:00,243
When did you enroll
in university?

565
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:02,843
In 1995.

566
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:05,743
In 1995?

567
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,576
- I enrolled in 2021.
- 2021?

568
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:13,877
Mok-man, this girl is a weirdo.

569
00:44:14,877 --> 00:44:19,727
You are telling me
you started university in 1995?

570
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:20,727
That is right.

571
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,093
You have been at school
for over 20 years?

572
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:25,976
Over 20 years?

573
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:30,060
It is 1999 right now.
What are you saying?

574
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:33,076
1999?

575
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:37,309
Stop playing around.

576
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,906
That is my line.

577
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:41,926
You are the one who is lying.

578
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:43,676
Give me
your cell phone number.

579
00:44:44,444 --> 00:44:47,976
You know
what a cell phone is, right?

580
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,409
Write this down.

581
00:44:53,676 --> 00:44:57,643
018-519-0813!

582
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:04,343
What the...?
A 018 number?

583
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:09,769
This number does not exist.

584
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:12,343
Please try again.

585
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:23,976
Let's do this, then.

586
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,176
Let's meet at the payphone
tomorrow at noon.

587
00:45:27,676 --> 00:45:30,760
If you don't see me
after 30 minutes,

588
00:45:30,843 --> 00:45:32,343
leave a message

589
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:34,009
on the left pillar
of the payphone.

590
00:45:36,576 --> 00:45:38,309
Let's meet at 8 p.m.

591
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:41,676
Sure thing.

592
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:51,843
Kim Yong...

593
00:46:08,176 --> 00:46:10,844
The left pillar...

594
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:16,209
OMG.

595
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:17,993
(Kim Mun-hee is a liar!
in 1999, Kim Young)

596
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:19,743
Is this for real?

597
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:25,493
It is simple.

598
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:28,631
He started university in 1995

599
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:30,576
and took a lot of time off.

600
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:35,143
Or maybe he still thinks
he is in his 20's.

601
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:36,826
There was a message.

602
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:39,493
He must have written it
in the middle of the night.

603
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:43,726
Maybe it is his other persona.

604
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,326
She is right.
That is the fad nowadays.

605
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:48,226
Sounds wrong to me.

606
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:52,576
Mu-nee,
you can still interview him.

607
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:56,076
It might be interesting.

608
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,076
It is a good thing.

609
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:01,310
Is that so?

610
00:47:04,209 --> 00:47:06,877
Han-sol, I have something
to tell you.

611
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:11,376
I will be waiting for you
in the greenhouse.

612
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:19,209
Han-sol. Hiya.

613
00:47:30,276 --> 00:47:35,126
Han-sol, I was out
of my mind that day.

614
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:36,776
I am really sorry.

615
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:02,376
You spelled my name wrong.

616
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:05,666
It is Mu-nee, not Mun-hee.

617
00:48:06,562 --> 00:48:10,609
There is no 'h'.

618
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:16,109
Why don't you apologize
for not showing up?

619
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:22,209
I am sorry.

620
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,093
I am so smelly.

621
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:36,944
Why are you taking
the semester off?

622
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:40,243
Oh, is that why you are here?

623
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:42,210
It is nothing.

624
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:45,710
I just don't think
university is for me.

625
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:49,177
I don't really need a diploma.

626
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:52,676
And I am not interested
in Korean literature.

627
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:58,277
The real reason is
that I want to start making money.

628
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:01,277
Don't take it
so seriously.

629
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:07,410
I had no idea.

630
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,109
I am sorry I did not tell you.

631
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,277
Don't apologize.

632
00:49:18,143 --> 00:49:20,301
Mu-nee, I have to go.

633
00:49:20,384 --> 00:49:21,993
It is time for the guests to come.

634
00:49:22,076 --> 00:49:25,343
Oh, sorry.
Go back inside.

635
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,477
Study hard.

636
00:49:31,076 --> 00:49:32,777
I know you will be fine
on your own.

637
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:46,343
You are the one
who is fine on your own.

638
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:53,643
After 7 years,
I thought I knew him.

639
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:56,343
I guess I was wrong.

640
00:49:57,144 --> 00:49:59,809
Still, I think he should graduate.

641
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:02,909
I think he is being hasty.

642
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:10,278
I think it is good

643
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:14,176
that he has goals and plans.

644
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:21,909
Honestly, I envy his smarts.

645
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,843
I guess you are right.

646
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:30,509
Didn't you say you wanted
to ask me something?

647
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,910
Oh, the thing is...

648
00:50:36,143 --> 00:50:39,409
I don't know a lot of girls.

649
00:50:40,176 --> 00:50:44,844
I would like to hear your opinion.

650
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,343
Dating advice?

651
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,777
How did you know?

652
00:50:50,276 --> 00:50:51,610
Go on, then.

653
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:56,743
Well...

654
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:03,609
I think I met my soulmate.

655
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:10,844
It feels like a miracle.

656
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:15,310
It is your first date, right?

657
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:21,040
Wear something nice,
but not too nice.

658
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:22,082
Huh?

659
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:26,160
Your hair should look...

660
00:51:26,243 --> 00:51:28,060
Nice, but not too nice!

661
00:51:28,143 --> 00:51:30,392
No, it should look great.

662
00:51:30,475 --> 00:51:32,844
Hair is important for men.

663
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:55,410
Hiya.

664
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,477
Now, let's plan out
the dating course.

665
00:51:59,977 --> 00:52:01,227
No worries.

666
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,510
Any girl will love my plan.

667
00:52:05,244 --> 00:52:07,743
I am extremely worried.

668
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:11,393
First,
we are going to visit a farm.

669
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:15,626
We are having sandwiches
and pork ribs for dinner.

670
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:18,861
Then, we will have apple juice
and parfait for dessert.

671
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:20,127
Wait!

672
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,709
Are you seriously a tween?

673
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:26,643
There are so many problems.

674
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:29,875
At the end of the night,

675
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,627
have wine
or beer at a nice bar.

676
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,209
Oh, alcohol?

677
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:36,943
Yes!

678
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:42,310
This place is so nice.

679
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,494
I know.

680
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,477
- Your hair...
- My hair?

681
00:52:48,586 --> 00:52:50,443
Is it weird?

682
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:53,410
It is just...

683
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:58,409
It looks futuristic.

684
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,744
- It looks good.
- Really?

685
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,729
Whew.

686
00:53:04,744 --> 00:53:06,194
Thanks.

687
00:53:06,277 --> 00:53:07,196
Cheers.

688
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,709
Thank you.

689
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:16,109
- Here.
- Thanks.

690
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:21,061
- Han-sol, can you guess?
- Guess what?

691
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:22,857
What name do flowers hate?

692
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,444
I know, Wilton!

693
00:53:24,843 --> 00:53:26,361
Flowers don't like to wilt!

694
00:53:26,444 --> 00:53:28,876
Wow, you are so smart.

695
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:31,727
Do you have any more?

696
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,961
We are seeing
a movie tomorrow.

697
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,626
Will you help me choose?

698
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:37,527
What are the options?

699
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,072
'Attack the Gas Station'

700
00:53:39,155 --> 00:53:40,009
or 'Shiri'.

701
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,710
'Shiri'?

702
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:46,044
Yes, I am here.

703
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:49,676
Is someone with you?

704
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:52,860
You said 'Shiri'...

705
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:56,793
'Shiri' is a 1999 spy film.

706
00:53:56,876 --> 00:54:01,144
Kim Yun-jin turned out
to be the culprit.

707
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:04,276
Go get your mom.

708
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,710
Don't you recognize
your dad's voice?

709
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:10,644
She is not there?

710
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:12,810
Do you have any more?

711
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:17,544
Hello?

712
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:20,044
Isn't your mom home?

713
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:21,509
Where did she go?

714
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:23,630
You don't know?

715
00:54:24,076 --> 00:54:27,710
- That was a fun movie.
- It was so funny.

716
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:31,410
Didn't you say you
wanted to see 'Shiri'?

717
00:54:33,544 --> 00:54:39,294
My friend saw it first and
told me the entire story.

718
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:42,910
What a bad friend.
That is called a spoiler.

719
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,194
Spoiler?

720
00:54:44,277 --> 00:54:46,010
Where should we go now?

721
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,009
Wow, you are good!

722
00:55:22,977 --> 00:55:24,444
You will break the machine!

723
00:55:32,477 --> 00:55:33,644
Wow!

724
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:35,744
Han-sol, that was...

725
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,594
- This, this, and this.
- Okay.

726
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:44,594
Let's start taking pictures!

727
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:46,643
One, two, three!

728
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,110
Who are you interviewing?

729
00:55:56,409 --> 00:55:58,944
A university student living
in 1999.

730
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:02,644
I don't understand
what you mean.

731
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:04,644
Well...

732
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:09,394
He was a university student
in 1999.

733
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:10,610
Oh.

734
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:13,843
What is your theme?

735
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,244
Well...

736
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,810
Dreams and love.

737
00:56:24,844 --> 00:56:26,177
Dreams and love?

738
00:56:27,544 --> 00:56:29,389
Dreams and love.

739
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:31,909
That is terrific.

740
00:56:32,877 --> 00:56:35,461
Make your presentation
next class.

741
00:56:35,544 --> 00:56:36,544
Okay.

742
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:40,744
- That is all.
- Thank you, professor!

743
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:50,194
(I am an idiot,)

744
00:56:50,277 --> 00:56:52,677
(who talks
about love these days?)

745
00:56:57,543 --> 00:57:02,077
Yong,
what is your university life like?

746
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,077
It is really hectic.

747
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:07,710
I will be a senior next year.

748
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:14,144
I wanted to get to know myself
when I came to university.

749
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,277
But assignments and life are
getting in the way.

750
00:57:18,877 --> 00:57:21,751
Even when I am hanging out
with my friends,

751
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:26,361
I am nervous.

752
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,593
Sometimes, I just go and sit

753
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:29,444
at the library.

754
00:57:29,977 --> 00:57:31,309
Isn't that idiotic?

755
00:57:33,944 --> 00:57:36,827
No, I understand.

756
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,544
I am the same way.

757
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:46,277
Did you choose
a career path?

758
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,210
Do you have any dreams?

759
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:56,577
Dreams are a burden to me.

760
00:57:57,577 --> 00:58:00,644
They are a hassle,
and they are irritating.

761
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,410
I want to let them go.

762
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:10,341
But I can't get rid of them.

763
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:11,383
(Writing Notebook)

764
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,910
They are white elephants.

765
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,944
Dreams should not be like that.

766
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:32,344
How about a talking stage
between you two?

767
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:33,697
Talking what?

768
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,594
Your talking stage.

769
00:58:36,677 --> 00:58:39,844
It is the step
before a relationship.

770
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,844
Do you mean the chase?

771
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,169
Confess your feelings for her.

772
00:58:46,252 --> 00:58:48,977
Then, she will look
at you differently.

773
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,510
What is she like?

774
00:58:58,044 --> 00:58:59,277
She is...

775
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,378
A miracle I found
when I was desperate.

776
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:10,544
I want to
become someone worthy of her.

777
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:15,644
Oh, that could be my new dream!

778
00:59:16,577 --> 00:59:19,411
I can tell by your voice

779
00:59:19,494 --> 00:59:21,744
that you really like her.

780
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:26,277
Is it that obvious?

781
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:31,327
Love is all about timing.

782
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:34,467
You should follow your heart,

783
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,010
instead of listening to my advice.

784
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:39,361
Honesty always works.

785
00:59:39,444 --> 00:59:42,344
Go, Kim Yong!
You can do it!

786
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,044
- We made curfew, right?
- Yes.

787
01:00:24,578 --> 01:00:27,744
We ran like we were shooting
a commercial.

788
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,089
Youths, run toward your goals!

789
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,661
I will get going.
See you tomorrow.

790
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:36,544
Okay, get inside.

791
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:42,410
Good night.
Have a dream of me.

792
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,444
Follow your heart.

793
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:56,044
Honesty always...

794
01:00:59,544 --> 01:01:00,677
Han-sol.

795
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:02,164
Yes?

796
01:01:16,644 --> 01:01:18,277
Starting from tomorrow...

797
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,077
Would you go out with me?

798
01:02:05,077 --> 01:02:07,177
My heart is still racing.

799
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,910
Your words gave me courage.

800
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:14,110
I can tell just
by your voice.

801
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:19,977
Your love story is
warming my heart, too.

802
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:24,677
Do you like anyone?

803
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:25,977
Me?

804
01:02:31,644 --> 01:02:33,845
If love is all about timing,

805
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:36,427
I am way off.

806
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,711
I don't know your situation,

807
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:39,577
but don't give up on love.

808
01:02:40,078 --> 01:02:41,210
That would be...

809
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:44,510
So lonely.

810
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:46,011
That is right.

811
01:02:46,745 --> 01:02:49,977
But sometimes,
there is no choice.

812
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:55,477
I always have
to hide my feelings.

813
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:03,394
Those girls come here
to see Young-ji?

814
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:04,398
Yeah.

815
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,564
- No way.
- It is true.

816
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:15,745
Do you want to go
on a trip with me?

817
01:03:17,578 --> 01:03:19,045
Are you okay?

818
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:22,611
- Did I say something shocking?
- Yes!

819
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,561
What is gotten into you?

820
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:30,120
You are always studying.

821
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:32,377
I thought
it would be good for you.

822
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,823
Every day, I am trying hard

823
01:03:36,906 --> 01:03:39,410
not to fall in love with him.

824
01:03:39,777 --> 01:03:43,411
I can tell by your voice
that you like him a lot.

825
01:03:44,377 --> 01:03:45,810
Is that so?

826
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,777
It makes me curious.

827
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:55,694
We have been friends
for 7 years.

828
01:03:55,777 --> 01:03:58,877
Not about him.
About you.

829
01:04:00,244 --> 01:04:04,144
I am curious about you, too.

830
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:10,194
I want to tell you everything.

831
01:04:10,277 --> 01:04:11,260
Weirdly,

832
01:04:11,343 --> 01:04:14,978
it feels like we are old friends.

833
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,811
Me, too.

834
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,010
We might become BFFs.

835
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:21,310
BFFs?

836
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:23,510
BFs forever.

837
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:25,777
BFs?

838
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:31,644
It means
that we are totes best friends.

839
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:35,010
You keep using strange words.

840
01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:38,778
King Sejong will be back tumbling
in his grave, right?

841
01:04:39,377 --> 01:04:42,510
What?
Back tumbling?

842
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:48,811
Back tumbling!

843
01:04:50,044 --> 01:04:52,278
That is so creative!

844
01:04:52,945 --> 01:04:54,078
(Kim Yong enrolled in 1995)

845
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:56,510
That joke is way ahead
of its time!

846
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:03,158
Wait, 1995?

847
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:05,544
What is your major?

848
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:08,777
Mechanical engineering.

849
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,861
No way.

850
01:05:10,944 --> 01:05:13,395
My dad majored
in mechanical engineering.

851
01:05:13,478 --> 01:05:15,457
Do you know Kim Eun-sung?

852
01:05:17,877 --> 01:05:19,994
How do you know Eun-sung?

853
01:05:20,077 --> 01:05:22,778
He is my dad!
Are you close with him?

854
01:05:24,678 --> 01:05:28,127
Yeah, we have been friends
since high school.

855
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,445
OMG!

856
01:05:33,078 --> 01:05:38,961
Are you telling me
that you are Eun-sung's daughter?

857
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:40,177
Yes!

858
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,161
This is ridiculous.

859
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:46,877
Who the heck are you?

860
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:48,678
Did he put you up to this?

861
01:05:49,344 --> 01:05:52,277
It is true,
my dad is Kim Eun-sung.

862
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:55,015
I could not believe it, either.

863
01:05:55,098 --> 01:05:57,761
I thought you were lying.

864
01:05:57,844 --> 01:06:02,161
But you don't sound
like a liar at all.

865
01:06:02,244 --> 01:06:05,161
Sometimes, life is
stranger than fiction.

866
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:09,527
It is hard to explain, but...

867
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:14,110
We are using some kind
of time machine.

868
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:19,511
Are you saying
this is all real?

869
01:06:19,844 --> 01:06:22,677
Yes, isn't it freaky?

870
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,111
This is insane!

871
01:06:26,178 --> 01:06:29,310
Then, your Ham radio...

872
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,061
It is my dad's.

873
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:33,510
He used to use it
in high school.

874
01:06:35,177 --> 01:06:37,478
I am using his Ham, too.

875
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:45,511
The one with the faded sticker?

876
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:54,578
There is no sticker.

877
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,478
Look closely.
It is on the left side.

878
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,678
Left side?

879
01:07:00,945 --> 01:07:02,444
There is nothing here.

880
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,110
I don't see it, Mu-nee.

881
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:10,611
You must know my mom, too.

882
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:18,310
How would I know your mom?

883
01:07:19,044 --> 01:07:20,911
Don't you know Seo Han-sol?

884
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:23,344
My parents were both parts
of the student council.

885
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:45,510
Wait...

886
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:50,422
You are lying about Eun-sung

887
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:52,978
and Han-sol getting married?

888
01:07:54,644 --> 01:07:56,561
It is the truth!

889
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:58,744
Why would I lie
about my parents?

890
01:07:59,978 --> 01:08:03,877
Yong, this is crazy.

891
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:07,578
But I trust you.
You trust me too, right?

892
01:08:15,344 --> 01:08:18,711
Mu-nee,
you have a great imagination.

893
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:21,544
You should turn it
into a movie.

894
01:08:24,044 --> 01:08:28,662
My mom and dad were
a famous couple at school.

895
01:08:28,745 --> 01:08:29,877
Are you sure
you don't know?

896
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:47,878
What the heck...

897
01:09:57,345 --> 01:10:01,545
Mok-man, what is going on?

898
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:24,978
The end is nigh!

899
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:28,310
- The world will...
- It won't end!

900
01:10:28,878 --> 01:10:30,345
Yes, it will!

901
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:33,178
The apocalypse is coming!

902
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:01,211
What are you doing?

903
01:11:02,144 --> 01:11:03,710
What is wrong?

904
01:11:11,045 --> 01:11:12,478
Excuse us.

905
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:15,878
Hey, my leg still hurts.

906
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:25,547
It is not true, right?

907
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:27,877
What?

908
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:34,010
Eun-sung, tell me the truth.

909
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:39,078
Do you know
Kim Mu-nee?

910
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:41,695
- Min Mu-nee?
- Kim Mu-nee!

911
01:11:41,778 --> 01:11:43,278
Who is that?

912
01:11:46,245 --> 01:11:51,710
Are you two playing a prank
on me?

913
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:54,795
What are you talking about?

914
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:58,345
Yong, what is wrong?

915
01:11:59,045 --> 01:12:00,345
Kim Yong...

916
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:12,211
Never mind.

917
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:17,445
I must have been out
of my mind.

918
01:12:19,778 --> 01:12:21,344
That has always been the case.

919
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:26,311
Why did not you tell me
you were out of the hospital?

920
01:12:26,744 --> 01:12:29,178
I did not need your help.

921
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:37,144
Let's go, Han-sol.

922
01:12:37,777 --> 01:12:38,811
Okay.

923
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:56,728
Han-sol, do you want some help
with your math quiz?

924
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:59,111
I will get you past exam papers.

925
01:12:59,445 --> 01:13:02,178
That is the most efficient way
to study.

926
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:06,028
Then, you will have more time
for me.

927
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:07,614
I will be fine.

928
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:09,745
You have more to study for.

929
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:12,111
Han-sol.

930
01:13:15,345 --> 01:13:19,162
Why were you
with Eun-sung?

931
01:13:19,245 --> 01:13:21,645
He is
the student council president.

932
01:13:22,245 --> 01:13:23,628
I am the freshman representative.

933
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,378
Why would you do that?

934
01:13:26,545 --> 01:13:28,045
Yong...

935
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:35,378
- It is all battered up.
- I tried to stop them.

936
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,628
I guess
you were not injured that badly.

937
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,178
What is wrong?

938
01:13:55,345 --> 01:13:57,078
Did you check
with the administration office?

939
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:01,645
They can't share
private information.

940
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:09,394
(Kim Eun-sung)

941
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:10,878
That is my dad.

942
01:14:12,711 --> 01:14:15,245
Your parents are returning
to Korea next year, right?

943
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:17,778
Yeah, next year.

944
01:14:19,311 --> 01:14:20,911
Young-ji...

945
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:27,277
These might be the strangest

946
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:34,245
and most important events
of my life.

947
01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:42,945
I might regret it
if I just neglect them.

948
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,077
Why do you
feel that way?

949
01:14:52,478 --> 01:14:55,945
I am not sure.

950
01:15:10,245 --> 01:15:12,111
I am acting strange, aren't I?

951
01:15:17,178 --> 01:15:18,345
So...

952
01:15:19,611 --> 01:15:20,878
What is his name?

953
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:38,445
Yong, you should leave.

954
01:15:38,978 --> 01:15:40,778
This is a meeting.

955
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:45,178
Don't mind me.

956
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:50,811
There is my BF!

957
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:01,145
Get out.

958
01:16:03,111 --> 01:16:04,031
I will kill you.

959
01:16:05,945 --> 01:16:08,395
What is wrong with you?

960
01:16:08,478 --> 01:16:10,130
I get that you like her,

961
01:16:10,213 --> 01:16:11,711
but there is a line.

962
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:14,050
She is meeting
other representatives

963
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:15,878
for the first time today.

964
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:18,578
You are making her uncomfortable.

965
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,045
Go cool off.

966
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:29,845
There you are.

967
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:47,862
I think
love is making me blind.

968
01:17:47,945 --> 01:17:49,578
Crazy jackass.

969
01:17:49,945 --> 01:17:53,445
If you are going to act like this,
just drop out.

970
01:17:54,911 --> 01:17:58,329
Wow,
Geun-tae can't keep a secret.

971
01:17:58,412 --> 01:17:59,811
What secret?

972
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:03,478
I have known you for years.

973
01:18:03,778 --> 01:18:06,079
I know what you are good at,

974
01:18:06,162 --> 01:18:08,478
and what you like.

975
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:11,279
Mechanical engineering is not
for you.

976
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:13,811
You are just forcing yourself.

977
01:18:15,278 --> 01:18:18,745
Your dream is to become a writer,
right?

978
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:27,545
People can't only do
what they like.

979
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:33,311
You are going to live life doing
what you don't like?

980
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:45,178
Damn it...

981
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:48,311
You should quit smoking.

982
01:18:51,545 --> 01:18:52,645
Thanks.

983
01:18:58,578 --> 01:19:00,245
I won't give up.

984
01:19:03,545 --> 01:19:07,745
On love,
or your dreams?

985
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:16,728
Yong, we are here.

986
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:18,911
Eun-sung, you are here too?

987
01:19:20,545 --> 01:19:23,128
I brought the freshmen.

988
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:25,445
Kim Eun-sung,
answer the phone now and then.

989
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:29,328
Wash your face and sober up.

990
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:31,029
Hurry up.

991
01:19:31,112 --> 01:19:33,065
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

992
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:36,895
But we brought a lot of beers.

993
01:19:36,978 --> 01:19:40,662
- Goodbye, then.
- Go study.

994
01:19:40,745 --> 01:19:42,211
Han-sol, sit here.

995
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:05,979
- Yong.
- Oh...

996
01:20:06,811 --> 01:20:08,878
Come on in.

997
01:20:12,912 --> 01:20:14,578
It is a bit messy.

998
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:18,086
Nam-hae dragged us here.

999
01:20:18,169 --> 01:20:20,379
I am sorry to barge in.

1000
01:20:21,411 --> 01:20:24,046
No, it is fine.

1001
01:20:32,945 --> 01:20:34,979
Do you like reading?

1002
01:20:36,478 --> 01:20:40,145
I guess.
It is just a hobby.

1003
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,609
Oh, a Ham radio!

1004
01:20:52,692 --> 01:20:54,163
Do you know how to use it?

1005
01:20:54,246 --> 01:20:56,645
Does it work?
What should I do?

1006
01:20:58,079 --> 01:20:59,812

1007
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:03,411
I will teach you next time.

1008
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:07,479
Promise me?

1009
01:21:08,445 --> 01:21:09,479
Of course.

1010
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:18,111
I will give you
a gift in return.

1011
01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:23,712
Don't remove this sticker.

1012
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:26,478
It is a good picture of us.

1013
01:21:29,446 --> 01:21:33,545
Not until you keep your promise.

1014
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:37,278
Okay?

1015
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,545
I will wait for you outside.

1016
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:49,178

(Mommy)

1019
01:23:29,578 --> 01:23:30,778
Hello?

1020
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:34,112
Mom...

1021
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:37,978
Mu-nee.

1022
01:23:45,612 --> 01:23:46,979
Apparently...

1023
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:52,179
He suddenly disappeared.

1024
01:23:53,745 --> 01:24:00,112
My mom's first love...

1025
01:24:07,178 --> 01:24:09,779
I cheered him on.

1026
01:24:12,979 --> 01:24:15,845
He was an idiot in love.

1027
01:24:17,211 --> 01:24:21,678
I really wanted him
to become happy.

1028
01:24:23,411 --> 01:24:26,501
I guess I could feel

1029
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:29,711
how much he loved my mom.

1030
01:24:33,178 --> 01:24:37,745
Young-ji,
did I ruin everything?

1031
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,853
What if I said something

1032
01:24:44,936 --> 01:24:48,079
that I should not have?

1033
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,746
If your words ruined
their relationship...

1034
01:24:56,711 --> 01:24:59,346
They would have broken up,
no matter what.

1035
01:25:02,645 --> 01:25:07,646
So, don't blame yourself.

1038

1039
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:50,462

with those shovels.

1044

Behind you!

1045
01:26:25,212 --> 01:26:26,279

1046
01:26:27,978 --> 01:26:30,396
- Nice!
- Good job!

1047
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,811
- Hey, look alive!
- Sorry.

1048

- Pass!
- Over here, Yong!

1049

Are things not going your way?

1050
01:26:46,712 --> 01:26:47,812
Foul!

1051
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:50,712
You are getting a warning.

1052
01:26:51,446 --> 01:26:52,546
Can you get up?

1053
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:55,878
You scumbag,
get over here!

1054
01:27:08,646 --> 01:27:09,529
Hey, hey!

1055
01:27:09,612 --> 01:27:12,263
- Are you okay?
- Can you move?

1056
01:27:12,346 --> 01:27:14,812
- Is he dead?
- Try to get up.

1057
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:17,663
- He started it!
- That is ridiculous!

1058
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:20,078
- Breathe.
- Sit up.

1059
01:27:20,799 --> 01:27:22,711
- Can you get up?
- Kim Yong...

1060
01:27:24,012 --> 01:27:25,163
Hey, stop.

1061
01:27:25,246 --> 01:27:26,779
Where is he going?

1062
01:27:28,612 --> 01:27:30,329
What are you doing?

1063
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:32,879
- You denied it.
- Denied what?

1064
01:27:34,012 --> 01:27:35,696
What a prick!
you denied it!

1065
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:40,279
- Hey, let go of him!
- You jerk!

1066
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:44,212
- What is your name?
- Choi Dong-tak.

1067
01:27:44,531 --> 01:27:46,145
Students from other departures,

1068
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:48,493
leave for a better atmosphere.

1069
01:27:51,612 --> 01:27:52,911
Are you okay?

1070
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:57,512
Yeah, his punches are not strong.

1071
01:27:59,012 --> 01:28:00,045
Where is Yong?

1072
01:28:01,045 --> 01:28:04,246
Oh, he just left.

1073
01:28:06,611 --> 01:28:10,763
He is not a violent person.

1074
01:28:10,846 --> 01:28:13,963
I have been nagging him
about studying.

1075
01:28:14,046 --> 01:28:16,596
I guess he had pent-up anger.

1076
01:28:16,679 --> 01:28:18,441
He has been stressed

1077
01:28:18,524 --> 01:28:21,196
about schoolwork and love.

1078
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:23,762
When he looked at me,
he just exploded.

1079
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:26,778
I should not have run my mouth.

1080
01:28:28,145 --> 01:28:30,370
What I am trying to say is,

1081
01:28:30,453 --> 01:28:31,978
don't be disappointed in him.

1082
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:00,312
Mu-nee...

1083
01:30:03,412 --> 01:30:06,312
I can't ignore it anymore.

1084
01:30:09,812 --> 01:30:11,379
My heart...

1085
01:30:14,412 --> 01:30:17,046
Is full of suspicion.

1086
01:30:22,812 --> 01:30:25,079
I guess
my love is not strong enough.

1087
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:25,379
Mu-nee.

1088

Dreams come true?

1090
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:44,379
Is she living a happy life?

1091
01:31:52,779 --> 01:31:57,946
If I keep dating Han-sol...

1092
01:32:01,646 --> 01:32:04,246
Mu-nee might not be born.

1093
01:32:07,546 --> 01:32:09,879

don't do this to me.

1124
01:37:17,146 --> 01:37:19,612
It was love at first sight.

Even if I could turn back time,

1126
01:37:28,113 --> 01:37:30,112
I would love her again.

1142
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,912
I could not meet him in person.

1143

But while I was talking with him,

1144
01:40:26,347 --> 01:40:31,980
I discovered something
I had buried deep within me.

What was it?

1146

It was...

1147

Love.

1148
01:40:44,512 --> 01:40:47,313
They say romance existed
in the past.

1149

Does it no longer exist?

1150

It always exists.

1151
01:40:53,613 --> 01:40:57,180
We still love.

1152
01:40:57,846 --> 01:41:00,298
But we try to ignore it

1153

due to real-life problems.

1154
01:41:03,747 --> 01:41:09,996
I wish love were not an obstacle
to reality.

1155
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:14,050
It should be so widespread

1156

that everyone is in love.

1157
01:41:17,212 --> 01:41:21,212

romance could become reality.

01:42:27,646 --> 01:42:30,780
I will wait here.
Go to him.

1176
01:43:15,647 --> 01:43:21,012
('Time Traveler'
Author Book Signing)

1177
01:43:43,113 --> 01:43:47,364
- What is your name?
- Kim Su-bin.

1178
01:43:47,447 --> 01:43:51,147
- I loved your book.
- Thank you.

1179
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:57,213
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1180
01:44:02,513 --> 01:44:04,947
Hello.

1181
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:08,347
What is your name?

1182
01:44:11,613 --> 01:44:14,112
Kim Mu-nee.

1183
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:11,512
How is Mok-man?

1184
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:21,279
Good.

1185
01:45:31,113 --> 01:45:32,946
Thanks for coming.

1186
01:45:44,947 --> 01:45:46,747
I know it now.

1187
01:45:48,413 --> 01:45:50,247
You are...

1188
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,679
My miracle.

1189
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,647
Follow your heart.

1190
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:34,747
Honesty always works.

1191
01:46:36,012 --> 01:46:37,813
Your old friend...

1192
01:46:38,847 --> 01:46:40,846
Kim Yong.

1193
01:47:07,313 --> 01:47:11,080
I like you.

1194
01:47:12,046 --> 01:47:14,247
I have been wanting
to say that.

1195
01:47:18,047 --> 01:47:20,747
And I think this is the right time
to tell you.

1196
01:47:23,713 --> 01:47:27,447
Young-ji, I like you.

1197
01:47:28,647 --> 01:47:30,447
I like you, Young-ji.

1198
01:47:35,913 --> 01:47:36,980
Me too.

1199
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,813
Ditto.

1200
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:06,747
Let's go.

1201
01:48:35,813 --> 01:48:39,513
When times are hard,
think of this moment.

1202
01:48:40,113 --> 01:48:41,790
As time goes by,

1203
01:48:41,873 --> 01:48:44,313
it might fade
like an old picture.

1204
01:48:45,481 --> 01:48:48,880
But remember how splendid
and beautiful this moment was.

1205
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,134
Slow or fast,

1206
01:48:53,217 --> 01:48:56,380
let's walk side by side.

1207
01:48:58,213 --> 01:49:02,480
Let's all follow our hearts.

1208
01:49:04,047 --> 01:49:06,313
Honesty always works.

1209
01:49:08,447 --> 01:49:11,351
CQCQ, this is Kim Mu-nee.

1210
01:49:11,434 --> 01:49:13,813
I am signing off.

1211
01:49:51,013 --> 01:49:52,613
What a sudden downpour.

1212
01:50:14,913 --> 01:50:17,181
Here, use this.

1213
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:19,411
What?

1214
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:24,513
Whoa, what are you doing?

1215
01:50:26,214 --> 01:50:27,747
She should not catch a cold.

1216
01:50:29,048 --> 01:50:30,013
What?

1217
01:50:30,947 --> 01:50:32,680
Just take it.

1218
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:39,047
OMG!

1219
01:50:41,047 --> 01:50:42,713
I got lucky!
