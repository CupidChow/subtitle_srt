00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,680
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 9)

2
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,040
Are you sure that this is
Prince Saenkaew's handwriting?

3
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Nual said that she just cleaned up
Prince Saenkaew's room and dropped this.

4
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,800
Why did he need to write a letter to Sasin?

5
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,040
You saw that they were so close.

6
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,280
But when Sasin got shot and hospitalized,

7
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,240
Prince Saenkaew never once went to see him.

8
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,880
Don't you think it's strange?

9
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
You're right.

10
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,640
I think there's something
weird going on between them.

11
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,680
You think people would praise your love?

12
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,880
You will be a clown

13
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,760
and everyone will be laughing at you.

14
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
What about you?

15
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,140
Are you gonna judge me as well?

16
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,280
Our son hates me right now.

17
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,400
I've become a devil

18
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,600
who gets in a way of his happiness.

19
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Come in.

20
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
Prince Bodin told me to
invite you for a discussion.

21
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,580
He wanted to talk about
some details of the wedding.

22
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,360
My workers have done drafting

23
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,600
the layout for the wedding venue.

24
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,180
Please have a look.

25
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,180
If you would like to add
anything, just let me know.

26
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,960
If you think it's fine,
then I'm fine with it.

27
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,360
About the business in Chiang Mai,

28
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
my people also decorated
a house for newlyweds.

29
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,180
They can move in right after the wedding.

30
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,760
Did you hire a clerk to work at
your company in Chiang Mai?

31
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,920
I'd like to refer one person to work.

32
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
You can refer more than one people.
The business is new.

33
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,380
I need many employees to work there.

34
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
That's great.

35
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Can we refer Sasin to work there?

36
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,200
Sasin can take care of Pin.

37
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
I don't think so.

38
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,520
When she is married to Saenkaew,

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,440
my son can take care of her.

40
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,040
The others don't need to follow them.

41
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Okay, I'll let you decide.

42
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,720
Are you thinking about your nephew?

43
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,080
That's right. His
wedding is getting closer.

44
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,440
If we can't stop them,
we are in big trouble.

45
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,120
Are you sure

46
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,720
that Prince Kamfah ordered
someone to shoot that musician?

47
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,520
Why would he do that for?

48
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh my goodness! Eww!

49
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Honey, look at this!

50
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
- What is it?
- Here.

51
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
So disgusting.

52
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,040
A wedding of two men.

53
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,040
They aren't afraid of people gossipping.

54
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,760
People these days
like to do strange things.

55
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Man marrying another man?

56
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,670
Saenkaew?

57
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,360
What're you doing? People can see us.

58
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,560
Holy sh...!

59
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,560
Or…Saenkaew…

60
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,680
- and his future bride's cousin?
- What is it?

61
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,120
What are they?

62
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,560
At the restaurant the other day,

63
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,920
we saw them hugging like this.

64
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,520
They can't possible be anything else but…

65
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
Really close friends, right?

66
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,430
Oh honey!

67
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,130
They are lovers.

68
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,880
But bravo to you.

69
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Brilliant!

70
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
That's why.

71
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,280
Saenkaew has never been
rumored with any women.

72
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,640
He is gay, he is queer.

73
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,320
He likes men.

74
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,390
Disgusting.

75
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,140
So Prince Kamfah ordered
someone to kill his son's boyfriend

76
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,560
because he's afraid that
the wedding'd be off, right?

77
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,920
This is huge. It's not
only ruining the wedding,

78
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,350
but my brother will also be humiliated

79
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,080
all the way from Bangkok to Chansaeng.

80
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,130
The best!

81
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,320
Now, it's my turn.

82
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,480
Are you sure about this?
Let's go to our house.

83
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,320
Why are you living with Sanya?

84
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,800
But there are only females in your house.

85
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,950
It'd be better for him to stay with men.

86
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,680
Sanya and Mingmitr are living there.

87
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,680
They can help him clean up.

88
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,350
Also, their rental house
is closed to the hospital.

89
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,220
He can visit the hospital
to clean his wound easily.

90
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
I won't stay there for too long.

91
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,680
When my wound is healed, I'll go back home.

92
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,680
Don't you worry about him.

93
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,000
We're gonna take the best care of him.

94
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,440
My wedding is in three days.

95
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,760
You need to be there.

96
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
You represent my mother.

97
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
I want you there, on my happiest day.

98
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
We should go

99
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
before the traffic hits.

100
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,840
Help him out of here.

101
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,000
Let me help you with that.

102
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,360
Sasin was discharged
from the hospital today.

103
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,840
I heard that he'll stay
with his musician friends.

104
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,400
He must be so scared.

105
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
Good.

106
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
The wedding will go smoothly.

107
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,720
And it will end.

108
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,720
My dearest Saenkaew,

109
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,840
You're not the one who go through this.

110
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm right here.

111
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I won't let go of your hands.

112
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,880
I know that you're in pain.

113
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,040
Trust me when I say that I understand it.

114
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,680
I understand what you're going through.

115
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,080
I understand your fear.

116
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,640
But I want you to know

117
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,960
that you don't need to
carry it all by yourself.

118
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,320
You still have me. I love and
care for you more than my own life.

119
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,180
I don't want you to feel guilty

120
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,160
or feel like you're
fighting this on your own.

121
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,580
This is our story

122
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,960
and we'll begin this together.

123
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,120
Wait for me a little longer

124
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,640
and I'll try to find way for you
and Ms. Rachawadee to get

125
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
marriage certificate
before your wedding day.

126
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,480
I'll do anything for us to be together.

127
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,520
While we're away and you're missing me,

128
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
please look up to see the moon.

129
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,720
Please know that we're
looking at the same moon.

130
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,960
Why did Ms. Rachawadee
tell Sasin to live with us?

131
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,440
And she asked us to
watch out for his safety.

132
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,640
She might be worried that he
could come back to hurt Sasin.

133
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,400
We live together so we
can watch out for Sasin.

134
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,200
Why didn't he stay in the palace?
So many people than this place.

135
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
It's safer that way.

136
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
You're right.

137
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,290
You need to watch Sasin.

138
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,720
Let me know when he's alone.

139
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Yes, sir.

140
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Your nephew and that man
live in different places like this,

141
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,120
how can we expose them?

142
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Don't worry, the lovers will try

143
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,400
to find their ways back together.

144
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,440
The other one is injured and nearly dead.

145
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,230
So he will try his best to find him.

146
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Don't worry.

147
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,680
I have my way to stimulate
them to meet eventually.

148
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,320
What do you think, Homthip?

149
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,580
He looks good.

150
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,520
After the western ceremony,

151
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,920
there will be a Chansaeng
traditional ceremony.

152
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,520
He needs to try on a traditional outfit.

153
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,550
Right.

154
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,860
You look so good.

155
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,640
It's too bad. Your mom should have

156
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,000
seen you in your wedding day.

157
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,800
The happiest day of your life.

158
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,240
What's wrong? Why're you crying?

159
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,280
Tell me, what is it?

160
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,080
Why're you crying?

161
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,720
You need to be careful when you're alone.

162
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,520
Don't open the door to anyone besides us.

163
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Okay.

164
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,200
We need to take care
of VIP guests at the club,

165
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,840
otherwise, we wouldn't
have left you here alone.

166
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Come on.

167
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,480
I'm a man now, I can take care of myself.

168
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,520
You two should get going already.

169
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,840
- Go.
- Fine.

170
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
See you.

171
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,920
You need to find someone to

172
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
watch the entrace on the wedding day.

173
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,080
Don't let Inthorn or Kalong
get into the ceremony.

174
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Yes, sir.

175
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,680
Are you Prince Saenkaew?

176
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
That's right.

177
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,040
Who are you? How did you get in here?

178
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm Sasin's friend.

179
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,600
I sneaked in here to look for you.

180
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,880
Sasin's condition is getting worse

181
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
he's about to die.

182
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
What?

183
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,640
He said that he wanted to see you.

184
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,080
You need to go and see him right now.

185
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Saenkaew is running away. Hurry!

186
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
Prince Saenkaew?

187
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,440
Who is he running after?

188
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Prince Kamfah?

189
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,660
What are they doing?

190
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,000
- Hey! Follow them.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,120
Hello? Let's try the camera, honey.

192
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
So pretty.

193
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
One more shot.

194
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,680
How was it?

195
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,240
- Very chic, honey.
- Oh well.

196
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,080
When Saenkaew comes here to see Sasin,

197
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll snap their photos
when they're in love.

198
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
And I'll expose the photos at his wedding.

199
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,880
His bride will be so mad
and will call off the wedding.

200
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,640
Sounds like a good plan.

201
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,120
But it takes days to develop these photos.

202
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't you think the wedding
will be over once we get the photos?

203
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,240
Why don't they have a camera
that can show photos immediately?

204
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,910
I know.

205
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,680
They're here, let's hide.

206
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,720
Sasin is living inside.

207
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's go, honey.

208
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,640
- Who's that?
- It's me.

209
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,330
Saenkaew?

210
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Saenkaew!

211
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm not dreaming, am I?

212
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
- This one?
- That's right.

213
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,640
- Inthorn?
- You scared me! Kamfah?

214
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,120
- How did you get here?
- How did you get here?

215
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
You?

216
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,960
You planned to kidnap my son?

217
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,360
Kidnap your son?

218
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,600
Why would I do that?

219
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,710
Tell me, what's you plan?

220
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
What are you doing?

221
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,520
Phong! Get up!

222
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,190
What do you think you're doing?

223
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
How're you feeling?

224
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Still hurt?

225
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,240
Tell me! Where are you hiding my son?

226
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,410
Tell me!

227
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,680
I didn't hide Saenkaew anywhere.

228
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,720
Right now, he must be

229
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,040
making out with Sasin, his boyfriend.

230
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,320
What're you talking about?

231
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,840
You didn't expect me to
find out about this, did you?

232
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
I'm not sure about it first

233
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,600
but seeing your face right now, makes me

234
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,760
realize that my guess is right.

235
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,800
- Stop talking nonsense already.
- What nonsense?

236
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,320
You already knew about it, didn't you?

237
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,760
That there's something going on
between Saenkaew and Sasin,

238
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,800
- that's why you sent someone to hurt him.
- What?

239
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh my goodness!

240
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,040
Prince Bodin is joining the party as well?

241
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
What a surprise!

242
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,360
What does it mean?

243
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,720
You know what? When I got shot,

244
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,580
I wasn't afraid of death,

245
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
I was afraid that I couldn't
see your face again.

246
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm worried that my
dad will hurt you again.

247
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,000
If that's the case, then
I'd rather give you up,

248
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,580
than having something happen to you.

249
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,560
I won't give up.

250
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,520
And you can't give up either.

251
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Okay?

252
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,800
Well, why did you ask him that?

253
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,180
You expected to get the truth?

254
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
You should have asked me.

255
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,280
Sasin was shot and almost died

256
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,040
because of my brother.

257
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,520
He was so furious

258
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,670
that Saenkaew is having an
intimate relationship with Sasin.

259
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,400
Come on, brother?

260
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,320
You know it well that your
son doesn't like women

261
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,800
still you tried

262
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,520
to get him to marry
Prince Bodin's daughter.

263
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,200
This is a fraud.

264
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,380
Is it true?

265
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,000
It's not true. Prince Inthorn is lying.

266
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,300
Stop talking.

267
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,060
We should go and see
them with our own eyes.

268
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,960
Saenkaew is now hanging out with Sasin,

269
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,910
after not seeing him for such a long time.

270
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,280
Perhaps they are making out right now.

271
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,840
If you want to see them, please follow me.

272
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,240
Let's go, honey.

273
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
But you can't sneak out
to see me like this again,

274
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,480
your dad could catch you.

275
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Wait?

276
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,560
You told your friend to tell me

277
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,130
that you're in severe
condition, didn't you?

278
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
I didn't.

279
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,780
Sasin!

280
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,120
Saenkaew! Open the door!

281
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,480
Sasin! Saenkaew!

282
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,770
I know that you two are making…

283
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,760
out right now.

284
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,850
I…

285
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,880
What're you doing here?

286
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,180
What're you doing here?

287
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,320
Saenkaew and I are here to see Sasin.

288
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,320
Not true. Sasin and Saenkaew are lovers.

289
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
They're fooling you, Pin-anong.

290
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,520
No way.

291
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,920
Sasin is a cousin that I love so much.

292
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
He won't break my heart for sure.

293
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,840
See? There's nothing like
what Inthorn said earlier.

294
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,480
What should we do?

295
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,320
What do you think? We need to leave.

296
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Saenkaew,

297
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,400
I don't believe you. I
will find a proof for this.

298
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Let's go.

299
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,920
Prince Inthorn can't be trusted for
one second, always a messy one.

300
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,360
Pin, Saenkaew, are you leaving with me?

301
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,320
I'm gonna stay for a bit longer.

302
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,930
I need to discuss something
with Sasin about the wedding.

303
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
Should we go then?

304
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,480
- So they can talk about the wedding.
- Sure.

305
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,800
Would you like to ride with me back home?

306
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Sure.

307
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,390
Pin?

308
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,760
Thank you for…

309
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,880
You think that I'm stupid?

310
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Pin.

311
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,160
My dearest Saenkaew.

312
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,040
One hour earlier.

313
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,400
Saenkaew?

314
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,280
Are you still up?

315
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,020
I want to talk to you
about the wedding guests.

316
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,360
Saenkaew?

317
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,840
My dearest Saenkaew.

318
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,000
You're not the one who go through this.

319
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
I'm right here.

320
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,640
I won't let go of your hands.

321
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,760
You still have me. I love and
care for you more than my own life.

322
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,680
I'll try to find way for you and Ms.
Rachawadee to get a marriage certificate.

323
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,240
I'll do anything for us to be together.

324
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,230
I love him.

325
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,320
I believe that you will be
the last person to hurt me.

326
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,760
I feel like

327
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm the luckiest girl in the world

328
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,600
for having the best
cousin and the best fiancé.

329
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,120
I want the three of us
to stay like this forever.

330
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Sasin?

331
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
I gotta go.

332
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,040
What's wrong with you?

333
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,160
Why did your buttons look like that?

334
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Let me help you.

335
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,320
Not true.

336
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,200
Sasin will never do that.

337
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,880
When I got shot, I wasn't afraid of death,

338
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,450
I was afraid that I couldn't
see your face again.

339
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,180
I'm worried that my
dad will hurt you again.

340
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,270
If that's the case, then
I'd rather give you up,

341
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,800
than having something happen to you.

342
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,760
I won't give up.

343
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,800
And you can't give up either.

344
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Okay?

345
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,960
Follow me.

346
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
This way.

347
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
- Pin?
- Don't say anything, my dad is coming.

348
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,280
- This one?
- That's right.

349
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,680
Sasin.

350
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,880
I know that you two are
making... out right now.

351
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
You know what?

352
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,840
You two are working together
to kill me cold-heartedly.

353
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
Pin.

354
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you do it?

355
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,160
You're like my brother.

356
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,320
You promised to take care of me

357
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,760
to stop people from hurting me.

358
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,640
Now you're the one doing it.

359
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,440
Why're you so mean to me?

360
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,040
So mean.

361
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,180
This is all my fault.

362
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
If you don't love me,

363
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,840
why are you so nice to me?

364
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,120
Why're you making me love you?

365
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,560
I love you as my sister.

366
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,640
I've never meant to hurt you,
I've only meant good intention to you.

367
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,640
But I really can't be your husband.

368
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,020
I'm sorry.

369
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,720
We didn't mean to hide it from you.

370
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm trying to find a way
to stop the wedding.

371
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Then I will tell you.

372
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,960
If you get married,
you will be in so much more pain than this.

373
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
I should thank you?

374
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,640
And be grateful for your generosity?

375
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,600
He didn't mean it like that.

376
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,640
We still love you.

377
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,760
Why does your love

378
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,760
hurt me so much?

379
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,280
I thought that I was the
luckiest woman in the world

380
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,840
with the best cousin

381
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,840
and the best fiancé.

382
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,880
It turned out that I was
too stupid to realize that

383
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,950
two men that I loved the most

384
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
were falling in love with each other.

385
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Pin?

386
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,440
I'm sorry.

387
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,940
I know that I did the wrong thing to you.

388
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,080
I'm trying to fix it.

389
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,240
I'll call off the wedding

390
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,840
and I'll tell everyone that it's my fault.

391
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,880
I won't let the damage reach you.

392
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
And you two will be together?

393
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,240
Congrats.

394
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,970
You understand me, right?

395
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,610
All you want is for me to understand you.

396
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,760
Does anyone understand me or feel my pain?

397
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,280
- Anyone?
- I'm sorry.

398
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,400
You think you can take
Saenkaew away from me?

399
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
No way.

400
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,840
I'll marry him.

401
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,200
- Pin?
- I won't call off the wedding.

402
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Pin?

403
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,520
Why would you do that?

404
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,180
You know that I can't love you.

405
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,960
I will end up in pain no matter what.

406
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,440
So I should just get married.

407
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,920
And all three of us

408
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,200
will end up in pain together.

409
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,320
You don't need to come to my wedding.

410
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,600
You should stay home and rest.

411
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,910
Let's go.

412
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,080
We can't decide who to love

413
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,280
in this world

414
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,880
or how our love should be like.

415
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,720
You have a chance to be happy

416
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
for yourself.

417
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,240
But my happiness

418
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,680
and being myself hurt people.

419
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,840
It hurts people I love.

420
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,020
It's not true.

421
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,680
You're just being yourself.

422
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,200
You're not hurting anyone.

423
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,330
Stop the car.

424
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Stop the car!

425
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,010
Why do you want to stop the car?
You forgot something?

426
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,560
Saenkaew!

427
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Saenkaew!

428
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,560
Why're you here?

429
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,360
I don't want to leave you.

430
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,340
But…

431
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,240
I shouldn't have come back,
what if my dad follows me here?

432
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,680
What if he decided to kill you?

433
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
It's okay.

434
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,320
It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.

435
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,800
Don't cry.

436
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,480
We'll get through this.

437
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
I promise you.

438
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,800
I won't let go of your hands,

439
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
even if I have to die.

440
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,520
Don't say that.

441
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,130
How do I live without you?

442
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,140
Prince Inthorn was out of his mind

443
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,460
for accusing that there's something
going on between Sasin and Saenkaew.

444
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,540
How could it be possible?

445
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,130
This is all complicated.

446
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,480
Sasin got shot,

447
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,320
Saenkaew's letter

448
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,920
and what Prince Inthorn said.

449
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,680
I can't let that happen.

450
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,200
It's embarrassing enough to

451
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,680
be related to a homeless prince,

452
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,960
let alone being involved with a homosexual.

453
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,440
Come in.

454
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
This way, please.

455
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,210
Mr. Kuea?

456
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,000
Why didn't you tell me that you'd come?
I would have prepared to welcome you.

457
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,760
I just got back from my trip abroad.

458
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,920
I just heard that your
daughter is about to get married.

459
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,600
That's right. Tomorrow.

460
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,400
I'm sorry that I didn't invite you, I…

461
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,180
We're busy organizing
the wedding reception.

462
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,940
But we prepared an
invitation for you, here.

463
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Please come.

464
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,680
Please come.

465
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,230
I heard that your future
son-in-law is a prince or some sort.

466
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,720
He's super rich, right?

467
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,840
So about your loan?

468
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,000
- You'll get your money back, including interest.
- Good.

469
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,960
I'll come here and collect
my money tomorrow.

470
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,760
I hope you won't let me down.

471
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,940
Otherwise,

472
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,400
I won't be so kind anymore.

473
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,440
Well, please come to the wedding tomorrow.

474
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,800
You'll get your money back for sure.

475
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,520
It is how it is,

476
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,720
they need to get married no matter what.

477
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,520
If I don't have money to return to him,

478
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,280
he'll kill me for sure.

479
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,720
What if Prince Saenkaew was

480
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,920
a homosexual like what Prince Inthorn said,

481
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,680
what're we gonna do?

482
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,440
If that's true,

483
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,680
it could be good for us.

484
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,940
Sasin.

485
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,280
We've been thinking if
we should ask you this.

486
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,680
About you and Prince Saenkaew.

487
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,680
When we got back home last night,

488
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,680
we saw you and him..

489
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,040
That's right. We're in love.

490
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,120
What?

491
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,120
What about Pin?

492
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,120
She's gonna marry him tomorrow, isn't she?

493
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,520
Saenkaew and I tried to cancel the wedding.

494
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,840
Pin followed Saenkaew here.

495
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,880
And she knows everything.

496
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,800
Still, she insisted on
getting married with him.

497
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,440
What?

498
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,600
- How could they get married when Saenkaew is homo...?
- Hey!

499
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,040
I understand if you
would be disgusted by me.

500
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,880
That's right, you're disgusting.

501
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,560
Hey!

502
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,780
I'm sorry.

503
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,030
I'll pack up and find
another place to live.

504
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,100
You have so many disgusting traits.

505
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,080
Foul mouth,

506
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,960
too much ego, never
listens to anyone, unreliable,

507
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,560
and so many more.

508
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,180
But not you loving Prince Saenkaew.

509
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
What do you mean?

510
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,600
No matter who you love, men or women,

511
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,800
it's none of my business.
You're still my buddy.

512
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,680
You're mine too.

513
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,960
You're my brother.

514
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Thank you.

515
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,240
Thank you for understand me.

516
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,400
I don't understand about
what's going on between you two.

517
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,580
And I don't have to.

518
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,080
It's your life.

519
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,040
I'm on your side even though
I don't understand anything.

520
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,480
Thank you so much.

521
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,980
Let me in!

522
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,000
I'm here to tell you to be prepared.

523
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,800
After the wedding, you and Pin-anong

524
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,800
need to get a marriage certificate
on Monday at the district office.

525
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,340
Then we'll travel to Chaing Mai soon after.

526
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,960
Why is it so sudden?

527
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,050
If it wasn't a holiday today,

528
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,240
I would push you to get a
marriage certificate today.

529
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,600
Please, dad.

530
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,680
You know that I can't marry her.

531
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,580
And you expect me to host
a wedding for you and Sasin?

532
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,180
How did Inthorn find out about

533
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,230
your disgusting behavior?

534
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,680
You really know what we did?

535
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,600
- I can fill you in.
- Saenkaew!

536
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:50,240
Why? You're my father,

537
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,400
don't you want to know your son?

538
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,320
- What is he like?
- But who you are

539
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,640
and what you want

540
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,440
are about to destroy
your family and your life.

541
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
It's not.

542
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,280
You're destroying my life.

543
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,080
You can hate me

544
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,840
or don't see me as your dad all you want.

545
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,180
But you need to think
about others in our family,

546
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,640
think about your grandma.

547
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,320
If she finds out about this,

548
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,640
you can lose her,

549
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
like you lose your mom.

550
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
If you continue to be stubborn,

551
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,720
you can prepare to go to Sasin's funeral.

552
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,320
I'll go shopping for
something for Chiang Mai.

553
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,920
Do you need anything?

554
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,360
- You need to go with her.
- No need to.

555
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
He should stay here and pack up.

556
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,500
Don't you worry.

557
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,600
No matter what happens.

558
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,480
I will still marry him.
