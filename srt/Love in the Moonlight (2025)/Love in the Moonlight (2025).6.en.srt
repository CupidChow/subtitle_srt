00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,070
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 6)

2
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,750
You came all the way to give me the invitation

3
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,870
to Prince Saenkaew's wedding.
Of course, I'll attend the event.

4
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,950
We're so honored for you to attend.

5
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,590
You need to thank him, Saenkaew.

6
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,550
Thank you.

7
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,950
I think I should go.

8
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,230
- I don't want to trouble you any longer.
- Sure.

9
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,390
Congrats.

10
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,010
Congrats.

11
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,630
Sir? What happened to Prince Saenkaew
was not like this. Actually…

12
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,350
I know.

13
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,230
I know that he doesn't want to get married.

14
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,870
You told me already.

15
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,310
But Prince Kamfah visited me like this.

16
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,280
I can't interfere with anything.

17
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,790
I feel bad for him.

18
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,270
He's a good guy and he's honest.

19
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,310
He just wanted to save his family

20
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,470
without having to marry someone he doesn't love.

21
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,950
Songsawat,

22
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,390
a life of someone like him

23
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,710
will get more complicated when his title gets higher.

24
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,750
There're so many rules of living his life.

25
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,670
His duties sometimes need to come first,

26
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,450
even before his own heart.

27
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,150
You think that asking help from the Field Marshal
about transferring assets

28
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,310
will end everything?

29
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,510
I just wanted to find better way than getting married.

30
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,550
I don't want to marry to her.

31
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,310
I don't want to be a selfish person and used her.

32
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,590
Nobody is using anybody in this marriage.

33
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,270
Her dad and I

34
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,070
agreed on something for us to survive.

35
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,470
If there's a better way than marriage,

36
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,030
why don't we try it?

37
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,790
Why do we need Pin to be involved with this?

38
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,550
Let me be in hell all by myself.

39
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,790
Why do you have to drag others to be in hell with me?

40
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,590
You think it's a good idea to involve

41
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,750
a powerful person like the Field Marshal into this?

42
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,510
You were about to cause troubles

43
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,630
among two nations, coming from this marriage.

44
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,990
If there was a mistake,

45
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,070
can you handle that?

46
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,790
We're not gonna talk about this anymore.

47
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,390
You need to prepare to marry Pin-anong.

48
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,390
What? Prince Saenkaew wanted to meet the Field Marshal

49
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,470
because you wanted to ask him to preside over the reception?

50
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,150
Wow!

51
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,870
Our event will be so popular.

52
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,870
It's gonna be all over Bangkok

53
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,850
nope, Thailand.

54
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,310
Pin?

55
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,110
I brought jewelry sets from Saenkaew's mom,
so many of them.

56
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,630
You should try to see
which one is suitable for your wedding gown.

57
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,830
Dueanpradap, Saenkaew's mom,

58
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,550
owned so many beautiful pieces,

59
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,670
including rubies and emeralds. I'll show them to you.

60
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,630
Thank you so much.

61
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,590
- But…
- Pin, honey.

62
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,270
They gave you gifts, you need to accept it.

63
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,590
It's Chansaeng's tradition.

64
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,350
Right?

65
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,270
That's right.

66
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,790
Please filter your guests first.

67
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,630
I'm afraid that someone like Prince Inthorn

68
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,150
would show up.

69
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,030
I don't want to be humiliated again.

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,150
I'm sorry

71
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,870
that my brother caused some dramas earlier.

72
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,670
I promise you that it won't happen again.

73
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,390
But I thought you should be familiar

74
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,110
with humiliation already.

75
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,910
Why should I?

76
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,470
I heard that you visited

77
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,790
pawnshops all the time to pawn your vintage items.

78
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,520
People talked about it all the way to Chansaeng.

79
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,670
So I thought you'd be familiar with it.

80
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,830
Welcome to our little place.

81
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,470
He has no land to live and he still has that big mouth.

82
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,470
You should keep it to yourself.

83
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,950
Can you stop stirring things up?

84
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,990
If he calls off the wedding, we will be in trouble.

85
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
Right now

86
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,570
our creditors are waiting in line to get their money back.

87
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,110
How could Prince Inthorn fool us like that?

88
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,350
They're not good people to hang out with.

89
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,630
I think this rumor could be true.

90
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,390
You still believe Prince Inthorn?

91
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,710
But I felt like this father and son have something to hide.

92
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,810
Saenkaew?

93
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,830
How was it? You met the Field Marshal, didn't you?

94
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,790
That's right.

95
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,390
What did he say? Did he agree to help you?

96
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,630
What was it? Is he gonna help you?

97
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,510
- What's going on?
- What're you doing here, Saenkaew?

98
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,210
Dad?

99
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,320
I mean…

100
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,670
I couldn't sleep so I came out here to get some fresh air.

101
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,190
Is he your dad?

102
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,390
Good evening, sir.

103
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,070
This is Sasin, Pin's cousin.

104
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,630
I think it's getting late.

105
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,510
You should go back to your room.

106
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay.

107
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,590
Wait.

108
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,790
I need to talk to him.

109
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,150
It's late, let's talk tomorrow.

110
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm closing the door.

111
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,750
Nual, where're they heading to?

112
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,830
I heard that they're looking for elderly's gifts for the wedding.

113
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
The wedding?

114
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,510
Why is there a wedding?

115
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,870
Why did you ask about Sasin all of a sudden?

116
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,590
I want to know if he's close to Saenkaew.

117
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,190
Well…

118
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,670
Sasin is an older cousin of Pin.

119
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,030
He is taking care of Pin

120
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,950
so he hangs out with Prince Saenkaew as well.

121
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,150
They're not very close.

122
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,630
Is it true?

123
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,670
About Sasin and your son?

124
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,870
Just like what Homthip said.

125
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,450
They have different lifestyles.

126
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,110
Prince Saenkaew only hangs out with Sasin with Pin is around.

127
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Kamsu.

128
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,830
Thank you

129
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,570
for not telling him about Sasin.

130
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,910
If Prince Kamfah finds out that they're so close,
it will be a trouble.

131
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,110
I don't want to see Prince Saenkaew in trouble.

132
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,350
The wedding is right around the corner,
things will get better.

133
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,430
Let me ask you something.

134
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,230
You've never felt bad for him at least once?

135
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,770
Homthip?

136
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,550
I've seen him since he was little.

137
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,830
Of course I want to see him happy as much as you do.

138
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,510
As a son of Prince Kamfah,

139
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,630
he needs to sacrifice something.

140
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,550
This one is not too bright, it's the right choice for elderly.

141
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,570
- This one is pretty.
- Nice color.

142
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,950
I can't choose.

143
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,670
Saenkaew, which one do you think?

144
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,830
It's up to you.

145
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,310
How could it be up to me?

146
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,990
It's our wedding.

147
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
Well, the top one is fine.

148
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,990
Saenkaew, can you look in the car for me?

149
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,350
I think I forgot my inhaler in there.

150
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,270
- Sure, Grandma.
- Okay.

151
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,990
Is something wrong?

152
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,550
Are you feeling okay?

153
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,710
You don't look so alive today.

154
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,510
It's nothing.

155
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,670
I just feel like when the wedding is

156
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,710
getting closer, Saenkaew looks like
he worries about something.

157
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,110
- It's like he doesn't want to get married.
- You're overthinking it.

158
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,610
What could be a reason for

159
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,670
him not to marry you?

160
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,150
I don't know. I just feel like

161
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,030
I make him feel uncomfortable.

162
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,750
Marriage is a huge deal in life.

163
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,190
Saenkaew is a serious man.

164
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,470
He could be worried if the wedding'd turn out great

165
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,470
or his life after marriage

166
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,590
could go exactly as he expected.

167
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,790
There're so many to things about in his head.

168
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,030
- You think so?
- Yes.

169
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,910
But I believe that

170
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,750
both of you will be happy.

171
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,910
You just have to trust each other

172
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,150
and hold hands

173
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,270
no matter what happens, you'll get through this.

174
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,190
Here's your inhaler.

175
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,830
Let me help you with that.

176
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,950
Should we go?

177
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,670
Sasin! This is huge! Why did you tell me?

178
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,830
- About what?
- Don't act so innocent.

179
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,830
About Pin's wedding.

180
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,150
The Field Marshal will attend the wedding.

181
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,350
Big wedding of the year.
The Field Marshal will preside over the wedding of

182
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,180
Prince Saenkaew Na Chansaeng
and ML. Pin-anong Sirichalalai.

183
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,430
Is Saenkaew back?

184
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,710
I have something to talk to him.

185
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,430
I don't think you should make
Prince Saenkaew worry about anything.

186
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,190
My cousin should be the one to worry about it.

187
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,830
Get out of the way, I need to talk to him.

188
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,990
What do you want to talk to him about?

189
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,870
I can pass the message on.

190
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,230
I'll recite every single one of your word.

191
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,990
I want to ask him

192
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,790
why did the Field Marshal agree to
preside over his wedding?

193
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,790
Saenkaew told me that
he went to see him about assets storage

194
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,230
so he could call off the wedding.

195
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,050
You know about this?

196
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,870
He told me everything

197
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,430
including the fact that
he was forced to marry and he didn't love Pin

198
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,710
- and he will never love her.
- You got it all wrong.

199
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,910
Saenkaew loves Pin-anong

200
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,670
and they will get married.

201
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,670
He has never planned to call off the wedding.

202
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,870
Not true. I'm talking to him. Where is he?

203
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,070
- Saenkaew?
- What're you doing?

204
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,700
Saenkaew!

205
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Let me go!

206
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,350
- Saenkaew!
- Stop that, Kamsu!

207
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,310
What's going on?

208
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,440
Go back to your room!

209
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,270
I said go back to your room! Come on!

210
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,830
What happened?

211
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,030
Why did Kamsu need to hurt Sasin?

212
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,150
What happened?

213
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,790
What happened earlier?

214
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,150
Why did you fight Prince Kamfah's guy?

215
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,910
I need to be honest with you.

216
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,310
Saenkaew doesn't love Pin.
He doesn't want to get married.

217
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,710
What?

218
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,430
He told me that.

219
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,670
Did you tell Pin about this?

220
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,430
I didn't.

221
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,310
Do you know why he didn't want to get married?

222
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,150
I have no idea. But if he doesn't want to,
we shouldn't force him.

223
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,030
I feel bad for Pin.

224
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,110
I'll handle this.

225
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,550
But you can't tell Pin about this, ever. You hear me?

226
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,510
Why didn't Saenkaew want to get married?

227
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,630
He didn't like that Pin's mom was a cook?

228
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,550
- I have no idea.
- What should we do next?

229
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,990
He didn't want to get married,
so he needs to get married.

230
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,430
What's on your mind?

231
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,630
You need to punish Kamsu for what he did today.

232
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,790
I don't know what got into him.

233
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,910
He only focused to pick on Sasin.

234
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,870
Are they close? Sasin and Saenkaew?

235
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,070
That's right, since Saenkaew has lived here.

236
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,510
Sasin is his friend.

237
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,550
They went out and hung out so often.

238
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,270
Saenkaew must like Sasin so much.

239
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,070
Sasin is a good guy.

240
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,950
Since Saenkaew has been friend with him,

241
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,630
he has changed a lot, he looks so lively

242
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,990
and so happy.

243
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,390
I haven't seen him like this for such a long time

244
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,510
since his mom passed away.

245
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,590
Sasin is also reliable.

246
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,390
Saenkaew went outside one night and

247
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,590
he got sick. Good thing Sasin helped him that night.

248
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,150
They spent a night at Sasin's friend's house.

249
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,070
Saenkaew used to spend a night with Sasin.

250
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,150
Yeah, what's wrong?

251
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,290
Hey!

252
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,450
Hey!

253
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,990
What? What's going on?

254
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,230
Why did you climb up here? What is it?

255
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,110
We need to talk.

256
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,290
Come here.

257
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,670
You should leave.

258
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,470
If my dad sees you here, it will be a big trouble.

259
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,950
- Come on.
- Nope. We need to talk.

260
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,310
Did you go to see the Field Marshal?

261
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,530
What did you say to him?
Why did it turn out to be like this?

262
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,870
I was gonna ask him to store my assets like I told you

263
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,230
- but…
- Saenkaew! Open the door!

264
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,390
You need to hide under the bed. Come on.

265
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,110
- Why do I need to hide?
- Hurry up, please.

266
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,670
I told you to open the door!

267
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,670
What are you doing?

268
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,870
I was in the shower. What's going on?

269
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,350
What's the deal with you and Sasin?

270
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,990
It's nothing. He's a close relative to Pin.

271
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,910
What about when you spent the night with him?

272
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,430
I went out that night to run some errands.

273
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,670
I had a fever and I passed out by the street.

274
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,510
He saw me so he took me to his friend's house. That's it.

275
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,070
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

276
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,870
Is it because of Sasin?

277
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,190
That's why you changed your mind
about marrying Pin-anong.

278
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,190
This has gone too far.

279
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,950
I don't want to get married because I don't love her.

280
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,550
It has nothing to do with Sasin.

281
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,930
What's this?

282
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,350
It's a button from my shirt.

283
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,990
- I'll have Thip fix it for me.
- Why are you so nervous?

284
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Nothing.

285
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,030
If you don't like Sasin,

286
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,870
then I won't hang out with him again, okay?

287
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,190
Dad!

288
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
It's enough!

289
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,310
I'm gonna tell Pin about canceling the wedding.

290
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,270
- I can't take it anymore.
- Where are you going?

291
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,110
You asked me about how I felt about her.

292
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,350
I'm gonna tell her that I don't love her.

293
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,150
I just want to do the right thing.

294
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,230
It has never been right since you were born this way.

295
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,430
What you are

296
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,350
will ruin reputation

297
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,230
and bring sorrow to you and people around you.

298
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,230
I used to believe that way

299
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,550
until I met so many people

300
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,270
who have lived their lives the way they wanted.

301
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,950
They seem happy with themselves.

302
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,990
I can't help but think

303
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,710
that I feel ashamed of myself

304
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,910
- and unhappy because of you.
- Saenkaew!

305
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,110
Saenkaew?

306
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,510
Saenkaew?

307
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,430
What's going on?

308
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,950
Grandma asked me to find you.

309
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,670
She wanted you to help pick out jewelry set

310
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,510
that I should wear for the wedding.

311
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,230
He's not feeling well. I'll help you with that.

312
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,050
Are you okay?

313
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,430
- Let me see.
- You should go.

314
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,550
Why did your dad say that

315
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,230
you changed your mind because of me?

316
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,190
He tried to find the cause, you don't need to care about it.

317
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,430
How could I not care about it? This is about me.

318
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,470
And he scolded you

319
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,110
why did he say that you would ruin his reputation?

320
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,470
- You?
- Hey!

321
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,830
I beg of you.

322
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,830
I can't take it anymore.

323
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,390
Can we talk later?

324
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Okay.

325
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,550
You should rest.

326
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,470
What is this?

327
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,590
Newspaper said that the Field Marshal will preside over

328
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,110
the wedding reception of Saenkaew and ML. Pin-anong.

329
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,870
You told me that they were gonna ask him

330
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,430
to store their assets to avoid marriage.

331
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,750
I don't know how it turned out this way.

332
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,110
But it's a good thing.

333
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,230
We don't have to try to stop the Field Marshal

334
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,430
from storing assets from my brother.

335
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,870
How could it be a good thing?

336
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,710
He is getting married and his assets will be transferred.

337
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,910
Think about it.

338
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,750
I mean we only have to deal with my brother,

339
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,950
not with the Field Marshal.

340
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,230
You need to stop the wedding.

341
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,030
So I can seize their assets.

342
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,130
Got it.

343
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,070
Your bags will be kept in the small car

344
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,590
and the ones behind will be kept in the big one.

345
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,070
Pin?

346
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,070
Where are you heading to?

347
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,990
To Hua Hin.

348
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,990
Where're your bags?

349
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,070
Hua Hin? I have no idea.

350
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,830
Nobody told you?

351
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,830
You need to pack your bags, so we can go on vacation.

352
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,870
Sasin won't join us.

353
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,350
Why's that?

354
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,270
I have something to talk to Prince Kamfah.

355
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,790
It's better for him to stay home.

356
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,830
Take care of the house, okay?

357
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,830
Let's go.

358
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Welcome.

359
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,270
Homthip, Kamsu.

360
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,990
Follow Nual and Jin upstairs,

361
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,830
- I told them what rooms to stay in.
- Okay.

362
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,470
Welcome.

363
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,070
I rebuilt this place

364
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,190
and they said that this is the most modern

365
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,150
vacation house of this age.

366
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,750
This is a really cozy place.

367
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,150
You should go upstairs to rest.

368
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,790
We were in the car for so long, you could get tired.

369
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,910
That's right.

370
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,830
This way, I'll take you.

371
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,830
Honey,

372
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,470
why don't you take Saenkaew to the guest house.

373
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,350
I told someone to arrange a room already.

374
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,450
Okay.

375
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,350
We should walk by the beach and swim in the sea.

376
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,230
It's so nice here.

377
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,110
I'm sure you're gonna love it.

378
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,390
During school breaks,

379
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,990
Sasin and I used to stay here for months.

380
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,230
You should ask Thip to accompany you.

381
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,510
I have a bad headache from a car ride.

382
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,950
I'm gonna take a pill and rest for a bit.

383
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,150
I'll follow you.

384
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,230
Get changed and hang out with Pin.

385
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,310
Or she's gonna think
that you don't want to marry her.

386
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,350
Well, she got that right.

387
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,650
You!

388
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,430
You need to hang out with her
and work on your attitude.

389
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,790
Do you need Sasin to come here?

390
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,730
- To light up your mood?
- Dad?

391
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,470
I told you that we're just friends.

392
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,910
There's nothing more.

393
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,990
I really hope so.

394
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,550
If there's something more, I don't know how to react.

395
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,150
He is a man

396
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,550
and he is also a cousin of your future bride.

397
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,030
It's so wrong in many levels, so humiliating.

398
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,470
The weather is so nice, not too hot.

399
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,470
Right.

400
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,830
Is everything okay?

401
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,310
You don't look so happy.

402
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,590
You don't want to be here?

403
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,270
It's not like that.

404
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,190
I think you act like something is bothering you lately.

405
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,190
You worry about the wedding, don't you?

406
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,950
Pin?

407
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,110
- I think our wedding…
- It's fine.

408
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,550
I understand.

409
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,430
Grandma said that marriage is a huge deal in our life.

410
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,150
You could be worried.

411
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,990
If you and I trust in each other,

412
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,430
then we will be happy.

413
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,790
Aunt Homthip, please wait for me.

414
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,370
Get them to the table when they're cooked.

415
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,230
The weather here is really nice.

416
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,590
Right.

417
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,510
I'm glad you like it.

418
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,430
Why don't you take a walk on the beach with them?

419
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,990
Let them hang out with Homthip.

420
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,870
I'm fine right here.

421
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,950
Should we build this one?

422
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,190
You mean a sand castle? Sure.

423
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,310
How did you get here?

424
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,030
I took a train, it's not to far from Bangkok.

425
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,310
Why did you follow me here?

426
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,630
I'm worried about you.

427
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,190
Did your dad abuse you again?

428
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Nope.

429
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,670
I'm glad there's no scar.

430
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,110
Is it hurt?

431
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,270
Not anymore.

432
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,190
Sasin?

433
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,970
You followed us here?

434
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,670
Good. Where's your bag?

435
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,070
Did you leave it in the house?

436
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,630
It's okay. I can find a place to stay.

437
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,830
Why don't you stay with us?

438
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,350
You know that I just had a fight with Kamsu.

439
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,590
Your dad was so mad at me.
If he knows that I follow you here,

440
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,470
he will be mad again.

441
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,710
Don't tell anyone that I'm here.

442
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,470
We'll talk later.

443
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,110
After the wedding,

444
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,350
you're gonna transfer all assets to be under Pin's name, right?

445
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
That's right.

446
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,390
After I'm done finding

447
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,870
concession to open timber business in Thailand,

448
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,910
Pin needs to transfer them back to be under my name

449
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,330
and my son's name.

450
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,230
And I'll provide money to you like we agreed.

451
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,870
Sounds good to you?

452
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,870
Not a problem.

453
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,710
As long as our children are in love,

454
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,790
it won't be my problem.

455
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,910
Sasin?

456
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,750
You followed us here?

457
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,150
It's all in my head.

458
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,910
What is this?

459
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,590
I sent you a signal

460
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,190
randomly, I don't know which room you stay.

461
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,730
I'm glad you found me.

462
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,030
Why did you call me here?

463
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,510
I'm gonna tell you

464
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,470
about the plan to stop the wedding of you and Pin.

465
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,950
Really?

466
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,670
- What?
- It seemed like the light was coming this way.

467
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,770
Let's hide.

468
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,990
So dark.

469
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,390
- Can you see anything?
- I didn't see anything.

470
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,730
Is this the one?

471
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,510
So dark in here.

472
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,190
I can't see anything.

473
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,390
The light that you saw

474
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,070
- could be a ghost.
- Come on.

475
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,830
What ghost?

476
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,830
Prince Kamfah also saw it, he told me to look around.

477
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,230
He's worried that
Kalong and Prince Inthorn would follow us here.

478
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,430
You two need to look on that side.

479
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,270
I'll look around this side.

480
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,590
What is it?

481
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,570
They're all here?

482
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,550
Because of you, your light was so bright,
I thought the whole beach saw you.

483
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,510
We should find a quiet place to talk

484
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,470
about my plan. Let's go.

485
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,830
Hey!

486
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,830
Hey!

487
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,750
- Hop on.
- What're you doing?

488
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,590
Your dad's people are all over the land,
let's talk in the sea. Come on.

489
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:49,830
Watch out!

490
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,550
Wait!

491
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,760
Hey!

492
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,030
What're you doing?
We don't know whose boat it is.

493
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,950
Don't worry, it belongs to a fisherman around here.

494
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,630
I'm close with them.
I hung out here all the time when I was little.

495
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,310
You can sit there.

496
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,590
Come on, the boat will leave the shore soon.

497
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
You ready?

498
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,510
We're leaving now.

499
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,970
Why did you stop?

500
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,670
Are we gonna talk here?

501
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,550
I didn't, I think we're running out of gasoline.

502
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,750
Yep, no gas left.

503
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,740
What should we do?

504
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,630
Calm down.

505
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,670
We're gonna wait here
until the other boats come around.

506
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,630
They'll be hunting for fish when it's getting late.

507
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,980
Damn it!

508
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
What it is?

509
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,910
What's going on?

510
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,150
Hey! What should we do?

511
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:09,470
Watch out!

512
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,370
Saenkaew?

513
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,910
Saenkaew?

514
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,310
I called you, you didn't hear me?

515
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,750
What should we do?

516
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,270
Hold on tight, okay?

517
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
Hey!

518
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,390
We can't just wait here on the boat.

519
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,630
There's a small island not too far from here.

520
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,030
You think you can swim there?

521
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,650
But…

522
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,750
It's not safe in here.

523
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,350
If the storm gets stronger,
we will be drifting further away from the shore.

524
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,040
Don't worry.

525
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,390
I'm here with you,
I won't let anything happen to you.

526
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,630
Let's go.

527
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,270
What is it?

528
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,430
Saenkaew is not here.

529
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,190
The light that you saw earlier?

530
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,990
You think he could be abducted?

531
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,030
Let's split and find him.

532
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,790
Yes, sir.

533
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,630
How're you?

534
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,910
There's a small cottage that
the fishermen used to hide from storm.

535
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,630
It's over there. We should get there.

536
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,710
Let's go. It's getting stronger.

537
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,970
There's some fuel in here, that's good.

538
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,470
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

539
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,790
Some clean clothes are here.

540
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:51,910
Why don't you change?

541
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,140
Hey!

542
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,550
Hey!

543
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,450
What're you doing?

544
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
What?

545
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,750
I need to change my clothes.

546
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,430
You want me to wear wet clothes?

547
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,150
I could get pneumonia.

548
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,670
You need to change too, hurry up.

549
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,870
Snake!

550
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,910
Watch out!

551
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,920
- What is it?
- Snake!

552
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,110
It's not a snake.

553
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,590
It's just a rope.

554
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,510
- I thought it was a snake.
- What snake?

555
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,190
You scared me.

556
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,310
What if it bit you?
