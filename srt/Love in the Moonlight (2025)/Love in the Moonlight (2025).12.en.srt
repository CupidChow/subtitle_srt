00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,770
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 12-13)

2
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,780
I heard that Sasin was here.

3
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,020
He left already.

4
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,090
Are you sure?

5
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,930
It's not that you're hiding him somewhere?

6
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,690
You still remember right?

7
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,410
What's gonna happen
if you're around him one more time?

8
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,170
You don't need to remind me.

9
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,250
I remember everything.

10
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,490
I remember that I need to protect his life with mine.

11
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,810
Don't say that to Pin-anong.

12
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,690
Don't you forget

13
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,210
that you are her husband now.

14
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,250
It's carved in my brain

15
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,450
that I'm her husband,

16
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,530
your son, and

17
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,370
a leader of this timber business.

18
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,610
Is there anything else that you'd like me to be?

19
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,290
You can order me around. Because right now

20
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,530
it's like I'm losing myself completely.

21
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,330
I did everything

22
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,810
to save you from embarrassment.

23
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,690
Your attempt was a success.

24
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,050
I'm happy for you.

25
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,490
Am I doing the right thing?

26
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Soon,

27
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,370
our son will be normal, right?

28
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,330
My Little Prince,

29
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,450
you're still up?

30
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,050
I don't want to see you like this.

31
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,610
I want to see you happy.

32
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,070
Can't you forget about him?

33
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,890
I really can't.

34
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,610
Memory about him

35
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,890
is the only thing that encourage me
to wake up every morning.

36
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,290
I'm still alive so that I can remember him.

37
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,410
When I forget about him,

38
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,930
there's no reason for me to live.

39
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,330
I think you should stop.

40
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Hey!

41
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,570
Just let me drink.

42
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,210
So I can forget everything like Saenkaew told me to.

43
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,050
Sasin, you know it well that

44
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,090
it's impossible.

45
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,730
Your memories are not like written on a blackboard

46
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,850
that can be erased anytime.

47
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,650
When you wake up tomorrow, and you're sober,

48
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,730
you will think about him even more.

49
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,090
If you're not stop drinking, you could die.

50
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,490
Sasin.

51
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,650
Saenkaew.

52
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,770
I love you.

53
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,490
Your lunch.

54
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,550
It's your dinner.

55
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,250
I told you to watch him.

56
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,250
I tried to stop him but he didn't listen.

57
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,830
So heavy.

58
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,650
Thank you Mr. Governor for inviting us

59
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,570
to your New Year's party at your place.

60
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,690
With my pleasure.

61
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,770
Your granddaughter-in-law is quite lovely.

62
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,970
She's a perfect match to your grandson.

63
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,670
It's too bad I couldn't attend the wedding.

64
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,690
I'd like to wish both of you

65
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,530
a lifetime of happiness and stay together forever.

66
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,130
When will you give a great-grandchild to your grandma?

67
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,410
I'll leave it to fate.

68
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,530
Prince Nukul is here today,

69
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,370
we should go over there and talk to him.

70
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,370
Sure.

71
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,930
Are you two coming?

72
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,010
You two should go.

73
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,930
I'll stay here and talk to the wood merchants.

74
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,170
Sure.

75
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,220
Please, this way.

76
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,370
Wait.

77
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,830
Pin.

78
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,730
I think you're drinking too much lately.

79
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,170
I'm drinking to be in a good mood.

80
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,890
So people can see that we're happy.

81
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,250
You should

82
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,210
drink some more.

83
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,290
Hello, Chatree.

84
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,810
- Hello.
- How're you?

85
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,250
- I'm good.
- Long time no see.

86
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,730
I haven't seen your wife lately.

87
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,570
- Is she good?
- She's fine.

88
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,050
I'm glad to finally meet one of the relatives.

89
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,290
So glad.

90
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,770
Should we talk inside?

91
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,450
- Let's go.
- This way.

92
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,730
Easy there. Be careful.

93
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,290
I heard that people of Nanta are struggling

94
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,130
with heated civil war.

95
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,530
Instead, the leader of Nanta

96
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,080
is crossing the border to Thailand to travel, happily.

97
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,810
I'm not here to leisure.

98
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,650
I need to attend a meeting to discuss

99
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,810
how to bring Nanta back to normal stage.

100
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,690
And making Nanta people to be flourished like before.

101
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,690
Can you do it?

102
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,490
A country led by a ruler with no brain,

103
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,530
but only uses the muscles,

104
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,070
it is waiting to be ruined anyways.

105
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,050
Look at you,

106
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,850
you're living in Thailand

107
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,090
you can say and do anything. I can't stop you.

108
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,730
In the past,

109
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,610
you used Inthorn to attack me, didn't you?

110
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,290
A coward like him is bound to be a failure.

111
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,010
He damaged my plan so many times.

112
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,390
If you see him,

113
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,610
tell him not to show his face in Nanta again.

114
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,530
He didn't come to see you in Nanta?

115
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,890
A coward like him?

116
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,890
I don't think he would dare to go back to Nanta.

117
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,810
The photos will be ready in two days?

118
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,610
That's right. I just got off the phone with Hong Kong.

119
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,770
Do you get all the photos?

120
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,250
We got all of them, none of them was damaged.

121
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,770
Hello, Somsak.

122
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,450
Luck is on a good man's side like me.

123
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,450
Excuse me, sir. Gen. Sattha,

124
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,210
Minister of Forestry, asked to discuss about

125
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,090
revenue from timber business in Chansaeng. It's urgent.

126
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,410
Tell him to come in.

127
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Yes, sir.

128
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,070
We can talk about the details later.

129
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,620
This is huge.

130
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,650
I need to think carefully.

131
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,330
Expenses and incomes of last month.

132
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,330
Thanks.

133
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,410
Who did you talk to on the phone earlier?

134
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,850
What's huge?

135
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,770
When I make a final decision, I will let you know.

136
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,810
Eww! Disgusting. This is so wrong and crazy!

137
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,090
If Pin sees these photos,

138
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,730
she will get so upset

139
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,530
and she will divorce Prince Saenkaew.

140
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,890
All their assets and timber business are under Pin's name.

141
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,690
We will seize all of them.

142
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,970
And we will be rich like we used to.

143
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,250
Should we send the photos to Pin?

144
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,210
Are you out of your mind?

145
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,170
If Prince Kamfah saw them first and seized them,

146
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,010
- we'd be in trouble.
- What?

147
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,890
What're we gonna do?

148
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,210
- My dad is severely ill?
- That's right.

149
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,730
He got a high fever in the morning,

150
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,610
and he almost passed out and fell off the stairs.

151
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,470
I asked a doctor to see him at our house.

152
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,810
Honey, did you call Pin?

153
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,970
Is that him coughing?

154
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,810
Honey? Are you coughing blood?

155
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,610
Pin,

156
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,610
you need to come down here to see your dad, hurry up.

157
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,570
Don't wait for anyone. You should be here alone.

158
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,210
Hurry up and you need to come here alone.

159
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,570
Sure. I'll be there as soon as I can.

160
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Okay.

161
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,590
What's wrong with your dad?

162
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,850
- He's severely ill.
- Oh my!

163
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,270
Honey?

164
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,750
Honey?

165
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,530
Honey?

166
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,770
You crazy!

167
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,290
You stole my food again?

168
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,740
- I'm not crazy.
- Go away.

169
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,240
Or I'll beat you to dead.

170
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,010
That's Chai. He picked her up at the train station.

171
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,290
- They're here.
- They're here.

172
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,810
Lie down. I need to lie down.

173
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,810
Dad?

174
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,970
Dad?

175
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,490
How're you feeling?

176
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,770
Pin?

177
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,810
I suddenly feel much better

178
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,530
after seeing your face.

179
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,370
You're so sick.

180
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,650
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

181
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,210
Hello.

182
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,670
Hello, how are you?

183
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,850
You're all here?

184
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,170
I have an important meeting in Bangkok.

185
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,490
So I thought I should stop by.

186
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,370
- What?
- I'm cold.

187
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,450
I also brought you some herbs.

188
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,970
I told Homthip to brew them for you.

189
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,730
Thank you.

190
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,690
Didn't you tell Pin repeatedly to come here alone?

191
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,210
They're all here, the whole family.

192
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,290
You heard me that I told her over and over.

193
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,890
What should we do next?

194
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,850
It's a good thing that they're all here.

195
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,770
We can take care of it all at once.

196
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,730
You look so moody, Little Rabbit.

197
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,450
Who did you call a rabbit?

198
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,850
I called who?

199
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,850
I'm talking to my work.

200
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,690
You followed me back to Bangkok.

201
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,810
I'm not sure if you wanted to see my dad or someone else.

202
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,730
My dad ordered me to come, so I needed to come.

203
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,130
Don't worry,

204
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,890
I'm not going to see Sasin.

205
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,090
- I know my duty.
- Of course, you do.

206
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,070
I know how well you follow your duty.

207
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,330
Where're you going?

208
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,850
- You can't stand even one minute to talk to me?
- Pin.

209
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,930
Please stop.

210
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,310
Don't start it.

211
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,810
It will be much worse than this

212
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,890
if you continue to choose this path.

213
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,530
You know that it won't end well.

214
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,810
One day, you could wake up and realize that

215
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,090
a man who you love with all your heart

216
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,330
looks at you with full of hatred.

217
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,930
One day, you could hear Prince Saenkaew calls your name

218
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,660
but it isn't in a gentle tone like he used to.

219
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,130
Instead, his voice will be full of anger and torment.

220
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,130
That is the day that you will finally realize

221
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,370
the taste of real pain.

222
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,370
Sanya?

223
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,170
When did you come back here?

224
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,450
Just yesterday.

225
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm here to see Dad. He's not feeling well.

226
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,370
You look at me like this.

227
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,450
You think I look so ridiculous, don't I?

228
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,810
I know it well that you.

229
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,570
Mingmitr

230
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,220
and Ms. Rachawadee are on Sasin's side.

231
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,450
Nobody welcomes me here,

232
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,970
still I'm here.

233
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,690
It's nothing like that.

234
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,930
You can come here anytime.

235
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,270
I miss the old days

236
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,770
when life seemed so simple and easy.

237
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,450
I sneaked out here

238
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,270
to listen to music

239
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,490
to dance

240
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,070
and I was so happy.

241
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,730
Today, I've tried so hard

242
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,810
and still I'm not happy.

243
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,490
No matter how hard I've tried,

244
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,410
he still doesn't love me.

245
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,890
Pin,

246
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,130
it's not about trying when it comes to love.

247
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,810
It's about our hearts.

248
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,070
I've been falling in love with you for such a long time.

249
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,370
I tried to do anything for you to notice.

250
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,970
But you still don't love me back.

251
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,210
It's not your fault

252
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,090
for not loving me back.

253
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,010
Same does Saenkaew.

254
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,370
I'm glad to see you again.

255
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,290
I should leave you alone.

256
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,330
Sanya,

257
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,470
how is Sasin?

258
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,490
See? You never listened to me.

259
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,930
I told you not to drink too much.

260
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,470
Now you puked in blood. What're you gonna do?

261
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,850
I don't care.

262
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,050
It's either dead of alive.

263
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
How could you say that?

264
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,450
If you were my child, I'd hit you for sure.

265
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,170
You're still young, how could you talk about death?

266
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,610
This is not Sasin that I used to know.

267
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,330
Get up and eat. Now!

268
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,890
Come on!

269
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,970
Or I'll pour it down your throat, come on!

270
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,830
Give it to me.

271
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,770
Just eat it.

272
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
Sasin?

273
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,980
What's going on?

274
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
Sasin?

275
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,290
It must be from spring onions in congee.

276
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Pin?

277
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,190
When he is sick,
his sense of smell will be stronger.

278
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,810
He doesn’t like the smell of spring onions.

279
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,610
I brew some herbs from Chansaeng.

280
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,270
You should drink it and it'll cure you.

281
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
How did you get here?

282
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,930
She's in Bangkok to visit his dad.

283
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,850
When she heard that you're sick,
she wanted to see you.

284
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,890
Is it true?

285
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,050
Thank you for still thinking about me.

286
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,730
We promised my mom

287
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,890
that we will take care of each other.

288
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,890
You must have forgotten about it,

289
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,170
but I haven't.

290
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,970
I'm sorry.

291
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,810
I'm sorry for making you sad.

292
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,450
I know that my apology isn't enough

293
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,090
but I feel really bad for hurting you.

294
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,210
It's all right.

295
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,330
Because I'm happy with my life right now.

296
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,090
Please give him this herbal remedy.

297
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,170
I need to go.

298
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,090
Please take care of him.

299
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,610
Wait.

300
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,510
Well?

301
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,570
Are you in Bangkok by yourself?

302
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Nope.

303
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,750
I'm here with my husband.

304
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,970
I should go.

305
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,410
Get better soon.

306
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,070
What is it?

307
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,550
Are you feeling well?

308
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,130
You don't need to know.

309
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,070
Did Prince Kamfah ask you to transfer his assets back?

310
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,490
Not yet.

311
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,570
Why're you asking me that?

312
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Good.

313
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,050
Don't give anything back to him, okay?

314
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,730
Not even one baht.

315
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,530
But you made an agreement with him

316
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,330
that I need to transfer everything back in three months.

317
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,410
I made that agreement
because I thought he was a good man.

318
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,970
I thought he'd love you like his own daughter.

319
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,050
I thought you'd be happy when you married his son.

320
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,730
I've never thought that

321
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,410
he would have an evil plan to fool everyone.

322
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,250
What do you know?

323
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,810
He let you married his homosexual son.

324
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,570
More importantly, he had an affair with Sasin.

325
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,690
Where did you get these photos?

326
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,570
Doesn't matter.

327
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,730
Your job is to show these photos to Saenkaew.

328
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,150
And divorce him.

329
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,980
Then you need to collect their assets
as your compensation.

330
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,130
If they don't agree,

331
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,370
I will expose these photos

332
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,130
to newspapers and people will find out

333
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,810
the true color of

334
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,010
Prince Kamfah's son.

335
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,210
Please calm down.

336
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,650
I'll handle the divorce.

337
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,450
And…

338
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,090
do you have all photos of them?

339
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,200
Yes. But I have this negative.

340
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,130
We can get more copies if we want.

341
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,250
Can I get it too?

342
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,050
Why would you want that for?

343
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,970
I'll threaten them with this.

344
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,170
To show them what we're capable of.

345
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,970
So clever, my girl.

346
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,670
I think you need to take care of it

347
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,210
while they're in Bangkok.

348
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,170
If something unexpected happens,
I can still help you out.

349
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,350
Don't you worry.

350
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,370
I'll take care of everything before I head back.

351
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,970
Thank you for agreeing to meet me today.

352
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,670
I'm not here because of you.

353
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,890
I'm here as a good citizen of Chansaeng.

354
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
If so,

355
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,130
well I need to appreciate you even more.

356
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,730
Let's get to business.

357
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,050
What did you just say?

358
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:22,210
Kalong proposed a position for you
to be an economic advisor for Nanta?

359
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,190
That's right.

360
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,090
And I said yes.

361
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,330
Nanta is facing with economic crisis.

362
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,070
I see that

363
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,090
our knowledge in wood business

364
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,930
could save his administration

365
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,090
and boost up business in Chansaeng.

366
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,130
Help Kalong?

367
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,850
A person that caused us to escape from Chansaeng?

368
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,130
A person who killed Uncle Lafah
and other royal family members in Nanta?

369
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,290
You're gonna help him?

370
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,250
I did it for Chansaeng

371
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,770
for our hometown

372
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,010
for our opportunity and future.

373
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,010
For us?

374
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,130
You meant for you and Kalong, right?

375
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,370
- Saenkaew?
- In the end, there is no eternal allies,

376
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,530
and no perpetual enemies.

377
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,970
It's all about benefit.

378
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,530
What about me?

379
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,370
I sacrificed everything.

380
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,890
I agreed to married someone I don't love.

381
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,490
I agreed to stay away
from someone I love with all my heart.

382
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,530
All of that was for nothing?

383
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,250
What happened between me and Kalong

384
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,290
is all about politics.

385
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,490
But your story is different.

386
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,730
The disgusting behavior of you and Sasin

387
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,090
can't be accepted by anyone.

388
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
For me

389
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,970
what I did was less shameless
than being hungry for money

390
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,050
and neglected morals like what you're about to do.

391
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,010
Pin? I thought you have something to talk to me.

392
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,650
What is it about?

393
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,690
Why do we have to walk here?

394
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,460
I don't want anyone to hear what we're about to discuss.

395
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,430
Pin?

396
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,490
I think we can talk right here.

397
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,970
We don't have to walk all the way to that place.

398
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,910
I miss this old place.

399
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,570
I stayed with Mom for so long
then I gave it to Sasin.

400
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,470
So many good memories happened there.

401
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,570
You like that place too, don't you?

402
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,170
Let me go.

403
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,470
Let me go.

404
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,290
Where're you going, thief?

405
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,090
I think I should go.

406
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,270
I promised Grandma that I'll take her shopping.

407
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,090
My dad had photos of you kissing Sasin.

408
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,530
He wanted to use them to
ask for more money from you and your dad.

409
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,410
I got them all, photos and negative.

410
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,610
If you want to destroy them,
you can get them from the house.

411
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,730
I put them up there.

412
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,110
It really is you!

413
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,390
Sasin?

414
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,520
I'm not dreaming, am I?

415
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,450
How did you get here?

416
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,010
Pin came to see me

417
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,850
she saw that I was sick.

418
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,290
She felt bad for me

419
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,650
so she let me stay here.

420
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
What about you?

421
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
What're you doing here?

422
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,730
Pin told me to look for photos of us kissing.

423
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,410
She said that she kept them here.

424
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,730
Did you see it?

425
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,370
Photos?

426
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,190
I didn't see anything.

427
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,270
Pin didn't come to this place for a while.

428
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,610
But…

429
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,810
Sasin.

430
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,210
I gave Saenkaew back to you.

431
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,370
I think I should go.

432
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Can you stay a little longer please?

433
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,450
I still miss you.

434
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,370
It's not easy

435
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,050
to live without you.

436
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,420
I know.

437
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,690
Nothing is easy

438
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,290
if we have to live alone.

439
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,650
The only thing that keeps me going

440
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,970
is to know that you're still safe.

441
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,630
Therefore,

442
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,690
I need to go.

443
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,690
Good luck in everything.

444
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:53,970
Saenkaew!

445
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,810
Please stay.

446
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
Please?

447
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,870
Just a little bit.

448
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,930
I want to memorize your face.

449
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,290
I want to feel you.

450
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,250
Let me be happy for just a minute.

451
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,780
Saenkaew!

452
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,090
Grandma.

453
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,170
Grandma.

454
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,730
Grandma!

455
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
- Grandma.
- Grandma!

456
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,020
- Grandma.
- Grandma!

457
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,060
- Prince Saenkaew!
- Grandma!

458
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:22,930
Prince Saenkaew?

459
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,530
Grandma!

460
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,770
I shouldn't have called you two here to meet up.

461
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,890
Otherwise, she wouldn't been like this.

462
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,370
I'm really sorry.

463
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,350
- She's awake now.
- Grandma?

464
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,310
Grandma!

465
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,490
Grandma!

466
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,690
How are you feeling?

467
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,810
You and Sasin?

468
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:18,810
Grandma.

469
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,970
I'm sorry that I kept it from you.

470
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,630
I love Saenkaew.

471
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,390
We are in love.

472
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,670
But Saenkaew and…

473
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,790
Pin.

474
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,810
I know about them even before the wedding.

475
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,810
But I still pushed to marry him.

476
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,930
Please don't be mad at him.

477
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,810
I'm sorry.

478
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,450
Please forgive me.

479
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,970
Please be okay.

480
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,690
I'm worried that I'd lose you like I lost my mom.

481
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,290
I promise you that

482
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,450
I won't come to see Sasin again. I promise.

483
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,570
Why would you do that?

484
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,960
You love him.

485
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,810
Why wouldn't you want to see him again?

486
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,050
Why didn't you tell me?

487
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,750
You've kept this

488
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:57,280
all to yourself and been tortured all alone?

489
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,810
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,850
I could help.

491
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Grandma?

492
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,850
You're not disgusted that I'm like this?

493
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,670
You're a wonderful boy

494
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,130
you've sacrificed a lot,

495
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,070
why would I be disgusted?

496
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,070
Don't worry.

497
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,810
I'll stand by his side.

498
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,020
Thank you.

499
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,170
May bad things stay away from me.

500
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,770
May you attract only good things.

501
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,510
This cotton thread

502
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,090
is a blessing from me.

503
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,050
I tied these for you

504
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,220
and I wish you to be strong

505
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,850
with a stable heart

506
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,010
just like this thread.

507
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,050
The world could judge

508
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,810
and the path could be rough,

509
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:18,070
but I wish love from two of you

510
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,690
will protect one another.

511
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,650
Please take care of Saenkaew.

512
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Sure, I will.

513
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:40,210
I don't care if others disapprove this,

514
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,890
as for me,

515
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,210
you two received thread tying blessing ceremony

516
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,770
from Chansaeng tradition.

517
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:55,250
And you're now life partners.

518
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,210
Can I tie the thread to

519
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,770
bless both of them?

520
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,570
Sure you can, come here.

521
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,410
When Grandma tied the threads

522
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,050
for us last time,

523
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,490
you're tied to me because of your duty.

524
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,410
But this time I hope

525
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,690
that this thread

526
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,730
will tie your love with Sasin.

527
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:17,210
Pin?

528
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,770
It's all my fault.

529
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,650
I'm sorry.

530
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,850
I should have told you the truth sooner.

531
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,770
I was a coward.

532
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,730
I was too ashamed to say it out.

533
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,360
Please take care of

534
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,010
Saenkaew for me.

535
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:13,850
Thank you so much.

536
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:16,830
Come here.

537
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,670
Now I understand

538
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,330
that love is not about owning someone

539
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,130
but it is to be happy

540
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,370
when someone we love is happy.

541
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:55,130
I want you to remember me

542
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,530
as a sister who loves

543
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,290
and means well to you.

544
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,490
Don't remember as someone

545
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,730
who tried to separate you two

546
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,810
and make you feel bad.

547
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,450
I've never seen you that way.

548
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,890
Pin.

549
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,690
What is it?

550
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,010
Why do you want all of us here?

551
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,570
Our family need to talk to your family

552
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,110
about something, honestly.

553
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,750
It seems to be something huge.

554
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,330
You made it sound so scary.

555
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,110
Pin, go on.

556
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,810
- Go on about what?
- Come on.

557
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,690
Say that you feel trapped

558
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,090
that you are used. Come on.

559
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,570
She is sad and she is mad

560
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,890
that she was a fool for marrying Prince Saenkaew.

561
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,290
When Prince Saenkaew

562
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:46,090
doesn't even like women.

563
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,330
Khunying Wad?

564
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,170
Someone warned us about this

565
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,570
but we ignored it.

566
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,610
Because we trusted in

567
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,330
Chansaeng's pride.

568
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,610
We couldn't believe that you would fool us like this.

569
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,170
We have photos as evidence.

570
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:14,710
They are photos of Prince Saenkaew

571
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,610
kissing his lover

572
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,530
and he is Sasin, Pin's cousin.

573
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,770
What do you want us to do?

574
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,850
He needs to divorce Pin as soon as possible.

575
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,850
And assets that are registered under her name

576
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,330
will be preserved for her only.

577
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,610
They will be considered as compensation for my girl.

578
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,410
- Don't you think it's way too much?
- Obviously not.

579
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,850
Comparing to humiliation that I received.

580
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:47,210
But if you refused to do so,

581
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,810
then it's fine.

582
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,370
I'll send the photos to all newspapers

583
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,730
in Thailand and Chansaeng.

584
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:55,850
People will find out about

585
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,690
that Prince Saenkaew, the only son of Prince Kamfah,

586
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,290
is a homosexual.

587
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,490
You can't do that.

588
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,270
Sure, why can't I?

589
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,690
For my one and only daughter

590
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,090
of course I can do anything.

591
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,810
Show them to Prince Kamfah and Princess Sridara.

592
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,770
Show them how humiliated they are.

593
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,090
There're no more photos.

594
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,290
What?

595
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,810
I burned them all, photos and negative.

596
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,050
Pin! You bitch!

597
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,810
Saenkaew is a good person and he is my good husband.

598
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,490
I can't let both of you hurt him like that.

599
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,130
Pin! You ungrateful child!

600
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,010
- Give me back my photos and negative!
- Let her go!

601
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,570
Don't touch my wife.

602
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,010
Let's go.

603
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,880
Pin! Come back here!

604
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,490
- Pin!
- I've heard enough.

605
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,410
You don't care about our families' relation.

606
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,410
You made something up without any proof.

607
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:06,130
I need to cut ties with Sirichalalai Palace from now on.

608
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,290
Kamsu!

609
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,530
Yes, sir!

610
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,770
Pack up!

611
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,450
We will leave this place right now.

612
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,210
And we will not come back here ever again.

613
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,210
What should we do?

614
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:38,450
Kamfah ends the relationship with us.

615
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,530
We will have nothing left.

616
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:48,840
But everything is still under Pin's name.

617
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,730
We need to make Prince Saenkaew disappear.

618
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,080
What do you mean?

619
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,330
The only way out is to get rid of Prince Saenkaew.

620
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:02,490
Get rid of?

621
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,970
You're gonna kill him.

622
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,010
If he dies now,

623
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,290
everything will belong to his wife.

624
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,570
Then we can pressure that crazy girl later

625
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,050
to transfer everything to us.

626
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,810
But it's too risky.

627
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,050
What if somebody caught us?

628
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,610
Don't let anyone catch us.

629
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,090
We need to do it before they find out,

630
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,070
and transfer all assets.

631
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,830
I bought this house

632
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,450
from my friend many years ago.

633
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,190
Even before I moved from Chansaeng.

634
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,170
So that I have a place to stay
when I come to Bangkok for business.

635
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:55,090
The house is so cool and lovely.

636
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,530
I'm sorry for my dad, he caused a scene yesterday.

637
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,570
It's okay.

638
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:18,650
About Saenkaew,

639
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,270
I really appreciate you.

640
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,930
Don't you worry.

641
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,370
I won't leave him for sure.

642
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,730
Thank you so much.

643
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,070
We'll go back to Chiang Mai tomorrow

644
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,610
and we won't have to deal with this craziness ever again.

645
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,810
Your dad planned to hurt Saenkaew?

646
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,490
I'm afraid it's more than hurting him.

647
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,330
He really needs money

648
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,530
and that money is under my name.

649
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:02,090
I will protect him, I won't let anyone hurt him.

650
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:05,730
Sasin,

651
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,550
I think

652
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,610
it's time for both of you to decide to do something about it.

653
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,130
The train will leave at 12:30 PM.

654
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,490
Sasin will wait at Bangkok Noi Station.

655
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:31,170
But our train to Chiang Mai will leave at 6:00 PM.

656
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:35,570
What should we do to distract his dad from this?

657
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,310
I'll distract Kamfah.

658
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:46,710
Pin,

659
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:50,090
you need to take him to see Sasin as soon as possible.

660
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,450
Grandma?

661
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,770
Don't worry about me.

662
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,770
I don't know if we will meet again

663
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,650
after being apart this time.

664
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,370
I will miss you so much.

665
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:23,690
The most important thing is that.

666
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:27,410
I know

667
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:29,930
my beloved grandson

668
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,490
will live his life happily.

669
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,450
I will take care of her.

670
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,170
Don't you worry.

671
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:58,120
Thank you so much.

672
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,690
You need to start packing now.

673
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
Sir?

674
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:29,850
Please wait.

675
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:44,830
Your dad wanted me to ask

676
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:46,960
if you'd like anything from Bang Lamphu.

677
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,730
He told the maids to buy many kinds of chili paste

678
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,210
back to Chiang Mai.

679
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:53,970
It's okay.

680
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,770
I need to pack.

681
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,100
Grandma?

682
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,920
Sasin.

683
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,890
You're about to leave. I'm gonna miss you.

684
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,470
Can I have a hug?

685
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,650
So dramatic. He's not leaving here to die.

686
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,930
Don't forget about us. Good luck.

687
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,650
How could I forget about you?

688
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,380
Good luck, pal.

689
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,490
See? You just scolded me.

690
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:54,010
You're getting sad too.

691
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,150
You're hugging him so tight.

692
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,430
Good luck.

693
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:58,930
I'm happy for you.

694
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,270
You will finally be with the one you love.

695
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,770
Even though you have to hide and run away,

696
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,670
it doesn't mean that your love is wrong.

697
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,410
Thank you so much, everyone.

698
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,090
Thank you for helping me until now.

699
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,590
Really appreciate it.

700
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,620
Madame?

701
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,410
You want some mangoes today?

702
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,570
Just pick the ones you like.

703
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:04,370
A thief?

704
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,010
I'm not a thief.

705
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:13,130
How can she steal my produce every day?

706
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:15,010
I'll catch you!

707
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,370
I think we should call a taxi far from here.

708
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,690
It's not safe around here. They can see us.

709
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,330
To Bangkok Noi train station. Please hurry.

710
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,090
Don't you worry.

711
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,930
It's less than 15 minutes from here.

712
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,940
Let's go.

713
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,130
You packed up everything from my office.

714
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,250
There are a few things left, sir.

715
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,810
I'm not sure if you'd work on the train.

716
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:45,670
Okay, I'll go pack them up myself.

717
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,170
We don’t need to leave anything here.

718
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:53,270
We won't come back for many years.

719
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,610
Are you sure about moving to Chansaeng?

720
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,450
Why're you asking?

721
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,130
It's our hometown.

722
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,570
I don't trust Kalong.

723
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,770
There is nothing left for you to say.

724
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,300
I've thought this through.

725
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,850
Are you blind or something?

726
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:27,570
See? All my things are damaged.

727
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,270
Auntie, I drove like normal people.

728
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:34,450
But your bike cut right in front of me.

729
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,490
Cut in front of you what?

730
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,130
We were going straight.

731
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,450
- Can't you wait when you're about to turn?
- I was waiting.

732
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,970
But he rode too slow.

733
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,170
I couldn't measure the distance.
You got problems with that?

734
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,370
How could you ask me that? Look at my products.

735
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,490
How are you gonna pay me back?
These are my products to sell.

736
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,790
Hey! You two need to wrap it up,

737
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,890
- so others can go on about their lives.
- None of your business.

738
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,210
Where're you going? You son of a bitch!

739
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,320
Come back here.

740
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,290
What should we do? It's almost noon.

741
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,550
That is Prince Saenkaew.

742
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,570
Saenkaew?

743
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:20,890
Nope.

744
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,290
You need to wear glasses for real.

745
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:27,810
It's noon already.

746
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,110
Why aren't they here?

747
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,570
Or they can't get out of the house?

748
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,270
- Where're you going? Come back here.
- None of your business!

749
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,530
Catch him!

750
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,370
They're fighting for real!

751
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,010
It's noon. What should we do?

752
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,650
Looks like it's gonna be long.

753
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,670
Should we walk?

754
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,450
There's a shortcut this way.

755
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:04,610
You can walk through their orchards for a little while

756
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,810
and it'll lead you to the front of the station.

757
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,090
Here.

758
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,330
What the heck!

759
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,070
I think it should be this way.

760
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,170
I think I should look for Saenkaew.

761
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:48,010
You're gonna miss him. Maybe it's the traffic.

762
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,330
I'll be back before the train leaves.

763
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:53,130
If he's here before me, tell him to wait for me.

764
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,010
Here, hold this.

765
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,350
Dad,

766
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,650
If you read this letter,

767
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,530
it means that I'm not here anymore.

768
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,970
Don't try to find me.

769
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:50,210
I'm not good enough for you
to waste your time and upset about me.

770
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:53,370
I'm sorry that I was born to love another man

771
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,890
and humiliate you.

772
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:58,290
My disappearance

773
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:00,970
could make you happier

774
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,330
and you can look at people without any shame.

775
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:06,890
Respectfully, Saenkaew.

776
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,880
Saenkaew!

777
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,970
I think we're almost there.

778
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,330
The villagers said that
this shortcut will lead to the station soon.

779
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:36,610
Dad?

780
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,530
Luck is on your side again, Saenkaew.

781
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,610
- Pin-anong! Step back!
- No!

782
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,690
I know that you planned to kill him.

783
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,570
So you can seize his dad's assets.

784
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:51,810
Well, you knew about it then you need to leave.
Aren't you mad at him?

785
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:55,370
He fooled you, he had an affair with your cousin.

786
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:58,130
Step back and let me get him for you.

787
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,650
Don’t do it.

788
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:06,270
If you need money, I can give it to you.

789
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:09,770
You think I'm that stupid?

790
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:13,170
You and your dad are too tricky.

791
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,890
I won't risk it for you to fool me again.

792
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:20,330
But thanks for choosing this path.

793
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,850
It makes my job easier.

794
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:40,730
Sasin!

795
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:43,990
Saenkaew!

796
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,850
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

797
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,960
You love him so much?

798
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,890
You don't care about your cousin at all?

799
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,690
If you're gonna hurt him, over my dead body.

800
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:05,770
Sure I will. You two will be dead together.

801
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,960
Pin!

802
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,810
If you're gonna shoot them,

803
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:15,810
then you need to shoot me.

804
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:20,290
Are you stupid? He doesn't love you that much.

805
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,170
You're will to die for him?

806
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,530
How did I raise you to be this stupid?

807
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,770
Sasin! Saenkaew! You need to run!

808
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,010
You think I wouldn't dare to shoot you?

809
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:43,490
Just so you know, you're worthless for me.

810
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:47,970
If you die,

811
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:50,210
Saenkaew dies,

812
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,530
everything will belong to me.

813
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,070
You understand?

814
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,440
Just shoot me.

815
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,050
Pin!

816
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,210
Come on, shoot me!

817
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,100
Let it go!

818
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:12,530
Let it go! Now!

819
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:14,610
Shoot me!

820
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,390
Let it go!

821
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,730
Let go of your hand! Step back!

822
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:22,810
- Let it go!
- No!

823
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,010
- I won't!
- I told you to let it go.

824
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:25,770
I won't!

825
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,220
- Let go of your hand!
- No!

826
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,150
- Don't!
- No!

827
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,610
Stop right now!

828
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:41,970
Let's go. Come on!

829
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,130
Saenkaew!

830
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,850
You think you can run away from me?

831
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:21,850
You!

832
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,250
You're so cruel! You killed my husband!

833
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:40,950
You!

834
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,450
You stabbed me?

835
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,730
Honey!

836
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,210
Honey!

837
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:39,570
They're here.

838
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:41,810
Hurry up.

839
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,560
Come on!

840
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,290
The train is about to leave, let's go.

841
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,530
I almost forgot. Here.

842
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,070
I transferred your money
back to your bank account.

843
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,020
Thank you.

844
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,050
Good luck, my lovely brothers.

845
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,250
You must live a happy life, okay?

846
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:06,770
Think of me.

847
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,470
I won't forget about you.

848
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:12,450
Here.

849
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:24,010
Good luck, both of you.

850
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:28,970
The train is leaving. Come on!

851
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:31,910
Let's go.

852
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:34,290
- Bye!
- Bye!

853
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:35,860
Good luck!

854
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:37,450
Take care!

855
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:40,170
You too, take care!

856
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:42,450
- Bye!
- Saenkaew!

857
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:44,010
Sir?

858
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:45,570
Sir!

859
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,450
- Saenkaew! Come back!
- Sir!

860
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,610
Be happy and enjoy life!

861
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,860
Sir!

862
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:57,090
Bye! Good luck!

863
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,450
Saenkaew!

864
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,040
Don't go!

865
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,560
- Prince Saenkaew!
- Come back!

866
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:07,850
Saenkaew!

867
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,610
Saenkaew is gone.

868
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,770
He's gone.

869
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,170
Did you know that

870
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,330
Saenkaew will never come back here?

871
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,290
I know that

872
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:49,530
we might never

873
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,690
see him again.

874
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:54,690
You knew?

875
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:00,570
Why did you let him run away with Sasin?

876
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,370
Why?

877
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,130
He deserved to live his own life, not the one

878
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:12,110
we designed for him to follow.

879
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:14,450
But his choice

880
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,450
will lead to sorrow and pain.

881
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,490
You know that

882
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:25,210
detaining him

883
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,850
will only torture

884
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:31,370
and sorrow him even more.

885
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:34,810
But it's different.

886
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,850
If he is with us,

887
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:43,690
I can still take care of him, protect him,

888
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:46,210
no one will find out who he is.

889
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,360
Now…

890
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,810
he chose to be with Sasin.

891
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:56,770
You know it well that

892
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,330
a love among someone like him

893
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,910
will not be accepted anywhere.

894
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:06,790
The whole world will judge them.

895
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,970
If the whole world judges him,

896
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:21,770
we need to stand by his side firmly.

897
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:29,130
That is what family needs to do.

898
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:31,650
Accept.

899
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,770
Understand.

900
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:35,770
And stand by his side.

901
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:45,810
I hope that when Saenkaew comes back,

902
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:49,810
if we have a chance to meet again,

903
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,690
you won't look at him

904
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,620
as a son who causes disappointment to his dad,

905
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:02,770
but you should look at him, as a son

906
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:06,970
who is brave enough to choose his own path.

907
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:12,210
You need to accept who he is.

908
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,530
(One Year Later)

909
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,130
(Phatthalung, 1965)

910
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,790
Dear Pin,

911
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,570
I'm sorry for being gone for too long.

912
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,210
Our lives here started to follow the plan.

913
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,730
I heard about what happened to your dad.

914
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,770
I'm sorry for your loss.

915
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,490
I hope you stay strong like you've always been.

916
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:27,060
I'm translating books and documents for

917
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,610
people who'd like to contact Embassy of France.

918
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:33,730
And Sasin,

919
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:36,850
he is a music teacher now.

920
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:41,170
He opens a small class at home.
The kids love him.

921
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,610
You should see him around the kids.

922
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:48,290
It's just like big monkey hanging out with the little ones.

923
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,250
But we're happy.

924
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:53,890
- I'm gonna fight a monster.
- You're fighting back?

925
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:57,050
Follow me!

926
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,370
- Here!
- Follow me!

927
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,720
How're you gonna fight?

928
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,480
You're almost done?

929
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:04,650
Almost done.

930
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,810
Our lives are quite simple

931
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:10,250
but they're so meaningful.

932
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:14,010
I know that this is not a life everyone has dreamed of

933
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:18,410
but for us, this is truly freedom.

934
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,610
What is that?

935
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:22,770
You don't like?

936
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,090
Without your help,

937
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,410
we wouldn't have had a chance
to spend this kind of life.

938
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,930
Send my best wishes to everyone.

939
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:42,030
I attached my address at the end of this letter.

940
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,490
If you're free, please come and visit us.

941
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,070
Love and miss you always.

942
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:51,890
Saenkaew.

943
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:33,890
A letter from Prince Saenkaew?

944
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:36,950
Yes.

945
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:41,170
He said that he's happy

946
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,810
and he seems really happy.

947
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:46,890
At least,

948
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,970
he looks happier than he was with me.

949
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:52,370
Pin?

950
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,690
I'm fine, not sad.

951
01:29:57,650 --> 01:30:00,850
I'm glad to see them happy.

952
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,690
This is true love.

953
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,850
Sometimes to see someone we love

954
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,570
live his life like he wanted, to be happy,

955
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,890
it could be greater gift than owning him.

956
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,570
I used to believe that there is a happy ending,

957
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:32,410
a prince and a princess

958
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:35,220
stay together eternally.

959
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:39,130
Now I know

960
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,670
that to see them happy

961
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,610
is enough, for real.

962
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:48,530
We all have our own paths

963
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:52,130
when we can accept this face

964
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,710
happiness will start.

965
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,050
What're you doing out here?

966
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,530
It still rains.

967
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:27,890
Nothing.

968
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,130
Just thinking this and that.

969
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,570
Thinking of Pin,

970
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,960
thinking of Dad,

971
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,500
thinking of Grandma.

972
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,970
You're not thinking of me?

973
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,010
Come on! I'm so sick of seeing your face.

974
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:57,650
Hey! Don't get sick of me yet.

975
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:01,730
I've never thought that

976
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,250
we would have nights like these.

977
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:08,170
That we can look at the moon together,

978
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,730
and we don't have to hide,

979
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,090
or be scared of anyone.

980
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,250
But for me,

981
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:28,610
since I found out that I've fallen in love with you,

982
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,210
I always pictured us like this.

983
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,650
Looking at the moon together

984
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:37,930
and living together.

985
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:42,690
Well, you're a dreamer.

986
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,990
But…

987
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,900
thank you

988
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,010
for teaching me to believe in dreams.

989
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,970
Otherwise,

990
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:58,590
I wouldn't have enough courage to fight,

991
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,220
and to love you.

992
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,490
But

993
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:11,470
I still have one dream.

994
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:13,090
What is it?

995
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,810
I have a dream that

996
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:19,810
tonight we will…

997
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,280
What kind of dream is that?

998
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,270
Go ahead and do it yourself.

999
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:37,290
Well, I want to turn my dream into reality.

1000
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Hey!

1001
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,640
What?

1002
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:43,990
What is it?

1003
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,010
You wanted me to cook you grilled beef late at night?

1004
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:53,850
- Who'd do that?
- Please? I want to eat some.

1005
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:58,090
- I'm hungry. Please.
- Hey! Stop!

1006
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,170
Is anybody there?

1007
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:16,220
Can I get a glass of water?

1008
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:26,190
Kamsu?

1009
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,540
Kamsu?

1010
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,530
Pin, is that you?

1011
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:39,970
How did you get here?

1012
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:45,100
I heard that you're sick
so I came here to see you.

1013
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:50,770
Thank you.

1014
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,610
You came all the way to Chiang Mai.

1015
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:56,130
You're here by yourself?

1016
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,170
Not really.

1017
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:02,110
Someone would like to see you too.

1018
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:18,730
Saenkaew?

1019
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:24,490
Dad.

1020
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:32,770
Saenkaew?

1021
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:37,470
Dad.

1022
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,280
I'm sorry.

1023
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:05,290
He's here too?

1024
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:18,690
How many days are you going to stay?

1025
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:22,490
We booked a hotel for three nights, sir.

1026
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:28,290
Why did you stay at the hotel?

1027
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,920
We have a house here.

1028
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:38,650
Stay here.

1029
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,880
I'll ask Homthip to arrange something for you.

1030
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:54,690
Thank you, sir.

1031
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,530
Thank you, Dad.

1032
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,290
- Thank you.
- Saenkaew.

1033
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:32,570
- Come here and sit by my side.
- Okay.

1034
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,130
Pin, you should be in here too. Come on.

1035
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:50,210
Sir? Can you put your arm around your son's shoulder?

1036
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,960
Sure.

1037
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:54,970
Smile.

1038
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:57,780
Smile, okay?

1039
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,070
1..2..3

1040
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,970
I think you should sit in the middle,

1041
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,120
Pin too.

1042
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:11,890
So good.

1043
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:16,570
I don't think they should be in the middle.

1044
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,970
The same position was good already.

1045
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:21,930
So true.

1046
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:25,550
You think so?

1047
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,930
- Sure.
- Look at the camera.

1048
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,850
Where should he in in this? Standing or sitting down.

1049
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,850
You want me in the family portrait?

1050
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:42,570
If you don't want to, just stand there.

1051
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,930
Suit yourself.

1052
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,370
Sure, I want to be in there.

1053
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:49,970
Come on, get in there.

1054
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:57,730
Ready?

1055
01:38:58,380 --> 01:38:59,380
Wait.

1056
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:13,290
The kids should be in the back, let's go.

1057
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:20,370
Good. Now smile!

1058
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:23,530
Smile so big!

1059
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:25,970
1..2..3

1060
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:30,650
Homthip and Kamsu, you need to be in this too.

1061
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:31,710
Come here.

1062
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:35,730
You two are family. Come on.

1063
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Sure.

1064
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:44,090
Smile everybody. Smile so bright!

1065
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,810
1..2..3

1066
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:00,450
Perfect. One more time!

1067
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:03,290
1..2..3

1068
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:15,450
The End.
