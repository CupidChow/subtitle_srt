00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,540
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 10)

2
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,260
It's only afternoon and
you need a drink already?

3
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,220
You're worried about me?

4
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
How kind of you.

5
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,540
But you're not as kind
to me as you are to Sasin.

6
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,500
You worked with them to fool me,

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,040
tried to destroy our wedding.

8
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,300
I wanted to save Prince Saenkaew, Sasin

9
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,780
and you.

10
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
Saved me?

11
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,100
I became a clown and nobody ever thought
of telling me anything.

12
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,880
It's so painful to see your
cousin and your fiancé that way,

13
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,440
do you want to know how I feel?

14
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,520
Please let go of Prince Saenkaew.

15
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,700
If you're keeping him like
this, you will end up in pain.

16
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,700
If I let him go,

17
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,300
I will feel less pain than this?

18
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,300
I don't think so.

19
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,740
Don't let your anger
and sorrow lead your life,

20
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,500
in the end, a person
who will feel the most pain

21
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,060
could be you.

22
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,780
It's so painful that I can't
feel anything anymore.

23
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,100
Two people that I love the most

24
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
betrayed me at the same time.

25
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,060
It can't get worse than this.

26
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
Sure it can.

27
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,140
It will be much worse than this

28
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,260
if you continue to choose this path.

29
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,300
You know that it won't end well.

30
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,900
One day, you could wake up and realize that

31
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,340
a man who you love with all your heart

32
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,520
looks at you with full of hatred.

33
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,220
One day, you could hear
Prince Saenkaew call your name

34
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,860
but it isn't in a gentle
tone like he used to.

35
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,820
Instead, his voice will be
full of anger and torment.

36
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,140
That is the day that
you will finally realize

37
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,340
the taste of real pain.

38
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm the bad guy in this equation.

39
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,140
I'm fine if one more person hates me.

40
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,140
What? You need more
time to develop the films?

41
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,740
I thought it would be ready today.

42
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,580
You just gave me the film last night.

43
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,940
We need a few days to get it done.

44
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,030
Honey.

45
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,220
I think we won't get anything tonight.

46
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,050
They are all leaving.

47
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,240
Hiding like this won't lead us anywhere.

48
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,300
Too many mosquitoes, we should go.

49
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,860
Saenkaew.

50
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Honey.

51
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Take a picture!

52
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,140
We got the good ones
but they won't develop in time!

53
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,110
Your nephew is getting married tomorrow.

54
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,240
Should we try another shop?

55
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,500
You still have to wait at another shop.

56
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,100
I can guarantee you that

57
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,330
our shop provides the
fastest service in Thailand.

58
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,440
Can you finish it tomorrow?

59
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
I don't think so.

60
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,860
It's graduation season,
so many films to develop.

61
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,970
What should we do?

62
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,940
- What're you doing?
- Trust me.

63
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,740
- Let go.
- What're you doing?

64
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,080
Honey?

65
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,640
If I give you all of this,
can you finish it tomorrow?

66
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,340
Honey, you can't do that!

67
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,300
This is all we have!

68
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,620
Oh, darling. If we can't get
the pictures to stop the wedding,

69
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,900
you think Kalong would let
you live to spend more money?

70
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,140
Prioritize us.

71
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,100
Get it done tomorrow.

72
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,660
Sure, you'll be the
first. I'll try my best.

73
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Good job.

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,780
So you two know all about this?

75
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,580
Thank you for not leaving your friend.

76
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,860
We won't do that. He did nothing wrong.

77
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,620
He's just in love.

78
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,020
I saw Pin today.

79
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,180
She seemed so furious, she
wouldn't listen to a word I said.

80
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,620
I'm her cousin, I should be
the one she could rely on to.

81
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,860
Instead, I stole her lover.

82
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,940
Of course, she's furious.

83
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,580
No matter what, she shouldn't
marry Prince Saenkaew.

84
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,660
In the end, a person
who will feel the most pain

85
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,540
is her.

86
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,180
But the wedding is tomorrow.

87
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,840
What're we gonna do?

88
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,860
Should we go to the wedding
and take Prince Saenkaew away?

89
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,100
His father's gonna shoot you in the head.

90
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,140
Don't forget that he
almost killed Sasin last time.

91
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,620
Also, I think his father will be
more cautious during the wedding.

92
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,060
But there are so many people there

93
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,280
it should be the best chance

94
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,580
if we get there and take him away.

95
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,040
We only have this chance for one day.

96
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,100
According to Chansaeng's tradition,

97
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,940
there is thread tying blessing
ceremony for the newlyweds.

98
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,980
But his dad cut out this part.

99
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,900
Still, I wanted to give
you two this tradition.

100
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Please come closer.

101
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,620
This cotton thread that is tying today

102
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,440
will not only be tied on your wrists

103
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,540
but it is also tying your hearts

104
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,580
to stay together.

105
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
Staying together

106
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,860
could be smooth and rough.

107
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,500
You two need to help each other

108
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,580
facing problems, don't turn
your backs against one another.

109
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,860
I wish you a lifetime

110
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,040
of happiness and love.

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What?

112
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,440
What's wrong?

113
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,140
Your words truly touched me.

114
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,460
It's getting late and they

115
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,340
need to wake up early tomorrow.

116
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,260
Should we let them go to bed?

117
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Goodnight.

118
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,060
You can't cry like this tomorrow.

119
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,240
People will get suspicious.

120
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
Pin?

121
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
- But I want you to reconsider…
- Do I have other choices?

123
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,700
If I call off the wedding,

124
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,900
people will say that I got
stood up on my wedding day.

125
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,820
Khunying Wad has been
scolding and insulting me

126
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,180
since I can remember.

127
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,740
What do you think my life would be

128
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,180
if I got dumped right before the wedding?

129
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Pin?

130
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,520
I used to think that if I had a
chance to run away from this place

131
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,580
and lived my own life,

132
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,460
I would be so happy.

133
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,740
But you all destroyed my dream

134
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,100
and no one ever cared about my feelings.

135
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,840
You think my happiness

136
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,940
means nothing to you?

137
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,500
You know that

138
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,340
if we get married, you
won't be happy either.

139
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,020
Let my happiness be
decided in the future.

140
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,180
You're gonna marry me
tomorrow no matter what.

141
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Sasin.

142
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,240
Don't you worry, everything
will go as we planned tomorrow.

143
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,140
I really hope so.

144
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I need to get Saenkaew out of there.

145
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,920
Thank you for not leaving
me behind and sorry

146
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,860
for risking your lives like this.

147
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,040
We want to help.

148
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,060
If you want to pay us back, it's fine.

149
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,500
When Ms. Rachawadee hosts your wedding,

150
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,260
don't forget to invite
us as your groomsmen.

151
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,260
Sure, you're all I have.

152
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,540
Why don't you give her a ring?

153
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,720
You need to be cautious,

154
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,860
if you find anyone suspicious,

155
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,040
- don't let them inside.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,380
I wish your love gets stronger

157
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,100
and lasts forever.

158
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,150
Stay in love and happiness forever.

159
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,340
Please take care of Saenkaew for me.

160
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,220
Marriage is more than love

161
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,140
but it is a promise to your bride's family

162
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,820
that you will take care of their daughter

163
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,060
like her parents used to take care of.

164
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,120
You've done a good job as a son, now

165
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,820
you need to be a good husband to Pin-anong.

166
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,150
How was it?

167
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,510
Everything is under control, sir.

168
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,620
There will be many people
at the reception this evening.

169
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,420
Tell our people to be more cautious

170
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,820
don't let anything messy happen.

171
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,980
Yes, sir.

172
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
It can't be any mistake tonight.

173
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,500
I will take Saenkaew and Pin-anong to
get marriage certificate tomorrow

174
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,580
and get on the train to Chiang Mai.

175
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,860
We will not come back here again.

176
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,900
It's me.

177
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Come in.

178
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
What is it?

179
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,300
Certificate of No Impediment?

180
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,220
I went out to get flowers this morning

181
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,410
and Sasin waited to see me.

182
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,860
- How much?
- Two baht per kg.

183
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,180
- Give me one.
- Aunt Thip?

184
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,830
Sasin?

185
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,920
Why're you here?

186
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,940
I'm waiting for you, I know
that you're here every morning.

187
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,740
Can you help me with something?

188
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,060
He asked me to get this for you.

189
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,700
He will have you get a marriage certificate
with Ms. Rachawadee.

190
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,340
Thank you so much.

191
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,780
You risked it for me.

192
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,940
If everything follows the plan,

193
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,660
I will transfer the assets

194
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,220
and come back to help everyone.

195
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,780
If it doesn't go to plan,

196
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,810
if it all gets destroyed,

197
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,380
- you need to run away far from here.
- Nope.

198
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,460
I won't leave anyone behind.

199
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,700
I'll come back to save you all.

200
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
About the assets from our timber business,

201
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,260
when it's time, they will come back to us.

202
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,460
But this opportunity

203
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,950
for you to be with someone you love

204
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,240
is rare to find.

205
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
If you lose it,

206
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,980
you won't get a second chance.

207
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,110
But…

208
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I will take care of your grandma.

209
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,140
You've sacrificed

210
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,990
and you've tortured yourself
for everyone for too long.

211
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,060
You need to

212
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,780
find your own happiness,

213
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
okay?

214
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,820
Can I see your invitation please?

215
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,530
Welcome.

216
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,900
Don’t let anyone without an invitation in.

217
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,410
Okay.

218
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,040
Can I see your invitation please?

219
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,140
So beautiful, my girl.

220
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,710
Let me see.

221
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Listen to me.

222
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,420
Thank you for being a
good daughter for our family.

223
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,390
If your married life isn't that happy,

224
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,700
tell me and I'll handle it.

225
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
Saenkaew.

226
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
Yeah?

227
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
What is it?

228
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,380
You should dress well

229
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,540
for your important day.

230
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,050
Okay.

231
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,400
It's almost time.

232
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,900
I should go and welcome our guests.

233
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,090
Saenkaew.

234
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,160
Thank you for your sacrifice.

235
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,760
Can I see your invitation please?

236
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Welcome.

237
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,860
Can I see your invitation please?

238
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,990
Can I get a picture?

239
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,490
Smile please.

240
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,750
One more.

241
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Thanks.

242
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,900
Congratulations.

243
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,460
Thank you so much for coming.

244
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,810
Let me take you to your seat.

245
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,140
Good evening, Songsawat.

246
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,900
The Field Marshal is busy

247
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,140
so he sent me here. He
also said that he was sorry.

248
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,460
Thank you so much for coming.

249
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,440
Of course, we're friends.

250
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,440
I don't know if I should
say congratulations to you.

251
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I know that this is not what you wanted.

252
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,180
It must be my fate.

253
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,140
Why don't I believe that someone like you

254
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,340
would relent to your fate?

255
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,940
Anyways, I'd like to wish you

256
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,220
a successful path in everything.

257
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,020
- Good evening, Songsawat.
- Good evening.

258
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
Let's take a picture.

259
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,820
Don't yawn or I'll follow you.

260
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,060
- I'm so tired.
- You can lean on my shoulders here.

261
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
- I got them.
- You got them!

262
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,550
Here.

263
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,180
Finally!

264
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,430
Honey!

265
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,850
Let's go.

266
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,020
It's time to get to the wedding, honey.

267
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,900
Hurry up, baby.

268
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,000
- Honey.
- Yeah?

269
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,540
You don't think of helping me row?

270
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,300
It's against the current.

271
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,980
I don't know how, baby.

272
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,580
Stop whining and keep rowing.

273
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,580
- Are we almost there?
- Not yet, let's go.

274
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,220
- I'm helping you.
- You're not helping.

275
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Follow me.

276
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Sasin?

277
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,540
Let's get in from the back,
Kamsu wont focus on this.

278
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,440
We can sneak into the wedding. Let's go.

279
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,500
- Follow me.
- You need to patrol this area.

280
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,110
Kamsu!

281
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,860
Oh my! Cover up, come on.

282
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,790
This way.

283
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,460
- Aunt Homthip.
- Yeah?

284
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,460
What're you doing here?

285
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,010
What?

286
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,740
I'm here to check on something.

287
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,100
The guests are starting to arrive.

288
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,780
What're you talking about?
The guests won't arrive here.

289
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,660
What's that noise?

290
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,860
- Who's there?
- Hey!

291
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,240
It's nothing.

292
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
You're imagining things.

293
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,460
Let's get back to the reception.

294
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,140
You act so weird tonight.

295
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Don't!

296
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Move!

297
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,150
I told you that it was nothing.

298
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,820
You need to bring your
people somewhere else.

299
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,890
You need to catch her.

300
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,640
Kamsu!

301
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,420
- Let me go!
- Stay still.

302
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Hey!

303
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,220
- What?
- Just stay still.

304
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Let me go!

305
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Let me go!

306
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,780
- Hurry up, my baby.
- Honey!

307
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,020
- I'll wait up there, follow me.
- Sure.

308
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,830
Prince Inthorn.

309
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,860
What're you doing here?

310
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,180
Baby, you need to go!

311
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
- Stop right now!
- Let me go.

312
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,780
Let me go! What do you want from me?

313
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,140
Catch him! Hurry up!

314
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,840
You can come out now.

315
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
They're gone.

316
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,890
Prince Inthorn? The one who
attacked the party last time.

317
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,980
It seems to be getting out of hand. We need
to hurry up to get Saenkaew out of here.

318
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

319
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,020
- Sir?
- What's going on?

320
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,300
Prince Inthorn tried to sneak into
the reception and he dropped this.

321
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Is everything okay?

322
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,830
Yeah, it's fine.

323
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Excuse me.

324
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,620
Let's go, take me there.

325
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,790
Tell our people to search for Inthorn.

326
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,020
Don't let him show this disgusting picture.

327
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Yes, sir.

328
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,790
Where're you going?

329
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,420
I told you not to come here.

330
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,420
Please stop doing that.

331
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,260
You need to let them go.

332
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,900
You knew about this?

333
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
Just great.

334
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,060
He's the bad guy

335
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,140
and everyone is helping him.

336
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,040
Nobody cares for me.

337
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
Sasin?

338
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Saenkaew.

339
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Saenkaew.

340
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Let's get out of here.

341
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,100
Stop, right there.

342
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,840
Can I get this?

343
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
I don't think so.

344
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,500
I made this one for Saenkaew.

345
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,260
Help! Somebody, help!

346
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,260
- This way!
- What's going on? What's with the noise?

347
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,780
The bride and groom are here.

348
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,980
I've been looking for you.

349
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,060
Sasin?

350
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,140
Sasin is Pin-anong's cousin.

351
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,840
Three of them are so close.

352
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Good evening.

353
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,420
Nice to meet you.

354
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,240
What're you doing back here?

355
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,540
Why don’t you attend
the reception from the front?

356
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,360
That's right.

357
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,220
Sasin and his friends are
here to congratulate us.

358
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,660
But they're about to leave.

359
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Right?

360
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,140
I think I should stay a little longer.

361
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,340
- I can, can't I? Grandma?
- Sure.

362
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,440
Let's get inside. Did you have your dinner?

363
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,460
- Not yet.
- Let's go and eat then.

364
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,240
Let's go get you something to eat.

365
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,710
You two need to get inside.
It's not good to be gone for too long.

366
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,380
Come on, boys. Let's eat.

367
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Wait.

368
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Sir?

369
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,940
Someone saw Prince Inthorn
running into the building.

370
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
Everyone,

371
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,040
search everywhere. Don't let
him get inside the reception.

372
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Yes, sir.

373
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,700
Kamsu is following me closely like a tick.

374
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,060
How can I get inside the reception?

375
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,460
Thank you.

376
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,020
I'm so grateful.

377
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,180
You're not fully recovered,
still you're here at my wedding.

378
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,220
You want to see me in
my happiest day, don't you?

379
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,580
How can he miss a wedding of

380
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,700
his best friend and his baby cousin, right?

381
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Everyone,

382
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,540
I'm the bride's cousin.

383
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,380
And I'd like to gift the bride
and groom with this song.

384
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,260
He is singing this song to mock me

385
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,420
for getting in your way, isn't he?

386
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Thank you.

387
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,780
Why don't we serenade
you with one more song?

388
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Enough.

389
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,100
It's time for the bride and
groom to say something.

390
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,900
It's your time to be up
on the stage, let's go.

391
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,300
Everyone, please listen to me.

392
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
That's Prince Inthorn.

393
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,500
This wedding is a fake one.

394
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,900
They're trying to fool you.

395
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,050
Inthorn!

396
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,340
Stop doing crazy thing.

397
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
Your son is doing something crazy.

398
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,540
He's crazy and he's not like us.

399
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,340
Everyone, Prince Saenkaew

400
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,060
isn't the best groom like you think he is.

401
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,380
He has a secret he's trying to hide.

402
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,340
And I have proof in my hand.

403
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,860
Dad? What's going on?

404
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,140
He has photos of you and Sasin.

405
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,860
- Stop!
- Don't get any closer.

406
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,700
Get him out of here.

407
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,660
Why is there a black out?

408
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,980
- What's going on?
- Get a flashlight.

409
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,900
- Get him! Now!
- Yes, sir.

410
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,620
You need to look at the photos.

411
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,940
Let me go! You need to see the photos.

412
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,210
You scumbag! Let me go!

413
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,100
Fire! Let's get out of here!

414
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,340
- Fire!
- Fire?

415
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,140
- Fire?
- Fire!

416
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,210
- Ma'am!
- Fire?

417
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,820
Watch out!

418
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,580
You need to get your
boyfriend out of here, Sasin.

419
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,220
Saenkaew!

420
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,470
This way!

421
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,020
What is in the photos?

422
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,580
Some nonsense photos,
you don't have to worry.

423
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,460
I'm not going! Let me go!

424
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,020
I'm not going! You scumbag! I'm a nobleman!

425
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,220
Let me go!

426
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,960
Kamsu! Let me go!

427
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,860
Prince Bodin, I have a proof.

428
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,180
You need to look at the photos.

429
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,480
It’s a photo of Saenkaew and Sasin…

430
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,440
Keep him in a room.

431
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Sir?

432
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,300
Prince…

433
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,380
Sir? Sir?

434
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,010
Are you okay?

435
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Saenkaew?

436
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,340
What're you doing here? Where is the fire?

437
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,750
There is no fire.

438
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,900
I need to run away from the wedding.

439
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,340
Saenkaew! Saenkaew!

440
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,100
My car is parked by the fence, the red one

441
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,940
with license plate
number Kor Tor 2275. Run!

442
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,380
I'll handle it from here.

443
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,740
- Thank you.
- No need to. We're friends.

444
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,180
Help! Help me!

445
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,100
Help! Help me!

446
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,900
Help! Help me!

447
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,720
Help!

448
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,860
- Ms. Songsawat?
- Someone is trying to hurt me.

449
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,100
Who?

450
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,360
Saenkaew?

451
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,780
Take care of her.

452
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,750
This is a certificate from the embassy.

453
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,660
I'll get a marriage certificate
with Ms. Rachawadee.

454
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,300
My dad will agree to our plan.

455
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,540
After that, we will be together.

456
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,380
I promise you that I won't let go of you.

457
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,850
Hey!

458
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,320
Hey!

459
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,700
Sasin!

460
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,540
Hey!

461
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,580
How're you feeling?

462
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,370
Hey!

463
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
How're you?

464
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,740
I'm fine.

465
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,460
Saenkaew!

466
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,810
Don't!

467
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,460
No!

468
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,280
- No!
- You think you can run away from me?

469
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,330
You're trying to run! Why's that?

470
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,540
Please let us go. I beg you.

471
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,080
Go where?

472
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,500
I'll follow you until you're dead.
