"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 11)

2
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,780
You need to leave, I need to talk to Prince Inthorn.

3
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,300
But Prince Kamfah ordered me not to let anyone in.

4
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,180
He told me to come here.

5
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,660
This is my palace, Sirichalalai Palace.

6
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,380
Did you forget about that?

7
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
Leave.

8
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,660
The photos that you scattered during the reception.

9
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
What are they?

10
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,400
Too bad we lost power.

11
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,640
These photos

12
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,340
- are photos of Sasin and Saenkaew were..
- Hey!

13
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,540
- What are in the photos?
- Stop!

14
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,540
I want to talk to him!

15
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,700
But I don't think you two need to talk.

16
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,660
You need to leave.

17
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,540
If Prince Kamfah finds out about this,
he won't be pleasant.

18
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,380
This way.

19
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,100
It's all ruined.

20
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,720
Our well-respected elderly guests
needed to face something like this?

21
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,820
The journalists will talk about this tomorrow.

22
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,460
We all will be humiliated.

23
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,660
You're such a rotten seed, like your mother.

24
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,140
It was supposed to be a prosperous event,

25
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,450
instead unlucky things happened!

26
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,580
What did I do that was so wrong?

27
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,100
You always blamed it on me.

28
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,830
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything?

29
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,460
This is your wedding.

30
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,540
Messy things happened on your wedding day.

31
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm so mortified I didn't know where to hide my face.

32
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,700
If I didn't agree to marry to save Dad,

33
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,600
you wouldn't even have this palace to hide your face.

34
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
Pin?

35
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,020
- How dare you talk back to me like this?
- I'm gonna keep talking back to you!

36
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,580
I never argued.

37
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,140
I was a good girl, I followed the rules,

38
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
but nobody loved me,

39
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,620
nobody cared about my feeling.

40
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,180
What should I do

41
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,620
to make everyone happy about me?

42
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,100
This is it, from now on.

43
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,400
I will live my life the way I've always wanted.

44
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,660
I don't care

45
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,220
- if I have to please anyone.
- You're crossing the line!

46
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,700
What is going on?

47
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
Oh, you poor thing.

48
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,460
You're worried about him, aren't you?

49
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,700
There, there, don't cry. He'll come back.

50
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Sasin!

51
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Don't hurt him!

52
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,420
You're still worrying about him?

53
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,060
You worry about him more than our people?

54
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,320
That's why you ran away with him.

55
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Dad!

56
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,400
I figured out how to save our people
without having to marry Pin.

57
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,350
Please trust me on this.

58
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Please, I beg you.

59
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,020
Let us go.

60
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Let you go?

61
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,140
So that you can do horrendous and insane thing

62
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,660
and ruining our family's reputation like you used to?

63
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,820
As a father,

64
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,940
I can't let you do that.

65
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,980
You still call yourself a father?

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
What kind of a father is that?

67
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,540
You threatened your son.

68
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,700
You've never cared about his happiness.

69
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,010
A father?

70
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,500
You see your son's happiness as something shameful.

71
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,900
Shut the hell up!

72
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
Saenkaew!

73
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,740
You don't have to ask for this person's mercy.

74
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Our love

75
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,220
doesn't need any approval from anyone

76
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,340
especially from a selfish guy like him.

77
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
He knows nothing about love!

78
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Sasin!

79
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Sasin!

80
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,270
Sasin!

81
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,970
Sasin!

82
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,740
Step back!

83
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,850
No!

84
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,460
If you're gonna hurt him,
then you need to hurt me too.

85
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,360
- You love him that much?
- That's right.

86
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Saenkaew!

87
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,580
No! Don't hurt him!

88
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,660
It's okay.

89
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,860
I'm right here.

90
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,300
I won't let anyone hurt you.

91
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Drag him here!

92
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,250
Dad!

93
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,600
Please! No!

94
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Don't do it!

95
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Go on!

96
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Shoot me!

97
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,060
I'm not afraid of you.

98
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,540
No matter what you do,

99
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,580
you can't change the fact that

100
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,860
we are in love.

101
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,900
Even if I die and become a ghost,

102
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,300
I still love him.

103
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,550
Good.

104
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,940
Go to hell so this will end!

105
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Dad!

106
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,970
- Saenkaew!
- If he dies,

107
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,260
then I will die too.

108
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,760
You're willing to die for him?

109
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,540
Don't!

110
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,170
Saenkaew! Don't!

111
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
No!

112
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Stop right now!

113
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,140
Spare his life,

114
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,340
and I'll go back to marry Pin.

115
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
No!

116
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
No!

117
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,140
Let him kill me.

118
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,820
Kill me.

119
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,620
Let him kill me.

120
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,180
But you can't go back.

121
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,110
Otherwise,

122
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,580
you will live a miserable life for the rest of your life.

123
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I know.

124
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,540
But I can't let you die.

125
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Dad!

126
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,750
If you let him go,

127
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,460
from now on.

128
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,620
I will follow your orders, everything.

129
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,890
Fine.

130
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,820
If you agree to go back with me,

131
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,140
I'll spare his life.

132
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,740
No!

133
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Don't do it!

134
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Sasin!

135
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Sasin!

136
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,610
Hey!

137
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm sorry that I can't keep our promises.

139
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,660
But I want you to know

140
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,400
that I love you,

141
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
I love you the most.

142
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,680
Bring him back to the palace.

143
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,580
No!

144
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,880
No! No!

145
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,540
Don't do it!

146
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,340
No! No!

147
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Let me go.

148
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Let me go!

149
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,250
- Enough already!
- Sasin!

150
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,740
Saenkaew!

151
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,790
What happened to you?

152
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,620
Whose blood is this? Who hurt you?

153
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,460
- Who?
- Inthorn's people kidnapped him.

154
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,860
You poor thing!

155
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,260
Oh my goodness.

156
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,060
Why is he so mean and cruel like this?

157
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,380
I'm glad that you wouldn't get worse than this.

158
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Are you okay?

159
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,660
Saenkaew is back

160
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,260
so I guess bad things will end here.

161
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,460
My daughter and Saenkaew

162
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
got married officially yesterday.

163
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,260
You should get the marriage certificate today.

164
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,620
To make it official.

165
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you for coming back.

166
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Nope.

167
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,060
I should thank your dad instead

168
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,820
for bringing you back.

169
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,020
You should be happy to know that

170
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,500
Sasin will never come near you again.

171
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,380
Where is he?

172
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,500
Why did he let you go?

173
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,700
He is fine.

174
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,420
He is still alive.

175
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,400
Because I agreed to come back to you.

176
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,830
That's why?

177
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,700
If you hadn't loved and cared for him that much,

178
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,620
you two could have been gone far far away from here.

179
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,620
You wouldn't even cared how my life would be.

180
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,820
Now I am back.

181
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,260
What more do you want from me?

182
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,380
I lost.

183
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,230
I gave up.

184
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,100
My life is yours,

185
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,020
from now on.

186
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,380
You can wake me up normally.

187
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,860
You son of a bitch!

188
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,540
You have no dignity and pride.

189
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,660
You destroyed the wedding of the family for Kalong?

190
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,300
You didn't bring anything to the table,
yet you destroyed it all.

191
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,860
Why should I bring anything to the table?

192
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,570
When the family

193
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,620
never brings anything to me.

194
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,800
Our dad gave it all to you.

195
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,100
If he gave it to you, it would be gone by now.

196
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,340
You are

197
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,820
just like rust, attached to the family.

198
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
You're only deteriorating and ruining the family.

199
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,100
How dare you!

200
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,400
If I'm a rust, destroying the family,

201
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,020
what would a homosexual like Saenkaew be compared to?

202
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,180
How did you raise your son

203
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,060
to be a homosexual like this?

204
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,780
I hit you at the right spot, didn't I?

205
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,820
You got more photos?

206
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,360
None. They're all gone.

207
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,660
I scattered them all at the reception.

208
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
And I dropped the negatives

209
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,180
when I rowed a boat,
trying to get into the reception from the back.

210
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,180
Please, I have none. If you don't believe me,

211
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,940
you can search me.

212
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,420
Nothing.

213
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,130
Please, don't shoot me.

214
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,940
- I'm your younger brother.
- A brother?

215
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,620
You're my brother

216
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,340
and you acted as if a stray dog.

217
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,580
You have no pride at all.

218
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,660
It's my fault.

219
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,060
I won't do it again.

220
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,540
Please, I beg you.

221
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,780
Please, I beg you.

222
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Get away from here.

223
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,060
And don't disturb Prince Kamfah again.

224
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,620
I don't think he will be

225
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,740
this kind next time.

226
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
Kamsu!

227
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,580
I'm not afraid of you.

228
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Where're you going?

229
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,260
Come back here.

230
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Honey!

231
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,660
How are you?

232
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,580
Why're you looking like this?

233
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,620
Honey!

234
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,100
Duangkamol, my baby.

235
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Where're the negatives?

236
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,340
You still have it?

237
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
It's right here.

238
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,010
Honey!

239
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Get up!

240
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,100
It's here.

241
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,020
Why're you so obsessed with it?

242
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,740
It's not the time to appraise it!

243
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,400
Should we go?
They could come back at any minute.

244
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,540
- Should we?
- Let's go.

245
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Baby, please help me.

246
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,410
Up! Honey.

247
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,620
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

248
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,420
Our guys still can't find Inthorn.

249
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,020
The last time he was seen

250
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,540
was when he tried to ruin Saenkaew's wedding.

251
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,100
Then he just disappeared.

252
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
Where is he?

253
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,220
Send someone to search for him.

254
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,260
Sir?

255
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
What's the point, sir?

256
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,100
Saenkaew already got married with a Thai lady.

257
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
They transferred all their assets already.

258
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,860
I don't think there is anything we can do.

259
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,780
So finding Inthorn is quite useless.

260
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,140
You have an important proof to humiliate Kamfah?

261
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,500
Send it to me, I wanna see it.

262
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Hurry up.

263
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,700
Just do what I said.

264
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
Yes, sir.

265
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
This way.

266
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,980
Easy there.

267
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,020
I think you get heavier, honey.

268
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,400
You should rest here.

269
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Sure.

270
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,340
Wait for me here.

271
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,940
I'll call a cap and I'll take you to see a doctor.

272
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Be careful.

273
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Prince Inthorn.

274
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Prince Bodin.

275
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
Give me the negatives.

276
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,100
You want this?

277
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,740
I'm not giving it to you, you broke prince.

278
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,260
I can't let you hurt my daughter.

279
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Just give me the negatives.

280
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,740
You want this?

281
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,340
Then come and get it.

282
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,660
Duangkamol, my baby.

283
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,580
Let it go!

284
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Saenkaew!

285
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,030
Saenkaew!

286
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,700
I think you should take some painkillers,

287
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
you're gonna be bruised.

288
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Where is Saenkaew?

289
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,430
Where is he?

290
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,100
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

291
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,340
I heard someone was at the gate last night.

292
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,780
I went outside to check and I saw you lying there.

293
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,300
So I took you in.

294
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,080
Hey! Where're you going?

295
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,300
- Move!
- You can't go anywhere!

296
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,900
- Hey!
- Let me go.

297
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,440
- Where're you going?
- Let me go! I'm gonna find Saenkaew.

298
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,860
- You'll be killed if you leave now.
- Hey!

299
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,380
You need to admit the fact that

300
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,380
you can't win this.

301
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
This way, doctor.

302
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,180
My friend has a high fever.

303
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,660
He's mumbling all the time
and he doesn't respond to me.

304
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,000
Chiang Mai.

305
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,000
Grilled chicken!

306
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,660
You want some grilled chicken?

307
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,820
Grilled chicken!

308
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,980
We have grilled meatballs too.

309
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Grilled chicken!

310
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,700
I need to see where

311
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,020
the driver park the car.

312
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,400
Hello.

313
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,180
This is Pin-anong. She's Saenkaew's wife.

314
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,940
She will be your new boss lady.

315
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,800
Nice to meet you all.

316
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,020
It will be so nice to work with you all.

317
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,000
Thank you so much for opening a business here.

318
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,260
Chansaeng is in chaos right now.

319
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,180
There're so many officers from Nanta.

320
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,540
It'd be hard for us if we stayed there.

321
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
That's right.

322
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,270
I've built this

323
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,300
timber business for you, Saenkaew.

324
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,420
From now on,

325
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,500
Saenkaew and Pin-anong

326
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,980
will take care of our business.

327
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,700
We're not leaving you behind.

328
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,060
We'll start over together.

329
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

330
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,260
- Thank you, Prince Saenkaew.
- Thank you.

331
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,180
- Thank you, Prince Saenkaew.
- Thank you.

332
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,940
I'll be by your side.

333
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,300
I'll help you taking care of
our workers and the business.

334
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,460
About your assets that transferred to me,

335
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,740
I'll transfer them back

336
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,700
within three months.

337
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,800
Totally up to you.

338
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,170
Well,

339
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,700
we should explore the city tomorrow.

340
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,180
It'll give us a chance to greet the elders here.

341
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
Up to you.

342
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,580
Anything you'd like me to do?

343
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,940
You're gonna spoil me then?

344
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
That's right.

345
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,260
I promised my dad

346
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,020
that I will do anything you want.

347
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,020
Then fulfill your husband duty.

348
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,400
We haven't slept together, haven't we?

349
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,060
We need to be the real husband and wife.

350
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,580
Why're you like this?

351
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,980
Why do you make me feel like I'm so disgusting?

352
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,580
I've never seen you that way.

353
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
But you acted like one.

354
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
I'm sorry.

355
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,620
That's enough.

356
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,020
Just tell me.

357
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,580
What do you want me to be, to think or to do?

358
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,580
So that I can please you.

359
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,060
You can just tell me.

360
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,740
- I will try to do it.
- Why do you have to try?

361
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Why?

362
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,740
Can't you just love me?

363
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,580
I'm so in love with you.

364
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,820
Can't you just love me?

365
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm sorry.

366
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,020
Stop apologizing to me.

367
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,180
I don't want to hear you apologizing anymore.

368
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,540
I just want you to love me.

369
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,900
What're you doing here?

370
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,700
I'm looking for Saenkaew and I need to talk to Pin.

371
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,100
Nobody is here, they are all in Chiang Mai.

372
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,300
Only Prince Bodin and Khunying Wad stay here.

373
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,300
- They're on their honeymoon.
- Nope.

374
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,340
They moved there, they will never come back.

375
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,020
I heard that Prince Kamfah opens a business up there.

376
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,700
You didn't know about this.

377
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,940
The negative film is all destroyed, and it gets wet.

378
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,950
I can't develop these for you.

379
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,020
I need to send them to a lab in Hong Kong

380
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
to work on them.

381
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,700
Send them to Hong Kong?

382
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,380
That's right, sir.

383
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,580
The fee will be so costly.

384
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,020
It could be up to tens of thousands.

385
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,620
I don't care how much it costs.

386
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,460
Just need to see the photos.

387
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Honey?

388
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,740
Mr. Kuea took all of the dowry.

389
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,540
We barely have anything left.

390
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,860
This is the last amount of cash that we have.

391
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,460
If we spend it like this,

392
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,000
we won't have any left for another day.

393
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,980
These photos will earn us money to spend until we die.

394
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,820
What do you mean?

395
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,820
I will show the photos

396
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,420
of Prince Saenkaew kissing Sasin

397
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,780
to Pin.

398
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,660
When she sees these,

399
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,260
she will ask for a divorce.

400
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,340
Then all of Prince Kamfah's assets

401
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,220
will belong to us instead.

402
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,900
You need to develop these negatives
as soon as possible.

403
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,880
How much is the deposit?

404
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Let me go.

405
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,050
Let me go.

406
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,940
Where are you going, thief?

407
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Sasin!

408
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Saenkaew!

409
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,880
We can stay here.

410
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,100
I'll catch fishes.

411
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,620
I'll climb coconut trees to feed you.

412
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,940
You should let me feed you.

413
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,520
You? Feed me?

414
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,930
Someone like me

415
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,460
can shoot, ride a horse,

416
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,000
and go hunting, I've done them all.

417
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,680
Well, you can feed me

418
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,700
and I will play instruments

419
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,820
and sing for you when you're tired.

420
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,420
This morning, Gen. Kalong

421
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,060
and the Prime Minister of Chansaeng

422
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,100
signed an agreement to hand over Chansaeng to Nanta.

423
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,820
The high-ranking representatives

424
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,250
and royal family members
from major cities are witnesses the ceremony.

425
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,580
In the agreement,

426
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,300
people of Chansaeng and its resources

427
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,060
will be controlled by Nanta Republic.

428
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,620
People are not happy with the announcement
and they go out to protest,

429
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,500
causing them to fight against officers.

430
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,620
Many people are injured from this.

431
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,710
Can you see that?

432
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,700
What I chose for you

433
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,500
can save everyone.

434
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,020
If you refused to marry Pin-anong,

435
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,900
I think

436
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,820
we would be like people there trying to survive.

437
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,370
Can you see

438
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
how significant your duty is?

439
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,940
Saenkaew?

440
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,260
What you said isn't entirely accurate.

441
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,940
Their marriage is more than just a duty.

442
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,870
But they are actually in love.

443
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,260
Am I right, Pin?

444
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,620
Can I wait in the car?

445
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,700
Are you two fighting?

446
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,590
We're not.

447
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,300
I think I should go.

448
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,380
I don't want to be late for monk's lunch.

449
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,900
Honey?

450
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,010
Where're you, honey?

451
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,620
Honey?

452
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,890
Are you inside?

453
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,800
Honey?

454
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,700
I'm finding my husband.

455
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,920
You're a crazy person, how did you get in here?

456
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,300
- Get out!
- I'm not crazy, who's crazy?

457
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,100
- I'm not crazy, I'm finding my husband!
- Get out!

458
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:50,940
Honey?

459
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,880
Get out!

460
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,060
- I need help! A crazy lady is here. Get out!
- Help me!

461
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,740
- Honey!
- Get out!

462
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,100
Honey? Help me!

463
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,260
How was it? Did you share some good deeds with me?

464
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,550
Saenkaew!

465
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Saenkaew!

466
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,180
Saenkaew!

467
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,460
Sasin?

468
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,740
How did he get here?

469
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
Saenkaew!

470
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm right here.

471
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
Saenkaew?

472
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,140
I'm handling this.

473
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,740
Saenkaew.

474
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,770
What're you doing here?

475
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,980
I'm here to pick you up.

476
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,100
Please come with me.

477
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,800
Let's run away together.

478
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,000
Ms. Rachawadee will help us.

479
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,660
We can run to Hua Hin and stay in the island.

480
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,180
You will catch fishes

481
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,820
and I'll play music for you.

482
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,540
Do you remember what we talked about?

483
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,420
It's too late.

484
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,340
Everything is changed.

485
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,060
Nothing is changed.

486
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,220
I still love you

487
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,330
and I know that you still love me.

488
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,540
There is no use in this.

489
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,580
There is no place for

490
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,400
our love in this world.

491
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,500
It will hurt you.

492
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,940
I can't let you die.

493
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,700
I'm willing to die, I just want to be by your side.

494
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,140
But you can let me die?

495
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,140
What're you talking about?
I won't let anything happen to you.

496
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,300
I won't let anyone hurt you.

497
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,460
I will protect you.

498
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,060
But if you die,

499
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,860
how can I live?

500
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,880
We can't win in this game.

501
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,300
Please go.

502
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,140
No!

503
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,100
Don't give up.

504
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,500
- I won't give up.
- Please.

505
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,620
Don't come back here.

506
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,260
Don't let me waste what I have done.

507
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,060
This is the best option.

508
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,100
At least,

509
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,780
we both are still alive.

510
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,980
We can still meet in memories.

511
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,410
Please, I beg you.

512
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,580
- Saenkaew?
- If possible,

513
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,100
please forget about me.

514
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,620
Forget what happened between us.

515
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,400
I ask you to start over.

516
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,420
Living your life without me.

517
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,700
And you won't suffer because of me again.

518
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Saenkaew?

519
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,200
But I love you.

520
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,400
I love you.

521
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,420
Please, I beg you.

522
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,260
I beg of you.

523
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,260
Goodbye, Sasin.

524
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,070
Saenkaew!

525
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,820
Please come back here, Saenkaew!

526
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,660
I beg you, Saenkaew!

527
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,240
Saenkaew!

528
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Saenkaew!
