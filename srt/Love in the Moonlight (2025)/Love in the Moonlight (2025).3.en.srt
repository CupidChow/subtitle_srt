"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 3)

2
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,740
You didn't make out with her?
Then why did you hold her like that?

3
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,000
She was about to fall, so I caught her.

4
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,940
Fell how? I saw you hugged her.

5
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,940
You're not making any senses,
I'm done talking to you.

6
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,620
Where're you going? Come back here.

7
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
- Let me go.
- I won't.

8
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,850
How did she fell? Why did you hold her?

9
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Come here.

10
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
See it now?

11
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,180
This is how she was about to fall.

12
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Saenkaew!

13
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,420
- Uncle?
- Hi, darling.

14
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,530
Uncle?

15
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,140
Why're you here?

16
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
What? Why're you asking me that?

17
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
Who's this?

18
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,470
See you inside.

19
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,620
Uncle? Wait.

20
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,620
Who's that?

21
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Saenkaew's uncle.

22
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,820
Wait, Uncle! Wait!

23
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,860
How did you get here?

24
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,540
It's my beloved nephew's welcome party,

25
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,460
why can't I be here?

26
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,300
It tastes good, doesn't it?

27
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,860
Excuse me, everyone.
May I have your attention please?

28
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,760
It's gonna be a minute. Thank you.

29
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,300
Inthorn?

30
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,060
Good evening, everyone.

31
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,660
First of all, let me introduce myself.

32
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,860
I'm Prince Inthorn of Chansaeng.

33
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm Prince Saenkaew's uncle.

34
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,380
I'm so glad that

35
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,100
everyone is here for my nephew's welcome party.

36
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,540
That homeless prince.

37
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,220
Are they gonna move their whole family here?

38
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,540
I guess you all should know it by now that

39
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,940
Saenkaew

40
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,780
has engaged to this beautiful lady.

41
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,060
And she is Prince Bodin's daughter.

42
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,740
Uncle? What're you doing?

43
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,180
I'd like to congratulate you on your engagement.

44
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,780
But I'm not sure if you all know that the marriage

45
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,220
is based on benefits,

46
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,260
not from true love.

47
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
You need to stop now.

48
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,820
Why do I need to stop? It's the truth.

49
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,100
Why don't you tell everyone that before you came here

50
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,220
you had a fight with your dad about this?

51
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,780
It's true. Just tell them.

52
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
How did you know?

53
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,940
How did I know?

54
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,740
I know everything.

55
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,140
Everything that you hide,

56
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,660
I know it all.

57
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
What do you know?

58
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,250
Enough!

59
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,740
Inthorn, enough!

60
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,100
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

61
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,740
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

62
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,020
Move! Out of the way! Let me do it!

63
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,730
Please move!

64
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Grandma!

65
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

66
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,420
Move, please!

67
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,500
You two wanted to die?

68
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,780
Do you know who I am?

69
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,620
I'm Prince Inthorn of Chansaeng,
you lower class scumbags!

70
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,870
Don't you ever touch me again!

71
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
That's enough!

72
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Sir?

73
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,580
Please help me.

74
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
These scumbags

75
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,220
attacked me, sir.

76
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,140
For Prince Kamfah and Prince Saenkaew's sake,
I'll let you go this time.

77
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,100
If you cause any trouble again next time,

78
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,100
I will not be this kind to you.

79
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,420
I did what I did because I wanted to save you.

80
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,300
Don't you know that Prince Kamfah and Prince Saenkaew

81
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,140
try to fool you?

82
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,380
Believe me, sir

83
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,590
they have something to hide for sure.
Trust me on this.

84
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,180
Get him out of here! Now!

85
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,160
Let me go! Let me go!

86
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,660
Trust me!

87
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,740
Let me go! Let me go!

88
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Grandma?

89
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Grandma?

90
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,940
I'll take you to the doctor.

91
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,500
It's okay. I'm getting better.

92
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,660
I'm sorry

93
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,500
for causing troubles.

94
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,660
I need to apologize to you, Pin.

95
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,180
Grandma, no one sees it like that.

96
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
You're up?

97
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,500
Pin, you need to help me with the guests at the party.

98
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,980
It's chaos down there.

99
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,970
Okay.

100
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
You too.

101
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,970
I'll be back.

102
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,340
Thank you for helping my grandma.

103
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,820
Inthorn went to Saenkaew's welcome party?

104
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,840
That's right. And he announced that my daughter

105
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,140
needed to get married because of money.

106
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,860
I feel so bad for her, I hope you understand.

107
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,620
This rumor travels all around the city already.

108
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,940
She has been crying since last night

109
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,660
and she wasn't even up yet.

110
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,340
Pin, my poor girl.

111
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,980
Did you call for me, Dad?

112
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,940
I need to apologize to you.

113
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,300
I'll take care of my outcast brother.

114
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,420
Sorry.

115
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,140
I think we need to organize really big wedding

116
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,140
to make up for my daughter's embarrassment.

117
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,400
And her dowry should be higher as well.

118
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,500
It's up to you.

119
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,620
Why did Prince Inthorn
go to Prince Bodin's palace all of a sudden?

120
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,820
You need to prepare to go to Thailand

121
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,620
to find out about Inthorn

122
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,100
and protect Saenkaew.

123
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,980
- I'll be there when everything is done.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,540
There you are.

125
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
It's because of you.

126
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,420
I was so mortified at the club.

127
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,300
- What did I do?
- About last night.

128
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,300
People at the club talked about us behind our backs.

129
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,220
I couldn't stand to be in the event so I needed to leave.

130
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
But I didn't do anything.

131
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Because you didn't do anything, that's why it happened.

132
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,220
You were right there.

133
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,900
And you let that Prince Inthorn
say something nonsense like that.

134
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Why didn't you stop him?

135
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,540
You must be shameless like your mother
and feel nothing about it.

136
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,060
Remember that I'm not like your mother.

137
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,820
Don't blame her.

138
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,940
This is not her fault, Khunying.

139
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,300
He is my relative.

140
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,740
So it is my fault.

141
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,660
Well, you need to take better care of your relatives.

142
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,620
Don't let anyone cause any trouble like this again.

143
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Pin?

144
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,940
You're here!

145
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,300
The party is about to start, why didn't you dress up?

146
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,860
I'm helping Mom with the food.

147
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,380
- It's almost done.
- Did you just talk back to me?

148
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,580
I understand that you're just like your mom,
staying in the kitchen.

149
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,800
But you're his daughter.

150
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,020
So you need to dress up and don't humiliate me.

151
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,180
Yes, ma'am.

152
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,780
You need to stay here,
don't ever show your face at the party.

153
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
Mom!

154
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,060
Mommy!

155
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Sasin.

156
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,440
Yes?

157
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,140
When I'm not around…

158
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,060
Stop saying that.

159
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,620
You will get better.

160
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,380
That's right, you will get better.

161
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,400
You will stay with us for such a long time.

162
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,660
When something happens to me,

163
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,420
please take care of Pin.

164
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,980
You

165
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,340
are Pin's only relative.

166
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,000
Please take care of her.

167
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,820
Promise me.

168
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,180
Sure, I'll take care of her.

169
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Aunt Soi?

170
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Pin.

171
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,860
You shouldn't have taken the blame for me.

172
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,180
Khunying Wad scolded you too.

173
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,460
It's not your fault.

175
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,380
Don't apologize for something you didn't do.

176
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Sasin?

177
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,930
I'm glad that you're here,
let's talk to Saenkaew with me.

178
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,260
Why do we need to talk to him?

179
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,980
You didn't know? We're gonna talk about
what his uncle said last night.

180
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,940
I wanted to know if it was true

181
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,780
that he'll get married because of some benefits.

182
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,260
You don't need to ask him, I can tell you right now.

183
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,300
It's based on benefit.

184
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,060
Don't forget that the palace is struggling financially.

185
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,660
The creditors asked for their money back.

186
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,460
So my dad wanted dowry to save the palace.

187
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,140
But he needed to gain some benefits too,
I want to know what that is.

188
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,740
It doesn't matter.

189
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,220
I told you that I'm such a lucky girl

190
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,780
to get married to Saenkaew.

191
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,340
He is the best person.

192
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,620
I've never seen any men who is so kind
and understand me like him.

193
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
Are you sure that he's a good guy?

194
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,940
I saw he did something with Ms. Songsawat last night.

195
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,700
They seemed so close.

196
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,060
- You sure?
- You think I'm lying?

197
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,940
He was just greeting guests in the party.

198
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,260
I trust him.

199
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,980
Right. He's the perfect guy
and I just like to stir up dramas.

200
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,420
But I don't trust others.

201
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,980
Well, can you look out for me?

202
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,980
To see what's going on between them.

203
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,540
My uncle came all the way here, I don't trust him.

204
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,700
If he finds out that we also carry diamonds,
gold and jewelry,

205
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,980
he will harass us constantly for sure.

206
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I know.

207
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,700
And he seems to

208
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,020
know what's going on in our house really well.

209
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,580
He even knows about your argument
with your dad before you came here.

210
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,460
I think we have traitor back home.

211
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,700
I don't know how much he knows.

212
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,140
- If he knows about my secret…
- Impossible.

213
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Only your dad,

214
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,540
Kamsu and I

215
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,100
know about this.

216
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,540
Thip?

217
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Thip?

218
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,020
Your grandma must be up now.

219
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,900
I'll help you with that.

220
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,100
I'll be right back.

221
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Come on in.

222
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,060
Hey! How did you get in here?

223
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,700
- You told me to come in.
- I thought you were Homthip.

224
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
What did you hide?

225
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,340
It's nothing.

226
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,180
- Sure there is. Move.
- Hey!

227
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,900
Hey!

228
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,140
Give it to me.

229
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,020
Why? What's in this book?

230
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

231
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,540
Right, you must store that sex bomb's love letters in here.

232
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Am I right? Let me see.

233
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,540
Hey!

234
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,300
You're talking nonsense. It's nothing.

235
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,220
It's nothing then why are you hiding it from me?

236
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,550
Let me see.

237
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Let it go!

238
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,980
Give it to me.

239
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,800
If it's nothing, then I can see it.

240
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Let it go!

241
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,800
What's going on?

242
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,100
What happens?

243
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,700
It belonged to Princess Dueanpradap.

244
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,380
Whose book?

245
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,700
Saenkaew's mother.

246
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,260
She gave it to her before she passed away.

247
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,180
- I…
- I don't feel good.

248
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Excuse me.

249
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,220
The Rabbit in the Moon.

250
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,050
Once upon a time

251
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,940
in the moon far far away,

252
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,540
there was Rabbit

253
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,820
with his glistening silver fur.

254
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,660
He lives alone

255
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
in his house

256
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,460
made from beautiful glasses

257
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,020
with 15 windows.

258
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Every day, the little Rabbit

259
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
had a job to open windows in the glass house,

260
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,980
one window per day.

261
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,300
Every time that he opened the windows

262
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,540
his silver fur would reflect light

263
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,340
through the windows.

264
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,340
People on Earth would stare at silver light in the moon

265
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,340
and they called it waxing moon.

266
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,660
When he opened all 15 windows in the glass house,

267
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,940
the light from the Rabbit would be shining so bright

268
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,740
and we called it full moon.

269
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,860
The next day

270
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,300
the Rabbit would close the windows,

271
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,620
one window per night

272
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,740
people on Earth called it waning moon.

273
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,780
When all 15 windows were closed,

274
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,780
people on Earth wouldn't see
any silver light from the Rabbit.

275
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,340
Why didn't the Rabbit open the windows all the time?

276
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,340
I don't like it when I can't see the moon.

277
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,620
It's not possible, it's nature,

278
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,500
just like our life.

279
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,700
There are sorrows and happiness.

280
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
We are happy

281
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,400
and we are sad, we have it all.

282
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,380
When you grow up,

283
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,740
you will understand this.

284
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Hey!

285
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
I'm sor…

286
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,620
I went to

287
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,220
my nephew's welcome party to humiliate him the other night.

288
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,260
I told everyone that their wedding

289
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,380
are not real. They don't love each other.

290
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,770
They must be so mortified right now.

291
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,420
And they could cancel the wedding already.

292
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,200
Is this what you can think of?

293
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,940
No wonder they hardly called you a royal family member.

294
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,860
Everyone knows about political marriage.

295
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,940
Elite class members get married based on benefits.

296
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,020
They marry for money and power.

297
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,140
Romantic weddings are only for middle class dreamers.

298
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,060
It could be possible that

299
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,020
the female side is infuriated

300
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,580
and calls off the wedding.

301
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,420
Stupid you!

302
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,020
You need to stop Saenkaew's wedding.

303
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,100
Otherwise, I will see you as a liar

304
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,400
and fraud against the nation. You will be punished.

305
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,580
Kalong, you son of a bitch!

306
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,580
How dare you talk to a royal family member like that, huh?!

307
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,380
I'm from royal family!

308
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Honey!

309
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,800
Did you hang up the phone properly?

310
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,630
He could hear you.

311
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
We're good.

312
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,400
What should we do next?

313
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,740
I threatened Saenkaew in the event,

314
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,860
that I knew everything in his family.

315
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,620
He seemed to be so shocked
as if he actually had a secret to hide.

316
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,580
Could it be about his disagreement
with his dad about marriage?

317
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,460
Or your nephew had secret wives somewhere?

318
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,220
Secret wives?

319
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,100
It can't be, when he was in Chansaeng,

320
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,500
there's no rumor about women.

321
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,020
As a matter of fact, his house

322
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,180
was full of hot women.

323
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Oh come on! If he slept with his servants,

324
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,740
he had nothing to worry about,

325
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,340
he could pay them up to keep their mouths shut.

326
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,900
But he tried to hide it well

327
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,770
so it must be bigger than this.

328
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,340
If we find our Saenkaew's secret,

329
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
we can use it against him.

330
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,300
Do you like it?

331
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,000
I do.

332
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,300
Thank you so much

333
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,540
for taking me out.

334
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,300
Well, if you're feeling better

335
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,060
perhaps you could forgive Sasin?

336
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Is he…

337
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,300
Sasin performs here.

338
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,950
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

339
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
I just want the two of you to talk.

340
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,620
Sasin doesn't feel good for making you upset.

341
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,580
He has been so sad and he hasn't been quite lively.

342
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,140
Oh wow! Ms. Waewwan! You look so pretty tonight.

343
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,500
Is that your new dress?

344
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,420
Such a sweet talker, you handsome.

345
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,300
What about the rest of us? None of us is handsome?

346
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,660
Still handsome, but less than me.

347
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,060
Not quite lively like that?

348
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
- Saenkaew…
- Pin.

349
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Please wait for me here.

350
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,540
I need to use a bathroom.

351
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,820
Why're you standing here alone, looking so sad?

352
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,660
You're here in Rachawadee's house,

353
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,700
everyone here must be happy.

354
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,070
I'm Rachawadee, owner of this club.

355
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,270
I am…

356
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Prince Saenkaew.

357
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,660
Sasin and Pin-anong told me about you.

358
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,760
He gossips about me, I guess.

359
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
No, he doesn't.

360
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,020
Sasin is a good guy.

361
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,780
Our regular customers.

362
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,220
Do you feel uncomfortable?

363
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
No.

364
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,380
They look…

365
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,220
happy.

366
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,540
Everyone should be happy in Rachawadee's place.

367
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,100
They can be themselves

368
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,500
with no one to judge.

369
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,940
That's too bad

370
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,660
the world doesn't work that way.

371
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
People are ready

372
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,900
to judge someone who doesn't fit the norms.

373
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,620
You were born to a royal family.

374
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,740
You need to follow certain rules and manners.

375
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,580
You can relax in this place

376
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,800
leave your rules behind.

377
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,350
Just be yourself.

378
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,740
Do what your heart desires.

379
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,540
Let go of your burdens.

380
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,260
We have enough sorrows in our lives

381
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,340
don't let this little thing

382
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,380
cause you more sorrows.

383
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Am I right?

384
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,140
Could I have a word with you?

385
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll let you two talk

386
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,620
and I'll get you drinks.

387
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Pin?

388
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,900
Is there any song you'd like to hear tonight?

389
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
I can play it for you.

390
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,220
I don't know what she wants to hear.

391
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,700
But you will hear broken heart songs for sure.

392
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,500
Everything's good?

393
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,980
All good?

394
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,620
Ms. Rachawadee,

395
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,580
do you think Saenkaew will be mad at me
for bring him here to meet Sasin?

396
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,200
I don't think he's a narrow-minded type of person.

397
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,760
You should calm down.

398
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,700
Rachawadee's club is the coolest one in town

399
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,900
with a good-looking musician.

400
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
Alright, I'll cut to the chase.

401
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,220
I'm sorry for ruining your mom's memento.

402
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,700
I didn't mean to and I felt bad about it.

403
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,860
If you had nothing to hide,

404
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,180
you should have let me look at the book nicely.

405
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
You acted like you had a secret so I was curious.

406
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,780
So it's my fault?

407
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,380
I just protected my belonging.

408
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,700
But you tried to take it away.

409
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,540
Isn't it your fault for breaking into my room?

410
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,060
Well, you broke into my house too.

411
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,460
- I'm done talking to you.
- Wait.

412
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
I'm sorry.

413
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,900
It's my fault, it's all my fault.

414
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,340
I'm a horrible person with no manners.

415
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,580
I didn't respect your privacy.

416
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,140
I'm truly sorry.

417
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,660
I know that the book means so much to you.

418
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
What're you laughing at?

419
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,290
I stayed up all night creating it.

420
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,340
It looks funny just like you.

421
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,140
No, it's not. It's a rabbit so it looks like you.

422
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,860
It looks like you.

423
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,620
Like you, it's a rabbit.

424
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,500
This is not a rabbit.

425
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,740
It is a rabbit.

426
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,140
Such a relief.

427
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,260
I'm glad to see both of them finally make up.

428
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,700
Let me give them drinks.

429
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Sure.

430
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,980
Now that you two have made up, we should celebrate.

431
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,070
You shouldn't bother him next time.

432
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,060
You're lucky that he forgave you this time.

433
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,380
-I heard that we shouldn't mind mad people
-What?

434
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,580
- and drunk people.
- Hey!

435
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,900
- Well, you are both.
- Pin?

436
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,820
Why are you two ganging up on me?

437
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Let's drink.

438
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Kamsu,

439
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,900
report me when you get to Thailand.

440
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,260
You need to take care of my son
and keep Inthorn away from him.

441
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,380
- I'll be there soon.
- Yes, sir.

442
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,490
Wait, Prince Bodin.

443
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,060
Wait, I have something to tell you.

444
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,500
What is it? You don't understand a word I said?

445
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,860
You have to listen to me.

446
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,300
My brother and Saenkaew have something to hide from you.

447
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,780
Before Saenkaew came to Thailand,

448
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,660
he fought him because he didn't want to marry your daughter.

449
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,980
Stop trying to mess with my head.

450
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,660
I don't believe you. If he didn't want to get married,

451
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,180
why would he come to Thailand?

452
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,420
I think he has a secret wife.

453
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,420
You don't love your daughter?

454
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,070
He is fooling your daughter.

455
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
Go away!

456
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,420
Let's go.

457
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,980
Hey! You don't love your own daughter?

458
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,820
Damn it! Please trust me.

459
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,740
Don't go! Please don't go.

460
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,140
Listen to me.

461
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,860
I have no evidence but please believe me

462
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,990
that it's true!

463
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,100
Sir! Sir!

464
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,800
Wait! Sir!

465
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Damn it!

466
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,300
Thank you, thank you so much.

467
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,300
Don't thank me just yet.

468
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,820
I don't know if the Field Marshal would let you meet him.

469
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,060
I'll go to see him this evening.

470
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,940
I can talk to him about you.

471
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,020
This is grateful enough.

472
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,300
I don't know what to say.

473
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,900
Can you come out and meet me tonight?

474
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,220
We can talk about it.

475
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Sure.

476
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,860
Where?

477
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,220
Wait,

478
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,380
who is he talking with on the phone?

479
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,820
I don't know but it's a woman.

480
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,220
She called and asked for Prince Saenkaew.

481
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Okay.

482
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,460
Who did you talk to on the phone?

483
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,400
My dad called.

484
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,000
He asked how my grandma was.

485
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
He did?

486
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,140
You shouldn't hang up too soon.

487
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,380
I really wanted to talk to him.

488
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,140
I don't feel good. Excuse me.

489
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,580
Pin told me that you have a cold.

490
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,400
You should take some meds and rest.

491
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,620
Please have plenty of it.

492
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,980
This sausage is the famous one.

493
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,630
I'd love to try more of it.

494
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,220
But I'm old and I couldn't eat much.

495
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,090
Got it.

496
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,580
About Prince Inthorn…

497
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,980
I need to apologize to you again,

498
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,940
that Inthorn humiliated you like that.

499
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,660
Inthorn and Kamfah haven't seen eye to eye for years.

500
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,060
Inthorn accused Kamfah of stealing

501
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,100
timber business from him.

502
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,530
When the fact was that

503
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,260
Kamfah built the business from the start.

504
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Right.

505
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,020
He said that Prince Kamfah and Prince Saenkaew

506
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,000
had a fight before heading to Thailand, is it true?

507
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,230
Well,

508
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,980
they had a fight and it's normal.

509
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,110
I don't think it has something to do with the marriage

510
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,180
like Inthorn said.

511
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,300
I see that Saenkaew

512
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,980
is getting along with Pin really well.

513
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,300
That's right. He seems to adore my daughter.

514
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,220
I don't think it could be any reason
for him to not want to get married.

515
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,850
You're right.

516
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,420
Let's eat.

517
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,260
Let me help you with that.

518
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,020
You're burning up.

519
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,780
You have a fever

520
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,140
and I think you should postpone the appointment. Don't go out.

521
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,660
I can't. Ms. Songsawat helped me out.

522
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,620
I'll be back soon.

523
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,620
- Please stay.
- I'm fine.

524
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,730
I gotta go.

525
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,540
Keep the change.

526
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,630
Saenkaew?

527
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,860
What is he doing here?

528
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,620
- Excuse me, are you Ms. Songsawat's friend.
- That's me.

529
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,740
Who's that?

530
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,020
Ms. Songsawat asked me to inform you that

531
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,380
she had something to do and couldn't meet tonight. Sorry.

532
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,330
Saenkaew.

533
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,560
Uncle?

534
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,860
You're out by yourself at night like this,

535
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,260
are you meeting someone?

536
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,220
- This is nonsense.
- Nonsense?

537
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,050
I saw you

538
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,300
waiting for someone in the restaurant.

539
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,780
That woman who came to meet you, who's she?

540
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,370
Are you spying on me?

541
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,270
Well, that's right.

542
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,460
But I'm worried about you.

543
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,460
Saenkaew,

544
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,780
I know that your dad forced you to get married.

545
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,360
You can tell me if something is bothering you.

546
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,850
- Let me help you.
- Uncle

547
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,180
stop talking already. You think I'm that stupid?

548
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,920
Everyone knows how much you hate my dad and our house

549
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,140
because my dad wouldn't give you money for gambling.

550
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:03,140
A gambler like you ruined our family.

551
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,390
Saenkaew!

552
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,420
- How dare you talk to me like that!
- Well, it's true.

553
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,300
Tell me where your hidden wife is.

554
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,510
Who is she?

555
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,980
Or you're having an affair with someone's wife, aren't you?

556
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,780
- Tell me who she is. I'll expose you.
- This is nonsense.

557
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,620
Tell me or I won't let you go.

558
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,780
Sasin!

559
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,540
You caused drama in the party.

560
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,340
What're you doing to him?

561
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,700
You punk! I'm talking to my nephew.

562
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
It's none of your business.

563
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,260
You're good.

564
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,580
- Come on.
- Bring it on.

565
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,660
Wait! Wait!

566
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,300
This is not the end. I'll get back at you later.

567
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
He's gone.

568
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,810
Saenkaew!

569
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,770
Saenkaew!

570
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,410
You!

571
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,060
You!

572
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,940
Come on in!

573
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,870
- What is it?
- Sasin is here to see you.

574
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,060
He brought a friend.

575
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,370
Sasin.

576
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,940
What happened?

577
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,780
What's wrong with your face? Were you in a fight?

578
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,540
I'm fine but Saenkaew is burning.

579
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,780
I remember that your house is around
so I'd like to stay for a while.

580
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,740
He has a fever. We could wash him to cool down.

581
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,460
He could get better.

582
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,340
I'll get a washcloth.

583
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,750
- Okay.
- Dao

584
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,640
get me a washcloth.

585
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,060
Come on in.

586
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
Mom!

587
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,340
What is it?

588
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,780
What're you doing?

589
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
Nothing.

590
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,300
Grandma asked to see you.

591
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Sure.

592
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,000
Dad, Grandma wanted me to bring you this.

593
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,180
Thip, come on.

594
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,420
Why did a man send you a love letter?

595
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Do you have any idea

596
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,420
what would others say about us

597
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,860
if this scandal leaked out?

598
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,260
You are going to taint our reputation

599
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,500
and ruin our family, you ungrateful son!

600
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,380
- Honey, please. I beg you.
- Don't stop me!

601
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,620
Please stop!

602
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,830
Don't! Sop!

603
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,260
Dueanpradap, why did you stop me?

604
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,700
I'm gonna punish him so he'll stop behaving like this.

605
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,460
Please just talk to him.

606
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,540
We can just talk about this?

607
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,580
We are blue bloods.

608
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,900
What're we gonna do if others find out about this?

609
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,300
There will be no heirs left to continue our bloodline.

610
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,000
Our family will be vanished.

611
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,700
But our royal family

612
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,340
has been gone since France took over Chansaeng.

613
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,780
We are still here.

614
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,400
Our pride and dignity are still here.

615
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,660
If Saenkaew becomes like this,
our ancestors will curse him

616
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,140
for bringing bad reputation to us.

617
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,660
I'll talk to him and find out who that guy is.

618
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,420
Please, I beg of you.

619
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,000
Please, don't do anything to him. Please!

620
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,100
Dueanpradap, why did you stop me?

621
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,540
Dueanpradap!

622
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,020
Dueanpradap!

623
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,020
Kamsu!

624
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,540
Get the car, I'll take her to the hospital. Hurry!

625
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,620
- Yes, sir.
- Dad? What's wrong with Mom?

626
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,020
Mom!

627
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Mom!

628
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,460
Dad!

629
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Because of you.

630
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,980
Dueanpradap was in pain and she died.

631
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,380
You killed the woman who I loved the most.

632
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,100
Mom, I'm sorry.

633
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,380
I'm sorry.

634
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,580
You need to forget everything that happened.

635
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,140
You need to remember that

636
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,860
I have one and only son.

637
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,020
I only have a son.

638
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,740
Other than that, he's not my child.

639
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,980
It's my fault.

640
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,540
It's okay.

641
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,490
Don't cry.

642
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:13,730
It's okay.

643
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,780
It's okay.
