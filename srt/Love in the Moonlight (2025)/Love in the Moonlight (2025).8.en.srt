"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 8)

2
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,470
Sasin?

3
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Pin?

4
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
Sasin?

5
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,690
What're you doing?

6
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,540
Is he still sleeping?

7
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,530
Sasin?

8
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,930
Are you okay?

9
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,370
Why're you here?

10
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,210
- I…
- He's here to scold me.

11
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,850
I dragged him to join
me on a boat, got stuck

12
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,590
on the island and caused some troubles.

13
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,130
Right?

14
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,850
- But I…
- Why do you want to see me?

15
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,490
I don't feel good that

16
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,250
Saenkaew's dad doesn't seem
like he likes you very much.

17
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,770
I'd like to ask you

18
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,450
to apologize to him properly.

19
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,210
If one day,

20
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,250
Pin and Saenkaew get married,

21
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,410
we will be like family.

22
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,570
I love you like my real brother

23
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,610
and I don't want him to feel bad about you.

24
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,210
Please?

25
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,910
Apologize to him with me

26
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,090
and I'll help talking to him.

27
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Fine.

28
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,890
I don't want you to
feel bad about it either.

29
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,010
Sure. I'll arrange the meeting.

30
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,330
I'll apologize to him with you.

31
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,870
Thank you.

32
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,830
What's wrong with you?

33
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,530
Why did your buttons look like that?

34
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,870
How old are you?

35
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,490
Let me help you.

36
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,380
You should wear it properly.

37
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,570
Kalong!

38
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,170
He rushed me to stop the wedding.

39
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,370
If you think that it's
easy, then you do it!

40
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,050
What should we do?

41
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,770
If we can't stop the wedding.

42
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,170
Kalong will get us for sure.

43
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,130
You shouldn't have
betrayed your brother like that.

44
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,000
My dear,

45
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,370
if you're not gonna make it better,

46
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,570
at least don't give me more headaches.

47
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,550
My head hurts enough as it is.

48
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,370
Where're you going?

49
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,180
Come back here.

50
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,570
I'll teach you how to
put together a garland

51
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,010
to give to Saenkaew's
dad, along with your apology.

52
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,050
I went to the flower market this morning,
and prepared flowers for you.

53
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,250
It seems so complicated,
why don't you do it for me?

54
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,210
No, you need to do it yourself

55
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,330
to show your sincerity.

56
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
I'll teach you.

57
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Get the needles

58
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,610
and then you need to

59
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,650
pick beautiful flowers like this.

60
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,410
Then stick them in the middle.

61
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Right,

62
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,930
Ms. Rachawadee invited both you
and Saenkaew to the night club.

63
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,370
I think if you asked Prince
Kamfah to go, he wouldn't mind.

64
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,770
Sure, let's go.

65
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,530
I haven't heard Mingmitr's
singing voice in a long time.

66
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,050
We should hurry up and finish this.

67
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,250
I'll help you.

68
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,130
Let me see how you do it.

69
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
Like that.

70
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,570
Should we get some noodles
at the same place after this?

71
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,620
I haven't visited that
place in such a long time.

72
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,210
Sure.

73
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,290
I need to use a bathroom
real quick and I'll be right back.

74
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,690
I don't have a problem
with marriage certificates

75
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,290
but to protect both of us about this.

76
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,970
I've drafted a loan agreement

77
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,130
to guarantee that I'll return your assets

78
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,910
all of them.

79
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,030
Thank you so much.

80
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,450
Pin?

81
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,470
Sanya.

82
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,410
Have you seen Sasin and Saenkaew?

83
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,330
I saw them walking

84
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,650
but I don't know

85
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,810
where they were heading to.

86
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,970
Is something bothering you?

87
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,050
Maybe it's just all in my head.

88
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,050
Whatever it is bothering you,

89
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,850
you can talk to me.

90
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,010
I know that I don't look reliable,

91
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,490
but I'm happy to listen to you.

92
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,030
Well,

93
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,850
I was really happy when

94
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,130
I was around Sasin and Saenkaew.

95
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,570
We always hung out together.

96
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,570
But now, it seems like
they're getting closer.

97
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,970
I don't know.

98
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,890
I can't help it but feel left out.

99
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,640
It's like they don't see me anymore.

100
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,010
I understand how you feel.

101
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,410
But don't dwell on it.

102
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,210
It's better for them to get closer,
rather than being mad, right?

103
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,690
You will marry Prince Saenkaew soon,

104
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,450
after that

105
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,210
nobody will be closer to him than you.

106
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,570
Thank you, Sanya.

107
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,330
You've always been so kind to me.

108
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,770
I'll keep your words in my mind.

109
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,530
Sure.

110
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Right,

111
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,540
Prince Bodin will take us to
have lunch with Ms. Tararat tomorrow.

112
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,050
I think I can sneak out
during the gathering.

113
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,730
I'll wait for you and take
you to see Ms. Rachawadee.

114
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,050
Don't forget the certificate from the embassy.

115
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
You need that for the marriage
certificate, don't you?

116
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,850
I don't know how Pin would react.

117
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,330
I'll explain it all to her.
She will understand.

118
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,290
Don't worry.

119
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,970
Finally, I met someone who would

120
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,050
pin a flirty guy like you down.

121
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,510
- It's not like that. We…
- It's fine.

122
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,050
I've been through a lot and
I've seen so many things.

123
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,580
I'm happy for both of you.

124
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,010
After this, your lives won't get easier.

125
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,290
Someone will dislike you

126
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,490
and someone will judge you.

127
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,250
I need you to remember

128
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,450
that you will get through this

129
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,290
with your love

130
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,830
and understanding.

131
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Thank you.

132
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,130
Where have you been? I didn't see you.

133
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,090
You left me here all alone.

134
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,710
You want to dance with me?

135
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,490
Sasin,

136
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,450
let me get you a drink.

137
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,930
My dad told Kamsu to watch me closely.

138
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,850
It's hard for me to get out of the house.

139
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,090
But Prince Bodin will take Pin and I

140
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,910
to have lunch with Ms. Tararat tomorrow.

141
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,890
I think we should take this chance

142
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,410
and get a marriage certificate
with Ms. Rachawadee.

143
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,610
Tararat doesn't meet people quite often.

144
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,650
She is so kind

145
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,970
for having lunch with us.

146
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,170
Did you get her gift already?

147
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,210
It's in the car.

148
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,170
It's getting late and nobody is ready?

149
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
This is my document.

150
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I'll leave it to you.

151
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,970
I'll pick up Ms. Rachawadee
and drop her off in Bangrak.

152
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,530
Then I'll come back to get you.

153
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,730
Saenkaew?

154
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,650
There you are.

155
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,810
Let's go, my dad asked
me to come and get you.

156
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,110
[Certificate of No Impediment]

157
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,070
Hello.

158
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,700
You two look like a perfect couple.

159
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,930
Like you're meant for each other.

160
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,610
You need to have children
for your dad to play with soon.

161
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,730
And so do you.

162
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,710
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,330
Excuse me,

164
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,610
I'd like you to try this one.

165
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,970
It tastes so good.

166
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,410
I picked it especially for you.

167
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,170
Bangrak District Office.

168
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,410
Please wait here, I'll
need to pick up Saenkaew.

169
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,730
Sure.

170
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,250
Cheers to the future bride and groom.

171
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,430
Cheers!

172
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,250
- They said that Shumai here is so good.
- Pin, honey

173
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,410
why don't you get that dish for Saenkaew?

174
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,100
That's Kamfah and his clan.

175
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,490
I guess he is inviting
someone to a wedding.

176
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,810
We can drop you off.

177
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,130
No worries, my driver is waiting for me.

178
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,970
Let me walk you to your car.

179
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,010
Wait, dad.

180
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,890
What is it?

181
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,650
I lost my watch.

182
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,530
I guess I forget it in a bathroom
while I washed my hands.

183
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,810
Can I go get it?

184
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,290
Well, Grandma can join me in my car.

185
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,370
So you can get home earlier and rest.

186
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,290
Pin, you can ride with Saenkaew.

187
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,430
Okay.

188
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,490
This way.

189
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,490
We will be right back.

190
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,370
Or Saenkaew could've dropped his watch

191
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,290
while he walked with me in the garden.

192
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,290
I think I should help him look.

193
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Saenkaew.

194
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,550
What're you doing? Someone could see us.

195
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,130
I missed you. Everything
is about to end now.

196
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,530
Let's go or we won't make it.

197
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
My dear Dongkamol,

198
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,770
why did he hug your future
bride's cousin like that?

199
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,570
He's been gone for too long.
Is something happened to him?

200
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,210
- Kamsu, check on him.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,290
Prince Saenkaew?

202
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,170
Sir?

203
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,530
Sir,

204
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,130
he is riding with Mr. Sasin out of here.

205
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,490
Saenkaew is going somewhere with Sasin?

206
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,450
I need to find a parking lot,
you need to see Ms. Rachawadee inside.

207
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
They're about to close.

208
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,710
Okay.

209
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,210
Hey,

210
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,690
hey!

211
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,050
This is your document.

212
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,900
- Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

213
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,490
Prince Saenkaew.

214
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,130
Dad?

215
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,450
What're you doing here?

216
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,250
Go home!

217
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,630
Prince Saenkaew?

218
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,530
Saenkaew!

219
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,850
- Saenkaew!
- Sasin.

220
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,330
His dad dragged him out of here.

221
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,330
How did Prince Kamfah
find out about us here?

222
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,950
What do you think you're doing?

223
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,530
Why did you go to the district office?

224
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,450
Why did you need this
embassy's certificate for?

225
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,290
I just wanted to do the
best thing for all of us.

226
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,810
What do you mean?

227
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,610
The best thing for Pin and I

228
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,890
is to not get married.

229
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,360
Pin deserves a better man than me.

230
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,210
She doesn't deserve
to live in hell with me.

231
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,170
Why did you change so much?

232
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,610
Is it because of Sasin?

233
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,090
How dare you disobey my order?

234
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,890
You questioned how I could dare to do this.

235
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,570
But I questioned why I
was so scared earlier.

236
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,010
I didn't even do anything wrong. Go ahead!

237
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,420
Go ahead! Hit me!

238
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,690
You can even kill me!

239
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,290
You can kill me

240
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,570
but you can't change me.

241
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,910
I've tried my whole life

242
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,810
and I still can't change who I am.

243
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,730
Now I'm done.

244
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,610
I quit running away from myself.

245
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,890
I will live my life like I want to.

246
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,690
This is weird.

247
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,540
Why did Saenkaew hug him?

248
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,370
Oh come on! They must
be happy about something.

249
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,570
We can be surprised when
we see him hugging a woman.

250
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,890
You're right.

251
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,410
It's still weird.

252
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,890
Saenkaew has never been rumored to
be with any woman, never.

253
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,770
Why is that?

254
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,970
Sasin?

255
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,690
What did you do at the district office?

256
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,450
Why didn't you tell me?

257
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,650
Do you have any idea why
Prince Kamfah found out about us?

258
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,050
I told him.

259
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,870
I heard you two talked this morning.

260
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,730
I'll leave it to you.

261
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,370
I'll pick up Ms. Rachawadee
and drop her off in Bangrak.

262
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,970
Then I'll come back to get you.

263
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,710
Saenkaew?

264
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,690
That's why he followed you there.

265
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,770
I know where they are.

266
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,170
I heard Saenkaew talked
to Sasin this morning

267
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,930
that they'd go to Bangrak District Office.

268
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,590
Why did you tell him?
Everything was ruined.

269
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,690
What was ruined?

270
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,710
Why didn't you tell me anything? Why?

271
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,890
What did you two plan to do?

272
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,610
I'm trying to help Saenkaew

273
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,010
- and I'm trying to help you.
- Help me?

274
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,810
Help me with what? Just tell me!

275
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,290
I'll wait until everything is done

276
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,330
- then I'll explain it to you later.
- You always say that!

277
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,450
Don't you feel anything
because I sure feel something.

278
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,650
Why didn't you tell me anything lately?

279
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,850
You acted like I was someone else.

280
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,770
It used to be just the three of us.

281
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,930
Can you stop acting like this?

282
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,210
If you tell me, we can
figure the way out together.

283
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,130
I love both of you.

284
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,890
Can you not act like I'm someone else?

285
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Please?

286
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,450
I'm sorry.

287
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,890
Are you sure that you want to do this?

288
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,490
Do I have a choice?

289
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,410
Just handle it already.

290
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,070
Go.

291
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,410
See you tomorrow.

292
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,330
Don't be late, you
almost ruined it tonight.

293
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,110
Okay.

294
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,130
Did you drive here?

295
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,730
Nope, I didn't bring my car.

296
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,290
No money for gas.

297
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,610
So pathetic.

298
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,090
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

299
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,490
- Get home safe.
- See you.

300
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,930
- We should go.
- Let's go.

301
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Sasin.

302
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,970
Saenkaew.

303
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,070
I love you.

304
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,050
My name means the moon, you know?

305
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,570
And you're a rabbit.

306
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,250
Rabbit belongs to the moon, just like you.

307
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,130
You belong to me forever.

308
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,010
Help! Help!

309
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,330
Pin! Pin!

310
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,170
Open the door! Please open the door!

311
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,290
Anyone, please open the door!

312
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,210
- Open the door!
- It's late! Who's here?

313
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,170
Sanya?

314
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,890
What's going on?

315
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,050
Sasin got shot.

316
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,130
Where is he? How is he?

317
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,530
I sent him to the hospital.

318
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,690
I don't know his condition yet,
I rushed here to tell everyone.

319
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,050
Sasin?

320
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,730
Let's get changed so we can go.

321
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,130
Please come inside to wait.

322
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,630
Okay.

323
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,050
Everyone's ready? Let's go.

324
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,770
Where's Saenkaew?

325
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,530
Not ready yet.

326
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,410
Open! Come on!

327
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,730
Open! Come on!

328
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,170
You all should go.

329
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,330
I'll take him there later.

330
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
We should get going.

331
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,010
Open the door!

332
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,690
Open the door!

333
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,650
What're you trying to do?

334
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,750
Let me go!

335
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,020
Stop, right now!

336
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,020
Saenkaew!

337
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,130
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see Sasin.

338
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,590
He's not gonna die.

339
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,410
It's far from his heart.

340
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,510
How did you know about that?

341
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,490
Sanya didn't tell us

342
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,570
where he got shot.

343
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,310
Dad?

344
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,130
Did you do it?

345
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,130
Why did you do it?

346
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,930
You're too stubborn.

347
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,130
I tried to talk to you
nicely and you won't listen.

348
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,570
Why did you hurt him?
Why didn't you hurt me?

349
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,610
I would hurt you if you weren't my son.

350
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,210
You need to stop daydreaming

351
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,650
and coming back to reality already.

352
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,050
Stop humiliating me.

353
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,730
And think about our family's pride.

354
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,190
All you care is your pride

355
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,250
and family's dignity.

356
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,730
What about my life?

357
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,090
What about my happiness?

358
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,890
Your happiness

359
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,610
is about to destroy your life.

360
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,910
You think people would praise your love?

361
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,710
You will be a clown

362
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,700
and everyone will be laughing at you.

363
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,110
What about you?

364
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,690
Are you gonna judge me as well?

365
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,850
I can't help but think

366
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,410
that I would be much
happier if I weren't your son.

367
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Saenkaew!

368
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,950
You can hate me all you want

369
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,530
but I won't let you walk the wrong path.

370
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,650
I won't let you walk to hell either.

371
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,250
Even if it's hell

372
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,930
and Sasin is waiting for me, then I'll go.

373
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,050
One more step and I'll have
someone shoot him again.

374
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,290
And I'll have them shoot
him to death this time.

375
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,210
One more step.

376
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,730
Sasin?

377
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,250
How is he?

378
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,890
He's safe now.

379
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,930
The doctor took the bullet out already.

380
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,810
Sasin.

381
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,910
God bless, my dear.

382
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,570
Who shot him?

383
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,170
Does he have any enemies?

384
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,690
No one. He has never been in a fight.

385
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,450
Pin?

386
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,090
How's Sasin?

387
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,730
He's safe now.

388
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,370
Saenkaew.

389
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,330
He wakes up?

390
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,010
What did the doctor say?

391
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,510
He woke up already.

392
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,510
The doctor wanted him to
stay in the hospital longer.

393
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,410
If his wound isn't
inflamed, he could go home.

394
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,490
If you're worried about him,

395
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,490
I'm gonna see him this
afternoon, you want to join me?

396
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,470
I don't think so.

397
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,490
He's doing good now.

398
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,410
Please take care of him.

399
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,350
You didn't see the gunman's face?

400
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,810
Who did it?

401
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,770
Why did they hate you so much

402
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,730
that they could try to kill you like this?

403
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,010
You've never involved in any fight.

404
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,450
Actually, I can think of someone.

405
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,010
Who?

406
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,690
- Don't tell me that it's his…
- That's right.

407
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,010
I think Prince Kamfah was behind this.

408
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,050
He must have know about
my relationship with Saenkaew.

409
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,570
What're you gonna do?

410
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,970
This is huge.

411
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,290
He's aiming for your life.

412
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,330
Even if I have to die, I
won't break up with him.

413
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,970
If I have to stay alive
without him by my side,

414
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,530
it's no different than a dead man.

415
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,450
You did it, didn't you? Why?

416
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,290
He's just a distant cousin of the bride.

417
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,610
If he was dead, they still
won't cancel the wedding.

418
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,770
Nope.

419
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,370
I didn't do anything.

420
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Wait.

421
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,290
He was attacked on his way back,
around Nang Loeng Street.

422
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,650
Nang Loeng Street?

423
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,130
Right?

424
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,210
The gunshot that we heard the other night?

425
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,450
- Hey! Don't run!
- Honey, where should we go? Come on!

426
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,290
I told you to stop running!

427
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,090
- They're coming! Where to go?!
- This way!

428
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,850
- Where are they?
- Let's look around, come on!

429
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,570
- Are they gone?
- They're all gone, honey.

430
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,770
That's a relief. Let me catch my breath.

431
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,250
A relief? It's all because of you.

432
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,050
Who told you to cheat a dealer?

433
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,530
I told you that there are
eyes everywhere in the casino.

434
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,850
We're lucky we're alive.

435
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,730
Stop whining already, my baby.

436
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,250
Let's get going before they return.

437
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,970
Honey!

438
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,250
- Honey!
- My baby!

439
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,810
I got shot!

440
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,230
Honey!

441
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,530
What's the noise earlier?

442
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,450
Sounded like a gunshot to me.

443
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,890
Let's hide, come on.

444
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,010
This way!

445
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,050
That's Kamsu?

446
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:57,570
Kamfah's people?

447
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,690
Why did he do that for?

448
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,250
I know, right?

449
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,410
They're about to get married next week.

450
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,050
Can you give Sasin this letter?

451
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,410
Don't let my dad see it.

452
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,710
Why do you need to send a secret letter?

453
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,970
Why don't you go and see him with us?

454
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,490
I…

455
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,090
I can't.

456
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,070
Or…

457
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,860
You

458
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,050
and Sasin?

459
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,050
Stop asking.

460
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,210
Just give him the letter.

461
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,250
Why is it turned out to be this way?

462
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,730
I'm sorry.

463
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,130
Am I disappointed you?

464
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,490
Sir?

465
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,890
When you're with Sasin

466
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,570
are you happy?

467
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,610
He is my only happiness.

468
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,650
I've never expected anything from you.

469
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,850
I just wish

470
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,250
for your happiness, that's all.

471
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,370
But my dad found out about us.

472
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,370
He is the one who hurt Sasin.

473
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,210
What's that?

474
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,010
Oh my goodness,

475
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,530
my poor little prince.

476
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,930
I'm happy to see you're getting better.

477
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,650
Thank you so much for coming.

478
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,430
Well…

479
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,490
how's Saenkaew?

480
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,210
He's not feeling well so he can't be here.

481
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,570
You need to get well soon.

482
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,290
My wedding is coming closer.

483
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,730
You need to play in my
wedding like you promised.

484
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,050
Did you remember the gunman?

485
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,570
So you can tell the police
and he will be punished.

486
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,730
It's so dark.

487
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,130
I didn't prepare for it.

488
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,450
I couldn't see anything.

489
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,290
That's too bad.

490
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,830
He looks a little bit tired.

491
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,090
Should we let him rest
so he will recover soon?

492
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,930
That's good. I'll be back.

493
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,610
I gotta go.

494
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,460
My dear Sasin,

495
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,130
While I am writing this,

496
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,650
I really hope it can be just
a normal letter from lovers,

497
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,450
not a hidden letter,

498
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,610
not a letter full of
restrictions and limits.

499
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,970
But we both know it
can't be that type of letter.

500
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,250
My dad forbids me from seeing you.

501
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,690
But nobody can forbid me from loving you.

502
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,290
I'm still here and I still love you.

503
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,810
If you feel like you're
tortured all by yourself,

504
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,250
please know that I feel the same.

505
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,610
Please wait for me.

506
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:23,450
I will wait for you and I won't give up.

507
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,010
I won't let what we have

508
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,770
to end just because
others say that it's wrong.

509
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:34,810
I'll find my way back to you,
no matter how hard the road is.

510
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,330
Please trust me

511
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,730
like I've always trusted you.

512
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,530
We will be back together again.

513
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,510
I promise.

514
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,290
Love you the most.

515
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,170
Your Saenkaew.

516
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:51,810
I'm sorry.

517
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,250
Watch where you're going, okay?

518
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,670
Nual!

519
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,930
My... Sasin.
