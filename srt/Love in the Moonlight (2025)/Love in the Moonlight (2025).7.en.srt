"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 7)

2
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,610
Snake!

3
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,690
Watch out!

4
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,770
- What is it?
- Snake!

5
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,990
It's not a snake.

6
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,370
It's just a rope.

7
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,090
- I thought it was a snake.
- What snake?

8
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,970
You scared me.

9
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,170
What if it bites you?

10
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,090
Hey!

11
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,790
You have something to tell me?

12
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,250
What?

13
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I…

14
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,130
- Earlier, I…
- Nope.

15
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,650
I'm talking about your plan to help me

16
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,450
to avoid marrying Pin.

17
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,550
Right.

18
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,010
About that,

19
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,850
I think we should hire someone to

20
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,020
sign a marriage certificate
with you, instead of Pin.

21
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,090
We can make an honest deal with her

22
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,970
that you need this to transfer your assets.

23
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,650
This is not about love.

24
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,650
How can we trust her

25
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,670
that she'd transfer assets back to me?

26
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm worried about that too.

27
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,210
So I'd like to suggest Ms. Rachawadee.
We can trust her.

28
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,930
She will be back from Penang in two days.

29
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,050
We can ask her.

30
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,010
My dad won't let it happen.

31
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,050
Don't lose your hope just yet. We can talk.

32
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,850
We should go to see Ms. Rachawadee
when we go back to Bangkok.

33
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,410
So we can figure something out.

34
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,730
Actually, if this is your plan

35
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,690
you can just wait for me to go back.

36
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,570
You're right.

37
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
But I don't know why.

38
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,410
I wanted to see your face.

39
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,690
What're you talking about?

40
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,610
We see each others almost every day.

41
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,530
Have you ever heard of this poem?

42
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,610
The sun is shining bright during the day

43
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,130
but without seeing your
face, it suddenly gets dark.

44
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,410
The moon is shining bright during the night

45
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,010
but without seeing your face,
my heart suddenly turns black.

46
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,770
Nonsense.

47
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,130
What're you talking
about? Let's just go to bed.

48
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,550
It should be boats
coming by in the morning.

49
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,770
Sir?

50
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,210
What's the update? Did you see him?

51
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,090
We asked villagers around here

52
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,610
and nobody saw Prince Saenkaew.

53
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,490
Where is he?

54
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,170
What if Kalong and Prince
Inthorn abducted him?

55
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,330
What're we gonna do?

56
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,770
What? Kalong abducted Saenkaew?

57
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,890
Is it true?

58
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,410
Saenkaew! You poor thing!

59
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,070
Saenkaew! Oh my goodness!

60
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,090
- Grandma? What's going on?
- Help!

61
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,330
Inthorn and Kalong abducted Saenkaew.

62
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,810
- I can barely breath!
- Grandma, let's go inside.

63
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,890
I can't believe it.

64
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,770
Since when was he gone?

65
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,270
I don't know either.

66
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,850
I went to see him last
night and he was gone.

67
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,730
It must be Kalong who took Saenkaew.

68
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,010
I think we should go to the police.

69
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,090
Who's out there? Prepare
a car for me, I'm going out.

70
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,630
What's going on?

71
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,730
Saenkaew has been gone since last night.

72
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,130
Grandma is worried that
Prince Inthorn could take him.

73
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,050
Hurry up! We should ask the police to help.

74
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,970
Everyone, please calm down.

75
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,930
Prince Inthorn didn't
take Saenkaew anywhere.

76
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,210
You know where he is?

77
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,250
I don't know where he is

78
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,730
but I'm sure that Prince
Inthorn didn't take him.

79
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,050
I saw he hopped on a
boat with Sasin last night.

80
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,230
Sasin is here?

81
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,770
You scared me.

82
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,410
If Saenkaew was out with
Sasin, then we don't have to worry.

83
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,290
He must be going out like other young men.

84
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,140
He'll be back soon.

85
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,690
Sasin visits Hua Hin all the time.

86
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,530
He knows his way around.

87
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,490
Sasin is such a bad influence.

88
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,830
I told him to watch the
house and he came here.

89
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,570
I need to talk to him when I see him.

90
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,310
- Over here!
- Help!

91
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,570
This way!

92
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,290
Help! Help us!

93
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,850
We are here!

94
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,170
Over here!

95
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,690
- Help!
- This way!

96
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,520
This way!

97
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,850
This way!

98
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,230
The boat is gone! What do we do now?

99
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,290
They must be worried about me.

100
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,450
We can do nothing.

101
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,530
We just need to wait for
another one to come by.

102
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,010
- Trust me.
- You told me this last night.

103
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,370
So many boats coming and going.

104
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,050
Someone'd help us. See?

105
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,130
Do you see any boat coming for us?

106
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,810
Should we walk to the other side?

107
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,900
I was there earlier and it's so pretty.

108
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,410
- Perhaps there are more boats on the other side.
- Nope.

109
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,410
Come on, let's just walk there.

110
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,210
We can enjoy the path to calm down.

111
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,210
- It's better than being stressed out like this.
- Hey!

112
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,930
How could I calm down?

113
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,050
My grandma has a heart condition.

114
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,930
If she's worried about me and she got sick,
what's gonna happen?

115
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,090
And my dad.

116
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,370
- He must be furious that I'm gone.
- Hey.

117
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,850
Please calm down.

118
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,730
We still can't get out of here
even if you're so stressed out.

119
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,050
Of course you don't have to.

120
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,630
Nobody is waiting for you, you don't
have to be responsible for anyone.

121
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,410
You don't have to carry the
future of your family like me.

122
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,490
We got stuck in this place

123
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,690
it's all because of your stupid plan!

124
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,170
I'm sorry

125
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,530
that you got stuck with
a careless guy like me.

126
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,890
But we have no choice.

127
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,040
I'd rather swim in the
ocean back to the place

128
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,970
than being here with someone like you.

129
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Fine!

130
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,250
Just take a walk to cool thing off!

131
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,450
I'll find something for us to eat.

132
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,850
He's still mad? He could
be so hungry by now.

133
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,240
I'd rather swim in the
ocean back to the place

134
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,210
than being here with someone like you.

135
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,370
I hope he won't do anything stupid.

136
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,530
Saenkaew!

137
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,930
Saenkaew!

138
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,090
Prince Saenkaew!

139
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,890
Oh no!

140
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,610
Saenkaew!

141
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Saenkaew!

142
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,190
Saenkaew!

143
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,210
We still can't get out of here
even if you're so stressed out.

144
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,490
Of course you don't have to.

145
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,530
Nobody is waiting for you.

146
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,050
No! Saenkaew!

147
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,210
You don't have to be
responsible for anyone.

148
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,930
Saenkaew!

149
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,810
You don't have to carry the
future of your family like me.

150
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,850
We got stuck in this place

151
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,250
it's all because of your stupid plan!

152
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,610
I'd rather swim in the
ocean back to the place

153
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,610
than being here with someone like you.

154
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,170
Saenkaew! Please be all right!

155
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,830
Saenkaew!

156
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,870
Hey!

157
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,170
Hey!

158
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,090
What're you doing in the sea?

159
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,170
Catching some fish?

160
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,490
I thought you swam back.

161
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,090
I won't do anything crazy like that.

162
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,430
I would drown and die for nothing.

163
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,050
I just find a place to rest

164
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,010
so I wouldn't take it out on you again.

165
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,810
I'm sorry for my behavior earlier.

166
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,250
What're you doing?

167
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,850
I'm sorry.

168
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,250
I thought you were drowning.

169
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,630
I was afraid that I couldn't save you.

170
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,850
You don't have to be that upsetting.

171
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,410
I'm not crazy enough to swim back.

172
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,830
- Hey!
- I thought I've lost you.

173
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,450
It's just a split second
that I couldn't find you

174
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,970
I've never feared about
anything like this before.

175
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,690
It made me realize

176
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,290
my feeling to you

177
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,170
and how much of it.

178
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,770
What're you trying to say?

179
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I love you,

180
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Saenkaew.

181
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,770
Stop making jokes already.

182
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,930
I don't know when it started

183
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,850
but I just feel it.

184
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,970
I'm happy when you smile.

185
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,730
I'm in pain when you get hurt.

186
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,370
I'm in sorrow when I don't see your face.

187
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,490
I want to protect you, be by your side.

188
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,310
You make me crazy like this,

189
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,500
if this isn't love, then
I don't know what it is.

190
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,210
How do you feel about me?

191
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,570
It's impossible.

192
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,290
- You don't have any feeling for me?
- Stop pushing me already!

193
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,570
I told you that it was impossible.

194
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,210
It's impossible because you feel nothing,

195
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,290
or that we're both men

196
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,810
or because of society

197
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,090
- or because of your dad.
- All of it!

198
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,330
How I feel about you

199
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,130
means nothing.

200
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,330
Society won't accept anything like this.

201
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,030
What about my dad?

202
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,570
He expects me to be a leader

203
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,930
to take care of the family after him.

204
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,210
But look at me.

205
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,850
I can't even be

206
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,330
a normal and simple man for him.

207
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,210
Listen to me.

208
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,330
We can't decide who to love

209
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,610
in this world

210
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,170
or how our love should be like.

211
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,570
You have a chance to be happy

212
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,890
for yourself

213
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,810
not to carry the pride

214
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,050
and expectations from your dad.

215
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,970
But my happiness

216
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,610
and being myself hurt people.

217
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,610
It hurts people I love.

218
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,930
It's not true.

219
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,450
You're just being yourself.

220
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,970
You're not hurting anyone.

221
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
Sasin.

222
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,250
Saenkaew.

223
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,410
I love you.

224
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,490
Please don't worry about it.

225
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,410
At least, we know that

226
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,510
Kalong didn't take him anywhere.

227
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,130
I'd rather have Kalong taken him.

228
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,330
At least we can negotiate to get him back.

229
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,490
But it turned out this way.

230
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,030
Sasin is a really good man.

231
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,650
He was getting close to Prince Saenkaew

232
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,450
because he saw that the
prince was all by himself.

233
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,030
He wanted to help out

234
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,450
and there's nothing more.

235
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,170
I don't know if he'd think about anything.

236
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,700
But Saenkaew's feeling, that I know of.

237
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,530
After he's back,

238
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,610
you need to watch him.

239
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,210
Don't let him be around Sasin anymore.

240
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,170
You haven't told me that you love me.

241
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,330
Isn't it obvious? Do I have to?

242
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,930
You haven't told me yet.

243
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,130
I want to hear it, can you say it?

244
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,930
Saying that this Little Rabbit

245
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,970
loves you so much.

246
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,770
Goosebumps!

247
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,490
Who'd say that?

248
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,090
It's fine if you don't say it now.

249
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,370
When we're done handling
the cancellation of the wedding,

250
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,530
I will make you say it to me every day.

251
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,090
What's wrong?

252
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,330
I'm worried about Pin.

253
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,090
She must be devastated when she found out.

254
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,850
She must be.

255
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,250
I did the wrong thing to her.

256
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,650
But if I let her marry you,

257
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,970
she will be sad and

258
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,370
in so much pain.

259
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,650
Don't worry.

260
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,290
I think she'll understand.

261
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,650
This is the last clean water,

262
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,930
you should drink it.

263
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,730
You should drink it. I'm fine.

264
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,330
We don't know how long we're
gonna stay here, you should drink it.

265
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,710
Let's share.

266
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,290
If I need water, so do you.

267
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,970
Here.

268
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,030
How's the fish? Is it cooked?

269
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,770
Not yet.

270
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,970
I think the fire isn't strong enough.

271
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,730
I think there's no more left.

272
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,850
Really? Still hot.

273
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,210
I don't think so.

274
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,130
What? You're teasing me?

275
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,530
No, I'm not.

276
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,530
- Then why're you laughing?
- I'm not.

277
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,010
You're teasing me, right?

278
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,030
I tried to help! Watch out for the fish.

279
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,770
- Hey!
- Come back here!

280
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,770
- I'm gonna grill you instead of fish!
- Don't!

281
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,770
- No! It's hot!
- Get back down.

282
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,690
Why do we need a coconut for?

283
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,810
You can drink coconut water.

284
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,610
We can survive out of this.

285
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Come here.

286
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,050
Uncle?

287
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,410
I'd like to apologize to you

288
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,370
that Sasin caused some troubles.

289
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,410
It's not your fault.

290
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,250
It's my son's fault.

291
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,690
He had no self-control.

292
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,490
But you can relieve

293
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,970
that Sasin is there with Saenkaew.

294
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,420
I'm sure that Sasin will
take a good care of him.

295
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,610
Sir?

296
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
How is it?

297
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,850
A fisherman just got back and he said that

298
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,190
he took his boat passed the
abandoned island in the north.

299
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,850
He saw smoke by the beach.

300
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,770
It's possible that they could hide there.

301
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,850
Find me a boat to that island.

302
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,850
- I'll drag him back here.
- Yes, sir.

303
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,850
Beautiful moon tonight.

304
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,730
When I was a kid,

305
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,030
my mom often told me a story
about a rabbit in the moon.

306
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,030
It said that in the moon

307
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,580
there was a rabbit living in a glass house.

308
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,330
He needed to open and close each window

309
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,650
to let moonlight shining to the earth.

310
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,990
It's related to the moon's phases.

311
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,850
You're such a romantic person.

312
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,250
It's just like us.

313
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,650
My name means the moon, you know?

314
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,830
And you're a rabbit.

315
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,580
Rabbit belongs to the moon

316
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,330
just like you belong to me forever.

317
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,930
But we need to go back.

318
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,580
You don't want to go back?

319
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,170
We can stay here.

320
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,650
We can do that?

321
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,930
Sure, we can hide here.

322
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,410
I'll catch the fish

323
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,810
and climb coconut trees.

324
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,330
You? Really?

325
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,170
You would play music all day
and I'll be starved to death.

326
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,370
Let me feed you.

327
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,170
You're feeding me?

328
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,730
Right, someone like me.

329
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,370
Well, I

330
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,150
can shoot, ride horses,

331
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,410
and hunting animals, I can do it all.

332
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,490
Fine, I trust you.

333
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,770
Then you can feeding us.

334
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,690
And I will play music

335
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,730
and sing songs when
you're tired, sounds good?

336
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,210
That's it?

337
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,570
What else do you want me to do?

338
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,330
You're taking advantage of me.

339
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,010
It can be just a dream.

340
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,090
We're not like others.

341
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,370
Hey,

342
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,210
how are we not like others?

343
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,450
We're just two people who are in love.

344
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,290
You don't know my dad.

345
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,450
He can do anything.

346
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,530
He won't let this happen.

347
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,030
Your dad doesn't know me.

348
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,210
I will do anything for us to stay together.

349
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,370
Trust me.

350
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,810
It's getting wet, let's
head back to the cottage.

351
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,250
Hey! That's light from a boat!

352
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,550
You're right!

353
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,530
This way!

354
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,170
We're here! This way!

355
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,390
Help!

356
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,410
We're gonna go back.

357
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,820
You don't want to go back?

358
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,970
We can stay here.

359
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,130
It's your call.

360
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,170
I'm happy that I have you.

361
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,690
We can hide forever.

362
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,610
And you told me

363
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,130
that you'd do anything
for us to stay together.

364
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,890
I trust you.

365
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,380
This way!

366
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,280
- We're here!
- Over here!

367
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,690
- Over here!
- Help!

368
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,250
- Help!
- This way!

369
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,370
This way!

370
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
Dad?

371
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,450
- Grandma?
- Saenkaew.

372
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,210
Why did you go out without
telling anyone like this?

373
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,770
Everyone was worried about you.

374
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,330
I'm sorry about that.

375
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:32,950
I'm sorry everyone.

376
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,850
You two are all right, aren't you?

377
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,430
We're fine.

378
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,050
I'm sorry on behalf of Sasin for causing

379
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,850
everyone to worry about Prince Saenkaew.

380
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,930
You need to apologize to
his dad and grandma now.

381
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,030
I'm sorry.

382
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,170
It's all my fault.

383
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,970
- I forced Saenkaew to run away with me…
- Stop talking.

384
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,510
Saenkaew!

385
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
Let's go.

386
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,050
I have to.

387
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,730
I don't want you to
misunderstand the whole thing

388
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,930
and punish him.

389
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,010
Saenkaew didn't do anything wrong.

390
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,730
Sasin!

391
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,490
- You need to go back now.
- But I…

392
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,690
Go!

393
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,610
You want Prince Kamfah
to be more furious than this?

394
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,250
Next time, when I ask you to do something

395
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,290
you need to follow my orders, you hear me?

396
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,730
You're so useless.

397
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,370
I'll wait in Bangkok.

398
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,650
What did you do? You're gone for two days
and two nights with him.

399
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,310
I went out to talk to
Sasin about something.

400
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,210
And there was a storm
so we got stuck there.

401
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,170
Your something?

402
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,810
About canceling the wedding?

403
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,970
Why did you even bother to ask?

404
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,450
Saenkaew!

405
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,250
You talked back to me now?

406
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,810
Sasin taught you, didn't he?

407
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,250
What's going on between you two?

408
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,930
Tell me!

409
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,410
Did you sleep with him already?

410
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,690
Why didn't you say something?

411
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,310
Say something!

412
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,610
If not, then just say no.

413
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,490
I don't want to talk about it.

414
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,330
Dueanpradap

415
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,770
our son is leading to the wrong path.

416
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,250
If someone finds out about him,

417
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,970
how could he live?

418
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,530
Everyone will turn against him.

419
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,370
I don't want that for him.

420
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,650
How can I save our son?

421
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,850
It seemed like Prince
Kamfah really disliked Sasin.

422
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:19,650
And you're surprised?

423
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,450
Sasin is so annoying all the
time. He likes to tease people.

424
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,730
It's not only him,

425
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,170
I get mad just to look at his face.

426
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,880
But I think it's not just that.

427
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,650
It must be something more.

428
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,620
- Be careful.
- Okay.

429
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,730
Mr. Sasin?

430
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,040
Where're you heading to?

431
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,250
To see Saenkaew.

432
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,550
Did his dad punish him?

433
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,690
He didn't do anything.

434
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,170
But I think you

435
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,730
better stay away from him.

436
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,210
Why's that?

437
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,210
You just ran away with him.

438
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,850
I think you should wait
until things are cooling off.

439
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,610
You should go back to your place.

440
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,150
Please?

441
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,310
Sasin?

442
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,530
Saenkaew?

443
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,030
I think we should go inside.

444
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,020
Are you okay?

445
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,610
Did your dad hit you anywhere?

446
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,370
- Did he abuse you?
- Hey, calm down.

447
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,760
I'm fine.

448
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,610
My dad was furious.

449
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,610
We shouldn't see each other for a while.

450
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,130
I will ask Ms. Rachawadee

451
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,050
about marriage certificate

452
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,410
and to transfer your
assets as soon as possible.

453
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,530
If it goes well, no one can stop us.

454
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,680
Please keep me posted.

455
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,420
I gotta go.

456
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,740
Hey!

457
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,080
What?

458
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,690
I think I was clear.

459
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,930
- If my dad finds out…
- But I missed you.

460
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,730
You don't miss me at all?

461
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,170
Not at all.

462
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,930
So mean.

463
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,530
Why do I have to fall in
love with someone mean

464
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,610
like you?

465
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,690
Ms. Pin, what're you doing?

466
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,650
Can I help you?

467
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,770
Thank you.

468
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,010
So pretty.

469
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,210
Do you have any idea
why Saenkaew's dad didn't like Sasin much?

470
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,450
He didn't like it when
they hung out together.

471
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,370
Ms. Pin,

472
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,930
why're you asking me that?

473
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,010
We will get married soon

474
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,130
when we live together

475
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,410
I don't want Saenkaew's
dad to have beef with Sasin.

476
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,330
I don't think you should worry about it.

477
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,810
Don't dwell on it.

478
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,530
When you two get married,

479
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:40,210
things will get better.

480
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,180
Sasin?

481
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:06,690
Sasin?

482
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,310
Pin?

483
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,810
Sasin?

484
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,710
Sasin?
