"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 4)

2
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,201
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,000
Calm down.

4
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,911
Easy there, just get up.

5
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,291
Just calm down.

6
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:15,338
Sorry.

7
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,064
It's okay.

8
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,201
Where is this place?

9
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,920
Ms. Rachawadee's house.

10
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,160
You had a high fever last night

11
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,920
and passed out on the side of the road.

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,500
So I took you here to rest.

13
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,040
What did you uncle do to you last night?

14
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:51,120
He started the fight like usual.

15
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
He doesn't like my family that much.

16
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,960
He have had arguments
with my father for such a long time.

17
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:02,280
But he followed you from Chansaeng to Bangkok

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,760
he must have hated you so much.

19
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,200
Your family got more problems than I thought.

20
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,760
It's more complicated when

21
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,120
we got more money and higher reputation.

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,960
If I wasn't born as Prince Kamfah's son,

23
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,560
my life would have been much easier.

24
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,200
Well, if something is bothering your mind,

25
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
you can talk to me from now on.

26
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,480
Talk to you?

27
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,750
That's right, talk to me.

28
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,840
I know that I'm just a low-income musician,

29
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,951
but,

30
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,840
it's better than keeping it to yourself.

31
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:07,824
Thank you.

32
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:33,158
Right,

33
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:35,080
you guys are up.

34
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
You hungry? I finished cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,391
Let's eat.

36
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:58,280
Thank you for letting me stay for a night.

37
00:04:58,503 --> 00:04:59,801
And you cooked for me.

38
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,120
Don't mention it.

39
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,920
Sasin spends the night here all the time.

40
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
He does, huh?

41
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,071
You surprised?

42
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:11,200
It's not like that.

43
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,100
We're just friends.

44
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,720
After work, musicians at the bar like

45
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,521
to hang out here and sleep over.

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
Sasin is single.

47
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm wondering

48
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,040
who would win a heart of my hot violinist.

49
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,100
I think

50
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,100
he's better off single.

51
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,600
- I feel sorry for his future lover.
- Hey! You!

52
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,101
Just eat, okay?

53
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,991
Add this too.

54
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,920
Stop mocking me.

55
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:57,964
Thanks.

56
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,650
- Some pepper?
- Just a little.

57
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:04,840
That's enough.

58
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,680
Is he gonna be okay?

59
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,760
Such irresponsible young man.

60
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,280
He's here.

61
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,138
Grandma.

62
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,361
Where have you been all night?

63
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,500
I was worried sick about you.

64
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,920
I didn't feel well and I couldn't make it home.

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,200
- Are you feeling better? You want to see a doctor?
- That's right.

66
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,441
Saenkaew had high fever last night. Now he's fine.

67
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm sorry for not calling Pin last night to tell her

68
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,360
that Saenkaew was with me.

69
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,841
You spent the night with Pin's cousin?

70
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,440
Kamsu! How did you get here?

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,480
Kamsu was here since last night.

72
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:10,280
Actually, he called to tell me that he'd be in Bangkok.

73
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,760
But I forgot to tell everyone.

74
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,931
Sir?

75
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Why did you have to spend a night with a man?

76
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:34,897
If your dad found out about this…

77
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,360
There was nothing going on.

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,760
I told you that I met Uncle Inthorn,

79
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,520
and Sasin came to rescue then
he took me to his friend's house.

80
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:46,484
Can you keep it down?

81
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:49,520
Kamsu,

82
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,120
what we need to worry right now is

83
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,497
figuring out what Prince Inthorn is after,

84
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,480
not picking on Prince Saenkaew like this.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,440
Prince Inthorn has nothing to worry about,

86
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:02,400
but this is what we should be worried about.

87
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,000
Sir? You shouldn't get closer to that guy.

88
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,520
If you caused a scandal,

89
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,440
- it could lead to your dad.
- Hey, you crossed the line.

90
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,800
I know my duties.

91
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,581
I need to protect the family's assets,

92
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:22,680
and my dad's dignity.

93
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,200
I know I'm not his perfect son,

94
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,800
but you should respect me.

95
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,840
I'm just doing my job.

97
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,840
And I hope that

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,320
you should do yours as well.

99
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,640
How dare you, Kamsu!

100
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,451
How could you talk to him like that?

101
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,931
Kamsu!

102
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm just doing my job.

103
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,480
- Prince Kamfah sent me here to take care of him.
- Take care?

104
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,800
You're trying to pick on him.

105
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,900
You know it well that Prince Saenkaew

106
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,120
have behaved and been well-mannered

107
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,600
since forever, he has never caused any trouble.

108
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
That's when he was in Chansaeng.

109
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
We're in Bangkok, far away from Prince Kamfah.

110
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,440
Prince Saenkaew could behave loosely.

111
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,080
If someone found out about him,

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
we all could be in big trouble.

113
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,024
Kamsu!

114
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,891
Kamsu!

115
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,120
If we found out about Prince Saenkaew, they'd be in trouble?

116
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
What is that?

117
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,458
I have no idea, but not in a positive way for sure.

118
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,760
I won't let our palace to be ruined.

119
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,081
Just being in a relationship with a homeless prince

120
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,320
is humiliating enough.

121
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,760
I think having scandal

122
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,600
could be a good thing.

123
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
We could seize their engagement offerings

124
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
and dowry, all of them.

125
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:23,680
They can get married.

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,280
When we receive their assets,

127
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,960
we can tell them to go home.

128
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,280
Homeless princes.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,001
First of all,

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,920
we need to find out what Prince Saenkaew is hiding.

131
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:55,560
Last night, I saw him around here.

132
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,100
I don't know whom he was supposed to meet.

133
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,280
They're gonna meet again today?

134
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,041
Nope.

135
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,551
What?

136
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,840
Nope? Why are we here for?

137
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:09,178
Well…

138
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,320
Just in case they'd meet again today.

139
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Come on, my baby

140
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,200
what do you expect me to do? This is all I got.

141
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:21,480
Please give me your beautiful smile.

142
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,320
Let's look at the other side.

143
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,160
Wait for me.

144
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:40,760
I'm here.

145
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:43,200
- I'm here.
- Sasin!

146
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:46,400
- You're always late.
- Well, I'm here now.

147
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,640
Let's get going.

148
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,418
Where're you going?

149
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,600
Well, Pin invited Saenkaew to watch a movie.

150
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,360
And they're gonna hang out later.

151
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm forced to drive them around.

152
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,200
You shouldn't have troubled Mr. Sasin.

153
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,760
Let me drive you.

154
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:25,320
It's not a trouble at all.

155
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,840
We're close,

156
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,241
right?

157
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,281
Tell him.

158
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,920
I should drive.

159
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,640
Ms. Pin can tell me where to go.

160
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:41,978
Sir?

161
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,720
Why don't you tell him that I can drive you?

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,080
Well, then…

163
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,480
if you really want to drive,

164
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,364
here's the key.

165
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,120
Pin, let's sit in the back with me.

166
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,391
Thanks.

167
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,801
Wait, wait!

168
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,040
I drive them so you don't have to go.

169
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,520
Why's that?

170
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
We've planned it.

171
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,250
Saenkaew, get in.

172
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,120
Drive safe, okay?

173
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,200
Okay.

174
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,200
You haven't been to Banglamphu, have you?

175
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,080
I haven't. This is my first time.

176
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,570
That one is cute.

177
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,880
Pin, let's see this.

178
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,640
Pin?

179
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,650
They sell many cool stuff, let's see.

180
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:39,680
You don't have to get this close.

181
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:40,898
Sir?

182
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,320
Should we go now?

183
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,120
Uncle Kamsu, we just got here.

184
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm worried about Princess Sridara.

185
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,840
She said that she didn't feel well this morning.

186
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:03,160
That's so boring. He's following us like we're prisoners.

187
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,081
Wait for me by the road in the back, okay?

188
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,360
- What're you doing?
- Come on, trust me.

189
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:16,880
Are you hungry?

190
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,500
Not really.

191
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,080
- But there are so many good foods here.
- When I say to run,

192
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
- you need to run.
- What?

193
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,640
Prince Inthorn's here!

194
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,040
- Prince Inthorn?
- Run!

195
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:31,480
Prince Saenkaew?

196
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:41,483
Prince Saenkaew?

197
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,600
What the heck are you doing?

198
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,721
Run away from a prison guard.

199
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,680
Kamsu's gonna scold me for sure.

200
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,871
Where're you going?

201
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,120
To see Kamsu, we should stop.

202
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:04,160
You can't! Kamsu will kill me.

203
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,231
No, he's gonna be mad at me.

204
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,360
- Let's go, it's fine.
- Prince Saenkaew!

205
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,804
Go home!

206
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,880
What're you doing?

207
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:19,920
- Hurry up!
- Mr. Sasin!

208
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,560
You can't do that.

209
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,160
- Come on!
- Stop!

210
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,223
Stop!

211
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,681
Stop!

212
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,291
Stop!

213
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:33,952
Why're you acting like this?

214
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:41,558
Let's go.

215
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,500
Hurry up!

216
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,160
Hey! You broke all my eggs, where're you going?

217
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,440
Pay for my eggs.

218
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,024
Hey!

219
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,201
Hey!

220
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,240
Stop! I can't breathe.

221
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,404
Hey!

222
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,720
I'll have a fight with Kamsu later for sure,
he looks so furious.

223
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,720
He should be, did you see that?

224
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,960
He's covered in eggs, such a big mess.

225
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,571
You're right.

226
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,104
Kamsu,

227
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:27,324
you poor thing.

228
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:37,518
I like that.

229
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:41,419
What?

230
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,160
I like that you laugh and smile like this.

231
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,360
It's better than being stressed out, you know?

232
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,321
That's right.

233
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,560
Actually, I almost forgot

234
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
when was the last time I laughed like this.

235
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,840
You're here.

236
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:34,644
Pin?

237
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:38,520
You caused troubles again.

238
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,840
What should we do next?

239
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,801
What do you think?

240
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,100
We can follow our original plan.

241
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:46,958
Let's go.

242
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,731
Follow me.

243
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:51,923
Let's go.

244
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,404
Let's go.

245
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,004
So good.

246
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,760
I told you that this is good.

247
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,801
You need something to drink?

248
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,481
I'll get something for us.

249
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,401
Wait here.

250
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm the happiest girl.

251
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,324
I feel like

252
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

253
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,840
I have super nice cousin

254
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,600
and the best fiancé.

255
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,400
I want all three of us to stay like this forever.

256
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,344
I'm back.

257
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,104
Thanks.

258
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,511
For you.

259
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,761
Thank you.

260
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:17,000
It's not that good, that one.

261
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:19,120
- Why's that?
- Just kidding.

262
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,691
Welcome home.

263
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:07,797
- I need to wash my face, I'm sweating.
- Sure.

264
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,561
You know that I need to report your dad about this, right?

265
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,640
Go ahead.

266
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
I also want to know what did I do wrong?

267
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,561
You can't.

268
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,800
Why would you want his dad to be mad at him?

269
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,360
This is nothing.

270
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,160
You shouldn't have been
so close to Mr. Sasin in the first place.

271
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,771
Kamsu.

272
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:58,604
Why do you make such a big deal

273
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,681
if he wants to have a friend?

274
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:08,320
- Homthip, take him to his room.
- Yes, ma'am.

275
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,040
Follow me.

276
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,971
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,541
Tell me

278
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,000
why can't they be friends?

279
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,760
Prince Kamfah sent me to take care of his son.

280
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,200
I need to stop what could be a problem

281
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,001
to this marriage.

282
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,241
How could Sasin be a trouble in this marriage?

283
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,421
He's Pin's cousin.

284
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,200
Distant cousin.

285
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,900
Prince Bodin and his wife didn't even call him a relative.

286
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,320
Why're you so attached to the titles?

287
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,760
We don't even have our land to live.

288
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,080
We need to stay in others' place.

289
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm afraid that he could be bad influence to Prince Saenkaew.

290
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:14,680
You saw that

291
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,240
he took Prince Saenkaew to run away with him.

292
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,160
Prince Saenkaew never behaved like this back home.

293
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,901
- When he met Mr. Sasin…
- Kamsu

294
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,881
since his mom passed away,

295
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:33,680
I've never seen him smile.

296
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,760
He now has a friend, he smiles,

297
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,300
and he laughs like he used to.

298
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:45,280
Don't you want him to be happy?

299
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,280
I understand you.

300
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,281
I also want him to be happy.

301
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:02,720
But it could be a trouble if we let this slide.

302
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,640
Explain to me,

303
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,761
what could be a big damage

304
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
if they become friends?

305
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:20,080
See? You can't tell me.

306
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,801
You just have an attitude towards Sasin.

307
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:26,500
If you still care about me,

308
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,720
don't let his dad know about this.

309
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,441
Kamfah has a lot on his plate.

310
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:37,018
He doesn't need to know about this nonsense.

311
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,881
You're back?

312
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:06,100
You're gonna lecture me about running away
from Kamsu, aren't you?

313
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,357
Why would I do that?

314
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,840
He's too strict and this is fine.

315
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,320
We're in Bangkok,

316
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,921
not a savage land like Chansaeng.

317
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,922
Why did they need that much protection?

318
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,721
Well,

319
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:39,720
what did Prince Saenkaew and Kamsu talk about?

320
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:44,320
They didn't talk much.

321
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,360
But I feel like

322
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,360
Kamsu doesn't really like Sasin.

323
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:55,480
I guess it's because Sasin likes to tease people.

324
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,040
Duangkamol?

325
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,200
You can't take a nap here.

326
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,200
Help me look if Saenkaew comes here to see his woman.

327
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:21,440
Oh, come on!

328
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,920
We watched him all day yesterday and we got nothing.

329
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,601
What do you want me to do?

330
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:31,682
I'm tired too.

331
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,640
- Duangkamol!
- What?

332
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,360
That woman.

333
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,080
- Which one?
- The one standing in front of a pawn shop.

334
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
It's her.

335
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,400
That woman? Really?

336
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,360
Your nephew has such a strange taste.

337
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:22,640
I can't blame him, we have different definition of beauty.

338
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,720
I think we should ask her about it.

339
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:30,080
Excuse me, bill please?

340
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:34,078
15 baht.

341
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:35,650
Right, just a second.

342
00:28:42,357 --> 00:28:43,320
Wait.

343
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:47,200
Isn't that Songsawat?

344
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,200
Yes, a sexy star.

345
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,600
Isn't she the Field Marshal's latest mistress?

346
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:59,760
That's right, they said that he fell head over heels for her.

347
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:11,360
Lucky her.

348
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:22,280
Saenkaew is quite something.

349
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,041
He looks so innocent.

350
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,522
But he's having an affair with the Field Marshal's mistress.

351
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,911
Pin.

352
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,200
What're you doing here? Who do I need to get changed?

353
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:35,800
It'll be a big party at Rachawadee's night club.

354
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,000
Sasin said that I need to take you there.

355
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,321
What party?

356
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:51,520
So pretty.

357
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,600
How long have you been standing? Eat something?

358
00:30:57,703 --> 00:30:59,004
Not yet, I started to get tired.

359
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,200
Sasin is there, let's go.

360
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

361
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,600
Prince Saenkaew, Pin, I'm glad you two could make it.

362
00:31:18,217 --> 00:31:21,640
Sure. What's the party?

363
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,521
Can I get a big round of applause.

364
00:31:29,943 --> 00:31:31,720
Louder, please.

365
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,880
Thank you, thank you so much.

366
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:40,360
Everyone, the ceremony is about to begin.

367
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,800
Please welcome a bride,

368
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,320
and a bride,

369
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,000
Wassana and Khaekhai.

370
00:32:02,803 --> 00:32:05,560
Kiss her!

371
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,400
Kiss her!

372
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,600
More!

373
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,560
More!

374
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:23,320
More!

375
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,480
They have been in love for years

376
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,600
so Ms. Rachawadee organized the wedding reception for them.

377
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,320
Their families are fine with this?

378
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,360
Nope, that's why they needed to have it here.

379
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,320
So it's just a fake wedding.

380
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,480
Why did you say that?

381
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,680
You don't like it that they're in love?

382
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:01,482
Nope, just feel bad.

383
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,600
Their wedding only existed in a dream,

384
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,840
dream that can never come true.

385
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:11,241
I believe that it'll be true someday.

386
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,960
No matter who we love

387
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,000
or what gender we are, society will accept them one day.

388
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,320
They could get marriage certificate

389
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,320
and be legally bound.

390
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,880
How could it be possible? Only in a dream.

391
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,240
You insulted the dream again?

392
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,800
I just live in a real world.

393
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,880
For me, real world and dream are inseparable.

394
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,001
Think about it,

395
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:53,040
if we hadn't dreamed of flying like birds,

396
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,800
nobody would have come up with the idea of building a plane.

397
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,960
I don't want to be drowning in sorrow of reality.

398
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,920
I'd rather be dreaming and bringing it to life.

399
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:52,160
I need to rest.

400
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:53,798
Sure.

401
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,200
- Please take care of her.
- Sure.

402
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:00,960
- Pin…
- Pin, come on, let's dance.

403
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:05,100
Why don't you dance with me?

404
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:25,244
What?

405
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:31,518
Nope.

406
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,400
Come on, you're well-rested.

407
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,851
Come on.

408
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:40,160
Come here, let's go.

409
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,121
Chansaeng.

410
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,920
Saenkaew sneaked out to meet with Songsawat,
the Field Marshal's mistress?

411
00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:02,184
That's right.

412
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,240
I was wondering why he acted so suspicious.

413
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:09,520
Now I realized that he's having an affair
with the Field Marshal's mistress.

414
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,600
Well, such a player.

415
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
When did they meet?

416
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,320
- How did they start dating?
- Oh, come on

417
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,960
you don't have to worry about that.

418
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:24,800
Think about it, if this scandal leaks out,

419
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,520
Prince Bodin won't let his daughter marry Saenkaew for sure.

420
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,100
And the Field Marshal could be so furious

421
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,800
and send someone to shot him

422
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,041
for messing with his woman.

423
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,121
Two birds with one stone.

424
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:43,760
What about this? I will spread

425
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,400
this hot rumor around town. Sounds good?

426
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,120
Don't do anything stupid.

427
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,240
If this is not true,

428
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:54,160
it means that we're about to frame
the Field Marshal's woman,

429
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,721
and you will be in trouble. This could lead to me.

430
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,101
But I don't think

431
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,960
Saenkaew'd be stupid enough to date her.

432
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:08,800
If it's not about this, what else could it be?

433
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,400
It could be about

434
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,720
you causing a scene in the party,
and Prince Bodin was mad

435
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:15,720
so Saenkaew sought for help from somewhere else.

436
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:18,280
It…it's possible.

437
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,560
No matter what,

438
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:24,121
I still did a good job, didn't I?

439
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,360
You need to find out more about this,

440
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:32,960
about their plan.

441
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:36,440
Sure, I got you.

442
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,600
- Sir?
- Come on in.

443
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:16,040
What is it?

444
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,531
Sir?

445
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:20,120
I went to make merit this morning

446
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,760
and this woman told me
that she worked for Ms. Songsawat

447
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,961
and she asked me to give you this letter.

448
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,560
She asked to see me tonight.

449
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,240
Really?

450
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:48,120
But Kamsu is watching you so close like this

451
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,000
how do you plan to get out?

452
00:41:02,277 --> 00:41:03,840
Thank you so much, Mr. Consul.

453
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,920
If you hadn't helped me out,

454
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,360
I wouldn't have been able to
transfer my assets to my Thai bank accounts.

455
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,720
No worries, transferring assets in the bank

456
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,520
shouldn't be any trouble.

457
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,040
I wish you the best with your plan.

458
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

459
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,880
That was Mr. Consul, right?

460
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,400
You asked him to help
with transferring your assets, didn't you?

461
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,121
Someone tipped you off, huh?

462
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,280
Sorry,

463
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,840
you can't stop me this time.

464
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,080
Are you sure

465
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,960
that your son's fake wedding will be a success?

466
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:59,080
I hope that nobody messed it up so bad
that you needed someone to help you out.

467
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,681
You wouldn't think that I would let you embezzle

468
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,080
assets that are supposed to be belonged to nation easily.

469
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,520
You know movements from my side so well,

470
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,120
you got a spy, didn't you?

471
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,841
Is it Inthorn?

472
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,240
No wonder why a gambler like him

473
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,960
could cause a scene all the way in Bangkok.

474
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,880
You're desperate that much,
you need to use someone like Inthorn?

475
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:37,100
I could use anyone

476
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:39,600
to maintain nation benefits.

477
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,640
My brother betrayed his own blood.

478
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,700
You think he wouldn't betray you?

479
00:42:49,457 --> 00:42:50,680
People said that

480
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,840
sewage flows to septic tank.

481
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,360
I guess you and Inthorn get along really well.

482
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:31,000
What should we do? Kamsu is guarding the door

483
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,360
for hours now.

484
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:50,218
What should we do?

485
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,880
Mr. Kamsu, you have a long-distance call from Chansaeng.

486
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:15,000
Sir, we're clear.

487
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:16,144
You should go now.

488
00:44:31,623 --> 00:44:33,240
Prince Inthorn works for Kalong?

489
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:36,800
That's right. I should have known about it sooner.

490
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,400
Tell Saenkaew to be cautious.

491
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,971
Yes, sir.

492
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,010
I'll protecting him.

493
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,800
And I won't let Prince Inthorn do anything.

494
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,600
I don't think we have a problem about asset transferring.

495
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,000
I'll be there when it's done.

496
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,101
Take care of my son.

497
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,761
Yes, sir.

498
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,351
What is it?

499
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,000
Prince Kamfah called, I need to talk to Prince Saenkaew.

500
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:15,920
He's not feeling well. He said that he had a headache.

501
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,440
I gave him some pills and he just fell asleep.

502
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,320
Call me when he wakes up.

503
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,360
You all should spend the night here.

504
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,040
I told Dao to prepare a room for you.

505
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,700
Thank you.

506
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:50,680
You brought us liquor

507
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,240
- and you let us stay here.
- So very kind.

508
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,920
Now you're nice to me.

509
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,611
Sasin,

510
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,681
you should invite Prince Saenkaew to join us next time.

511
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,320
The more the merrier.

512
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,120
Sure, it will be fun.

513
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,760
Prince Saenkaew didn't get drunk easily.

514
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,800
- Really?
- You don't believe me, do you?

515
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:14,320
He looks so innocent but he's good at drinking.

516
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,800
We were so drunk, we barely stood up straight.

517
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,880
But Saenkaew's eyes were still bright.

518
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,530
He's totally fine.

519
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,720
And he likes to act too serious.

520
00:46:31,677 --> 00:46:32,678
He likes to act furious

521
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,720
hoping that others would be afraid of him.

522
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,080
Instead, he looks like a rabbit

523
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,921
and that's so funny.

524
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,560
It seems like you're so fond of Prince Saenkaew.

525
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,160
So much.

526
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,801
He talks about Prince Saenkaew nonstop.

527
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:58,280
Everyone falls for his charm.

528
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,721
Sasin,

529
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,520
you can't fall for his charm, okay?

530
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,840
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay?

531
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,240
- Don't fall for his charm.
- Are you drunk?

532
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:14,800
You're talking nonsense, here drink some more.

533
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,840
So you can be quiet.

534
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,301
Hello.

535
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:06,600
I talked to the Field Marshal and you can meet him.

536
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,800
I'll take you to see him on Saturdays.

537
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,000
Thank you so much.

538
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,280
You should go.

539
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,360
If someone see you with

540
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:21,520
a moralless sexy star like me,
your reputation will be damaged.

541
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,601
Wait,

542
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,920
is something bothering you?

543
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,520
You can tell me.

544
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,680
I'm such a bad person,

545
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,560
my face was so grumpy that you could tell.

546
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,121
It's okay.

547
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,081
So what is bothering you?

548
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,563
My little brother is getting married.

549
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,171
There're just the two of us.

550
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:04,500
But I don't think I can go.

551
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,591
Why's that?

552
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,600
The woman's family is so strict,
they are somebody in society.

553
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,521
They're so high in morals.

554
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,280
If someone like me attends the reception,

555
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:18,040
I'm afraid they would be embarrassed.

556
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,400
But I think you should go.

557
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,840
Your brother sent you the invitation.

558
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,000
It means that he wants you on hig big day.

559
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,501
Don't mind about the others, focus on your brother.

560
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,881
Right?

561
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,480
I wore this super tight swimsuit in my first film.

562
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:00,320
And I needed to run from bad guys.

563
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,000
Then my swimsuit cracked open.

564
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:03,800
- What?
- Right in the middle of my chest.

565
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:05,640
They kept the scene.

566
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,720
That's the start of my career.

567
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,680
A sexy star of this era.

568
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:13,480
This is destiny for sure,

569
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:15,344
right?

570
00:50:15,883 --> 00:50:18,040
It's fun talking to you.

571
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,600
I wouldn't let others come into my house.

572
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:22,418
Why's that?

573
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,800
I met a lot of guys

574
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,880
and I can see from their eyes.

575
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,360
They're either so horny or insulting me.

576
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,801
But I don't feel like that with you.

577
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,120
I feel like I'm talking to a friend.

578
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:43,960
What? I thought we're already friends.

579
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,783
If we're friends,

580
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,562
can I ask you something?

581
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,631
Sure.

582
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,321
Actually, if you agree to marry Pin,

583
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,320
you can transfer your assets to her bank account,

584
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,280
your family can survive for sure.

585
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,700
Why did you need to ask him
for his help storing your family's assets?

586
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,880
I see Pin as my own sister.

587
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,280
I can't love her more than a sister.

588
00:51:19,597 --> 00:51:20,920
I don't want to use her.

589
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,960
She deserves tp be married to a good guy,

590
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,800
not someone like me.

591
00:51:30,517 --> 00:51:32,880
But you're perfect.

592
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,640
You have money and you're born in a good family.

593
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,801
Not like that.

594
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,880
I'm not perfect.

595
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,000
There're so many things that I can't do.

596
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,760
I can't live my life the way I want.

597
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,161
That's why I told you that I admired you

598
00:51:52,837 --> 00:51:53,920
for your bravery

599
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,480
to live your own life.

600
00:51:58,437 --> 00:51:59,438
You don't care about anyone.

601
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,961
If the Field Marshal agrees to help you

602
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,760
and your plan is successful,

603
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,720
can I get one thing in return?

604
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,041
What is that?

605
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:22,542
I want you to live your life like you want to.

606
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,200
Be yourself.

607
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,500
Be who you want to be.

608
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,320
If I have a chance, I will try.

609
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,280
I wouldn't dare to do it in the past.

610
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,720
But someone once told me that

611
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:52,200
I don't want to be drowning in sorrow of reality.

612
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,960
I'd rather be dreaming and bringing it to life.

613
00:53:02,122 --> 00:53:03,200
Who said that?

614
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,681
Just someone I know.

615
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,920
If they're just someone you know,

616
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,560
you wouldn't care that much about what they said.

617
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,280
They must be someone important to you.

618
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,120
I don't think we have enough.

619
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,480
Then get five more.

620
00:53:55,997 --> 00:53:57,480
- Don't you think it's too much.
- Just get more.

621
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,100
- So hungry.
- Here, grill some more.

622
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:01,718
You want some sticky rice?

623
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,440
- One for me.
- I don't want any.

624
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,201
Two bags of sticky rice, please.

625
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:16,118
Hey!

626
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,691
Hey!

627
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:24,158
Where is he off to?

628
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,760
To the bathroom, I guess.

629
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,044
Hey!

630
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,440
- What's this?
- How did you get here?

631
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,840
I should ask you this. You said
there's nothing between the two of you.

632
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,240
- It's nothing.
- Liar.

633
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,440
You're gonna admit when I saw you two sleeping together?

634
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,871
Hey!

635
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,761
Stop with that nasty thought of yours.

636
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,320
You're insulting me and Ms. Songsawat.

637
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,760
Then tell me, why did you walk out
of her house in the morning?

638
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,521
You spent the night here, of course you're having an affair with her.

639
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,500
Tell me, what is it?

640
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,223
I asked her to make an appointment
with the Field Marshal for me.

641
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,320
I'd ask him to help me with assets transferring.

642
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,680
If everything goes according to plan,

643
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,480
Pin and I don't have to get married.

644
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,081
You don't want to get married?

645
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:18,858
Why?

646
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,040
She deserves someone better than me.

647
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,000
Why didn't you tell her? You know that she loves you.

648
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:28,122
I'm sorry.

649
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,041
I don't want it to be this way.

650
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,263
I try to find solutions.

651
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,681
Solutions of what?

652
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,440
This is your excuse.

653
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,920
You and your dad are horrible people, so selfish.

654
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,960
You did everything for your own benefits.

655
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:43,720
You don't care about others.

656
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,760
You felt bad for your mom because you're a horrible son?

657
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:49,700
- Hey!
- Why?

658
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,121
I heard you talked in your sleep.

659
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,560
I felt bad for you at first

660
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,760
but now I get it.

661
00:55:57,497 --> 00:55:59,103
You're irresponsible.

662
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,600
You're selfish, you're using people.

663
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,280
That's why your mom left you.

664
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,801
Hey!

665
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:37,280
Saenkaew wanted to ask the Field Marshal for his help.

666
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,800
Why didn't he want to get married?

667
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,241
That way is easier.

668
00:56:43,477 --> 00:56:44,478
I know, right?

669
00:56:45,497 --> 00:56:46,598
Why's that?
