1
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,390
(Sirichalalai Palace, Bangkok, Thailand)

2
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,410
You'd like to hold a welcome party for me?

3
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,610
That's right.

4
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,510
We should announce to everyone
that Prince Saenkaew of Chansaeng

5
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,510
will is soon-to-be my son-in-law.

6
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,110
The party will be the talk of the town.

7
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,510
Everyone in Bangkok will be surprised.

8
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,570
- You think so?
- Sure, I do.

9
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,190
I can help you out with the guest list.

10
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,790
I can do it.

11
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,750
If I let you do it,
we will only have a bunch of nobody guests.

12
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,430
Did your dad tell you when he will arrive?

13
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,310
He said that he would arrive next month.

14
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,430
He must be busy with
transferring his assets.

15
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,650
But…

16
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,270
you don't have to worry about it.

17
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,430
I'm here to help you.

18
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,550
After the marriage,
your assets can be transferred to Pin.

19
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,150
And all of your family members
can relocate to Thailand.

20
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,630
That will stop them from harming us.

21
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,190
There're so many details about it.

22
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,770
This is a big topic to discuss,
we should talk about it later.

23
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,470
It's not a big topic to discuss.

24
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,070
I heard that your dad

25
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,790
wanted to work in the timber
industry in Chiang Mai.

26
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,190
I can help with finding
agents and a furniture factory.

27
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,150
We're practically family.

28
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,230
We're building a successful
business together.

29
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,550
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right.

30
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,370
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 2)

31
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,030
So? What's going on?

32
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,390
What's the update from Kamfah's family?

33
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,790
I have some information.

34
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,370
Prince Kamfah and Prince Saenkaew
had an argument the other day.

35
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,990
Prince Bodin's daughter, you know her well.

36
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
I'm not getting married.

37
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,510
This is about my entire life's happiness.

38
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,390
Why're you forcing me? You're so selfish.

39
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,470
How dare you talk about your own happiness!

40
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,630
Who is the selfish one now?

41
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,330
Yeah?

42
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,270
How are they doing now?

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,150
Prince Saenkaew has left
for Thailand for days now.

44
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,150
He's in Thailand now?

45
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,230
Your reward for bringing news.

46
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,170
See? This is what I expected.

47
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,870
Kamfah planned for his son
to marry his friend's daughter,

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,670
in order to transfer his assets.

49
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,710
It's still strange.

50
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,710
It sounded like a good plan.

51
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,670
Why did they still have an argument?

52
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,070
A young man doesn't like to be forced
when it comes to love.

53
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,910
If there's anyone you'd like to invite,

54
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,470
or you'd like to add something,
you can let my dad know.

55
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,790
He will follow your requests for sure.

56
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,810
Grandma!

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,110
You're gonna fall!

58
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,550
Grandma!

59
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,750
Grandma? What's going on?

60
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,260
I heard your grandma talked to Homthip that
she'd like some mangoes.

61
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,590
So I volunteered to pick some for her.

62
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,430
You climbed up too high.

63
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,350
I'm worried that you'll fall.

64
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,830
You don't have to worry about him.

65
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,430
He's good at climbing trees,
even better than a monkey.

66
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,510
I heard your scream and

67
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,470
I thought that your
heart condition acted up.

68
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,190
- I was so worried.
- Thank you for that.

69
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,470
You're overthinking.

70
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,630
Grandma still looks so young

71
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,310
- and so strong.
- Wow!

72
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,910
- Such a sweet talker.
- You think this is a joke?

73
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,150
If something happened to her,
can you be responsible for that?

74
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,360
Oh my! Grandma, look.

75
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,230
He isn't pleased with anything I say.

76
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,040
Come on.

77
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,310
Sasin didn't mean to scare me or anything.

78
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,710
Don't blame him, okay?

79
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,210
Here are your mangoes.

80
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,030
Are you free this afternoon?
Would you like to hang out at my place?

81
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,750
I can play the violin for you.

82
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,590
He's a good violinist.

83
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,390
It's the only thing he's good at.

84
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,550
- Let's go, Grandma.
- That's right.

85
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Maybe some other time.

86
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,870
Don't you have a cooking class with Pin?

87
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,980
You're right. I totally forgot.

88
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,240
What's with the face?

89
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,830
You don't want me here? Learning with you?

90
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,710
That's not true.

91
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,470
The more the merrier.

92
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,750
How is this one?

93
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,310
They're lovely.

94
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,140
You look so grumpy, Little Rabbit.

95
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,950
Who did you call a rabbit?

96
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,250
What?

97
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,190
I was talking to my Luk
Chup that looks like a rabbit.

98
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,590
That's a cute rabbit you made.

99
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,170
That's right.

100
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,390
Can I have this one?

101
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,830
Well, I don't think so.

102
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,830
I wanted to make this one for Mr. Saenkaew.

103
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,710
Prince Saenkaew, your dad's on the phone.

104
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,230
- Dad?
- Is anyone around?

105
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,570
Nobody's here.

106
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,710
We can't let anyone know about this,
especially Prince Bodin.

107
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,310
What is it?

108
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,970
We got a problem about
money transferring to Thailand.

109
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,350
Kalong knows about it.

110
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,830
What? How did he find out?

111
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,830
Someone must have tipped him off.

112
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,710
You have to be very
cautious when staying there.

113
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,210
Kalong won't stop for sure.

114
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,630
Got it.

115
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,030
Field Marshal?

116
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,750
Saenkaew didn't want to get married?

117
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,430
And he fought with his dad about it?

118
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
This is weird.

119
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,470
That's right. My spy didn't lie about it.

120
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,150
Marriage will help with movement of assets.

121
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,430
And it can help his whole entire family.

122
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,990
I'm questioning the same thing.

123
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,950
What about this? I can look into it myself.

124
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,190
Hey!

125
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm always ready to be
a good citizen of Nanta.

126
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,310
I want Nanta to earn a lot of money.

127
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,790
To develop and grow the nation.

128
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,010
Can I trust you?

129
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
They said blood is thicker than water.

130
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,750
Blood may be thicker than water

131
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,750
but my nationalist
heart is the thickest.

132
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,090
Gen. Kalong.

133
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,790
Chansaeng is not under you just yet.

134
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,670
It's inconvenient for you
to do anything, isn't it?

135
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,430
But I have a spy

136
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,790
living at their place to report
their moves to me all the time.

137
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,120
I also know

138
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,030
Prince Kamfah and Prince
Saenkaew really well.

139
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,830
I can even foresee their next moves.

140
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,770
Come on.

141
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,870
Let me help you.

142
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,630
I heard that there're some disagreements
between Kamfah and his brother.

143
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,820
About assets and inheritance.

144
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,470
If you're successful in
finding out about Saenkaew,

145
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,170
getting in the way of their marriage,

146
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,190
and transferring their assets,

147
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,570
I'll consider you as doing
something good for the nation.

148
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,790
The assets that I can seize from Kamfah...

149
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,320
I'll share them to you as your reward.

150
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,560
I will do my best

151
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,230
for Nanta.

152
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,110
The Field Marshal refrains from
welcoming guests these days.

153
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,380
I can't even see him for just one second?

154
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,870
He isn't available, truly.

155
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,040
Sorry about that.

156
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,710
Come on in, please.

157
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,270
Yes, sir.

158
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,270
Please see him out.

159
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,330
This way, please.

160
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,910
Ms. Songsawat, please come this way.

161
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,470
The Field Marshal is
waiting for you, welcome.

162
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,810
This way, please.

163
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,990
Please follow me.

164
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,190
How was it?

165
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,990
Why did you need to
visit the Field Marshal?

166
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,230
He's a powerful man in Thailand,
that could stand up against Kalong.

167
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,510
If I could ask him to store our assets,

168
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,390
Kalong won't have a chance
to fight against him for sure.

169
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,590
And I won't have to act
like I'm using Pin for this matter.

170
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,790
Ms. Pin is a nice lady.

171
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,710
And it seems like she really likes you.

172
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,800
If the wedding is postponed,

173
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,350
she will be so devastated.

174
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,230
But if we're forced to get married,

175
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,950
she will be even more devastated.

176
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,050
She deserves to be with
someone who's right for her,

177
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,120
someone who loves her
and can take good care of her,

178
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,030
not someone like me.

179
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,190
If you couldn't meet him,

180
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,710
what's your next move?

181
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,270
Ms. Songsawat, please come this way.

182
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,710
The Field Marshal is
waiting for you, welcome.

183
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,870
That lady is so familiar.

184
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,670
It's her.

185
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,050
What're you doing, Saenkaew?

186
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,030
Pin.

187
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,230
Do you know her?

188
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,310
Her name is Ms. Songsawat Pilatlakkana.

189
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,170
She's an actress and does beauty pageants.

190
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
A sex bomb.

191
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,350
Everyone is kind of scared of her.

192
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,770
Scared?

193
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,290
Why's that?

194
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,230
Because she's a good actress?
That's why people scared of her?

195
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,710
That's not it.

196
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,670
She's the Field Marshal's
favorite mistress.

197
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
Prince Kamfah?

198
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,190
We got a situation.

199
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,990
Gen. Kalong.

200
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,180
You need to bring your
soldiers out of my house.

201
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,550
Chansaeng isn't ruled by you.

202
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,870
Mr. Kamfah.

203
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,550
Why're you so mad about this?

204
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,350
I'm not intruding.

205
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm just saying hi to my neighbor.

206
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,990
A neighbor?

207
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,000
What do you mean?

208
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,710
I need to run some errands in Chansaeng.

209
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,990
Like meetings and
discussions with France about

210
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,830
handing over Chansaeng to Nanta.

211
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,120
To make the handover go smoothly.

212
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,430
I need to stay here for a while.

213
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,350
My place is right next to
yours, what a coincidence.

214
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,590
I hope you go back to where you belong!

215
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,630
Leave my place alone
or you'll see what I can do!

216
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,270
Understood.

217
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
Right.

218
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,750
Please say hi to

219
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,750
Mr. Saenkaew for me.

220
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,590
I heard that he'll get married soon.

221
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,990
I'll send my people to retrieve
a wedding invitation from here.

222
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,150
Let's go.

223
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,550
Kalong keeps an eye on us for sure.

224
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,750
Call Mr. Consul.

225
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,870
I'll ask him

226
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,950
to help me work on transferring
money to Thailand faster.

227
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,140
But I need to organize the wedding

228
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,310
of Saenkaew and Pinanong
faster than we planned.

229
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:49,870
Yes, sir.

230
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,190
These are songs to play in
Mr. Saenkaew's welcome party?

231
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,430
That's right.

232
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,030
That's right?

233
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,430
Are you crazy? These are all sad songs.

234
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,970
This is a welcome party for Pin's fiancé

235
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,970
not a lonely heart's club.

236
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,630
Such a whiner.

237
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,290
I'll take care of it.

238
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,390
You should've taken
care of it from the start.

239
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,410
What?

240
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,270
I know that you're sad because
Pin is engaged to someone.

241
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,620
You should get over it already.
She's like an angel, but you…

242
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,330
You're like an ugly dog.

243
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,470
What? You're not gonna console me?

244
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,910
If he finds out that you
have a crush on his cousin,

245
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,590
he'll stomp you to the ground for sure.

246
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,190
One more thing, I don't think
he'd let her date you for sure.

247
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,710
Fine.

248
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,110
I just wanted to know

249
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,790
how much that Prince Saenkaew guy

250
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,570
is better than me.

251
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,230
Sasin!

252
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,050
What're you doing?

253
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,710
Selecting songs.

254
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,830
I think he is 2,500
times better than you are.

255
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,570
Pin?

256
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,030
Mingmitr and Sanya, I'd like
to introduce you to someone.

257
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,570
This is Prince Saenkaew.

258
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,710
Saenkaew, this is Mingmitr and Sanya.

259
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,690
They're Sasin's closest
friends in the band.

260
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,570
Hello.

261
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,510
Nice to meet all of you.

262
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,470
Good that you're here.

263
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,130
Pin's dad wanted us to
play in your welcome party.

264
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,070
Do you have any special
songs you'd like us to play?

265
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,170
I'm not good with music.

266
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,670
So it's up to you.

267
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, come on.

268
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,030
You don't need to tell me now.

269
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
What about this?

270
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,710
Why don't you hang out
for a drink with us tonight?

271
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,830
We can talk about songs, sounds good?

272
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,790
- Well, I…
- Come on.

273
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,790
You said no to me before.

274
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,270
If you refused to hang
out with me again,

275
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,350
I couldn't help but
but think that

276
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,790
you disliked me for sure.

277
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,740
I think it's better to hang out with them.

278
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,270
Sounds like fun, I'll be here too.

279
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,950
No, you can't.

280
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,110
If Khunying Wad sees you in drinking group,

281
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,440
we'll get scolded at for sure.

282
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,590
They're not home. They'll
have a party to attend to.

283
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,870
I can stay, all clear.

284
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,830
Good. You can cook us side dishes.

285
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,390
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

286
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Go downstairs.

287
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,750
Thank you, Sasin.

288
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Saenkaew?

289
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,030
Are you feeling better?

290
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,470
You should rest. I'll help you.

291
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,230
No need to.

292
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,310
You should go and hang out with them.

293
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,950
Let us women do the kitchen work.

294
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,590
We're all the same.

295
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,950
I'll help you cook and
it will be done faster.

296
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,350
So you can hang out and
have fun with us faster.

297
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,830
You're so good at this.

298
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,470
You're good at desserts and cooking.

299
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,310
I'm not that good.

300
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,230
Khunying Wad likes to
call me a troublemaker.

301
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,590
A troublemaker how? I don't get it.

302
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,630
Well…

303
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,950
Just being me is trouble enough, I guess.

304
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,150
I'm a cook's daughter.

305
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,790
I don't act like an aristocrat or a lady.

306
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,830
I often embarrass them.

307
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,620
I totally understand you.

308
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,270
Perhaps, just being ourselves

309
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,030
could cause trouble to someone.

310
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,470
But it's their problem.

311
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,990
Don't let it become yours.

312
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,390
Let them solve their own problems.

313
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,290
Right?

314
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,290
Right.

315
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,110
When it comes to not being
an aristocrat or a lady,

316
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,510
don't let that bother you.

317
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,550
If you have a chance, you
should just live your life.

318
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,310
Be yourself.

319
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,010
Don't please anyone.

320
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,350
I think that kind of life

321
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,950
is the best kind of life.

322
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Thank you so much.

323
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,990
I'm so lucky to get to know you.

324
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,910
I'm not that good person.

325
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,510
Food is here.

326
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,610
Nice smell.

327
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
Wait, wait.

328
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,210
We need to celebrate our friendship first.

329
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,570
This is what we do.

330
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,070
Cheers!

331
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,470
Come on, cheers!

332
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Bottoms up!

333
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,390
Sure thing.

334
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,150
Let's go.

335
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,630
Can you handle it?

336
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,910
Let me get you a refill.

337
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,030
Hey, what're you doing?

338
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,390
Why did you put so much whiskey in it?

339
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,070
You told me

340
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,170
that Prince Saenkaew never said a word
about his feeling towards Pin.

341
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,030
This is it.

342
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,670
I'll a mix strong drink
so he'd be drunk and saying something.

343
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Thank you.

344
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,590
I think it's a good idea.

345
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,830
Ms. Pin, your dad and
Khunying Wad are here.

346
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,270
They're also asking for you.

347
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,990
They said they'd come home late.

348
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,750
I better go.

349
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,550
- I should go.
- Wait, Pin!

350
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,790
Where are you going?

351
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,950
You promised us that
you'd hang out with us.

352
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,690
Here's your drink.

353
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Cheers!

354
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

355
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,510
Bottoms up!

356
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,070
Why're you so quiet?

357
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Let's drink!

358
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,790
- Come on, cheer!
- Hey!

359
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,710
Sasin, come on! Let's drink.

360
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Cheers!

361
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,010
Bottoms up, okay?

362
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,870
I can't drink anymore.

363
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,230
Sanya, you can't stop. Let's go.

364
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,310
One more bottle?

365
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,630
I can't take it anymore.

366
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,670
You don't look like a person
who's good at drinking.

367
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,270
You think I don't know that
you tried to get me drunk?

368
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,790
Distilled liquor in Chansaeng is so strong
that it could start a fire.

369
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,990
What we drank tonight was just water.

370
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,310
Just water?

371
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,990
You're quite something.

372
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,190
You knew our plan so you tricked us?

373
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,990
I think I should warn Pin

374
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,710
to be careful around you.

375
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,870
I told you that I only meant well to her.

376
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,290
Hey!

377
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,230
Pin is really happy when you're around.

378
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,050
I'd like to ask you to take care of her.

379
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,470
But there's one thing,

380
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,430
you often have your grumpy face on.

381
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,830
It's like you have something to hide.

382
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,150
Everyone has their bad side,

383
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,190
their disgusting side

384
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,830
that they don't want anyone to see.

385
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,630
You're right.

386
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,470
I believe there's one person in our lives

387
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,710
that we can share
absolutely everything with,

388
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,510
both good and bad things.

389
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,870
They won't judge us

390
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,390
and they will stand by
our sides no matter what.

391
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,310
We'll find them someday for sure.

392
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,530
Why're you so active today?
Cleaning from the early morning.

393
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,910
Mingmitr and Sanya
were so drunk last night.

394
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,630
They puked all over my house.

395
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,550
And they're gone, they left me
to clean the house by myself.

396
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,590
- You deserved it.
- What?

397
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,950
After I left last night,

398
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,470
did you make fun of my Saenkaew?

399
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,510
You're worried about
him? He's not that innocent.

400
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,180
Nobody could do anything to him.

401
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,170
I've observed him

402
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,190
and I think he is all right.

403
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,710
He passed my criteria.

404
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,670
But just the first step.

405
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,950
Just the first one? How
many steps do you have?

406
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,530
There are 38,000 steps.

407
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,070
I'll be 60 when all steps are completed.

408
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,390
Maybe older.

409
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,230
I told you already that he is a good man.

410
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,270
If you get to know him a little bit more,

411
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,350
you will like him like I do.

412
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,430
What're you thinking? Still hangover?

413
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,790
I'll put these on dishes for you.

414
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,510
So yummy.

415
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Come on in, please.

416
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,990
Khunying Wad wanted
me to give you the guest list.

417
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,430
(Ms. Songsawat Pilatlakkana)

418
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,830
Her name is Ms. Songsawat Pilatlakkana.

419
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,510
She's the Field Marshal's
favorite mistress.

420
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,830
I'll have someone take care of your place.

421
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,030
So you don't have to stay at a motel.

422
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,950
I really need to thank
you for arranging all of this.

423
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,470
We appreciate your help.

424
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,270
You're welcome.

425
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,830
You're a friend of Gen.Kalong.

426
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,920
Gen. Kalong and I are good friends.

427
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,430
So you're my guest.

428
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,030
Thank you so much.

429
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,750
If you don't mind me asking,

430
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,590
what's that invitation for?

431
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,750
From Sirichalalai Palace of Prince Bodin.

432
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,510
A welcome party for Prince
Saenkaew, your nephew.

433
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,590
Well,

434
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,990
they used scented hard paper.

435
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,070
They must be so excited about
their soon-to-be son-in-law.

436
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,710
They invited everyone in Bangkok.
Sure, they must be so excited.

437
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Right.

438
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,390
Prince Saenkaew asked to see
the Field Marshal the other day,

439
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,670
Really?

440
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,510
Why did he want to see
the leader of Thailand?

441
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,150
I'm not sure.

442
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,750
Because I didn't bring him to see my boss.

443
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,950
Excuse me, sir.

444
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,230
- Please excuse me for a minute.
- Sure, take your time.

445
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,310
You think it's about your
nephew not wanting to get married?

446
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,430
We'll find out soon enough.

447
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,070
Can you lift it up? Our
guests could walk into it.

448
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,030
Right, this is high enough.

449
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,450
This is huge.

450
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,550
How much did you loan for this party?

451
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,590
A lot, but we need to organize a big party,

452
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,630
and invite many guests to witness

453
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,390
the fact that Pin will
marry Prince Saenkaew.

454
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,150
Prince Kamfah won't
change his mind for sure.

455
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,310
Such a fruitful investment,
don't you think so?

456
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,150
Well, you paid for the party already.

457
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,390
What else can I say but agree with you?

458
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,990
I'm glad you could make it, Doctor.

459
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,790
Hey! Who're you looking for?

460
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,110
A host. I haven't seen him.

461
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,630
Pin! Over here!

462
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,670
I hope you remember my daughter, Pin.

463
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,540
Pin is so beautiful like an angel.

464
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,830
Well, she walks with another angel.

465
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,630
Can you not disagree with me for once?

466
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,230
Why don't you take them to the table?

467
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,070
Little Rabbit looks so dapper tonight.

468
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,350
What rabbit?

469
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,590
Forget about the rabbit, let's go and play.

470
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:48,950
Let's go.

471
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,040
He's a good violinist.

472
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,980
A glass of champagne, please.

473
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,550
Grandma, can you stay
here with Pin for a minute?

474
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,550
- Are you making the rounds?
- Yes.

475
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,590
Go ahead, dear.

476
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,750
- I'll take care of her.
- Thank you.

477
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:43,270
A person you asked me to look for is here.

478
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,390
Is this the one?

479
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,030
I heard that she's the latest
mistress of the Field Marshal.

480
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,590
That's right. Look at the way she dressed.

481
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,670
It's like she wants everyone
to know about her past jobs.

482
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,590
How dare she attend a
party in the palace like this?

483
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,150
Seeing her here makes me want to go home.

484
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,190
Disgusting.

485
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,230
Good evening, Ms. Songsawat.

486
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,070
- You?
- My name is Saenkaew.

487
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,230
Prince Saenkaew? The host of the party.

488
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,990
Nice to meet you.

489
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,490
Nice to meet you, too.

490
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,790
Prince Bodin's future son-in-law.

491
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,950
He must admire you so
much, look how big the party is.

492
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,470
I'll cut to the chase.

493
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,010
I need to ask you a favor.

494
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,750
A favor?

495
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,710
You want to be a star?

496
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,670
I want to meet the Field Marshal.

497
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,790
Wait, hear me out.

498
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,950
I really need his help.

499
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,170
My family is in big trouble.

500
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,110
Our assets could be seized
or we could be executed.

501
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,510
I heard thousands of
people say the same thing.

502
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,830
You just want to meet him,
to take advantage of him.

503
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,830
It's quite entertaining to
see children of aristocrats

504
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,590
and wealthy people like you

505
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,270
stoop down to talk to a sex bomb like me.

506
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,570
I would never consider talking to you
is some kind of stooping down.

507
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,390
I read your biography.

508
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,790
I think you're a brave woman.

509
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,550
Brave? You're gonna call me shameless

510
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,630
for being naked in films
and being his mistress?

511
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,660
Of course not.

512
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,390
I think you're brave for
choosing your own path,

513
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,750
and not caring about others.

514
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,470
I want to be brave like you.

515
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,670
To be yourself and to
not care about others.

516
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:33,950
You know what?

517
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,790
There're so many things I want to do

518
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,670
but I can't do any of them.

519
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,750
I'm fascinated by you.

520
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,390
See you later.

521
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,580
Grandma?

522
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,110
I'll look around for you.

523
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,230
Sasin, did you see Saenkaew anywhere?

524
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,190
I've looked around and I didn't see him.

525
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,630
I haven't. What's going on?

526
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,750
Grandma's old friend moved
from Chansaeng to Bangkok.

527
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,750
She wanted to introduce her to Saenkaew.

528
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,510
I see. I'll let him know when I see him.

529
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,600
Thank you.

530
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,060
I'll be right back.

531
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,790
I'll be right back.

532
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,070
You're fun to hang out with,

533
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,710
you're not boring like other aristocrats.

534
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,870
You're actually an intellectual person.

535
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,150
I never thought that you're
interested in various social issues.

536
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,450
You said you wanted to
meet the Field Marshal,

537
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,710
I'll talk to him about you
when I have a chance.

538
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:16,590
Thank you so much.

539
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:20,730
Thank you so much.

540
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,790
I should call it a night,
let's hang out later.

541
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,630
I'm sorry, I think I drank too much.

542
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,270
- Thanks.
- Are you okay?

543
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,620
Yeah.

544
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:54,830
Mr. Saenkaew!

545
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,270
Why didn't you make a sound? You scared me.

546
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,510
Is Saenkaew here?

547
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,190
- Come here.
- What?

548
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,750
What's going on?

549
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,760
Hey! Let me go!

550
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,190
- Are you insane?
- I should be the one asking you that!

551
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,790
You disrespected my cousin.

552
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,430
What did I do?

553
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,040
Quit acting so innocent!

554
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,830
I saw what you did with that sex star.

555
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,190
How could you insult her with that tone?

556
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,110
She has an honest job as an actress.

557
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:32,110
You defended her?

558
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,500
Did you know that she's
the Field Marshal's mistress?

559
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,990
You're gonna have an affair
with someone's mistress?

560
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,990
You're overreacting! I
was just talking to her.

561
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,150
- About what?
- It's none of your business.

562
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,550
You can't tell me because you
made out with her, didn't you?

563
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,750
That's why when I
asked you if you loved Pin,

564
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,830
- you couldn't answer me.
- Hey!

565
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,270
I just met her tonight.

566
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,410
- We didn't do anything.
- You didn't?

567
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,750
- Why did you hold her?
- She almost fell so I caught her.

568
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,750
She fell how? I saw you held her.

569
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,470
- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- Where're you going?

570
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,990
- We need to talk.
- Let me go!

571
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,890
No, I won't! How did she fell?
Why did it look like you're holding her?

572
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,790
Come back here.

573
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,290
Can you picture it now?

574
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,070
This is how she was about to fall.
