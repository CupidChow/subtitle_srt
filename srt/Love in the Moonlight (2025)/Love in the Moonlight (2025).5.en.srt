"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 5)

2
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,130
You don't want to get married?

3
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,970
Why didn't you tell her?
You know that she loves you.

4
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,290
You're irresponsible.

5
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,570
You're selfish, you're using people.

6
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,190
That's why your mom left you.

7
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Hey!

8
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,310
Because of you.

9
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,750
Dueanpradap was in pain and she died.

10
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,330
You killed the woman who I loved the most.

11
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,930
Come in.

12
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Sir?

13
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,370
You worked with Homthip, trying to fool me.

14
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,160
Where did you sneak out to last night?

15
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,010
Just ran some errands.

16
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,770
You don't have to watch me this close,
I'm not a prisoner.

17
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,010
But sir?

18
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,860
We need to be more careful.

19
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,650
Your dad just told me that

20
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,770
Prince Inthorn kept messing around

21
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,130
because Kalong supported him.

22
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,320
He worked with Kalong?

23
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,490
They wanted to stop the wedding

24
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,650
and transfer assets from our place.

25
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,780
Your dad has taken
care of transferring cash

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
out of Chansaeng already.

27
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,390
He will be in Bangkok soon.

28
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,610
He also said that when he's here

29
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,800
he will arrange your
wedding as soon as possible.

30
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,530
I asked Grandma and Homthip to teach me
to make chickpea tofu.

31
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,810
Why don't you try some?

32
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,150
Thank you.

33
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,650
Tastes good.

34
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,650
Well, have some more.

35
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,430
It's all yours.

36
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,810
Sasin.

37
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,570
Come here, come taste my chickpea tofu.

38
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,290
Who did you get in a fight with?

39
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,130
Why do you look like that?

40
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,340
A random bad guy, the
worse person that ever existed.

41
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,330
Who's that? What was it about?

42
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,690
He's a two-faced man,

43
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,610
a liar, and a manipulator.

44
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,980
He acts so high and mighty but

45
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,970
the truth is that he's so vile,
a snake and irresponsible.

46
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,210
- Too bad I didn't punch him back.
- Go ahead!

47
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,850
Just do it!

48
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,930
It will be nothing
comparing to what you did.

49
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,530
What do you expect me to do?

50
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,450
Figure it out on your own!
You're so smart, aren't you?

51
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
You planned the whole
think to betray people.

52
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,450
What's going on between you two?

53
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,810
I'm trying to fix it.

54
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,510
By lying to people?

55
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,370
I think you better go
back to you stupid town,

56
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,090
and your stupid house, and
never come back here again.

57
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Sasin?

58
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,220
- Saenkaew?
- I'm sorry.

59
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Sasin.

60
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,530
Why did you talk to him like that?

61
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,230
Chansaeng is about to be taken over

62
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,530
and his childhood home will be gone.

63
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,890
You're so mean for telling
him to go back home like that.

64
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,310
Mean? I'm so mean?

65
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,230
I'm not half as mean as him.

66
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,930
What're you two fighting about?

67
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,650
You need to stop being around him.

68
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,750
He isn't a good person
like you think he is.

69
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,970
Why're you acting this way?

70
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,850
You used to like him, didn't you?

71
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,490
That was before I knew his true colors.

72
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,770
He is using you.

73
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,890
Why're you bringing this up again?

74
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,670
That's right.

75
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,700
This marriage is based on benefits.

76
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,750
But both families will gain something.

77
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,490
No one is using anyone.

78
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,170
More importantly,

79
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
I love him.

80
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,610
Pin?

81
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,220
Why waste your
energy loving someone like him?

82
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,690
- You will be sorry.
- Can you stop being like this?

83
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,090
We all used to be so close.

84
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,090
I want us to go back to normal.

85
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,250
I don't want to see you two fight.

86
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,370
Please, I beg you.

87
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,710
Can you stop being like this?

88
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,260
Please, I beg you.

89
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,610
Saenkaew will ask the Field
Marshal about transferring the assets?

90
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
That's right.

91
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,120
I went to see his mistress'
house this morning.

92
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,440
And I saw Saenkaew had a
fight with his bride's cousin.

93
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,290
It's like what you said.

94
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,530
You're so sharp, that's
why you're a nation's leader.

95
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,680
Why didn't he transfer his assets

96
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,530
through his marriage like he planned?

97
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,700
Perhaps because I
caused a scene at the party

98
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,120
and the bride's side was so mad about it,
they wouldn't let them get married.

99
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,650
Well, Kalong.

100
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,000
I did a great job, didn't I?

101
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,240
It's not the time to
talk about praising you.

102
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,310
If the Field Marshal helped him out

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,530
and got in the way of transferring assets,
it'll be harder to get assets from Kamfah.

104
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
So?

105
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,820
What should we do?

106
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,410
I won't let Nanta's assets
fly out of my hands for sure.

107
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Come here.

108
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,030
Let me go.

109
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,690
We need to talk.

110
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,020
You need to stop avoiding
me and being a coward already.

111
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,210
You know how much Pin cares about you?

112
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,690
She was worried that I
could hurt your feeling.

113
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,170
But you don't care about her at all.

114
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,890
No, I care deeply about her.

115
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,290
That's why I'm trying
to stop the wedding.

116
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,800
Then tell her that you
don't want to get married.

117
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,410
If I tell her now, our
families won't let that happen.

118
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,290
I need to talk to the Field Marshal first,
then I'll tell her.

119
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,250
How could you say that?
So my cousin is just your back-up plan?

120
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,610
So selfish.

121
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
Saenkaew?

122
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,210
Sasin? What's going on?

123
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,210
Grandma?

124
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,490
What're you two fighting about?

125
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,410
It's nothing, please come with me.

126
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,090
Don't lie to me.

127
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,730
You will marry Pin soon.

128
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,970
We're gonna be family.

129
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,170
Can't you two just talk normally?

130
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,490
It's my fault.

131
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,850
If I were him, I would
have been mad as well.

132
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,570
You know that you did something wrong,
you should apologize to him.

133
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,890
Sasin is a good guy.

134
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,570
I'm glad that you have a friend like him.

135
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,850
You like him a lot, don't you?

136
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,570
Sasin?

137
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,420
What's going on? You
can't concentrate today.

138
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,800
That's right. You've never been like this.

139
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,540
Or someone broke your heart?

140
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,050
Shut up, both of you.

141
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,290
Why don't you drink some more so
you can keep your mouth occupied?

142
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,350
Where're you rushing to? Stay for a drink.

143
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,210
I don't think so.

144
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,350
Sasin.

145
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,170
You know that you can talk
to me about anything, right?

146
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,130
Prince Saenkaew wanted
to cancel the wedding?

147
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,930
That's right. He asked Ms. Songsawat to
talk to the Field Marshal

148
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,090
about storing his assets.

149
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,450
What did Pin say about this?

150
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,420
I didn't tell her about it.

151
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,530
If he doesn't love her or doesn't
want to marry her, he should tell her.

152
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,690
But he did nothing, he's a fraud.

153
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,250
Calm down.

154
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,010
From what I know about him,

155
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,090
he doesn't seem like a fraud to me.

156
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,050
He seems to sincerely

157
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,450
care for Pin, like for real.

158
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,720
I thought so too, that's
why I don't get him.

159
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,820
He likes to do things in a complicated way.

160
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,290
That's just the meaning of life.

161
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,050
You're a simple guy.

162
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,410
You're so lucky to do what you please.

163
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,930
Someone else's life isn't that easy.

164
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,380
Especially someone with dignity, pride

165
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,170
and so many assets like him.

166
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,330
His life gets more complicated than yours.

167
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,090
You're right.

168
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,280
But I don't care to try to understand.

169
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,890
I just need to find a way to tell Pin
about him canceling the wedding.

170
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Easy.

171
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,890
- Excuse me.
- Why don't you just ask him?

172
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,610
So you can understand
it from his perspective.

173
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,090
What's that for?

174
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,820
We're on opposite sides now.

175
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,290
Don't be too quick to judge him.

176
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,450
Why don't you ask him first?

177
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,290
If you asked him and you
still wanted to be his enemy,

178
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,730
then you could just hate him after that.

179
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,930
To be rich and to be lucky.

180
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,890
You're my good luck charm.

181
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,050
Here, I'll give you 100.

182
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,710
It seems like you're lucky
in gabling at Thai casinos.

183
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,570
You never lose.

184
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,910
What can I say?

185
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,820
I'm a good person and a family man.

186
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,450
So God rewards me with this.

187
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,750
What the heck?

188
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,930
Don't! Stop!

189
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,650
Help! Help!

190
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,290
Somebody! Help!

191
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Help!

192
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,290
Please help! Honey!

193
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,890
Somebody! Help!

194
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,550
Stop!

195
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,970
- Honey!
- Who are you?

196
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,010
Kamsu?

197
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,650
You little servant, how
could you do this to me?

198
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,130
This is just a warning, sir.

199
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,170
If you continue to get in our
way of assets transferring,

200
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,810
you'll face worse than this, sir.

201
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,890
How're you feeling?

202
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
It hurts!

203
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,760
Pin? You called me here?

204
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,870
Well, I'll let you two talk.

205
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,610
I'll wait inside the house.

206
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,970
You told Pin to trick me here?

207
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,410
You are tricking people too.

208
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,330
Let's just talk.

209
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,770
I want to know why did you do that?

210
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,190
Why did you want to call off the wedding?
Why did you hide it from everyone?

211
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,330
You wouldn't understand.

212
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,850
Just tell me, perhaps a loser like me

213
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,410
could understand a high nobleman like you.

214
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,190
Starting off with your sarcastic tone?

215
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,170
I'm not talking to you.

216
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,630
I have a bad mouth, I'm sorry.

217
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,210
But you should man up
and face the problems.

218
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,290
Running away from them is not the solution.

219
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,050
I told you that I'm trying.

220
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,460
- Where're you going? We need to talk.
- Let me go.

221
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,770
- Let me go.
- I won't.

222
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,890
- Let me go.
- Just talk.

223
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,050
- Let me go.
- I won't.

224
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,850
Help!

225
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,450
Help! I can't swim!

226
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,890
Hey!

227
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,570
Hey!

228
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,610
Hey!

229
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
Hey!

230
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Hey!

231
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,790
Hey!

232
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,780
Hey!

233
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,090
Hey!

234
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,530
I'm right here.

235
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,290
I knew that you wouldn't let me drown.

236
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,590
You fooled me?

237
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,990
Nope.

238
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,650
- Where're you going?
- Let me go.

239
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,210
- Let me go!
- If you refuse to talk to me today,

240
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,250
I will hold you like
this, not letting you go.

241
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,970
- Okay?
- Hey!

242
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,330
- Let me go!
- I won't.

243
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Let me go!

244
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,770
We can talk when we're up on the shore.

245
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,790
You're not running away?

246
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,130
Hey!

247
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,890
Hey! You!

248
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,650
Why didn't you get changed
in your room properly?

249
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,930
You used a bathroom

250
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,850
and I'm so wet, I didn't want
to change in my bedroom.

251
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,890
It'd be a mess, I didn't
want to clean it up.

252
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,410
What's your deal about my cousin?

253
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Are you gonna marry her or not?

254
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,650
In six months,

255
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,130
my city will go back to Nanta.

256
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,210
Kalong, the new leader,

257
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,450
has a policy to seize all
assets from the royal families

258
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,930
to belong to the nation.

259
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,250
So it's all started from asset ownership?

260
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,970
It's more than that.

261
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,010
Kalong and my dad
didn't quite see eye to eye.

262
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,570
Kalong is now powerful.

263
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,490
He could kill my whole family

264
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,970
and seize our assets.

265
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,330
My dad made an agreement with Pin's family

266
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,170
to arrange our marriage.

267
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,010
Then the assets will be
transferred under her name.

268
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,930
And my whole family will be moved here.

269
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,290
So Pin is just your money's route?

270
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,930
I don't want it to end up that way.

271
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,090
That's why I'm seeking
help from the Field Marshal.

272
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,690
But my family won't agree with the plan.

273
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,170
So I can't tell anyone.

274
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,850
I'll wait until I'm done talking to him

275
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,130
then I'll tell everybody.

276
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,810
You don't want to use my cousin.

277
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,170
But she will be devastated
if she can't get to marry you.

278
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,370
Marriage without love

279
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,530
will ruin her even more.

280
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,490
I know that if the wedding is canceled.

281
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,890
Pin's family will gain bad reputation.

282
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,530
I'll make up for it.

283
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Good.

284
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,730
I won't tell anyone about it yet.

285
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,410
But when it's time

286
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,490
you need to tell her the truth.

287
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,050
And you need to apologize
to her, on your knees.

288
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,690
You got me?

289
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
Got it.

290
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,480
I know that I did the wrong thing.

291
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,210
Good.

292
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
What're you laughing at?

293
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,170
Isn't it too large for you?

294
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,410
It's like a kid wearing his dad's shirt.

295
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,570
It's your shirt.

296
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,610
No pants?

297
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,650
Get them for me, where are they?

298
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,010
You look good without them.

299
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
Wait a minute.

300
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,810
My baby, my whole body is aching.

301
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,450
Kamsu!

302
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,170
He hurt me until I was hospitalized.

303
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,970
I need to get back at him.

304
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,410
My baby, before we left the house,

305
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,650
we didn't turn off the lights?

306
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,040
We did turn them off.

307
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,650
Who're you?

308
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Mr. Kalong?

309
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,480
Who did you get into a fight with?

310
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,970
How long have you been here?

311
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,330
Not too long.

312
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,890
Kamfah's people hurt you real bad.

313
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,690
It's okay, I can take it for Nanta.

314
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,410
How soon can I meet the Field Marshal?

315
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,170
I'll arrange it soon, but
he's not feeling good.

316
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,120
He goes in and out
of hospital all the time.

317
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,530
It's hard to talk to him.

318
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,370
Wait, you're gonna meet
the Field Marshal too?

319
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,810
Sure I am.

320
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,490
I won't let Kamfah
transfer his assets easily.

321
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,050
He is trying to get the Field
Marshal of Thailand involved.

322
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,530
It means that he is
trying to get foreigners

323
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,280
interfering with Nanta's internal affairs.

324
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,430
If that's true,

325
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,450
then he'll face a harsh penalty, right?

326
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,770
He will be considered as a threat
to the nation, facing the death penalty.

327
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,510
Oh my brother.

328
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,480
- Well done.
- Why don't you try?

329
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,950
Sure.

330
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,770
Here.

331
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,010
Okay, put your right hand here.

332
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,330
Hold it, okay.

333
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,370
You're good at this.

334
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,090
Let's keep it down.

335
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,850
Keep it down, okay?

336
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,890
Sasin, Saenkaew.

337
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,090
You two made up and you forgot about me.

338
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,170
Why did you say that?
No one forgot about you.

339
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,410
Doesn't matter. You
two are hanging out together.

340
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,650
Now I'm mad.

341
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,730
You need to take me out to make it up.

342
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm going faster than you are.

343
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,010
Let's go faster.

344
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,210
Saenkaew, we should take a boat ride.

345
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,370
This is not okay. I want
to ride with Saenkaew.

346
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,560
You should stay there.
I don't want you to fall into the river.

347
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,530
I feel bad seeing Pin this way.

348
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,810
If she finds out about
canceling the wedding,

349
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,530
she will be crying her eyes out for sure.

350
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,070
Should I tell her now?

351
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,450
You said that you
don't want to tell anyone.

352
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,850
I've been thinking about
it and it's not fair for her.

353
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,850
I'm worried that she will lose it
when it goes further than this.

354
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,330
Let's wait until your plan
with Ms. Songsawat succeeds.

355
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,410
In the meantime, I'll distract Pin away from
you so she won't get any more involved with you.

356
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,090
You two need to come back right now.

357
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,210
I'm so lonely being up here by myself.

358
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,130
Okay.

359
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,330
Let's go.

360
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,770
This is not fair.

361
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,130
You left me here by myself.

362
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,970
Come on, you didn't join the boat ride.

363
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,170
But I picked this one for you.

364
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,370
For me?

365
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,890
Of course, I've never left you out.

366
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,630
Pretty?

367
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,550
Yeah.

368
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,370
I'll fold one for you.

369
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,040
No need to.

370
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,530
Let it go, I can do it.

371
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,330
I can do it.

372
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,450
See?

373
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,210
You like it?

374
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,570
How could you eat it? So bitter.

375
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:23,290
You ate the strong
one with little root inside.

376
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,930
You need to eat the young ones like this.

377
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,350
So sweet.

378
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,530
You acted like a crocodile
lying across the river.

379
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,810
I wanted to talk to Saenkaew
and you got in my way.

380
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,610
- Can I ask you something? If you don't marry him…
- Why don't I marry him?

381
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,540
When his dad is here,
he will arrange the wedding.

382
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,410
Just maybe, maybe.

383
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,130
I just want you to think about it,
of how you will live your life.

384
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,010
I don't like this kind of scenario.

385
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,970
Well?

386
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,430
What if Saenkaew didn't see
you more than just his sister?

387
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,890
If you continue to talk like
this, I'll get mad for sure.

388
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,400
I just want you to prepare yourself

389
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,250
- if he doesn't love you.
- He doesn't love me now

390
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,450
but he will love me when we stay together.

391
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,570
I'm sure that I can make him love me.

392
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,810
You can't force love.

393
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,570
Why did you say force?

394
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,770
I'm not forcing anyone.

395
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,170
I'm just saying that if we live together,

396
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,010
he will give me a chance
and get to know me,

397
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,370
then he will like me for sure.

398
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,210
What kind of conversation is this?

399
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,750
I was just teasing you.

400
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,490
It's not funny and you
can't say that again.

401
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,850
Please, I beg you.

402
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,940
(French Consulate, Chansaeng)

403
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,130
Hello.

404
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,450
My people told me that
you need to see me urgently.

405
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,650
- What's going on?
- Have a seat.

406
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,570
I was reported that Gen. Kalong

407
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,410
left Chansaeng already.

408
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,570
- He went back to Nanta.
- He didn't.

409
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,130
He flew to Bangkok, Thailand.

410
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,210
I'll meet the Field Marshal on Friday.

411
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,970
Why don't you come with me?

412
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,490
Thank you so much.

413
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,730
What was his reaction?

414
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,730
I haven't told him about you.

415
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,920
I'll let you talk to him first.

416
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,300
From what I see, if it
concerns international issues,

417
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,010
I don't think he would like to be involved.

418
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,940
I may have to talk to at least one minister
who's powerful enough.

419
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,530
I'd like to meet Gen. Sa-nguan,

420
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,290
a minister of foreign affairs.

421
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,090
I'll make an appointment for you.

422
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,290
I won't let the nation's
traitors get away with this.

423
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,590
Hey!

424
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Hey!

425
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,690
Hey!

426
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,110
No!

427
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,390
What is it?

428
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,370
Let's go to the night club.

429
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,410
Right now?

430
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,810
Right now, so we can talk.

431
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,770
Come on, let's go.

432
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,110
Hurry up.

433
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,810
Come on.

434
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,250
I asked Pin about it, indirectly.

435
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,310
What'd she do if she couldn't marry you?

436
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,410
What did she say?

437
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,090
What do you think? She's mad at me.

438
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,970
She even said that if
you didn't love her now,

439
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,250
you'd love her later when you two
lived together. Can you believe that?

440
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,010
Let me talk to her.

441
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,210
I don't think so. I tried to spare her
feelings and she was so mad at me.

442
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,820
If you asked her directly,
she couldn't take it.

443
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,890
I shouldn't have made her sad.

444
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,730
But I understand her

445
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,970
for falling in love so hard with you.

446
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,530
I mean, look at you. You're so handsome,

447
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,010
you're nice, come from
good family, you're soft

448
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,930
and you're kind.

449
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,410
I'm not that perfect.

450
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,930
If you know my true self,

451
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,490
you would be disgusted with me.

452
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,890
Then just tell me.

453
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,770
You thought that it was bad,

454
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,770
perhaps I like that side of you.

455
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,930
Pin?

456
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,530
You scared me.

457
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,850
What're you doing here?

458
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,450
It's so late, why aren't you in bed?

459
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,610
Where did you go out with Saenkaew?

460
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,570
Why did you need to sneak out?

461
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,530
We went to the night club.

462
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,330
You usually invited me to join you.

463
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,250
We went there together,
just the three of us.

464
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,130
Why didn't you invite me tonight?

465
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,450
Sasin?

466
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,930
Are you hiding something from me?

467
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,870
Or…

468
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,770
you took Saenkaew to meet another woman?

469
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,670
No, it's not like that.

470
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,170
I saw Saenkaew look so tense lately.

471
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,280
I wanted him to loosen up so we
just hung out and listened to music.

472
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,850
If you don't believe me, you
can ask Mingmitr and Sanya.

473
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,970
I'm sorry.

474
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,610
It's all in my head.

475
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,170
I trust that

476
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,490
you will be the last
person to hurt my feeling.

477
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,850
I promised your mom that
I would take care of you.

478
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,290
I intend to keep that promise.

479
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,770
Don't let me be alone again, okay?

480
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,090
I'm so lonely.

481
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,130
Sure.

482
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,410
Come here.

483
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,330
Why do we have to come here?

484
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,130
It's better to come to this place.

485
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,530
We won't find anyone we know here.

486
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,410
Pawnshop.

487
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,570
Hello, you two.

488
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,210
Wow!

489
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,530
You're struggling so bad
that you need to visit the pawn shop?

490
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,330
I'm sorry, was I too loud?

491
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,650
You are no different.

492
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,370
No, I'm not. I'm here to buy something.

493
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,530
But you're trying to pawn something.

494
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,210
I see.

495
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,530
You think that you already caught
a big fish by having my nephew

496
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,770
as your son-in-law and
you'll be comfortable?

497
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,690
It's not quite right to
say that he's a big fish.

498
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,410
Your brother and I have
a really good agreement.

499
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:23,570
It's weird that you're his brother

500
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,130
and you have a Thai wife,

501
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,850
why didn't Prince Kamfah
let you store any of his assets?

502
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,970
Just keep talking, sir.

503
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,970
You're so sure that your daughter

504
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,570
will marry Saenkaew and
earn a fortune from him.

505
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,330
Just so you know, Saenkaew is trying

506
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,370
to stop the wedding.

507
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,650
- Excuse me…
- Wait.

508
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,100
What the heck are you talking about?

509
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,250
If you don't believe me,

510
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,410
why don't you ask your future son-in-law?

511
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,410
Why did he try so hard

512
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,330
to store his assets

513
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,970
with the Field Marshal?

514
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,810
He's about to marry your daughter.

515
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,940
I met Prince Inthorn today.

516
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,670
He said that you're trying

517
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,760
to cancel the wedding with Pin.

518
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,290
Is it true?

519
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,970
Please don't listen to him.

520
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,730
Inthorn is trying to cause

521
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,850
drama between you and Kamfah.

522
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,290
He wants Prince Kamfah's assets

523
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,690
so he tried to stop the wedding.

524
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,850
Can you explain why Prince Inthorn

525
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,370
said that you're trying to
meet with the Field Marshal

526
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,330
and ask him to store your family's assets?

527
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,090
Sir?

528
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,090
Stop talking.

529
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,850
I booked train tickets for everyone.

530
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,050
Please pack up and go back to your city.

531
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:27,610
I'll cancel your wedding.

532
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,930
Please calm down.

533
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,290
This is just a misunderstanding.

534
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,650
I don't care.

535
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:39,450
I can't tolerate you
insulting us like this.

536
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,250
I need to protect the
family's pride and dignity.

537
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,890
Is anybody around?

538
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,690
Come and help them
pack up their belongings.

539
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,690
Is anybody around?

540
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,410
- Is anybody around?
- Khunying?

541
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,650
- Please calm down.
- Don't touch me.

542
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,930
Is anybody around?

543
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,060
Grandma?

544
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,770
- Grandma.
- Grandma!

545
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:05,770
Sir?

546
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
Grandma?

547
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,770
- Grandma.
- Please just lie down.

548
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,290
How are you feeling?

549
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,910
You want to see a doctor?

550
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,130
I'm doing fine.

551
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,850
You need to tell them

552
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:41,010
that this is just a misunderstanding.

553
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,690
You don't want to cancel the wedding.

554
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,810
You don't need to worry about that now.

555
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,060
You need to worry about your health.

556
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:55,610
If you care about me,
you need to promise me

557
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,930
that you will marry Pin.

558
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,450
What is it?

559
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,170
Promise me.

560
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,170
You know what to do, right?

561
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,570
Prince Kamfah told me to give you this

562
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,970
to guarantee that the
wedding between both of them

563
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,090
will happen for sure.

564
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,010
I need to apologize to both of you

565
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,410
for letting my uncle
cause troubles like this.

566
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,610
I should have explained
since the beginning.

567
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,410
You don't have to do that.

568
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,550
Please have a seat.

569
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,090
Actually, I was too quick to judge

570
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,850
you like that.

571
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,860
Well, I didn't

572
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,730
feel great when I learned

573
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,770
that my daughter's dignity got destroyed.

574
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,850
Grandma,

575
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,610
I need to apologize to you.

576
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,770
I shouldn't have been that furious

577
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,730
and listened to his words.

578
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,050
- I feel really bad.
- It's okay.

579
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,890
Please have a seat, Khunying Wad.

580
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,290
I'm not mad or anything.

581
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:06,090
I'm happy that both of you

582
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,090
won't cancel the wedding.

583
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,650
I can guarantee you that

584
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,290
I won't trust anything

585
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,210
that comes out of Prince
Inthorn's mouth anymore.

586
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,490
- Your plan got exposed?
- That's right.

587
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,530
I don't know how my
uncle found out about this.

588
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,250
You don't think that I told him, do you?

589
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,530
I would never think that.

590
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,660
Come on.

591
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,170
You're gonna meet the Field Marshal
with Ms. Songsawat tomorrow.

592
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,370
If he agrees with the plan,
then it's gonna go well.

593
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,290
I can talk to Pin about it.

594
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,820
But…

595
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,650
what if it didn't go well?

596
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,010
My grandma's health condition
acted up because of me.

597
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,770
It's because of me.

598
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,410
I made everyone sad.

599
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,410
Just like I did to my mom.

600
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,250
If something happens to
my grandma, how could I live?

601
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,290
I shouldn't have been born.

602
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,450
I caused troubles.

603
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,610
My mom died because of me.

604
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,190
If she hadn't had me,
she would have been alive.

605
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,330
And my dad wouldn't be in sorrow like this.

606
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,570
This is not your fault.

607
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,450
I know that you're trying to fix it.

608
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,810
It's gonna get better.

609
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,850
You still have me.

610
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,670
Don't cry.

611
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,410
I should go to sleep.

612
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,530
I need to see the Field Marshal
with Ms. Songsawat tomorrow.

613
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,970
You can't see him now. He has guests.

614
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,010
What guests? Who got here before me?

615
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,890
I told you that I'll be here today.

616
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,010
He asked you to wait.

617
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,090
I'm not waiting. If
he's mad, I'll handle it.

618
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,570
Let's go.

619
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,300
Sir? Why didn't he let me in?

620
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:14,930
Dad?
