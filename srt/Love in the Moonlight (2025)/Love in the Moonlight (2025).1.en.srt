1
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:16,914
Nanta

2
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:19,620
is a country that is filled with forests
and abundant natural resources.

3
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,780
It was once being prosperous from trading

4
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:24,020
and it was targeted by France.

5
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,340
When conflict of interest led to a war,

6
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,460
Nanta couldn't do anything but lost its major city

7
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:33,140
called Chansaeng to France.

8
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:36,460
France had ruled the city for 50 years
in exchange for Nanta's peace.

9
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,580
As Nanta started to become a republic and

10
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,140
ended its old monarchy system,

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,260
Chansaeng, a city being colonized by France,

12
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:49,420
surprisingly maintained its own roots and traditions.

13
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:52,860
The agreement will end soon.

14
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,140
And Chansaeng

15
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,500
will return to Republic of Nanta.

16
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,620
1963 ( 2506 BE )

17
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:03,740
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

18
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,300
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

19
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,020
WE NEED FREEDOM!

20
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,820
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

21
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:15,100
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,140
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

23
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:22,140
Chansaeng City was colonized by a foreigner for 50 years.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,060
We will gain freedom in six months.

25
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,380
- We want to be ruled independently, don't we?
- That's right!

26
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,420
- We don't want to be a part of Nanta anymore, do we?
- That's right!

27
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,781
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

28
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,660
WE DON'T WANT NANTA!

29
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:55,223
Today, we're holding an offering ceremony

30
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,543
to our ancestors and holy ghosts.

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,100
Please take care of our family, our house,

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,140
and people of Chansaeng.

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,100
May peace be with the city.

34
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:45,460
Princess Sridara.

35
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,940
Prince Kamfah and his son are here.

36
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,021
Kamfah?

37
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,750
How was your discussion with Nanta going?

38
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,900
We will be combined with Nanta in the next six months.

39
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,900
I'm so worried about this.

40
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:06,224
Grandma,

41
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,660
don't worry about it.

42
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,340
Our agreements remain the same.

43
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,260
Nanta understands us so well.

44
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:16,700
Even though there's no more monarchy system in Nanta,

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,420
we're still safe.

46
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,060
I also visited Uncle Lafah and he's doing well.

47
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,380
All royal family members in Nanta

48
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,820
can live their lives normally, like one of their citizens.

49
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:31,820
They no longer have their titles,

50
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,820
but the government still respects them.

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,540
As long as Mr.Santi,
the prime minister of Nanta, is ruling the nation,

52
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,343
after the handover,

53
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,060
it will be nothing change with our family.

54
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,380
Everyone needs to stay calm.

55
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,420
I, Gen. Kalong,

56
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,750
am ready and happy to serve people of Nanta.

57
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,100
From now on, people of Nanta will gain prosperity equally.

58
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,180
There will be no more elite class or capitalists

59
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,700
who took advantage of the nation like before.

60
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,820
I will steer the nation to the new era.

61
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:18,100
- You can't take that!
- Stop!

62
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:20,500
Stop! You need to stop now!

63
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
This is my order! Stop it!

64
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:24,138
Mr.Lafah!

65
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:29,220
These items belong to my ancestors.

66
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:32,940
Your ancestors who became wealthy from oppressing people?

67
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:35,780
I guess the former leaders must be too kind.

68
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,900
That's why royal family members and capitalists

69
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,100
own so many national properties like these.

70
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,500
I will bring Nanta to the new era.

71
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:48,780
All items that you used to own will return back to the nation.

72
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:52,460
- Sir? The cinerary urn!
- Stop that!

73
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,740
You need to stop right now.

74
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,300
You can't take my grandfather's cinerary urn!

75
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:57,220
Give it back to me!

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,340
I told you to give it back to me! Let it go!

77
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:03,660
- I told you to let it go!
- Honey!

78
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,860
There is no royal family's property.

79
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,000
There is only national property.

80
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:25,900
There is a new Nanta's leader.

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,060
Will it affect our city?

82
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,380
This Kalong guy is a headstrong leader.

83
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,200
- I'm afraid that the agreement…
- Prince Kamfah.

84
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,900
Prince Inthorn is here to see you.

85
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,821
Hi, brother.

86
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:54,680
How're you my beloved nephew?

87
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,660
Long time no see.

88
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,580
Come on, give me a hug. I missed you.

89
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:00,958
What do you want?

90
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,420
You know that I won't give you any money for gambling.

91
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:05,820
Come on.

92
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:08,460
Why're you seeing me in a negative way?

93
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,260
I'm here because I'm worried about you.

94
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,517
(Prince Lafah passed away.
Gen. Kalong shot the whole family.)

95
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,060
Lafah?

96
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,980
Kalong shot all of them in their house.

97
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:39,780
I heard that he would seize all properties from

98
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,620
royal family members in Nanta.

99
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,460
Dad? When Chansaeng is free from France

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,540
and handed over to Nanta,

101
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,811
then we will…

102
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,860
You will face the same situation
as Prince Lafah for sure, my dear.

103
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,800
Don't you worry, I always find solutions for you.

104
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,150
This is Duangkamol, she's my Thai wife.

105
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,300
Why don't you say hi to them?

106
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,000
Hello, sir.

107
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,770
Your Dad can transfer all of his assets

108
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,420
to Duangkamol, my wife.

109
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,181
And you can move to Thailand
before Chansaeng returning to Nanta.

110
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,100
Then Kalong can't do anything to us.

111
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,340
You think I'm stupid enough
to transfer my assets to your wife?

112
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,300
You will spend them all in casinos.

113
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,860
It's better to share some with me

114
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,220
than have Kalong seize all of your assets.

115
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,700
Let me go!

116
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm one of your bosses.

117
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,780
Get them out of here! Don't let them in anymore!

118
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,340
- Brother!
- Go!

119
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,270
You will be sorry for treating me this way.

120
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:50,900
Duangkamol! Hurry up and follow me!

121
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,931
Let me go!

122
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,620
- Let me go!
- Dad?

123
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,340
What should we do next?

124
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,300
My Little Prince,

125
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,780
your Dad went to see consul of France.

126
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,340
I'm sure they can find solutions for us.

127
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,340
Please come here and have a sip of tea to calm down.

128
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:30,618
Thank you.

129
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,701
Dad?

130
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:42,500
Homthip? Can you give us a minute?

131
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:43,798
Sure, sir.

132
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,140
Mr.Consul said that right now

133
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,300
France can help taking care of us.

134
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,860
Kalong can't do anything to us at the moment.

135
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,781
But…

136
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:06,780
After Chansaeng is handed over to Nanta,

137
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,600
France has no power

138
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,200
and can't interfere with internal affairs.

139
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,200
You meant that

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
in the next six months

141
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,600
our assets will be seized

142
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,020
and got shot just like they did to Uncle Lafah?

143
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,580
We still have time.

144
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,820
I already found a way out.

145
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:40,100
You need to get married with a Thai woman.

146
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,700
We can transfer assets to your wife

147
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:48,200
and relocate everyone to Thailand.

148
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:50,400
- Dad?
- Don't worry.

149
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,820
I already found you a wife.

150
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:58,500
Her name is Pin-anong.
She's Prince Bodin's daughter.

151
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,260
You knew her well.

152
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,460
They're close to us, they won't betray us.

153
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm not getting married.

154
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,380
This is about my entire life's happiness.

155
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,300
Why're you forcing me? You're so selfish.

156
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,700
Did you forget about riots around the city?

157
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:23,500
When Kalong ruled over Chansaeng,

158
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,180
things would get messier than this,
much more than this.

159
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,700
There will be nothing left in our family.

160
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,300
How dare you talk about your own happiness!

161
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,860
Who is the selfish one now?

162
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,500
Kamfah? Sankaew?

163
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,200
What's going on?

164
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,750
Can't you just talk it out in civil way?

165
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,100
If you don't want to do this for me,

166
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,860
at least you should do this for your grandmother.

167
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,460
She's getting older.

168
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,020
She shouldn't struggle in the last stage of her life.

169
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,140
(Sirichalalai Palace, Bangkok, Thailand)

170
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:31,380
What? You wanted me to get married?

171
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,200
I think it's about time.

172
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:36,600
I need to be honest with you.

173
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,800
You know it well that we're having a hard time right now.

174
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,171
We don't know when

175
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:44,550
the creditors would come here to seize this palace.

176
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,500
If you get married,

177
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,420
we'll earn dowry to save the palace.

178
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:53,780
- But I…
- Why're you so picky about this?

179
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,420
Your Dad and I took the best care of you

180
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,060
despite the fact that your mom was just a servant.

181
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,141
You had no intentions of giving back to us at all?

182
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,141
Pin.

183
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,780
Do you remember Prince Sankaew?

184
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,300
Prince Sankaew took care of you
when you went to study in Penang.

185
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,820
I already talked to Prince Kamfah

186
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,301
that you two should get married.

187
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,700
A daughter of a mistress

188
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,200
gets married to a homeless prince,

189
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,000
it seems like a perfect match.

190
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:47,020
Get married with Sankaew?

191
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,900
Get married with a man I have a crush on.

192
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,420
Sasin is so cool.

193
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:09,340
Of course, he is.

194
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,420
He's the best violinist of Rachawadee Club.

195
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,220
- Sasin, hi!
- Hi, Waewwan.

196
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,420
My birthday is next month.

197
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,300
I'd like you to…

198
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,660
play violin at my birthday party, can you?

199
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,340
I'd love to play at your birthday party,

200
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,420
but I'm not sure if I'm free.

201
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:04,980
If I accepted an offer from a pretty lady
and I turned you down later,

202
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:06,900
I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.

203
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,380
What about this?

204
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,980
I can have Mingmitr, a golden voice singer,

205
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:16,620
and Sanya, a good-looking guitarist,

206
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,200
to take care of you instead.

207
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:20,140
Happy birthday to you in advance.

208
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:22,158
See you later.

209
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,311
Where're you going?

210
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,741
What the heck?

211
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,940
Same as usual.

212
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,900
You have good talking skill
but you've never dated anyone.

213
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,660
I really want to know

214
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:34,380
who would pin someone flirty like you down.

215
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,340
If that person is not as pretty as my Rachawadee,

216
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,750
then I'm not interested.

217
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:42,000
Enough with your sweet talk.
I'm not falling for you.

218
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,340
Sasin.

219
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,460
Pin?

220
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,800
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

221
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,621
How are you?

222
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,571
Your drinks.

223
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,460
Thank you, Ms.Rachawadee.

224
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:15,340
Pin! Stop!

225
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,211
This one is mine.

226
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,021
Make yourself at home.

227
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,580
What's going on about your marriage?

228
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,421
There's nothing more to update.
I told you all about it.

229
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:32,860
You know that our palace is in a tough place.

230
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,820
Dad sold parts of our lands
and we barely have anything left.

231
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,800
The creditors want their money back.

232
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,000
They wanted me to get married,
earn dowry to save the palace.

233
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,220
But marriage without love won't last.

234
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:50,460
Who told you that it wasn't out of love?

235
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:52,200
Come on.

236
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:55,800
Even if you get married to Prince Sankaew
that you kept telling me about,

237
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,037
we still can't trust him.

238
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
I need to get married regardless.

239
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,860
You know that I can't disagree
with my dad and Khunying Wad.

240
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,820
It's a good thing that I get to marry Sankaew.

241
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,420
He's not a stranger to me.

242
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,960
If he loves you like you love him,

243
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,860
then I'm happy about this marriage.

244
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,980
As your brother, I still need to see

245
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,540
if he can pass my criteria.

246
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,940
And be the right man for you.

247
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
Grandma.

248
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,600
You're still up?

249
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,820
I can't sleep.

250
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,820
I'm worried about our house and city.

251
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,901
Chansaeng used to live peacefully.

252
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:45,900
I don't know what's going to happen in the next six months.

253
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,020
I heard that

254
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,061
old royal family members in Nanta were arrested

255
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,901
and killed, all of them.

256
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,260
They're our relatives.

257
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:06,300
It shouldn't have happened.

258
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,700
I worry that soon

259
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,540
all of us will be…

260
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,021
Grandma.

261
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,180
You don't need to worry about it.

262
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,700
As your grandson,

263
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,020
and an heir of Chansaeng family.

264
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,380
I will do anything to protect you.

265
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,820
Our family will be safe.

266
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,700
You have to believe me.

267
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,300
It's gonna be alright.

268
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,540
Did you pack up everything?

269
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,100
Yes, sir.

270
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,020
But I worry about Princess Sridara.

271
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,661
She has never left Chansaeng.

272
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,300
She has never been far from here.

273
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,800
Typical old lady.

274
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,460
She doesn't want to live anywhere else.

275
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,551
But it's better for her to leave.

276
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,181
If there's any riot in Chansaeng,

277
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,951
it'll be hard for her.

278
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,780
When you stay in Thailand,

279
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,860
you need to take care of everyone.

280
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,700
When I'm done with handling our assets,

281
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,740
I'll rush to Thailand to talk about marriage.

282
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,100
Prince Kamfah?

283
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,780
Can I say something to you?

284
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:00,420
I know

285
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,260
that you love Prince Sankaew so much.

286
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,820
About the marriage,

287
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,820
can you reconsider it?

288
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:15,000
I feel bad for him.

289
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,820
Sankaew told me

290
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,200
that he wants to marry Pin-anong.

291
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:23,700
He said that?

292
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,661
You think that someone like me would lie?

293
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,300
Of course not.

294
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:32,980
I just think that…

295
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,060
you already lost Princess Dueanpradap.

296
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:45,980
I'm worried that you could lose your son too.

297
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:57,860
You know it well

298
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:03,660
that I've already lost my one and only son.

299
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,060
What would others say about us

300
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,380
if this scandal leaked out?

301
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,060
You are going to taint our reputation

302
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,000
and ruin our family, you ungrateful son!

303
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:26,262
My Little Prince!

304
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,260
Please stop!

305
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:32,780
- Honey, please. I beg you.
- Don't stop me!

306
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,101
Dueanpradap?

307
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,901
Dueanpradap?

308
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,058
Dueanpradap?

309
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,700
It's better for him to get married.

310
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,340
Perhaps things will get better.

311
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,341
(Bangkok, Thailand)

312
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,900
Where are Prince Bodin's people?

313
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:30,380
I thought someone'd be here to pick us up.

314
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,980
Why don't you have a seat and rest here?

315
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,900
I'll look around for Pin.

316
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,800
- Please take care of her.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,511
Easy there.

318
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:03,220
Excuse me!

319
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,700
Out of the way!

320
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:46,900
Thank you for helping me.

322
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,200
"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 1)

323
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:19,864
Wait.

324
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,780
Are you Prince Sankaew?

325
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Your Grandma is with Prince Bodin's people now.

326
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,500
But we couldn't find you

327
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,800
so I walked around and looked for you.

328
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,460
How'd you know who I am?

329
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,500
I gave all credits to your Grandma.

330
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,500
She explained how you look so vividly.

331
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,244
How?

332
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,340
She said you wear all white, from head to toe.

333
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,800
And she said that you looked like…

334
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:04,478
Well, you really look like one.

335
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,421
Look like what?

336
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,980
A rabbit.

337
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,611
Hey!

338
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,980
Sankaew! This way.

339
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,860
Can you behave for once?

340
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,301
Hello, Uncle.

341
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,351
Hello, Khunying Wad.

342
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,660
I'm glad that Sasin found you.

343
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,141
I didn't know that you have an older brother.

344
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:38,340
He isn't her brother.

345
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,780
Sasin is Pin's cousin.

346
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,200
Her mom's relatives brought him along from Ayutthaya.

347
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,940
Prince Bodin was kind enough to raise him.

348
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,740
I just live there, in the palace,

349
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,220
my role is a little bit better than a servant.

350
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,300
Should we get going?

351
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:03,100
- Grandma must be tired, this way please.
- Please follow me.

352
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:37,100
You need to carry all of these to Thailand with you.

353
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,700
Hide them well, don't let anyone see them.

354
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,500
I will take care of selling our lands

355
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,900
and transfer assets in banks to Thailand.

356
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:49,700
- I will follow you as soon as I'm done.
- Got it.

357
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:57,200
Kalong has eyes and ears everywhere.

358
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,904
When you're in Thailand,

359
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,300
you need to be cautious.

360
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,100
You can't trust anyone.

361
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,331
Ouch!

362
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,101
Are you okay?

363
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:55,184
Excuse me!

364
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,260
Is everything all right?

365
00:31:11,477 --> 00:31:12,478
Hey!

366
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:32,784
What're you trying to do?

367
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,020
I asked what're you trying to do?

368
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:47,304
Let me go!

369
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:48,604
Let me go!

370
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,020
Let me go! Now!

371
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:54,200
- Who're you?
- Let me go!

372
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:56,958
Are you a thief?

373
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,340
Don't try to run! Thief!

374
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:44,358
Prince Sankaew?

375
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,020
What're you doing in my place?

376
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,061
Let me go first.

377
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:10,684
I'm sorry.

378
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,060
How did you get here?

379
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,701
I heard loud noise and someone yelled.

380
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,100
I thought that someone got hurt.

381
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,300
Right. It's my voice.

382
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,681
I went to a bathroom and I slipped.

383
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,340
I was drunk.

384
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:43,780
Since you're already here,

385
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,621
you wanna stay for a drink?

386
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,460
I have a lot to ask you.

387
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,901
But you're just sobering up.

388
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,500
You wanna continue drinking?

389
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,900
Who said I couldn't do it?

390
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,660
Well, normal people won't do something like this.

391
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:06,060
Come on, Mr.Sankaew.

392
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:10,780
Normal people won't sneak into
someone else's house at night either.

393
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,600
- Hey! I already told you that…
- Come on.

394
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,860
I was just kidding. You're too serious.

395
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,171
I'll pass.

396
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,380
I have something to do early morning.

397
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:28,420
I don't think I can stay for a drink.

398
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:31,058
I gotta go.

399
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,345
I'm not walking you out.

400
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,660
Something to do? Early morning?

401
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,660
My dad wants to leave this area as a garden.

402
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,020
Because he really likes a place by the river.

403
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:55,540
This is so nice and green.

404
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:02,380
I'll need to buy some ingredients for Luk Chup,

405
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,020
your grandma asked me to teach her tomorrow.

406
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:10,060
Thank you for taking care of her.

407
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,820
Let's go to the other side.

408
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:27,300
My mom and I used to live in a small house over there.

409
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,020
Now my dad lets Sasin stay there.

410
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm not sure if he's up yet.

411
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,900
I think we should go there and wake him up.

412
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,572
Let him sleep in. We shouldn't bother him.

413
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,100
I think he's gonna wake up in the afternoon.

414
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:52,900
Oh! You're here!

415
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,940
Why did you think that I'd be such a lazy person

416
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,740
who would wake up in the afternoon?

417
00:36:01,781 --> 00:36:03,940
I assumed from what I saw last night.

418
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,300
Last night?

419
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,551
Did you meet up with Sasin last night?

420
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,220
By coincidence.

421
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,460
Well, I don't think so.

422
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,140
- You intended to break into my house to see me.
- Huh?

423
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,140
Hey! I told you that it was just a misunderstanding.

424
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,900
Misunderstanding about what?

425
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,821
I'm so confused.

426
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,380
A thief broke into my house last night.

427
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,020
When I looked at him closely, it wasn't really a thief.

428
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,991
But he was…

429
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:38,778
A rabbit.

430
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,340
A rabbit?

431
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,940
- What rabbit?
- Pin.

432
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,697
If you want to hear a true version of this story,

433
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,580
this man had too many drinks, he was drunk

434
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,140
and he slipped to the floor so loud.

435
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,340
I was so shocked so I went inside to check on him.

436
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,580
That drunk guy blamed me for being a thief.

437
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,661
Well, that drunk guy felt bad about it.

438
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,860
He made it up by offering a drink.

439
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,940
He didn't expect that the other guy
would be disgusted by a poor drunk man

440
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:13,821
and turned down the offer.

441
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:14,898
Hey!

442
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:17,420
Looking down on people is not my trait.

443
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,261
I think we should call it off.

444
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm still confused.

445
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:27,140
But it looked like both of you got along really well.

446
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,300
I'm glad to see both of you this way.

447
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,420
Thank you for driving me around.

448
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,540
Otherwise, Sankaew and I
wouldn't get a chance to visit temples.

449
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,661
My pleasure.

450
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:28,220
I'm happy to drive you around today, just name a place.

451
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,600
I will take the best care of you

452
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:32,778
and Mr.Sankaew.

453
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,140
You should look ahead when you drive.

454
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,820
Why did you keep looking at the rearview mirror?

455
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:59,100
How did you know that I kept looking at the rearview mirror?

456
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,460
Whenever I looked into the mirror, I saw you staring at it.

457
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,820
Well, I'm driving, of course I need to
look at the rearview mirror all the time

458
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,060
for safety.

459
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,861
You're the one who keeps looking at me.

460
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,140
Hey! I didn't look at you.

461
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,157
- You didn't? Why did you…
- Whoa!

462
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,580
You two hit it off so fast.

463
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,700
You have no trouble with the conversation.

464
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:07,900
I pray to the Buddha statue here.

465
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,603
I feel so helpless

466
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,380
with no place called home.

467
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,861
I'd like to ask for your mercy.

468
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:23,200
Please enlighten me to find a way to save my house

469
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,981
from Gen. Kalong's cruelty.

470
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:29,500
I don't want Pin to be involved with this sadness and sorrow.

471
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,820
I don't want to see anyone in pain.

472
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:35,860
I don't want anyone to be distressed
because of me anymore.

473
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,901
Where's Pin?

474
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,341
Shopping.

475
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,340
For making dessert with your grandma.

476
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,701
Do you love Pin?

477
00:41:12,317 --> 00:41:13,318
Why did you ask?

478
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,820
You're getting married to her, I need to know.

479
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:21,940
Before her mom passed away,

480
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,901
she asked me to take care of her.

481
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,102
I already know her feelings about this.

482
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,260
And I want to know about your feeling,

483
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,020
to see if it's the same as Pin's.

484
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,500
Pin is a good person.

485
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,461
That's not my question.

486
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,260
I only mean well to her.

487
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,940
Still not my question.

488
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,340
Just tell me if you love her or not.

489
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:53,784
Not that hard.

490
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,900
It's not that simple to

491
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,800
explain people's feeling.

492
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,460
It seems hard when someone like you make it hard.

493
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,900
Love is simple.

494
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,420
If the two of you have the same feeling,
that is what matters.

495
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,980
But people tend to mix status, suitability,

496
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:35,100
and money with love.

497
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,340
For me, if I love someone,

498
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,700
I'll tell them how I feel.

499
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,060
If they love me back,

500
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,620
then they will be my happiness

501
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,540
and I will be theirs.

502
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,220
I don't care about social status, suitability

503
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,701
or other's opinions.

504
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:03,302
It's that simple.

505
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,700
If I can live my life as I please like you,

506
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,861
it'd be great.

507
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,750
Why's that? What's wrong with your life?

508
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,460
Wealthy people's lives or

509
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:32,220
royal family members' lives are much
better than a low-income musician like me.

510
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:35,104
What about my question?

511
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,020
How do you feel about Pin?

512
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,740
My feeling

513
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,140
is none of your business.

514
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,021
It's in my heart.

515
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,660
I don't need to share it with you.

516
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,061
(National Bank of Chansaeng)

517
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,020
Please let your people in Thailand know that
they can open bank accounts.

518
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,220
I will take care of transferring money and all assets

519
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:38,020
to your new bank accounts in Thailand as soon as possible.

520
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,550
Thank you so much.

521
00:44:42,021 --> 00:44:44,300
- Please make it quick.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,611
Mr.Kamfah.

523
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,500
I hope you don't mind that I called you a mister.

524
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:04,220
There are no more royal titles back in Nanta
for quite a while now.

525
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,541
I didn't expect to see you here.

526
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:09,604
Why's that?

527
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,500
This bank is taken care by Chansaeng.

528
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,800
But in the next six months,
Chansaeng will be combined with Nanta.

529
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,100
I'm here to check on it.

530
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,300
I hope you know that

531
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:31,000
after Chansaeng going back to Nanta,

532
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:34,060
it will be inspection of bank's transactions

533
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,900
to see if there's any abnormal asset transfers.

534
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:40,824
Got it.

535
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,420
I hope you won't be involved with anything

536
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,780
that could lead to troubles in the future.

537
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,620
Got it, General.

538
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,580
Wait a minute, Mr.Kamfah.

539
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,700
Where is your son, Sankaew?

540
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,580
Why are you asking about him?

541
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,220
I was just being polite.

542
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,021
Politeness

543
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,460
doesn't suit you well.

544
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,100
I'm a soldier.

545
00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:16,580
I'm familiar with rules and orders only.

546
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,461
I'm not familiar with manners.

547
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,820
It must be irritating to a royal family member like you.

548
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,981
When Chansaeng is handed over to Nanta,

549
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,820
I'll teach you rules and orders like we do in military.

550
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:32,618
Sounds good?

551
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,821
Sir?

552
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,150
I don't know how much he knows about our plan.

553
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,300
I'm so worried about my son.

554
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:06,380
My feeling

555
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:09,580
is none of your business.

556
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,860
It's in my heart.

557
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,380
I don't need to share it with you.

558
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,540
What do you feel inside?

559
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,820
Why're you playing such a sad song?
