1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,760
   

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,420
♫  Just tell me you can get up, so, so  ♫

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,920
   

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,720
    
 ♫  Just tell me you can do anything  ♫

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:31,260
   

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,470


7
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,700
Wh-What is it? Do you see something?

8
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,860
Will I pass this time?

9
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,020
I could see something...

10
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,450
I see one Dol hareubang. 
  (T/N: stone statues) 

11
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,270
Dol hareubang?

12
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,920
One shrunken Dol hareubang.

13
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,890
It isn't standing?

14
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,980
Not standing.

15
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,230
Then what does that mean?

16
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,850
It probably doesn't mean a good thing since it isn't standing.

17
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,610
Without getting employed, maybe it means this life isn't good.

18
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,800
Hey, Kim Myung Ja.

19
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,510
Oppa! Myung Ja?! I am Jennifer now. 
  (T/N: how a female calls an older brother, also used for romantic partners) 

20
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,960
It's been a while since I changed gender. Why can't you still get my name right?

21
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,890
- Oh, sorry. 
 - Forget it and just write a talisman.

22
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,750
Talisman?

23
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,260
Seeing that I had a good dream last night,

24
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,420
the talisman I'll write today

25
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,350
is going to be good.

26
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,110
That's how the talisman will be?

27
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,760
There will be good energy, so just trust me and

28
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,570
pay 50,000 won. 
  ($50) 

29
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,830
That's too expensive!

30
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,220
What does it mean to be a good person?

31
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,060
This is when you help one another.

32
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,560
Oppa will be happy to call me, and I will be able to raise money and

33
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,730
get surgery.

34
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,380
It's fine if you don't want to. I don't care if things go wrong for you.

35
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,020
I was going to buy a study book with this.

36
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,070
You already bought a lot of study books until now, and did you pass the civil service test?

37
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,850
Just bet on the talisman this time.

38
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,680
This is true, right??

39
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,480
Of course!

40
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,020
Okay, let's do it.

41
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,680
So what was the dream that was great yesterday night?

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,550
Oh that?

43
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,560
In my dream last night,

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
I was dating Song Joong Ki.

45
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,800
What? Forget it, don't write one.

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,510
You'll taint the talisman.

47
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,880
 I am a loser. After college, I've been stuck in a dorm 

48
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,000
 preparing for the civil service test for six years. And so 

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,310
 the things that others have, I don't have them. 

50
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,900
 Job, house, car, 

51
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,400
 girlfriend, money, looks. 

52
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,890
 Today is DoHyun High School, 3rd year, Room 1 Reunion, 6 pm at Jongro, 

53
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,600
 at "Double Plus Beef Love". See you later. 

54
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,290
 Just like there is ranking for beefs, there is also for people. 

55
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,430
 There is the silver spoon born, attractive looks, 

56
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,490
 given all of God's blessing, a totally perfect being. 

57
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,500
  But if you work at a well-known company,  

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,170
  you can cover your appearance with money at One Plus rank.  

59
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,760
  Lastly, the bottom rankers.  

60
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,060
  If anything, you've got to dispose of this kind of meat. 

61
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,890
  I am  

62
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,500
  a useless bottom ranker that needs to be disposed of. 

63
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,980
 Bottom rankers cannot even think of getting on the same grill as Two Plus rankers. 

64
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,120
  It's the world that they live in. 

65
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,340
  Even cringeworthy actions like that look good when a Two Plus rank does it.  

66
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,410
  If I do it, it'd be such a show.  

67
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,190
What are you doing?

68
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,230
- Apologizing? 
 - Apology?

69
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,900
This is an apolog—

70
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,420
If I don't do that, you're going to complain.

71
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,300
Here, get in.

72
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,230
- Ji Hyuk. 
 - Yes?

73
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,650
If you told my friends that you would buy dinner and then suddenly disappear,

74
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,000
what do I become?

75
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,970
Hey, what can I do if I fall asleep because I'm tired?

76
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,030
Criticizing me for something I couldn't control?

77
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,860
You're being petty.

78
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,660
Petty?

79
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,600
Eat the delicious food and lift your mood.

80
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,070
It is very difficult to dine here.

81
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,270
Did you think this would make me feel better?

82
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,020
Hasn't it?

83
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,790
You really don't know what I want.

84
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,390
I wanted to get a sincere apology from you.

85
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,650
Even if we just have ramen on the streets.

86
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,560
Honey, I really wanted you to know my heart

87
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,980
and apologize.

88
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,050
- Why are you laughing? 
 - Nothing.

89
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,440
I just think it's cute that you're acting so simple.

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,560
- What did you say? 
 - You know.

91
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,960
If I spend a lot of money to make you feel better, I'm not being sincere.

92
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,820
But if I just apologize simply, that's sincere?

93
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,870
So let's not argue of something that's not that important.

94
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,820
You're not going to be angry for too long anyway.

95
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,250
Let's just break up.

96
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,930
Ok I got it, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,790
Can't you understand me?

98
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,760
Let's break up.

99
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,830
I know that by "let's break up",

100
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,590
you mean "beg".

101
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,360
You actually don't have the heart to break up.

102
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,470
How exactly are you so confident?

103
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,070
There's no reason for me to not be confident.

104
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,720
From all the people you know, is there someone better than me?

105
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,620
So stop being stubborn, and let's not be angry anymore.

106
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,800
There is.

107
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,810
- What? 
 - A better man than you

108
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,200
was there for me.

109
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,590
Listen, I've known you since you were twenty.

110
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,890
I met him before that.

111
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,780
My first love.

112
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,170
First love?

113
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,070
Someone you've never met before, someone much better than you. My first love.

114
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,880
So who is he?

115
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,080
   

116
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,060
Welcome.

117
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,770
Welcome!

118
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,270
We have to do it together!

119
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,710
I'm kidding!

120
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,500
Wh-Why?

121
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,760
Hey!

122
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,300
Aren't you Do Yong Shik?

123
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,130
Is he really Do Yong Shik?

124
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,590
Our class president, Yong Shik.

125
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,310
  Ah, so you know Yong Shik.  

126
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,640
Nice to meet you.

127
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
  Please sit here. 

128
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,750
Hey, it's nice to see you.

129
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,300
I almost couldn't

130
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,550
recognize you.

131
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,000
 What happened? 

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,210
 They definitely said that the get-together would be at the "Double Plus Beef" place. 

133
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,740
Glad that we came here for our second round.

134
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,730
Earlier we were talking about why you weren't around,

135
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,440
but you're working part-time here.

136
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,900
"Part-timer".

137
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,280
This apron looks good on you. Carry on.

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,090
Were you eating something?

139
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,190
Let's-Let's eat the meat.

140
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,010
That's good.

141
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,880
Hey, don't be like that and sit down.

142
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
No, it's okay.

143
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,540
It's not that. If you're doing that, we won't feel comfortable.

144
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,280
Right.

145
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,610
Jerk, you don't listen.

146
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,240
Well.

147
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,280
Ye-Yes, sir.

148
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,120
I need something.

149
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,190
- About him. 
 -Yes?

150
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,540
- How much is his salary? 
 - 9... 9,000₩  ($9) .

151
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,720
9,000₩.

152
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,970
Just for two hours.

153
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,420
I will borrow him just for two hours.

154
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,790
Two hours??

155
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,130
Hey, Kim Tae Jin.

156
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,950
He's our classmate. It's a reunion we're having after a while so, shouldn't you join too?

157
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,950
Is it all right?

158
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,510
It's all right.

159
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,350
You and I agree!

160
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,790
Of course he needs to attend.

161
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,660
Sit comfortably. Your owner told you to sit comfortably.

162
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,880
Yeah, sit down.

163
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,060
Yeah... we feel uncomfortable.

164
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,960
I will cook the meat, so sit down.

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,460
She said she would cook the meat.

166
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,320
Stop making us uncomfortable and sit down.

167
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,880
Since I am paying, let's drink lots of soju.

168
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,980
Cheers.

169
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,130
Cheers.

170
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,330
So, Yong Shik, are you only working part-time?

171
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,240
I'm also preparing for exams.

172
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
Perhaps public service exams?

173
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,790
Yes.

174
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,120
Weren't you preparing for that exam since six or seven years ago?

175
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,490
Has it been so long?

176
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,140
Then again... I did hear that preparing for the fifth rank civil service exam is hard.

177
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,130
It is the fifth rank, right?

178
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,380
- It's the n-ninth rank... 
 - Ninth rank?

179
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,350
Wait... you have been preparing for ninth rank for six years?!

180
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,690
Even our previous class president Do Yong Shik became someone who preps for an exam...

181
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,960
I really thought things would work out well for Yong Shik.

182
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,720
Yeah... he was always the class president

183
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,300
and had a lot of popularity. You guys all like him.

184
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:43,070
Back then, I couldn't even come close to Yong Shik.

185
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,540
That was the person you were,

186
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,920
but now you are the person who is the most successful here. You never know what will happen to people.

187
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,690
You're right... I can't believe he is a venture company CEO at 31 years old.

188
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,470
That's impressive.

189
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,510
Hey, Hey... Being a CEO of a small IT company is not a big deal.

190
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,960
It's representative director!

191
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,080
What do you mean small company? Did you say the revenue was 30 billion won?

192
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,720
No.

193
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,440
50 billion won.

194
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,110
I took over a company with blockchain technology

195
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,030
and plan to launch a local delivery app.

196
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,520
Because of that, I couldn't go home for several days. It's been crazy.

197
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,840
It's really great.

198
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,710
Must be a different life from a salaried employee like me.

199
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,670
Let's cheer.

200
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,450
- Do it. 
 - Cheers.

201
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,780
Cheers.

202
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,080
Everything's great.

203
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,420
Who called him?

204
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,330
Okay, I'm sorry.

205
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,020
What does that make me?

206
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,420
It's been so long.

207
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,610
I saw that the bill turned out to be a lot.

208
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,260
No, it wasn't a lot.

209
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,860
Thanks!

210
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,890
Your car's nice.

211
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,650
Already?

212
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,950
So how is everyone getting back home?

213
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,720
I called a driver.

214
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,650
My wife is coming to pick me up.

215
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,860
I will be taking a cab.

216
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,600
Let's take cab. 
     

217
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,190
What about you, Yong Shik? How are you getting home?

218
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,930
My house is near, so I'll walk.

219
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,530
Just go in my car.

220
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,130
No, it's ok.

221
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,480
Go back safely.

222
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,770
Go.

223
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,330
I'll drop you.

224
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,220
Hey, Yong Shik.

225
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,410
Holy shit. Hey, are these...

226
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,840
all yours?

227
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,560
   

228
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,950
 If I were to admit one more thing... I am huge fan of pink. 

229
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,880
 According to color therapy, every person has a personal color that.... 

230
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,820
 eases their minds. 

231
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,490
 My personal color from a long time ago 

232
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,900
 is pink. 

233
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,380
 I don't know what the reason was, but from a certain point, 

234
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,950
 I started liking the color pink. 

235
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,050
 My attachment for pink officially grew worse 

236
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,220
 on the day I was taking the second civil service exam. 

237
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 The moment I became nervous, anxious, and unconfident... 

238
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,540
 I used a pink handkerchief to clean my face. 

239
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,570
 For some reason... 

240
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,620
 my mind was at ease and calmed down. 

241
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,140
 From that day on, in order to endure an uneasy life of a prep exam taker, 

242
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,360
 I started to buy things in pink color. 

243
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,350
 Then eventually, 

244
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,200
 just like today, I live surrounded by pink. 

245
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,980
 This is how it happened. 

246
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,470
 Because San Hyun's dad is turning 60, 

247
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,310
 he rented the most expensive hotel in Jeonju 

248
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,690
 and held a celebration. 

249
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,760
Is that so?

250
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,960
So...

251
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,590
You know your dad is also turning 60 years old next year, right?

252
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,340
I have to pass the test next year.

253
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,330
 Of course. 

254
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,460
Why is the test

255
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,450
so hard to pass?

256
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,780
You aren't an ordinary person.

257
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,830
 You were always class president. 

258
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,400
 And on top of that, your birth dream 

259
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,390
had a dragon wearing a crown!

260
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,720
Mom... do you think a civil service test is some easy test?

261
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,430
The competition is 37 to 1!

262
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,320
There is nothing special about me to easily pass!

263
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,450
Class president?! There is no point of being that even  a 100 times.

264
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,050
Birth dream? Even homeless people

265
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,000
all had birth dreams of dragon or tiger.

266
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,230
Paying for rent and daily expenses,

267
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,140
I have to work eight hours a day,

268
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,900
so how will I ever pass?

269
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,730
 Only those who deserve to complain can... 

270
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,700
 But you were always class president 

271
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,760
plus your birth dream was of a dragon wearing a crown!

272
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,620
 Me... I have no right to complain. 

273
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,220
I will work hard.

274
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,990
Yes.

275
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,460
Really, why am I even alive?

276
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,560
 Oppa. 

277
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,000
 Oppa, are you lonely? 

278
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,480
I am lonely.

279
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,340
 Lonely Oppa come here. I'll comfort you. 

280
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,030
   

281
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,040
 Humans are an ironic species. 

282
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,670
 They ponder why they live 

283
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,430
  and then immediately get taken over by instinct. 

284
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,700
 If this is something unavoidable by nature 

285
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,210
  then I will not resist. 

286
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,010
   

287
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,380
 Even if I'm a loser with nothing, 

288
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,070
 this is naturally how I prove that my physical health is in good shape. 

289
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:35,060
 "Don't squint your eyes or be grossed out", some movie somewhere said that. 

290
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,800
  Men who do not masturbate are one of two things. 

291
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,730
  Those who don't have hands or those with nothing down there. 

292
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,260
 Why... why is it like this? 

293
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,590
 This can't be... 

294
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,520
  I can't believe it. 

295
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,290
  This is a dream... 

296
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,320
  A dream... 

297
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,590
 This must be a dream! 

298
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:08,010
   

299
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,460
  It wasn't a dream. 

300
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,040
 What was actually supposed to stand, did not. 

301
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,510
  The hope that this is just a temporary thing is useless because 

302
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,720
 honestly, I've failed in real life for a long time. 

303
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,010
   

304
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,050
Just a minute.

305
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,740
What?

306
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,410
Couldn't you wear something different on a day like this?

307
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,790
Why are you like that all of a sudden? You said you liked these clothes too.

308
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,250
Right, I did say that three years ago.

309
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,980
You have been wearing the same clothes for the past three years,

310
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,430
and preparing for the civil service exam.

311
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,810
- Hee Jin. 
 - Right, I know it's hard for you too, so I didn't want to go this far

312
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,810
but today... It's hard for me to endure it too.

313
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:41,810
Because my boyfriend has no money or skills, I have to pay with my own money for this motel on my birthday! This whole situation...

314
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,970
it's so pathetic that it's killing me.

315
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,050
I'm going to be 30 next year, Oppa.

316
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,880
Just how long should I wait?

317
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,800
Just a little... If you would wait for a just little longer—

318
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,090
Why should I have to wait?

319
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,410
What?

320
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,280
Why should I have to?

321
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,950
You're supposed to date to be happy. But what happiness have I gotten from dating you?

322
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,190
Hee Jin...

323
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,920
Do you know that you're not even good in bed?

324
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,670
I'm tired of pretending like it's good just to boost your ego.

325
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,000
If you want me to pretend... you have to give me hope first.

326
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,980
But when it comes to you,

327
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,560
there's nothing for me to look forward to.

328
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,670
 The harsh words that my last girlfriend said 

329
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,200
 became a trauma and since then, 

330
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,740
 I couldn't get it to stand up in front of anyone. 

331
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,900
 But until then, it was okay because at any rate, 

332
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,340
 there wouldn't be a chance for me to use it in real life, however 

333
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,790
 this situation is different. 

334
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,630
 Even at home where there is no pressure... 

335
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,380
 Why... Just why in the world?! 

336
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,250
No.

337
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,000
This is just temporary. Don't worry, Do Yong Shik.

338
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,650
It will definitely rise tomorrow.

339
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,100
Don't worry. It's okay, it's okay.

340
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,560
It's okay, it's okay.

341
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,580
It's okay.

342
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,530
It's okay.

343
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,190
   

344
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,750
   

345
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,850
     

346
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,670
 What's going on all of a sudden? What happened here? 

347
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,890
Oh my... so the Dol hareubang

348
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,920
did that?

349
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,680
Your reading was spot on.

350
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,120
O-Oh my god.

351
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,090
Thirty-one is the age when you should be so active, but how did that become defective?

352
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,830
Then there is someone who has it working properly but is dying to have it removed.

353
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,070
Are you making fun of me?

354
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,100
Hey, you were a man at some point, so you should know how I feel!

355
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,730
Of course I know, it is like you are not living even if you are...

356
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,640
Write me a talisman or something.

357
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,600
- Talisman? 
 - Yeah, one that can raise... this thing.

358
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,620
I am a fortune-teller, not a magician.

359
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,600
Do you think talismans are like fairy wands?

360
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,780
Can't you do that for your Oppa?

361
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,990
Stop whining, and go to that um...

362
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,190
Just go to a urologist.

363
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,370
How can I go there? It's embarrassing.

364
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,490
And it's not embarrassing to get erectile dysfunction at thirty one?

365
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,600
Just close your eyes and go to the hospital to get treated.

366
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
It isn't like it is the Joseon era.

367
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,200
You can't live forever like a eunuch.

368
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,250
Even after your vasectomy, you need to use contraceptives for three months still.

369
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,860
Ah, yes.

370
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,390
It's completed.

371
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,020
After three months, please bring back your semen here.

372
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,470
Wait—

373
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,160
I don't think we're quite through yet.

374
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,420
Can you hold it and wrap it with a bandage a few more times?

375
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,380
It's because it hurts.

376
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,140
Fine.

377
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,690
Shall we look at it one more time then?

378
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,620
Even though it has erected fully,

379
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,690
the size is quite small.

380
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,010
I... I am?

381
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,180
Yes.

382
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,320
I see many male parts every day and still,

383
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,850
out of all of them, it is the

384
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,190
cutest.

385
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,080
I-It's not.

386
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,100
Our hospital also does enlargement fillers,

387
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,230
so whenever you want. Don't feel pressured.

388
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,670
Please come for a consultation.

389
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,840
Have a safe trip home.

390
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,640
Wait-Wait a minute.

391
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,800
Oh, I think a lot needs to go in so

392
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,140
prepare some money.

393
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,060
But it's not.

394
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,960
It's not, right?

395
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,030
You must be comparing it to those of foreigners.

396
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,670
Just sit down.

397
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,110
I think you are here to destress.

398
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,210
You seem to have a lot of time.

399
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,330
Your hospital must not be so busy.

400
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,810
In a society where 80% of the population has psychological disorders

401
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,440
do you think a psychiatrist wouldn't be busy?

402
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,850
I was just waiting to see you.

403
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,190
Are you still thinking of breaking up with me?

404
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,980
I don't make vain threats.

405
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,140
I was being honest about breaking up.

406
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,280
Well, if you break up with me,

407
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,440
do you have anyone to meet?

408
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,300
Of course.

409
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,450
Oh that awesome first love?

410
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,980
Yes. Now that I'm talking to you, it is making me even more curious about him.

411
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,690
He was awesome a long time ago, I wonder how great he is now.

412
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,870
What could he be doing now?

413
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,300
   

414
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,510
   

415
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,450
   

416
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,850
   

417
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,150
    

418
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,990
   

419
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,320
     

420
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,380
Why are you here again and not at your office?

421
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,710
I like it better here.

422
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,140
Holy crap, what is this?

423
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,930
Strangely if I play games in this room, I get a lot of items.

424
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,660
     

425
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,430
By the way, it got shorter.

426
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,900
Your coffee time as an excuse for a date.

427
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,120
We broke up.

428
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,850
"We broke up". Oh really?

429
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,890
You'd sooner shove Goliath into a toy car.

430
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,830
It's for real this time.

431
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,230
What's the reason this time?

432
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,130
I didn't feel like I was being loved.

433
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,190
Hey, think of the money Ji Hyuk has spent on you.

434
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,410
Is he crazy enough to do that for a woman he doesn't love?

435
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,590
I earn a lot too.

436
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,360
Apart from that, "this man really likes me"

437
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,570
is there a simple, yet warm action to convey that?

438
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,580
Getting me to laugh about nothing with witty sense.

439
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,830
Instead of expensive jewelry, having the maturity to move me with a bread tie.

440
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,890
Can't I wish for all of that?

441
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:04,160
A person like that can be compared to a unicorn.

442
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,110
He's not real.

443
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,530
It means he doesn't exist.

444
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,430
Switch rooms with me.

445
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,360
Amazing! What is this?

446
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,430
What are you here for?

447
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,130
I asked you why you are here?

448
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,620
That is—

449
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,980
Yes, go ahead.

450
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,880
It-It isn't getting erect.

451
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,420
That would be erectile dysfunction.

452
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,990
Please, fill this out first.

453
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,380
   

454
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,190
We'll start off with a basic exam.

455
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,350
   

456
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,530
Eastern or Western? Which one do you prefer?

457
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,980
- Sorry? 
 - I asked which one you prefer.

458
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,110
W-Western.

459
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,850
Western.

460
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,320
Take your time and deposit the semen here.

461
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,240
Were you not able to do it?

462
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,330
Please follow me.

463
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,150
I should stop.

464
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,760
A patient that can't masturbate and has erectile dysfunction has come.

465
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,380
Go.

466
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,770
Ethically speaking, you should go.

467
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,400
I did all the morning consultations.

468
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,820
Fine, you've worked hard.

469
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:35,080
But, I can't treat erectile dysfunction patients because it makes me feel guilty.

470
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,810
Why?

471
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,260
Actually, the remedy to that is something else.

472
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,620
It's not Viagra...

473
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,060
It's a new girlfriend.

474
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,430
How can I sell medicine hiding that fact, right?

475
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,300
I'll be going.

476
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,540
How can a doctor say such dog crap?

477
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,210
That's why it's better for a great doctor like you to treat him rather than a doctor like me.

478
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,090
Good luck.

479
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,650
Also, think twice before using such uncouth words like "dog crap" to your Sunbae next time. 
  (T/N: informal way to call a senior) 

480
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,930
Do I really have to bend down?

481
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes, a prostate massage includes having to put fingers in the anus.

482
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,570
F-Finger?

483
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,660
Yes. It's a basic exam, so please bend down.

484
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
I'm the doctor in charge. I'll start the test.

485
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,760
A-Are you a woman?

486
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm not a woman, I'm a doctor.

487
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,560
It was a male doctor in the ad though.

488
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,930
It ends in ten seconds. Please pull down your pants.

489
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,990
Pull it down more. More, more.

490
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,290
More.

491
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,120
Okay.

492
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,520
Raise your butt this way.

493
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,710
More, more.

494
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,880
More, more.

495
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,320
More, more.

496
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,090
Okay.

497
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,120
I'll be starting.

498
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,380
Please take a deep breath.

499
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,290
I'm putting in the finger.

500
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,920
  Let's bear it.  

501
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,970
Please bear it for a while.

502
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,310
  Let's bear it.  

503
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,060
  Bear it.  

504
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,410
You're doing great.

505
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,080
Yes.

506
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,220
 With patience I can avoid becoming a eunuch. 

507
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,720
It'll be done soon.

508
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,230
Okay.

509
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,500
It's done.

510
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,210
Since when has it not been able to get erect, Mr. Do Yong—

511
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,410
Yong Shik. Do Yong Shik.

512
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,850
Wait, are you that Yong Shik?

513
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,150
I'm sorry?

514
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,180
Are you really Do Yong Shik?

515
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,780
  It's her.  

516
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,730
  The one who filled my childhood years with a pink glow. 

517
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,950
  My first love.  

518
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,650
     

519
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,160
 The footage is so detailed! Wow! 

520
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,460
 W-What are you doing? 

521
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,220
 I'm going to put it up on the internet. 

522
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,060
 Since you want to show it so badly. 

523
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,660
 Give me this! You hear me? 

524
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,680
 I'll crush your phone! 

525
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,030
 Do it more. Do it more! 

526
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,360
 Hold on! 

527
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,060
 Don't do this! 

528
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
 Why? Show some more! 

529
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,710
 Are you okay? 

530
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,500
 - Yes. 
 - This area is known to be full of those kind of guys. 

531
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,930
 Didn't you know? 

532
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,620
 It hasn't been long since I transferred here. 

533
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,690
 I see. Next time, go around with your friends. 

534
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,480
 Hey! 

535
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,580
 "Hey"? 

536
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,690
 Your name tag's yellow, so I thought we're the same age. 

537
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,660
 Aren't you a freshman at Dohyun High School? 

538
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,020
 I'm a freshman at Hyein High School, Lee Ru Da. 

539
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,520
 Thanks a lot for earlier. 

540
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,660
 Sure. Be careful on your way. 

541
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:47,250


542
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,090
 You should look ahead while walking. 

543
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:02,860
♫  The bird with bent wings  ♫

544
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,080
♫  In the dark room  ♫

545
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,290
 Where do you live? 

546
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,680
♫  It stays alone  ♫

547
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,150
 That's right. I'm walking you home. 

548
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:16,570
♫  Tears fall down endlessly   ♫

549
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:21,190
  Those days when I didn't know I would downgrade to such a wretched loser... 

550
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,560
  In front of my first love who remembered me as a pretty decent guy.  

551
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,160
♫  I'm dreaming  ♫

552
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,200
You're really,

553
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,130
that Do Yong Shik from back then?

554
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,360
♫  A dream about flying  ♫

555
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,290
♫  Far, far...  ♫

556
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,190
  How do I appear in front of her? 

557
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:47,680
♫  Dream of flying high to reach the sky  ♫

558
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,960
   

559
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:20,570
♫  You quietly  ♫

560
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,460
♫  Without a word, you stay next to me  ♫
