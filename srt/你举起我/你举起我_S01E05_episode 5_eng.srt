11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,960
You. You said you can treat me, right?

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,420
♫  Your warm touch,  ♫

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,270
You said you can fix me. You said you can't watch me break down.

14
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,410
You said that, with your help,

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,840
I could do it too.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
♫  I can’t do anything  ♫

17

please, fix me!

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,540
Why are you here at this time, Oppa?

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,840
- Please, buy me a drink. 
 - What?

31
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,760
You see, this is the only place I can comfortably go to when I have no money.

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,750
Come in.

33
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,840
Are they out of their minds?

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,210
How despicable! There's a limit to playing with someone's feelings, but what? A bet?

35
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,700
How highly did they think of themselves to use someone's pain and make a bet?

36
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,390
I want to make voodoo dolls that look exactly like them and stab them with darts!

37
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,550
Forget it.

38
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,530
It happened because I'm a fool. The kind of person you can easily make a fool out of.

39
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,430
Oppa.

40
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,780
Why is my life in this state, Kim Myung Ja?

41
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,580
It's not Kim Myung Ja, it's Jennifer.

42
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:17,190
Oppa, why are you crying like a fool?

43
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,920
When this happens, you should get yourself together and proudly live a good life.

44
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,150
You know Talmud, right?

45
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,750
That person called Talmud said so: "Live a good life."

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,400
That's the best way to take revenge.

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,690
You should also proudly get your erectile dysfunction treated,

48
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,170
become a new man, and live a good life not feeling inferior to those two. That's how you take revenge. Got it?

49
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,100
That...

50
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,970
- Talmud is not a person. 
 - What?

51
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,230
- It's a book. 
 - Is that so?

52
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,120
I got confused because it's English.

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,870
It's Hebrew.

54
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,430
- It's not from the US? 
 - No.

55
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,370
By the way, how does a person who knows this much keep failing the exam?

56
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,200
Hey!

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right! It's better to see you getting mad like this. Don't be disheartened, Oppa!

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Cheers!

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,180
It's my first time seeing him like that.

60
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,280
You started this without knowing it would turn out this way.

61
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,170
You might feel bad but forget everything and—

62
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,430
- I want to fix it. 
 - What?

63
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,440
That's why, Ji Hyuk...

64
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,980
please, help me.

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,980
Ru Da.

66
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,710
To be honest, in the past few days I've tried a bunch of things as I was trying to treat him on my own.

67
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,060
It was too difficult.

68
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,830
You know that Yong Shik's illness is psychological.

69
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,160
I need your help.

70
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,880
Then what about us?

71
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,420
We'll talk about our problem after Yong Shik's treatment.

72
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,560
Let's talk about it later.

73
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,820
That's how it should be.

74
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:46,590
 The moment that you cause an accident, you don't have time to think about how to handle the aftermath. 

75
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,900
 But once your anger subsides and the time to settle things come, 

76
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,400
 whoever they may be, they swear inside and end up saying these words. 

77
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,900
 "Why did I do that?" 

78
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,840
 I hate the fool that I am too, so 

79
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,920
 please, fix me! 

80
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,200
Why did I do that?

81
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,390
 No matter how many times I ask myself, "Why did I do that?" 

82
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:28,820
 in the end, the problems I have don't disappear. In that case, there's only one way out. 

83
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:36,190
 However uncomfortable the situation may be, I must hold out. This is why you shouldn't make mistakes. 

84
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,950
I'm just going to a doctor to get treated. That's it.

85
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,820
Yes?

86
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,190
Do Yong Shik has arrived.

87
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,390
You're here. Oh... please sit down.

88
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,650
Since I'm here for treatment, let's not talk about other things.

89
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,240
I want to know the exact treatment plan going forward.

90
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,560
Who did you talk with and what?

91
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,650
I cannot treat you on my own. As you know, your erectile dysfunction is caused majorly by your psychiatric issues.

92
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,460
I definitely need help from an expert in that area.

93
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,050
So you and Dr. Do both will treat me?

94
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,900
Are you kidding me right now?

95
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,950
I know it's uncomfortable for you.

96
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,890
But if not for Ji Hyuk, you'll have to tell your entire background and all your problems to yet another doctor. That's not as simple either.

97
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:58,700
Ji Hyuk is a renowned doctor in this field. I'm sure he can help you.

98
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,030
I don't want.

99
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,870
Do you really want to fix it?

100
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,970
Were you being sincere when you asked me to fix you because you hate yourself so much?

101
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,530
Even so, are you trying to put your pride first?

102
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:25,800
If you really want to change then don't obsess over things as trivial as pride.

103
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,850
Anyhow, in this situation, Ji Hyuk and I are just doctors who want to treat you.

104
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,090
Because I'm really serious.

105
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,290
Firstly, I'd like to say that I regret how things have been in the past.

106
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,820
We caused you to get hurt because of our problems.

107
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,250
Please only talk about my treatment.

108
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,600
All right.

109
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,580
Before we can treat your erectile dysfunction,

110
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,360
we need to treat your... obsession.

111
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,760
My opinion is that we must start with getting rid of your obsession with the pink color.

112
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,110
You said that you don't know why you started obsessing over the pink color one day, right?

113
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,450
- Yes. 
 - There is a way to found out about it.

114
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:35,030
Let's go to the day where Do Yong Shik started to like the pink color first.

115
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,600
What do you see?

116
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,260
I see Ru Da.

117
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:52,000
She was wearing a pink color one-piece dress. We went to watch a movie,

118
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,640
and we had decided to dress as grown-ups as much as we could.

119
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,600
And after?

120
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,370
After watching the movie, we were on the way to our homes.

121
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,340
A glass window falling from above.

122
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,210
It's above Ru Da.

123
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,360
 It's okay. 

124
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,700
 It's okay. 

125
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,500
 It's okay. 

126
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,020
 It's all right. 

127
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,220
 It's okay. It's okay. 

128
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,620
 It's all right. It's all right.  

129
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,670
I open my eyes and

130
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,010
all I see is the pink color.

131
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:54,020
And I hear Ru Da's heartbeat.

132
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,780
What about Yong Shik?

133
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,710
He left.

134
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,380
It was because of me.

135
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,100
If I hadn't asked him to go to the movie with me,

136
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,100
Yong Shik wouldn't be fond of the pink color.

137
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,950
He wouldn't be so dispirited like that either.

138
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,270
It was all my fault.

139
00:15:52,490 --> 00:16:00,730
What he did to deal with his anxiety was entirely his choice.

140
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,800
You don't really need to feel guilty.

141
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,900
So, that's why I like pink color.

142
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,530
I hope Ru Da doesn't feel guilty about it.

143
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,690
There's no way that would actually happen. They played with me after all.

144
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,520
You came back.

145
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,780
Ru Ri... What should I do?

146
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,640
So Yong Shik got to know the bet you guys made about him?

147
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,680
I knew this would happen.

148
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,010
That's why I told you not to go play with a person's feelings like that!

149
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,690
I feel so sorry. What should I do?

150
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,970
First of all, you haven't apologized to him yet, right?

151
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,180
Apology?

152
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,520
For making a bet on him, for hurting him,

153
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,000
and for unknowingly being the reason for his obsession with the pink color.

154
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,790
Too much to apologize for?

155
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,000
I feel so guilty about it, I'm not sure I'd be able to get the apology out of my mouth.

156
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,330
But if you think about Yong Shik, you should apologize properly.

157
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:38,800
When you see someone driving recklessly, your anger towards them subsides if they at least using their blinkers to say sorry.

158
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,670
Even if you can't make all his wounds disappear, you can at least apply some medicine to it.

159
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,360
Just by saying you're sorry.

160
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,710
Yong Shik?

161
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,370
Yong Shik?

162
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,200
Is he not at home?

163
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,250
 Do you really want to fix it? 

164
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,360
 Were you being sincere when you asked me to fix you because you hate yourself so much? 

165
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,000
That's right. I'll make sure to at least get treated for erectile dysfunction.

166
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:48,270
♫  The bird with bent wings  ♫

167
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:54,390
♫  In the dark room it stays alone  ♫

168
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,910
♫  Tears fall down endlessly  ♫

169
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:08,530
♫  Leaning on the wall today it also closes its eyes  ♫

170
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,740
♫  I'm dreaming  ♫

171
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,120
♫  A dream about flying  ♫

172
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,110
I definitely can't get in alone.

173
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,650
♫  Far, far fly higher  ♫

174
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,110
♫  Dream of flying high to reach the sky  ♫

175
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,240
♫  You quietly came to me  ♫

176
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,290
♫  Without a word, you stay next to me  ♫

177
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:53,740
♫  Another tough day has passed again  ♫

178
00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:00,590
♫  I close my eyes and try to imagine tomorrow  ♫

179
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,740
Just what are you up to, Do Yong Shik?

180
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,680
♫  I dream of just you and me flying in the sky  ♫

181
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
   

182
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,620
♫  Far, far fly higher  ♫

183
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,210
♫  I dream of flying away with you  ♫

184
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,070
Yes, mom?

185
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,360
What are you doing tomorrow, son?

186
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,410
I'm busy studying.

187
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,390
Is it so?

188
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,860
If you are busy, what can I do?

189
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:57,730
But are you dating anyone right now?

190
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,630
W-Why?

191
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:04,680
 No, you see, Sang Yoon who lives next door brought back home a girl yesterday. 

192
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,230
And she's already in her trimester!

193
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,570
 It's not even a bad thing these days! It's just evidence that you're healthy. 

194
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,620
So, it's okay if you bring home a child before marriage.

195
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,650
And just tell me if something like that happens.

196
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,870
That's not going to happen.

197
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:29,520
What do you mean? Things like that happen in the blink of an eye!

198
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,560
 As long as your thing down there is fine. 

199
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,500
They say living a good life is the best revenge.

200
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,730
But why won't my body and mind comply?

201
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,620
Looks like you finally did something about it.

202
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,660
I was so tired of hearing things from people in the neighborhood, I got him neutered.

203
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,300
Are you happy?

204
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:20,530
Even if my Chunsam is running around the block now, it won't even matter. It's meaningless.

205
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,740
Nice one, Chunsam!

206
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,970
I know how you feel.

207
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,340
Let's go, Chunsam.

208
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,310
Yong Shik.

209
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,950
It's late.

210
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,590
What's going on?

211
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,770
Ah? That is...

212
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,010
I haven't apologized properly.

213
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,270
I'm sorry.

214
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,890
For making a bet on you.

215
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,950
And for being the cause of your obsession with the pink color.

216
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:00,190
Lastly, I'm really sorry you had to hear all those nasty things.

217
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,340
Alright.

218
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,580
I will eat well.

219
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,670
Do you have something more to say?

220
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,420
What?

221
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,740
Nothing.

222
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,860
Go back safely.

223
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,170
I waited for so many hours, and he accepted my apology just like that and went back in.

224
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:45,310
I mean, what else was he supposed to do? What was I even expecting?

225
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,580
Where are you coming from?

226
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,220
Why are you here, Ji Hyuk?

227
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,390
Your mobile was off and I heard you haven't gone home yet, so I was worried and came out.

228
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,690
Where and what were you doing?

229
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,380
That is...

230
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,310
Haven't you eaten yet?

231
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,900
I waited the whole day and finally met Yong Shik.

232
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,290
He just went inside after I said sorry.

233
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,930
I know he must be very angry, but it was a bit upsetting.

234
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,870
You know what, I'd thought that he had lost all of his self-esteem.

235
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,630
I was a little surprised. Well, I guess that's one good thing that came out of this.

236
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,350
By the way, don't you think other than the medicines we've already given him, shouldn't we also prescribe some other forms of treatment?

237
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,590
I mean, Buspirone helps to curb the anxiety but

238
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,670
it doesn't really help treat the obsession from its roots.

239
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,760
- Yong Shik's condition— 
 - Stop talking about him.

240
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,120
No, it's been thirty minutes since that was served.

241
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,690
You couldn't eat properly because you talk about him.

242
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,270
That's because I feel sorry.

243
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,580
Shall we leave now?

244
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,650
Yes.

245
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:57,620
Ji Hyuk, what cognitive behavioral therapy is there that we can combine with medications?

246
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,320
It's just that I'm worried because I'm thinking he ended up that way because of me.

247
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,910
What's most important is the efforts he puts in to treat his obsession.

248
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,700
Ah, okay.

249
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,450
"Exposing them to the triggers that provoke their OCD and

250
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,960
making them not rely on their compulsive behaviors is the way to treat their disease in the long run.

251
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,110
This will help prevent compulsive behavior from its roots."

252
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,180
So, I must get rid of his dependency on the pink color

253
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,250
in the moments he's feeling anxious.

254
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,060
Okay.

255
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,490
Who is it?

256
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,210
Who is it?

257
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,620
Lee Ru Da.

258
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,470
I'm here for your treatment. It's okay for me to come in, right?

259
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,030
What treatment?

260
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,290
First of all, we'll have to start by removing your clothes.

261
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,240
What are you doing?

262
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,950
Gosh!

263
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,680
- Up to this, I will take these away for today. 
 - What?

264
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,210
This is a treatment where you will endure anxiety throughout the day without pink things.

265
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,090
But like... there is no need to

266
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,770
take things away all at once. You can slowly, gradually—

267
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,630
Do you want to slowly and gradually become erected?

268
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,620
Let's do well today.

269
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,410
Why do we have a company get-together every other day?

270
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,300
I want to go back before getting hired.

271
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,620
Say things correctly.

272
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,790
Even when you're rolling in a dog crap field, the land of the living is still better. Being an employee is better than being a job seeker.

273
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,930
Rather than prepping to get hired, I would rather serve the army again.

274
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,170
- I guess prepping to get hired after thirty is not a favorable thing to do. 
 - Yeah.

275
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,760
Give me at least the handkerchief.

276
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,010
Are you an attention seeker? Do you think you are a celebrity?

277
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,880
These people don't even care a bit about you.

278
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,990
Why are you overreacting when they are just having a conversation between themselves?

279
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,230
Fight it. I cannot give you the handkerchief.

280
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,260
What about Seoul University? Why are you scared?

281
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,560
Excuse me, this is our spot.

282
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,530
Just the handkerchief.

283
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,890
Go.

284
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,940
Did you do well on the mock test?

285
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,140
Do you think I would have?

286
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,650
Oh, you are enduring it pretty well, Do Yong Shik.

287
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,390
If we continue to do training together, you will become well very soon.

288
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,470
I don't think my back will last until then.

289
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,010
Hey, let's go quickly. You're late for your part-time job.

290
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,650
Let's go!

291
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,670
   

292
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,650
   

293
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,610
Welco—

294
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,020
Welcome. This way.

295
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,790
- Ah, yes. 
 - This is nice.

296
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,180
Please, be quiet.

297
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,680
- You should change it quickly. 
 - It's so noisy.

298
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,070
Oh, my gosh.

299
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,750
What are we going to eat?

300
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,690
We got to eat meat since we are at a meat restaurant.

301
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,990
 What are you doing tomorrow, son? 

302
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,770
 I'm busy studying. 

303
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,370
 If you're busy, what can I do? 

304
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,050
Are you paying?

305
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,250
Alright, okay!

306
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,770
Aigoo, seriously!

307
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,690
Hey, why are you doing this?

308
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,190
You were doing well, so why are you suddenly acting like this?

309
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,860
My mom.

310
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,280
What?

311
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,450
In front of mom and her friends,

312
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,870
I can't go like this.

313
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,120
 But... 

314
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,130
 doesn't Yong Shik live in Seoul? 

315
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,840
 Yeah, he lives nearby here, but he is busy studying, so I didn't tell him. 

316
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,230
 What can we do? 

317
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,770
 Until when is he going to study? Is he not going to get hired? 

318
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,430
 He will when it is time. 

319
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,410
 The time has already passed! He is thirty-one years old. 

320
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,990
Thirty-one!

321
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,640
Looks like you will have some hardship during your late years.

322
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,030
 You never know how things will be with people. 

323
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,140
 Even if my son is late to getting hired, 

324
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,920
who knows? He might bring the best daughter-in-law.

325
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,190
Do you think that would happen?

326
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,010
Girls these days are so shrewd!

327
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,410
They're such foxes!

328
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,470
- What's wrong? 
 - My stomach has been slowly aching.

329
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,590
But you haven't had anything. What's wrong?

330
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,970
Where is the restroom?

331
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,900
What happened so suddenly?

332
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,560
 Seriously, she 

333
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,960
 was so happy that their cabbage harvest went well 

334
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,870
 but it looks like they failed with their son. 

335
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,420
 Their only son is unable to fulfill his duties. 

336
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,580
 She's going around paying everyone congratulatory money for their marriage, but will she be able to get any back? 

337
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,480
- I didn't know she was like that. 
 - I know, right?

338
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,940
