♫  And I arrived at where we used to go before  ♫

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,440
♫  So I walked around everyday  ♫

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,530
What's wrong?

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,170
♫  It hurts me more  ♫

I don't have that.

It's fine I have one.

36
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,540
I can't.

37
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,140
What?

38
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:57,250

I'm sorry.

43
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,960
Hey, Do Yong Shik!

44
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,060
You really can't do this right now.

45
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,090
If you leave like this, what do I become?

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,780
What happened?

47
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,290
What are you doing this for?

48
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,060
It didn't stand.

49
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,120
What?

50
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,080
It didn't stand. It won't stand!

51
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,260
 I still had some of the rush remaining from having confidently stood up in front of the world after a long time. 

52
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,310
 And so I had forgotten for a second there. 

53
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,800
 That she was Two Plus rank. 

54
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,790
 I'd been crouching down all this while. All I did was stand up for myself for a moment. 

55
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,480
 So I'd forgotten for a while that 

56
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,660
 I am still a  

57
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,020
 bottom ranker. 

58
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,480
Didn't he say he felt like he'd finally overcome his fears?

59
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,100
Didn't he say he felt like a hero?

60
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,560
And it's not like he was with a complete stranger. It was me!

61
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,060
How could it not stand up even when he was going to sleep with me?

62
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,450
   

63
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,030
Ru Da.

64
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,140
Where are you coming from?

65
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,770
I told you I was going to help Yong Shik.

66
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,250
It was revealed a while ago that he wasn't the culprit.

67
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,660
You were with him all this time?

68
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,020
Yeah.

69
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,690
Well, we should talk. I think we need to discuss what happened today.

70
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,120
Can't we talk another time?

71
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,850
Let's talk later.

72
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,420
I'm...

73
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,980
feeling quite overwhelmed right now.

74
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,650
Is it because of him?

75
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,180
Get back safely.

76
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,680
   

77
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,620
You are here... please sit down.

78
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,900
Please, have some too. You see,

79
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,020
I didn't have dinner today, so I've ordered a lot.

80
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,590
You should join me.

81
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,710
I'm fine.

82
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:58,140
Right, I did order too many sides, didn't I?

83
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,820
I've been drinking thirty year liquor.

84
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,110
Chicken, pizza and pasta

85
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,240
They don't go together, right?

86
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,950
Even for relationships between humans,

87
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,270
there is something such as compatibility, Dong Shik.

88
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,450
Ru Da... ever since she was in medical school

89
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,570
she had a strong sense of duty as a doctor.

90
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,930
That's why goodwill coming from a doctor to a patient

91
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,430
shouldn't be misunderstood as love.

92
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,520
So...

93
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,490
If Ru Da does anything to make you misunderstand her

94
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,160
then that is a mistake. It's a mistake.

95
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,300
It's not real feelings she has for you, Do Yong Shik.

96
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,150
I know.

97
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,550
Who fits with Ru Da...

98
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,540
What things are meant for Ru Da... I know well.

99
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,680
I'll be leaving first.

100
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,810
Dr. Do.

101
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,570
   

102
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,590
   

103
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,090
   

104
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,100
 Even if he's not the kidnapper, I hate otakus. His ambition must be to become a princess. 
 (T/N: Japanese term for nerds) 

105
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,730
 Isn't it a mental sickness to be that obsessed with pink? 

106
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,790
So that's why you... I thought you were doing a Mukbang. 
  (TN: Streaming eating show) 

107
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,890
Our Do Ji Hyuk also knows how to do such childish warnings.

108
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,710
Hyungnim, please stop. I'm embarrassed.

109
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,630
Love is supposed to be childish and embarrassing, you childish punk.

110
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,670
I mean do you think everyone dating sounds like their tongues are cut off when they say "Honey, is that so", or

111
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,980
"Babe, did you miss me?"

112
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,280
When you're in love, you want to be childish

113
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,500
and if you're not childish then it's hard to express your love

114
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,390
and so that leads to embarrassing situations.

115
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,590
That's proof that you're loving in the right way.

116
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,170
No matter how I look at it, I ruined my reputation.

117
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,030
Did Ru Da sway you so much that you are acting like this?

118
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,210
The way to catch a swaying woman,

119
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,780
the most simple and most romantic way, you want me to tell you?

120
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,880
A lot of men don't do this,

121
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,540
but propose.

122
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,420
That's it?

123
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,160
Usually, women at the age of marriage who date for a long time have a period where they sway.

124
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,170
They continue to age and yet still have no confirmation that the path they're on is the right one.

125
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,460
That's why they instinctively become anxious

126
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,470
and start turning eyes and so then you push a ring towards them

127
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,860
and then they think:

128
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,420
"Oh, the path I'm on was right."

129
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,700
And they can confirm this and come back.

130
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,220
Okay?

131
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,870
You two... have seen each other for a long time

132
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,900
and dated all you could.

133
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,320
So, why wait?

134
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,670
Life is about timing.

135
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,090
It's all about timing.

136
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,130
And now it's my time to go to the restroom.

137
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,450
I mean, for whatever reason...

138
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,280
A woman. No, me. Leaving me behind,

139
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,400
in a hotel is just not right.

140
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm really going crazy.

141
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,480
My eye makeup is a bit strong, isn't it? It's not smokey makeup, but dark circles under my eyes.

142
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,300
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

143
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,000
Alright,

144
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,450
you not responding to me

145
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,450
it hurts my pride, but let's move on.

146
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,580
Since you're not cured completely yet.

147
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,460
But

148
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,040
leaving in that situation was really not right.

149
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,400
Do you know how pathetic it feels for a woman to be left alone in a hotel?

150
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,460
That is a deep wound.

151
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,610
I was scared.

152
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,630
What?

153
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,000
Yesterday we... crossed a line we shouldn't have crossed.

154
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,640
So I'm saying

155
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,170
why is there a line between us?

156
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,220
Do you think you and I are compatible?

157
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,080
What?

158
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,700
Everybody seeing us thinks it's weird. We don't fit together.

159
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,750
The erectile dysfunction treatment I'm getting from you,

160
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,390
I'm thinking of quitting.

161
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,380
I know it's based on my own determination, so I'll take care of it on my own.

162
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,020
I mean, everything started because you made a bet with Dr. Do.

163
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,330
For you it's not me, it's Do Ji Hyuk, he is compatible with you.

164
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,870
You should try and fix things with him.

165
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,310
When you watch a romance film,

166
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,640
does the male lead

167
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,050
sending the female lead to another guy look cool?

168
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,520
Do you know why it looks cool?

169
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,350
Because the male lead is played by a handsome actor.

170
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,700
In real life, that's a pathetic act.

171
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,290
Are you still going to act so pathetically?

172
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,370
Are you gonna do such a stupid thing?

173
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,660
I'm sorry.

174
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,380
Okay, I got it.

175
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,700
Yesterday, I was immersed in the mood

176
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,940
and made a mistake.

177
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,140
Take care.

178
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,830
Bad bastard.

179
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,000
Stupid jerk.

180
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,520
I taught him to say what he meant

181
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,760
and he goes and says all the wrong things.

182
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,070
Hello?

183
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes, Ji Hyuk.

184
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,600
Where?

185
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,180
Why are we in the school?

186
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,870
Did you get an offer to become a professor?

187
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,350
No.

188
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,920
Then?

189
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,250
Do you remember there... there?

190
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,980
The place where you gave me emergency treatment.

191
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,430
Of course, I remember. I didn't even know you were my Sunbae.

192
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,590
I'd bragged a lot in front of you.

193
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,380
That's when I fell for you.

194
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,390
Don't lie.

195
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,550
I know you dated a lot of girls after that.

196
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,440
It was never anything serious.

197
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,020
I was just waiting for you to break up with your boyfriend.

198
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,910
You had a boyfriend then.

199
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,260
I could have just told you that I liked you.

200
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,180
But I couldn't confess to you because I was scared you'd reject me because you had a boyfriend.

201
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,020
While I was waiting, I dated other girls so that I wouldn't make it obvious.

202
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,530
I was such a coward, wasn't I?

203
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,460
What's up with you today?

204
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,180
I don't want to be a coward anymore.

205
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,700
What I'm going to say now might be a little embarrassing and childish...

206
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,970
but it's my complete truth.

207
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,180
I,

208
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,860
got jealous because I thought you were getting swayed by Do Yong Shik.

209
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,690
I want to stop being sad by the thought of you enjoying yourself with him.

210
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,220
I want to make you happy, too.

211
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,250
But to be honest, I don't really know how.

212
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,170
Besides taking you out to the best restaurant and buying you the best meals...

213
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,100
I don't really know what will happen.

214
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,290
Ji Hyuk.

215
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,990
You know I'm smart, right?

216
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,310
If you can start teaching me from now on then,

217
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,170
I'll try my best.

218
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,920
I'm proposing.

219
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,370
 For you it's not me, it's Do Ji Hyuk. 

220
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,370
 He is compatible with you. 

221
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,730
 You should try and fix things with him. 

222
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,610
I like it.

223
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,760
So are you going to leave her like that?

224
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,690
Why are you so selfless?

225
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,620
It's okay.

226
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,270
They say it never really works out with your first love.

227
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,340
Who said that?

228
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,570
I don't know.

229
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,240
Exactly! Why believe something when you don't even know its source? If it's working out for you then let it happen.

230
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,420
No, that's right, that's right.

231
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,100
Ah, it's really frustrating.

232
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,060
Yes!

233
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,360
Why?

234
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,720
I got a job paying me 5 million won.

235
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,140
Then now I can have surgery.

236
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,030
Now I'm really going to change into a woman.

237
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,410
♪  La-la-la  ♪

238
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,480
Hey, Jennifer.

239
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,040
Are you happy with your life?

240
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,430
Of course.

241
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,360
You couldn't be the woman you want to be.

242
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,520
Yes, I am not happy. So?

243
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,130
It's not like a lot of people who are born perfect.

244
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,450
Say a perfect life got you 100 points.

245
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,820
Then we'd all get 20 or 30 points.

246
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,080
But if we keep comparing ourselves to others then we'd be depressed all our lives.

247
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,990
Then our life that's not 8 hours or 80 days,

248
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,210
but 80 years will feel so long, don't you think?

249
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,430
If we're not going to get 100 points anyways,

250
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,350
then we might as well find a way to be happy with the 20 or 30 points that we get.

251
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,840
What else can we do?

252
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,630
Must be nice for you, being able to think like that.

253
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,130
Looks like you're not happy then.

254
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,270
You know it well.

255
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,550
Please, wait a little, good days are coming for you.

256
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,370
It's my prediction as a fortune teller. Cheers!

257
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:44,120
There you go, Do Yong Shik. Everything has just gone back to as it was.

258
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,830
Now I can do what I need to.

259
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,580
   

260
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,980
   

261
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,410
 It's okay... it's okay... 

262
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,250
 It's okay. 

263
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,310
   

264
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,300
I passed!

265
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,610
 Please, wait a little, good days are coming for you. 

266
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,530
I passed.

267
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,800
   

268
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,330
Oh, right... I must've lost it because I'm so happy.

269
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,520
Gosh!

270
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,690
Congrats!

271
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,570
Wow, this is great. I told you that good things are going to happen to you, right?

272
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:24,230
It's because of these rare moments when you get something right that make it hard for me to stop seeing a psychic.

273
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,810
So all you have to do now is prepare for the interview, right?

274
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,950
Yeah.

275
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,180
But you don't look that happy.

276
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,000
- What? 
 - If you've passed an exam you so desperately wanted to...

277
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,350
then you should be much happier! Cheers.

278
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,860
I don't know. I'm excited. I'm feeling good.

279
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,190
Maybe it's because I'm going to have a lot to do from now onwards.

280
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,100
Nervous?

281
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,400
Yeah.

282
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,610
Ah... cool!

283
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,630
   

284
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,610
 Welcome. 

285
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,720
Can you show me something that would be appropriate for an interview?

286
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,230
For interviews...

287
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,020
How about this one?

288
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,750
You can see in front of the mirror too.

289
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,640
I think it suits you because your proportions are good.

290
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,370
Ah... thank you.

291
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,930
 Your face is small, and your proportions are good. 

292
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,620
   

293
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,380
 What about Seoul University? Why are you scared? 

294
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:17,180
   

295
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,340
Excuse me, this is my seat.

296
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,710
 Two, one, two. You are doing good. 

297
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,150
I miss her.

298
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,030
What is this?

299
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,000
Who sent it?

300
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,690
No way?

301
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,350
   

302
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,540
Are you really going to resign?

303
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,800
Yes. This is a decision I'm making for the next chapter in my life.

304
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,100
Everyone, congratulate me.

305
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:35,580
Well, I am going to congratulate you but it's a bit annoying that we don't have someone to treat the patients

306
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,330
with erectile dysfunction.

307
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:44,040
By the way, is Do Yong Shik going to stop coming here?

308
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,230
Yes.

309
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,600
Well, yeah, since he stopped his treatment.

310
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,190
Then what should we do?

311
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,950
While cleaning the physical therapy room, I picked up Do Yong Shik's handkerchief.

312
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,100
A pink handkerchief.

313
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,690
Doctor Lee can go give it to him.

314
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,670
Hmm... no.

315
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,270
Tell him to come and get it himself.

316
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,380
Or you could courier it to him.

317
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,840
Yes.

318
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,660
How cold.

319
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,890
Could it really be Ru Da who sent this?

320
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,820
What does it mean then?

321
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,580
- Yes? 
  - I'm calling from the Danggeoan Urology Clinic. 

322
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,660
You left your pink handkerchief at the clinic.

323
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,710
Can you come to pick it up yourself? Or should we courier it to you?

324
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,650
I-I'll c-come pick it up myself. Today.

325
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,430
 I will see you later. 

326
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,190
Yes.

327
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,900
Oh...

328
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,820
Ru-Ru Da... Ru Da.

329
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,440
Long time no see.

330
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,710
Yeah... Have you been well?

331
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,850
Yeah. Looks like you're here to get your handkerchief.

332
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,290
Yes.

333
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,850
W-W-Well,

334
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,380
I passed the exams.

335
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,380
I have the interview left though.

336
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,150
Congratulations.

337
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:58,650
- Thank you, if I think it's because you helped me. 
 - Ru Da.

338
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,360
Long time no see, Do Yong Shik.

339
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,790
- You should go get your handkerchief now. Let's go, Ji Hyuk. 
 - Yes.

340
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,780
Will they really marry?

341
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,880
Of course.

342
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,790
They're getting older. It's not like they're going to date forever.

343
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,470
That's true. They've dated for a pretty long time now.

344
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,120
I've seen them together for a long time now,

345
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,310
the both of them suit each other really well.

346
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,590
You came.

347
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,370
Here.

348
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,080
Goodbye.

349
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,270
So she's getting married?!

350
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,480
Yes, well, they've dated for a long time.

351
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,520
They'll suit each other too.

352
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,170
They should get married.

353
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,820
Uh, this way,

354
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,670
There's a spot by the window here.

355
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,640
How do you think to put a sofa here?

356
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,910
- Ru Da? 
 - What?

357
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,960
Ah! Ah, I think the sofa is better there.

358
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,430
Aigoo...

359
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,870
Let's eat banana.

360
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,620
Let's eat banana.

361
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,960
Here.

362
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,080
What?

363
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,310
Gosh, this punk.

364
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,180
Maybe it's because he hasn't met a lady after his surgery.

365
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,050
He doesn't eat anything nor does he have any energy.

366
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:55,120
Are you that sad because my Chunsam got neutered?

367
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,670
What was that?

368
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,230
It's not even Ru Da who's sending me this. So just who could it be?

369
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,620
   

370
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,910
Now it finally feels like you're actually quitting.

371
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,980
Why are you acting like we're not going to meet each other ever again?

372
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,070
That's too much, isn't it?

373
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,670
You must live well.

374
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,030
I will.

375
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,630
How do you feel?

376
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,360
I feel a bit nervous.

377
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,740
That's normal when you have big events coming up.

378
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,970
How about we go somewhere fancy for dinner today?

379
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,980
Let's eat later.

380
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,230
I just want to go for a swim today.

381
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,610
Well, exercise is the best thing you can do when you're anxious.

382
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,390
- How about I join you? 
 - You can do things like these only when you're jobless.

383
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,280
Lastly, have you ever overcome

384
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,650
any adversities in your life?

385
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,350
Yes. Until very recently,

386
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,450
I used to be a person with low self-esteem,

387
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,070
because I kept thinking about how I would get a job later than others.

388
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,530
That's why I always had my head down.

389
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,480
I used to find it difficult to meet people's eyes

390
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,270
and it wasn't easy for me to tell people what I really thought.

391
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:34,380
I used to think that someone like me had no right to do so.

392
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,950
It escalated to the point where I was misunderstood to be a kidnapper

393
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,850
and the police were after me.

394
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:47,920
If it were a normal day then I wouldn't even have said that I was wrongly accused. I would have just endured it and moved on.

395
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,410
But that day, I mustered up the courage to stand in front of those people

396
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,510
and tell them that I was innocent.

397
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,150
For me, that was a moment where I had overcome my fears.

398
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,020
   

399
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,760
What was the reason you could muster up the courage that day?

400
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,150
It was a person.

401
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:22,580
   

402
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,550
Surprise!

403
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:40,900
Come on. Today was a major historic day for you. I need to congratulate you. Here.

404
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,800
There you go.

405
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,640
Your interview went well, so what's up with your expression?

406
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,340
What? What's wrong with my expression?

407
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,790
You look like you miss someone like crazy.

408
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,390
No.

409
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,920
How could you lie in front of a fortune teller?

410
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,360
It's boring. Don't you have any music?

411
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,960
Okay.

412
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,530
- Turn it up. 
 - Go!

413
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,020
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

414
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:27,080
♫  You make me want to be a hero-man  ♫

415
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,720
♫  You make me want to be a hero-man. Let's go sky high.  ♫

416
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,890
Change the song.

417
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,120
Another one?

418
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,750
Another one.

419
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,660
Really!

420
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,060
It's really hitting where it hurts.

421
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,360
Do you really miss your first love so much?

422
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:09,200
♪  Which one...  ♪

423
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,910
My gosh! If you're going to sulk like that, just go see her!

424
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,560
What?

425
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,060
I'm telling you to go find her and tell her that you can't forget her and that you like her a lot.

426
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,580
Talk with her boldly.

427
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,150
What's this when she's getting married to someone else?

428
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,220
It's better than for the women who's already married.

429
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,690
I'm not asking you to go change her feelings.

430
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,300
Just truthfully tell her what you feel.

431
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,560
Even if you just get rejected, at least go tell her your feelings.

432
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,440
You've now half passed the civil service exam.

433
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,120
Be a little more confident.

434
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,950
We've arrived.

435
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,480
Ah, really. Don't be nervous and trust yourself, understood?

436
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,540
Yeah.

437
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,520
Square your shoulders. You look handsome. There you go.

438
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,220
