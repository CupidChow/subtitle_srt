1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,810
   

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,800
♫  Just tell me you can get up, so, so  ♫

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,030
   

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,920
   
 ♫  Just tell me you can do anything  ♫ 

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,810


6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,930
   

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,960
If you want to die because of that, stop it and come down.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,360
I can't change your pathetic life instantly, but

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,380
I can at least treat that.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,220
Really.

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,910
Let me treat your erectile dysfunction, Do Yong Shik.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,550
I— How much more pathetic can I get?

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,460
Can't you just leave and pretend you didn't see me?

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,050
Why exactly...?

15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,900
Why are you doing this to me?

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,800
Because you were my first love!

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,100
Why are you so surprised? You used to like me, right?

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,340
I also liked you.

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,420
If only wasn't for that accident, we would have dated.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,260
 The Chaser? 

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,590
 Yeah, these tickets were difficult to get.  

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,960
  That movie is R-rated. 

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,990
  So? Can you proudly say that you've only watched pure videos as a teenager?  

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,640
  So, let's go watch it. They say it's really fun! 

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,300
 What if they catch us? 

26
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,280
 So we have to get ready to not get caught. 

27
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,190
♫  I miss you everyday  ♫

28
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,010
♫  But I will never admit that to you  ♫

29
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,090
♫  I want to get closer to you slowly  ♫

30
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,040
♫  So that I don't make you uncomfortable   ♫

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,660
♫  Now I even talk the way you do  ♫

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,200
♫  I make it obvious like a fool  ♫

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,680
♫  My expressions also grow similar to yours  ♫

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,790
♫  It keeps showing that I like you  ♫

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,950
♫  Everything inside me is already full of you  ♫

36
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,920
♫  Full to the brim  ♫

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,770
 Don't look. 

38
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,810
♫  I've already become addicted to you  ♫

39
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,060
♫  Now I even talk the way you do  ♫

40
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,070
♫  I make it obvious like a fool  ♫

41
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,650
 Wasn't the movie fun? 

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,740
 Yes, It was really fun. 

43
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,840
 What was his name? Ha Jung Woo? 

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,030
 The psychopath. I think he'll hit it big. 

45
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,560
 Really? 

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,820
 He's not the flower boy type. 

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,960
 You don't even know. 

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,990
 The flower boy era has passed. 

49
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,970
 The beast era will come. 

50
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,700
 By the way, if the movie is this good, don't you think it will hit a box office gross of 10 million? 

51
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,140
 It's not as easy as it sounds. Ten million views... 

52
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,760
 It's Rated-19 too. 

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,370
 There will also be those who watched it like we did. 

54
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,270
 Do you want to make a bet? 

55
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,930
 A bet? 

56
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,910
 If this movie hits 10 million, 

57
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,260
 I'll grant you a wish. 

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,640
 But if the movie doesn't go over 10 million, 

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,180
 you need to grant me a wish. 

60
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,570
 What wish? 

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,290
 What is your wish? 

62
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,450
 Ah... My wish? 

63
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,990
 My wish is... 

64
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,100
The movie had 5.7 million views.

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,090
I won.

66
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,970
The wish that I wanted you to grant if I won...

67
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,520
was for you to date me.

68
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,200
If I didn't get caught by my dad because of that accident, and send me to the US,

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,740
we would have dated, right?

70
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,460
So?

71
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,700
That's how regretful I was and how much you're

72
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,680
a special person to me.

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,380
I can't stand to see that person be so broken.

74
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,600
Still, I won't get treated by you.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,690
Why? Are you ashamed?

76
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,170
I already saw it down there.

77
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,340
An IT CEO who has a total sales of five billion won?

78
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,960
The fact that you're a hopeless test taker for six years,

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,920
and how you can't afford to date someone or even meet your friends...

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,080
I found all of that out, even the fact that you lied to me because you're embarrassed by all of that.

81
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,650
What is there to be shameful of?

82
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,950
The patients who come after going into depression  because of erectile dysfunction,

83
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,900
cases of people who completed their treatment

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,110
and turned their lives around,

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,370
I've seen a lot of them.

86
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,660
You can do it, Yong Shik.

87
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,360
I will help you.

88
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,350
You were really a cool kid, right?

89
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,060
The fact that my wish was for you to date me

90
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,360
just means that you're a really good guy.

91
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,390
You can go back to how it was that time.

92
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,190
Come to the hospital tomorrow.

93
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,160
I'll wait for you.

94
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,120
Hey, you...

95
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,140
Did you forget that I'm a fortune teller?

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,490
Of course, I'll find out through my powers that you were hanging between life and death.

97
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,300
Here.

98
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,560
Congratulations on making a U-turn in front of the River Styx.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,680
Let's go inside.

100
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,680
I thought you had given up on jumping off because you got scared.

101
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,740
I see that your first love came and stopped you.

102
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,180
Ah, It looks delicious.

103
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,920
I guess there's a reason why there's such a thing as a honeytrap.

104
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
It's not like that.

105
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,550
Don't pretend.

106
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,600
You went up to the rooftop railing to die,

107
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,970
and your pretty first love came and said:

108
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,460
"Yong Shik.

109
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,370
Don't die—"

110
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,690
It's been so long...

111
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,860
Since someone told me I can do it.

112
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,970
 You can do it, Yong Shik. 

113
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,880
After hearing those words,

114
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,830
I suddenly burst into tears.

115
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,860
All this time,

116
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,130
those were the words that I really wanted to hear.

117
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,360
To me, who has no hope,

118
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,580
someone, anybody...

119
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,870
"You can do it." I was hoping someone could say that.

120
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,810
Hey...

121
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,830
After listening to the words I desperately wanted to hear,

122
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,570
how can I die there?

123
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,990
Unni, are you going to bet a person for your pride?

124
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,230
Is that something you should do?

125
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,100
Ji Hyuk fooled me first.

126
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,300
Even if he did that, you shouldn't do this, Unni.

127
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,840
The two of you should figure it out between yourselves. Why are you making an idiot out of Yong Shik?

128
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,270
I said that I would treat him. Is that a bad thing?

129
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,550
Your intention is not innocent.

130
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,320
Then what? My pride is being stepped on. Should I sit back quietly?

131
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,310
What's bad about that?

132
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,330
Hey, do you think this is a childish game of who's going to text first after a fight?

133
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,820
It's a question about my level as a person.

134
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,380
I'm going to treat Yong Shik's erectile dysfunction, and restore my pride.

135
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,210
I'll give Do Ji Hyuk a shock.

136
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,490
Even if you fix his erectile dysfunction, are you sure he's going to change?

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,090
Hey.

138
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,120
Don't ruin the mood and go pray that Yong Shik will come to the hospital tomorrow.

139
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm full.

140
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,700
You're really very good at making ramyeon, Oppa.

141
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,310
It would have been too bad if you fell and died.

142
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,070
Oppa.

143
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,000
If you look at your fortune, it says that you will live until your old age.

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,060
In that long life that you're going to live, there has to be at least one good day, right?

145
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,340
Thanks, Kim Myung Ja.

146
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,930
That again.

147
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,860
Jennifer.

148
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,960
That's right. Since you have Jennifer,

149
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,180
cheer up, brother. See you.

150
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,840
Fighting!

151
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,740
Bye.

152
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,600
Aigoo...

153
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,010
 You were really a cool kid, right? The fact that my wish was for you to date me 

154
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,320
 just means that you're a really good guy. You can go back to how it was that time. 

155
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,600
What did I deserve?

156
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,060
 Come to the hospital tomorrow. I'll wait for you. 

157
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,840
What do I do?

158
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,930
What about it? I've already shamed myself and even sold my thing down there out. I've lost everything.

159
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,020
What's the use of being stubborn?

160
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,420
   

161
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:48,030
Still, this isn't right. It's not like I'm treating a cold.

162
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,470
I can't do this. I can't.

163
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,210
Yong Shik!

164
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,640
You made the right choice. Thanks for trusting me.

165
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,190
I can fix it soon. I'll do my best!

166
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,490
Wow, she managed to bring him here.

167
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,150
You're doing great.

168
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,610
After you broke up with your ex-girlfriend, you've never had sexual intercourse, correct?

169
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,520
I guess you won't be familiar with external stimulation then.

170
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,020
What?

171
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,270
That machine vibrates and stimulates below.

172
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,700
It might cause a bit of pain but it also counts as physical therapy, so just endure it.

173
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,080
Okay...

174
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,870
Is it externally stimulating you?

175
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,900
Is it getting stimulated?

176
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,480
Do Yong Shik.

177
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,540
This is a hospital. I'm your doctor and we're in the middle of treatment. Don't laugh.

178
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,180
Okay.

179
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,890
Do well.

180
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,530
That's why I'm thinking of doing joint treatment with Ji Hyuk.

181
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,490
That's a good idea. You get to treat him and date him.

182
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,680
Why do you always say that? It's nothing like that.

183
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,100
So, for the time being, I'll only take appointments and I'll freely use my remaining time.

184
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,430
Hey, tell me the reason.

185
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,630
It's because, as a doctor, I want to properly take care of that patient.

186
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,320
What's with you and Do Ji Hyuk all of a sudden? Did you find a dream goal at this age? Be a Schweitzer couple?

187
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,890
If that's the case, will you allow it?

188
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,710
What if I don't?

189
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,710
If you don't, it can't be helped.

190
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:08,890
I better tattle about the exact earnings of our hospital to your wife.

191
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,430
Lee Ru Da, you're really bad.

192
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,250
What was her phone number?

193
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,630
From when?

194
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,840
Did your physical therapy go well? Was it okay? Did it not hurt?

195
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,440
Ru Da.

196
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,690
I really don't think this is right.

197
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,180
I can't do it. Cancel it. Pretend this never happened.

198
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,460
I'm sorry. I'm going to leave.

199
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,840
- To your house? 
 - Yeah.

200
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,830
- Let's go together. 
 - Okay.

201
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,370
- Wait a minute. 
 - Okay. What?

202
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,010
I'll get changed. Let's go together.

203
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,970
   

204
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,240
What do I do?

205
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,370
It's a color that I like.

206
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,720
It's okay. Well... It's kind of like a princess' room. It's fancy.

207
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,250
I'm going to open the fridge.

208
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,050
What do you usually eat?

209
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,540
Stuff from the convenience store...

210
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,450
- Why is this here? 
 - Oh, that—

211
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,510
You can't even get it to erect. Do you think it will stand up if you're drinking alcohol?

212
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,990
- This can't do. Everything needs to be changed. 
 - What?

213
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,620
It's not the kind of problem that will get fixed just by medicine and physical therapy.

214
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,260
You need to change your lifestyle, and you also need to fix your daily routine.

215
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,500
You must not drink or smoke. You must also not eat food from the convenience store just to roughly fill yourself up.

216
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,760
Just in case, never wear clothes that stick too close to the skin. Got it?

217
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,560
From here on, you must live a life of taking care of yourself diligently.

218
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,380
Good. Shall we get started?

219
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,290
I can do this.

220
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,840
It's because you keep wearing tight clothes...

221
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,750
- This won't do either. 
 - Oh no, no.

222
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,970
- What are you doing? You keep wearing this, that's why you're like that! 
 - But this... But this is comfortable!

223
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,460
Oh no, what's this? You really shouldn't wear skinny jeans.

224
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,010
What's with the leather? Never wear stuff like this, okay? All of those won't do.

225
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,700
It's so dirty. Aigoo.

226
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,690
If you eat stuff like these, you'll get even unknown diseases.

227
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,090
Salad, once a day.

228
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,030
Still, wouldn't eating ham be okay?

229
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,030
You can't.

230
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,090
You should not drink alcohol either.

231
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,000
What are you doing?

232
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,040
- You definitely can't have alcohol! 
 - Just this one.

233
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,750
Internet Lessons. Secret Folder.

234
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,870
Eastern Philosophy. South Korea and Japan: Relationship and the Future Between the Two Countries.

235
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,030
"The Fairy and I, Hot and Bothered"

236
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,610
"I Can't Ask For Any Favor".

237
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,950
I understand your preference, but can you somehow change it to something more realistic?

238
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,720
Instead of fantasy, it's easier for you to relate to realistic ones, so they will work better.

239
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,490
Okay.

240
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,650
Okay.

241
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,770
This is enough for now. Do you perhaps have a swimsuit?

242
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,840
Swimsuit?

243
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,030
♫  I miss you everyday  ♫

244
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:57,270
♫  But I will never admit that to you  ♫

245
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,090
♫  I'm not playing hard to get  ♫

246
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,850
♫  It's just that you're so precious to me  ♫

247
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:11,160
♫  I want to get closer to you slowly  ♫

248
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,050
♫  So that I don't make you uncomfortable   ♫

249
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:21,380
♫  Now I even talk the way you do  ♫

250
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,060
You're here.

251
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,190
Yes.

252
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,090
Why are you wearing that?

253
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,400
Didn't I tell you wearing tight clothes like these is bad for your blood flow?

254
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,660
Hurry and take it off.

255
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,360
What? Why are you so surprised?

256
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,430
I didn't exercise for too long so my body—

257
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,600
I didn't expect any six-pack from you.

258
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,150
Take it off.

259
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,490
What's this? You're being ridiculous. Do you have a dragon tattoo or something?

260
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,100
R-Ru Da.

261
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,380
Do we have to swim? I really can't swim.

262
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,650
Yes. We have to swim.

263
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,710
Why?

264
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,450
Exercise that adequately shakes the lower body and rear parts

265
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,710
is good for the blood flow in the scrotum

266
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,850
and boosts your testicular metabolism.

267
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,370
There's no other kind of exercise that comes close to swimming for treating erectile dysfunction.

268
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,400
I can't even float on water.

269
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,790
That's why I'm here. Let's go.

270
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,920
Come faster.

271
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,840
Straighten your legs.

272
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,580
One, two. One, two.

273
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,630
Nice, nice. Good.

274
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,320
- Am I floating? 
 - I'm removing the kickboard.

275
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,770
You're taking the kickboard?

276
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,700
I'll take this. One, two, three.

277
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,850
One, two. One, two.

278
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,620
Give me the kickboard! Kickboard!

279
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,910
- Give me the kickboard! 
 - It's one meter deep!

280
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,740
Oh, seriously.

281
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,800
Let's try again?

282
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,090
Let's rest up.

283
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,740
What's wrong now?

284
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,180
Aren't you Do Yong Shik?

285
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,090
Hey, Tae Jin. Why are you here?

286
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,030
We're at a swimming pool. Of course, I came here to swim, man.

287
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,950
You too?

288
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,340
You must be well off. This center must not have been cheap.

289
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,640
I got a good opportunity.

290
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,480
If you do whatever you want, when will you take the exam?

291
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,920
Even if you pass now, isn't it late anyway?

292
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,920
If I were you, I would have thought of a relaxed life like this as a luxury and will only be studying the whole time.

293
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:37,100
If you can't get a grasp of reality, when will you get a job, date, and get married?

294
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,390
Aigoo. I'm getting frustrated.

295
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,730
Darling.

296
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,320
Who is this?

297
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,600
Who is she?

298
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,490
Don't say this is your girlfriend?

299
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,930
Then do you think I'm his mother?

300
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,060
Wow, hey, wow.

301
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,380
This guy. When did you start dating such a beautiful girlfriend?

302
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,120
You're really nice. Hello.

303
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,230
I'm Yong Shik's younger brother— I mean classmate. My name is Kim Tae Jin.

304
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,610
I am a CEO of an IT company.

305
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,920
I didn't ask anything.

306
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:01,080
That's right! I'm usually a step ahead. A step ahead...

307
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,930
Let's do this, you and Dong Shik, we three

308
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,990
let's have dinner together or—

309
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,560
If you know someone nice,

310
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,320
I'd like it if she can meet up and eat with us.

311
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,180
There is nobody like that around me.

312
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:26,450
There is! There are always beautiful women around beautiful women.

313
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,120
I was trying to say it nicely, he doesn't seem to catch on.

314
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,290
There's no helping it. I'll just tell it to you straight.

315
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,390
It's not that I don't have anyone nice around me. It's just that, for a level like yours,

316
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,330
there is nobody suitable whom I can introduce to you.

317
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,700
My friends are too precious.

318
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,650
If you can't get a grasp of reality, when will you be able to find a girlfriend and get married?

319
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,970
Swim safely.

320
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,920
Let's go, darling.

321
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,050
Are you stupid? Even after hearing that, how can you just stay quiet?

322
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,960
Aren't you mad?

323
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,460
- Everything he said is true. 
 - What?

324
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,570
I'm pathetic, after all.

325
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,780
Pathetic or what it's up to you to decide.

326
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,370
What are they to you anyway? How can you say that?

327
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,160
It's okay. I'm used to such words.

328
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,570
   

329
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,000
Today I was thankful, and I will go swimming three times a week.

330
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,820
Alright.

331
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,810
Drive back safely.

332
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,620
Goodbye.

333
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,600
Oh my goodness.

334
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,390
He is in a worse situation than I thought.

335
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,460
What could have happened to him that he became so lifeless?

336
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,320
He was really cool back then.

337
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,920
   

338
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,350
 Thank you. 

339
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:12,960
 If it wasn't for you, I would have been in so much trouble in gym class. 

340
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,790
 Did you eat lunch? 

341
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,890
 We had chicken and I overate. I thought my stomach was going to explode while I was running. 

342
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,300
 Who will eat this thing! 

343
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,450
 Didn't you say you had to give out snacks after becoming the class president? 

344
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,590
 Yes, that right, snack! Snack! 

345
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,890
 Everyone brings ice cream or hamburger. Who brings tofu kimchi? 

346
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,560
  - Is it? 
 - I don't need it. Take away! 

347
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,730
 You know him? 

348
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,790
 Yes. That's Kim Cheol Joong, class president of Class 3. 

349
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,670
 From what I know, he doesn't have parents and grew up under his grandmother.  

350
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,790
 - Wow. He doesn't even know how to be grateful. That jerk— 
 - Grandma! 

351
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,000
 - Are you Cheol Joong's grandmother? 
 - Yes. Do you know my Cheol Joong? 

352
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,340
 So I was right! I'm Cheol Joong's friend. 

353
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,090
 Hi. 

354
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,890
 Wow! It's tofu kimchi! 

355
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,000
 - Can I have some? I run just now and I feel hungry.
 - Aigoo! Really? 

356
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,090
 Eat up. 

357
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,360
 It's delicious. 

358
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,500
  - You think so? 
 - Wow, it's enough to brag about.  

359
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,590
 - Brag? 
 - Yes. Whenever we eat, he says he's reminded of his grandma's food. 

360
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:34,820
 He says your cooking is top-notch and that the school's food can't compare to yours. 

361
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,680
 - Did my grandson say like that? 
 - Yes. 

362
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,090
 It's very delicious. 

363
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,240
 Can I have some more? 

364
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,160
 You said you were full from overeating. 

365
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,670
How can a person like that turn out like this?

366
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,960
What is it again?

367
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,950
 What? 

368
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,850
Byeol Ru Da, are you done with outside duty? 
  (T/N: A play on her name Lee Ru Da. Byeol Ru Da means so-so.) 

369
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,060
 Yes. I'm on my way to the hospital. 

370
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,790
Then don't go back to the hospital and just go straight to the school gathering.

371
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,950
I am not coming to today's gathering.

372
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,720
You can't use the excuse of your fight with Ji Hyuk to get out of today's gathering.

373
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,710
If you dare not come, I'll expel you.

374
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,200
So, she's saying Ji Hyuk is lacking in expressing himself

375
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,410
or something so the two are butting heads right now.

376
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,050
My Ru Da has a part of her that is like a child sometimes.

377
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,690
You must be tired of trying to accept all of that.

378
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,920
Why would there be hardships when we already broke up?

379
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,780
Why haven't you told them? We don't see each other now.

380
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,060
Really?

381
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,010
Then we will set up a girl for Ji Hyuk.

382
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,960
Okay, go ahead.

383
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,410
Ji Hyuk, do you want to date Stella Kim?

384
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,330
Stella Kim?

385
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,360
That woman who is from the Miss Korea competition and went to Johns Hopkins?

386
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,420
Last time, when I went to the US, I got to know that

387
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,620
she doesn't have a boyfriend.

388
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,300
Hey, why are you so late to the party?

389
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,800
- Ji Hyuk already dated that girl. 
 - Really?

390
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,180
Stella Kim's first love is Ji Hyuk.

391
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,490
You guys dated while you were studying abroad, right?

392
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,180
I don't know.

393
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,540
Really?

394
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,550
So that perfect women's first love

395
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,280
is our Do Ji Hyuk?

396
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,080
Do Ji Hyuk's class is awesome.

397
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,180
Ru Da, how's your first love?

398
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,240
Do you know what he is doing right now?

399
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,580
Who thinks about their first love these days?

400
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,300
First loves are... meh.

401
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,440
Why are you so flustered?

402
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,020
Give me a drink, please.

403
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,780
You're acting strange?

404
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,560
You don't know?

405
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,980
Let's do cheers.

406
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,840
Okay.

407
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,730
Cheers.

408
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,290
Cheers.

409
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,220
Cheers.

410
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,080
Don't mind the Sunbaes. They're always like that, right?

411
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,820
Who says I'm minding?

412
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,920
Okay.

413
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,810
Is that friend's treatment going well? I heard you even did work outside of the clinic today.

414
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,600
Yes, the start was very good.

415
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,920
If you think the treatment isn't going to work, you can quit anytime.

416
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,440
I don't think that will ever happen.

417
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,210
An old eagle is better than a young crow.

418
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,340
His recovery is only a matter of time.

419
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,270
A matter of time my butt.

420
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,770
The problem is quite serious.

421
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,980
It's hot.

422
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,320
Even so, I can't give up now.

423
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,520
Even though he can't make it to Johns Hopkins,

424
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,100
but it should at least be able to get erect

425
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,170
right now.

426
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,560
Are you eating ramen?

427
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,070
Sorry, I'll eat quickly and clean up.

428
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,300
I really hate the smell of it.

429
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,740
But, you're so unlucky.

430
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,450
Why did you have to get indigestion while eating ramen that you can't eat this delicious ramen anymore?

431
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,870
That's why trauma is scary.

432
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,750
Ru Ri, why don't you just close your eyes and have one bite?

433
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,600
Trauma is something you confront and overcome.

434
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:17,860
Okay, so the basics of psychotherapy start with treating trauma.

435
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,590
Why didn't I think of this?

436
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,210
 Only after you lose something will you realize its importance. 

437
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:57,430
 Every morning, it would rise up by itself 

438
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,660
 I would get mad at it for no reason. 

439
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,910
 But now... I would like it if it rose up at any time. 

440
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,290
 So I hope it comes back to me. 

441
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,550
What are you saying, you crazy guy?

442
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,740
They say bananas are good for vitality.

443
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,220
I've been trying to find out who got my Mimi pregnant for two months!

444
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,300
What are you going to do about it?

445
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,030
What are you going to do now?

446
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,980
Hey.

447
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,530
Do you have any guarantee that our Chunsam only made your dog pregnant?

448
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,120
Our Mimi is white but gave birth to a black puppy!

449
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,750
Is there any black dog other than Chunsam in this neighborhood?

450
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,630
You should have taken proper measures for a dog with such vitality!

451
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,980
Proper measures?

452
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,840
Is it so wrong for him to have such vitality?

453
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,680
Our Chunsam is four, but in human years is only in his early thirties!

454
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,600
If you're in your early thirties and don't have vitality

455
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,590
then that's a fool!

456
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,580
If you're in your early thirties and don't have vitality

457
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,330
then that's a fool!

458
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,580
A fool! A fool!

459
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,430
 I'm jealous of Chunsam. 

460
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,770
This man, why are you shouting when you did nothing right!

461
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,570
 You're the same! Take responsibility! 

462
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,920
 Take responsibility, you old man! 

463
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,720
What are you looking at?

464
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,040
Follow me, follow me.

465
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,090
You're sure a black puppy came out?

466
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,660
I'm jealous of Chunsam.

467
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,000
Come here.

468
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,540
Who is Chunsam?

469
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,360
That's not it.

470
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,490
What are you doing here?

471
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,690
There's a place I want to go with you.

472
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,910
Where?

473
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,660
Let's go.

474
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,920
This is it.

475
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,480
It looks good.

476
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,190
Let's go with this one.

477
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,300
No, your face is small

478
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,460
and your proportions are good.

479
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,420
I like this better. Let's pick this.

480
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,150
But where exactly are we going for us to buy clothes like this?

481
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,560
There is a place like that.

482
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,250
   

483
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,220
It's a massage place.

484
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,270
We came to treat your erectile dysfunction.

485
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,250
Here?

486
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,020
Welcome.

487
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,150
We've booked a couple's massage.

488
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,460
Yes.

489
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,050
- It's under Lee Ru Da. 
 - Yes.

490
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,520
You booked with Hee Jin and Yu Ri.

491
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,420
Please, wait a minute.

492
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,680
 The customer has arrived. 

493
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,220
They'll be here soon.

494
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,810
Hello.

495
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,030
 Do you know that you're not even good in bed? 

496
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,910
♫  Just tell me you can get up so, so  ♫

497
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,880
♫  Oh oh woo oh  ♫

498
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,960
♫  Just tell me you can get up so, so  ♫

499
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,690


500
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,400
♫  Just tell me you can do anything  ♫

501
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,040
♫  Just tell me you can get up so, so  ♫
