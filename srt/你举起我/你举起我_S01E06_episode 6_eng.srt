1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,670
   

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,890
♫  Just tell me you can get up, so, so  ♫

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,260
   

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,980
   

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,970
    
 ♫  Just tell me you can do anything  ♫

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,910
♫  Right now  ♫

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,520
    

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,690
 Seriously, she 

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,100
 was so happy that their cabbage harvest went well 

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,900
 but it looks like they failed with their son. 

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,520
 Their only son is unable to fulfill his duties. 

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,410
 She's going around paying everyone congratulatory money for their marriage, but will she be able to get any back? 

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,540
I know, right?

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,340
Poor girl.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,440
Yong Shik, are you okay?

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,820
I can't handle this anymore.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,530
Please give me my handkerchief... please.

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,420
Please...

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,550
It's okay... it's okay...

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,340
It's okay...

21
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,590
It's okay.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,910
Where did this guy run to?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,960
What are you doing right now? Three parties came in.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,750
I will serve the three tables.

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,740
What? What do you mean?

26
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,500
I will do the work of this person for this month.

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,290
Oh...

28
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,910
Okay...

29
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,620
It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,180
It's okay.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:28,010


32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,580
Wow, thank you.

33
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,950
I'm not giving you any.

34
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,880
You're so mean.

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,240
Hello ma'am.

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,960
I am Ru Da. Yong Shik's high school friend.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,000
That Ru Da! It is so nice to see you.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,580
Have you been doing well?

39
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,060
Of course!

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,920
You were pretty when you were young, but you grew up pretty too!

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,510
But what brings you here?

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,000
I came to eat because my hospital is nearby here.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,190
Hospital? Are you a doctor?

44
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,920
Yes.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,250
Is it okay if I grill the meat for you?

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,860
Yes, of course. Please have a seat.

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,010
This is Yong Shik's old friend.

48
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,280
She looks really good.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,930
Her eyes are so big and pretty.

50
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,850
She is a doctor!

51
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,500
Doctor, doctor.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,800
I actually saw Yong Shik recently.

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh, did you?

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,910
Actually, Yong Shik is my first love.

55
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,960
So I was curious to see how he was doing, and I ended up seeing him.

56
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,360
He was still cool as ever.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,510
So nice and warm, with a big heart.

58
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,070
It's so hard to find a guy like that.

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,180
Our Yong Shik is really a nice person.

60
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,600
That's why I liked him.

61
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,060
What makeup do you use?

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,510
You have not aged at all!

63
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,380
What do you mean? I am over 61. How can I not have aged?

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,210
You are like Jun In Ah.

65
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,620
What do you mean Jun In Ah?

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,620
Maybe Hwang Shin Ae.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,410
Oh, I'm embarrassed.

68
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,060
 Please have some meat. 

69
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,020
 Please eat a lot. 

70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,930
 Please eat now. 

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,400
 - Yes. 
 - Aigoo. 

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,580
 Have some more. 

73
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,470
I'm full.

74
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,190
The meat was so good.

75
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,520
I ate really well.

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,900
Thank you so much, and it was good seeing you today.

77
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,860
Oh, no no no.

78
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,480
Not this. It's okay.

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,920
Oh, my! Aigoo!

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
Thank you.

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,310
Please head back safely!

82
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,830
Please take care!

83
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,300
Thank you!

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,690
See you again.

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,190
You didn't have to walk me home too...

86
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,610
I am not taking you home. I am just keeping my eyes on you

87
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,270
to see how well you can get through the whole day without anything pink.

88
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,920
Thank you for today.

89
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,630
For making my mom look good.

90
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,150
You did something I couldn't do for her.

91
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,500
You are saying nonsense again!

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,970
Hey, don't you even feel bad for you, Do Yong Shik?

93
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,840
Even if other people curse at you, you should love yourself.

94
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,220
You always say that you aren't good enough.

95
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,740
Is that so?

96
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,660
Who is it? It isn't me.

97
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,410
Ru Da.

98
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,980
Do you want to come in and have ramen?

99
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,650
 - Yong Shik's condition— 
 - Stop talking about him. 

100
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,760
 That's because I feel sorry. 

101
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,900
   

102
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,040
Who am I being cautious of right now?

103
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,580
 You really don't know what I want. 

104
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,780
 Even if we just have ramen on the streets. 

105
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,660
 Honey, I really wanted you to know my heart and apologize. 

106
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,060
You had a hard day following me around everywhere,

107
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,640
so at least have a full stomach before you leave.

108
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,720
I only have ramen to serve, so I am sorry.

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,440
That's okay! My soul food is ramen.

110
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,700
Thank you.

111
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,200
It really is!

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,220
♫  But I will never admit that to you  ♫

113
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,470
- What is this? 
 - What?

114
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,330
It is so delicious! So crazy!

115
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,520
Thanks.

116
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,530
Hey. Bring that thing.

117
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,010
The one in the fridge.

118
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,540
♫  I want to get closer to you slowly  ♫

119
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Bring it now!

120
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,410
Okay, hold on.

121
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,320
Hurry, hurry!

122
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,740
♫  Now I even talk the way you do  ♫

123
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,380
It was tasty.

124
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,610
So this is what ramen tastes like with pollack broth.

125
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,990
It is good to eat it like this when you have a hangover.

126
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,580
Ramen is such an interesting food.

127
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,840
Depending on how you cook it, it can taste a hundred different ways.

128
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,760
That's right.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,140
Have you tried cooking ramen with milk in it?

130
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,780
Milk?

131
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,380
Then it tastes like carbonara.

132
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,540
Oh really? I see...

133
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,540
♫  Every time I meet you  ♫

134
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,500
Should I try?

135
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,560
♫  Now I even talk the way you do  ♫

136
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,840
♫  I make it obvious like a fool  ♫

137
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,620
Wow! It does taste like spicy carbonara!

138
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,250
But... I think it had a lot of milk, so it was a little greasy.

139
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,230
Yes, you are right.

140
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,680
To catch the greasiness...

141
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,540
 You need cheongyang chili peppers! 

142
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,050
- Where are you going? 
 - To get cheongyang chili peppers.

143
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,390
Hey, don't! You can't eat that.

144
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,820
Let me have some.

145
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,910
No, hurry and have a seat!

146
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,800
I cannot end with this greasiness.

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,590
What do you mean you can't?

148
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,780
- Do you know anything? 
 - Drinking soju will help with the greasiness.

149
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,920
Hurry,

150
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,390
have a seat!

151
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,980
I feel so good!

152
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,730
I am so full.

153
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,060
We did eat quite a bit.

154
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,870
Not just a little bit. If we get stabbed like this, noodles will probably come out.

155
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,630
I think I gained like 2 kg.

156
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,620
What?

157
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, no...

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,340
Maybe I did gain weight.

159
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,820
Wait just a bit! I will get slippers from home.

160
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,330
It's okay. How are you going to go all the way there?

161
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:50,450
But still... Ah... do you want to wear my shoes? Since you bought it for me last time, it is still quite new.

162
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,120
Hey! Would I feel comfortable if you are barefoot then?

163
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm okay though.

164
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,400
What do we do then? It is hard to grab a taxi here too.

165
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,340
- I was strong since I was young. 
 - I'm very light, right?

166
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,540
You're not a book bag or a work bag, but why are you so heavy?

167
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,710
- What would you have done? 
 - You are giving me a piggyback ride anyway.

168
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,000
Give me a piggyback! A piggyback!

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,170
- Are you a feather? 
 - Oh, I'm already on your back.

170
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,690
Did you get neutered?

171
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,520
 I'm not sad. I'm upset. 

172
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm heavy. You're tired, right?

173
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,760
No, I am not tired.

174
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,210
You are not saying that I am not heavy.

175
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,040
I cannot lie.

176
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,820
Hey!

177
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,790
Don't worry. Do you think people with erectile dysfunction cannot even carry a woman?

178
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,220
You are saying negative things again!

179
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,130
I told you to not feel inferior!

180
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,780
Don't worry! You will be cured soon!

181
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,560
Who is your doctor anyways?

182
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,980
In the beginning, it was a bit like that,

183
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,660
but now I really mean it.

184
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,420
So I want you to overcome it soon.

185
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,820
I know.

186
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,570
How do you know?

187
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,430
Truthfulness can be felt even if it isn't spoken.

188
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,490
I will really try hard.

189
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,280
As much as you are caring a lot, to get good results,

190
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,390
I will work hard.

191
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,650
You can do it!

192
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,270
I believe in you.

193
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,940
♫  You quietly came to me  ♫

194
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,880
♫  Without a word, you stay next to me  ♫

195
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,350
♫  Another tough day has passed again  ♫

196
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,120
♫  I close my eyes and try to imagine tomorrow  ♫

197
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,210
♫   I am dreaming   ♫

198
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:49,420
♫  Just you and me  ♫

199
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,870
♫  Far, far fly higher  ♫

200
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,220
Please wait a bit.

201
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,720
The taxi is here.

202
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,930
- Do Yong Shik. 
 - What?

203
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,180
You really were not tired while carrying me?

204
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,580
Yeah. I told you I was fine.

205
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,230
♫  Fly higher, I dream of flying away  ♫

206
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,030
Let's go.

207
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,990
♫  Be a little calm  ♫

208
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:41,650
♫  Dreams that fly strongly, up so high  ♫

209
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,280
You came to Seoul, but I was not able to see your face. I am sorry.

210
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,450
That's okay.

211
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,060
You are probably busy studying.

212
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,260
Next time, please let me know if you are coming so I can make time.

213
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,230
Yong Shik, you know Ru Da,

214
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,960
how is she so vibrant

215
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,900
and grew up so prettily?

216
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,220
- Did she? 
  - She is so lovable, and 

217
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,460
seemed like such a great person.

218
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,980
She is.

219
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,550
- What are you doing? 
 - Just... because I couldn't fall asleep.

220
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,630
- What is that expression? I haven't seen it before. 
 - What?

221
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,830
How is my expression?

222
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,620
Like a warm

223
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,070
comfortable feeling?

224
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,020
Really?

225
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,320
It was very warm.

226
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,470
   

227
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,400
Yes?

228
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,930
You came?

229
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,480
Let's go to get treated.

230
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,420
Yes.

231
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,920
We will go to a time when Do Yong Shik was

232
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,760
most nervous and fearful recently.

233
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,540
What do you see?

234
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,650
 I see my mom being cursed at. 

235
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:14,590
Because of me, my mom is being looked down on.

236
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,450
But I can't do anything.

237
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,020
So at that moment, are you looking for the pink color again?

238
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,190
Ru Da is hugging me.

239
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,590
What?

240
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,490
She tells me it's okay.

241
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,240
She tells me not to suffer

242
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,300
 and is patting me. 

243
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,810
So how do you feel?

244
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,700
Oddly,

245
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,320
I feel relaxed.

246
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,010
Interestingly, I want to lean on.

247
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,750
Oddly...

248
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,960
I like it.

249
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,800
Someone like me

250
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,990
cannot be like this.

251
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,240
I like

252
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,160
Ru Da.

253
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,650
As I always say, your effort and willingness are the most important.

254
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,920
In everyday life, you need to try to minimize your obsession with pink.

255
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,840
Yes. Then I will see you at my next treatment.

256
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,720
I will get going.

257
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,600
Is this awkward?

258
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,630
Are you affected by what he said during the hypnosis?

259
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,680
Do you think you wouldn't look good in his eyes while you are in mine?

260
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:45,650
I know you want to treat him, but if you have no intentions of going to him, don't make him confused. You shouldn't do that to him.

261
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,560
Let's have dinner together later.

262
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,860
Not today. Let's do it next time.

263
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,900
It is my birthday today.

264
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,930
I know you were busy...

265
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:16,620
We have been busy for various reasons lately.

266
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,590
- Sorry... 
 - Let's please eat together.

267
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,790
Okay, let's do it.

268
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,950
♫  If I had the right shoes  ♫

269
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,590
 The votes were put in at the Blue House. 

270
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,360
 This is news we've just received. After receiving a report that a masked man kidnapped a woman in her 20s, 

271
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,940
 police have dispatched to the Gosichon area in Daseo-dong, Seoda district, Seoul. 

272
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,940
 Currently we know that the suspect and the woman went to a place with no CCTV 

273
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,700
 and the woman was wearing a white dress and a bag with pink accessories. 

274
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,130
- A library pass. 
 - Okay.

275
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,230
I am hungry.

276
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,060
Are we going to the cruise ship restaurant?

277
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,590
No. We are going to eat ramen.

278
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,580
What?

279
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,370
You said that it does not have to be an expensive course meal.

280
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,120
Even if you eat ramen on the streets, it would be good.

281
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,320
For my birthday, let's do that.

282
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,680
We are the police.

283
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,750
Sorry, but can we see your bag?

284
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,930
What?

285
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,350
We were informed that something was suspicious.

286
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,600
This?

287
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,410
Yes.

288
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,000
 Hey is this all yours? 

289
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,430
Why?

290
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,310
Why do you not want to show us? Is that not yours?

291
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,250
No, it is mine, but...

292
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,780
Wait a moment.

293
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,750
Wait a moment!

294
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,250
Get him!

295
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,640
What's going on?

296
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,150
Hey, open the door!

297
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,850
Open the door now!

298
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,460
We think we found the kidnapper. Please, bring more people.

299
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,000
It is so pretty here.

300
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,130
But can you eat here? You don't like eating outside.

301
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,570
But you like it.

302
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,210
Should we first make the ramen?

303
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,600
Okay, let's do it.

304
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,700
 Yes! 

305
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,820
 Hey, don't! You can't eat that. 

306
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,940
 I cannot end with this greasiness. 

307
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,900
 Hurry, have a seat! 

308
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,020
What are you doing?

309
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,590
What? Nothing.

310
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,940
He was not able to get hired for years!

311
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,480
He barely sees anyone.

312
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,470
If I go to get unpaid rent, most people tell me to come for a tea, but

313
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,990
 this person never let me in. 

314
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,220
 I really thought something was inside. 

315
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,450
 He had many weird things, now that I think about it. 

316
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,100
 What man would 

317
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,300
 have all these pink things? 

318
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,040
 He really did not seem normal. 

319
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,240
 He must be a pervert! 

320
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,170
 Yeah, that's what I think too. 

321
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,960
 I see. 

322
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,280
It is all done!

323
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,000
Let's eat!

324
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,900
Did it swell?

325
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,610
It doesn't taste good?

326
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,720
No, it tastes good!

327
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,590
Even if you are pretty, I think you won't be able to be an actress since you are bad at acting.

328
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,870
I will make it again. Did I add too much water?

329
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,050
No, it is okay.

330
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,120
Just wait a bit. We came all the way here so we need good ramen.

331
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,760
I will make it soon.

332
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,200
It really is okay.

333
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,700
   

334
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,420
   

335
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,460
   

336
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,120
What's wrong?

337
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,620
I think I have to go. Right now, Yong Shik is being misunderstood for a kidnapper.

338
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,320
Don't go!

339
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,880
He cannot be left alone. I need to go help.

340
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,370
That person is not the suspect. It will all be taken care of if he comes out of his apartment.

341
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,960
But it is not a simple thing for Yong Shik!

342
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,790
He is probably having a hard time breathing because of his anxiety.

343
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,410
I have a cast on.

344
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,580
You are still going to go?

345
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,570
I'm sorry.

346
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,790
 Are you an attention seeker? Or do you think you're a celebrity? 

347
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,580
 Hurry and get up! 

348
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,290
 Really! 

349
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,410
 Pathetic or what it's up to you to decide. 

350
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,940
 What are they to you anyway? How can you say that? 

351
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,540
 Don't be fearful when you didn't do anything wrong. 

352
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,540
That's right.

353
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,120
What did I do wrong?

354
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,260
I didn't do anything wrong, so what am I doing here like this?

355
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,420
Don't be a coward.

356
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,770
Don't get your self-esteem lowered.

357
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,560
 You can do it. I believe in you. 

358
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,010
I can do it!

359
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,380
He is coming out!

360
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,760
 Stay still. 

361
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,020
 Don't move! 

362
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,700
That bag is mine.

363
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,770
This is yours?

364
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,850
Are you kidding me?

365
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,090
I like the pink color.

366
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,680
What?

367
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,080
I like the pink color.

368
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,760
Is there something wrong with that?

369
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,550
A man can like the pink color too.

370
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,990
It is a bit unique but it isn't a bad thing.

371
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,560
I didn't commit any crime.

372
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

373
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,070
I don't have a job

374
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,480
and I don't have money, so I was not able to pay my rent a couple of times,

375
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,620
but are those reasons to be accused of as a kidnapper?

376
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:31,360
I don't have a lot of things and am a loser, but it does not mean that I don't have a conscience.

377
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,630
I did not commit a crime.

378
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,660
Then why did you run away, and why didn't you come out of your house?

379
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,710
I was scared.

380
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,990
Scared that you all will be like this.

381
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,840
If someone does not have enough, people look down on them

382
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,230
and accuse people.

383
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,410
I was afraid of that!

384
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,780
There is no one in there.

385
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,940
Officer Kim!

386
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,110
The kidnapper has been found.

387
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,930
What?

388
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,360
Are you sure?

389
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,150
There really is no one in there.

390
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,430
 - What is this? 
 - He wasn't the culprit? 

391
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,440
 - What's going on? 
 - Someone explain it. 

392
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,170
 Please step back. 

393
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,320
 Who is it? 

394
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,560
 That's not it. 

395
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,620
 I guess he was a decent guy after all. 

396
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,590
Yong Shik, let's go.

397
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,820
Get up now.

398
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,170
 Stay still. 

399
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,790
How do you feel?

400
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,600
I will tell you if you promise that you won't laugh at me.

401
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,070
Okay.

402
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,890
A little...

403
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,050
like a hero.

404
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,130
When I hit the bottom, no, the rock bottom.

405
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,020
When I was sinking,

406
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,190
I suddenly thought,

407
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:36,360
maybe I will not be able to go back up to the surface.

408
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:45,750
Today I accomplished what I thought was impossible.

409
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:55,390
In front of people, I finally stood up and raise my voice,

410
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:02,900
and I was able to, on my own, remove the false accusations and misunderstandings.

411
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,460
Now that I say it, a hero sounds too grand.

412
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,230
Not like a saved person.

413
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,190
You even saved a pretty person.

414
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,650
A long time ago... during that accident,

415
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,880
you saved me.

416
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,690
With your bare body, you blocked the glasses,

417
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,010
and the glass pieces even got stuck on your body.

418
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,390
Like that, you saved me first.

419
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,650
♫  I’ve walked around for a long time  ♫

420
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,760
I did that?

421
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,850
So, even though I nagged on the outside,

422
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:11,060
inside, I had trust even without me knowing...

423
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,430
that you would one day overcome everything

424
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,590
and go back to how you used to be.

425
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:26,120
Someone who is able to sacrifice oneself for others can do anything.

426
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,190
♫  In your warm hands  ♫

427
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:38,410
♫  My frozen heart, in your heart  ♫

00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,640
You did well.

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,940
♫  I want to be with you  ♫

431
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,460
For real.

00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,090
♫  There was no word we just  ♫

433
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,160
You were cool.

434
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,370
♫  Hold me in your arms  ♫

435
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,290
♫  If I could see your smile everyday  ♫

00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:31,210

445
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,070
♫  time seems to stand still  ♫

446
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,940
♫  everything on the street  ♫

♫  you who are walking to me  ♫

448
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:40,370
♫  became blurry more and more  ♫

449
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,330
What's wrong?

450
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:52,090
♫  My cold hands, in your warm hands  ♫

451
