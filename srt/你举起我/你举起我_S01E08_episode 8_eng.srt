Ru Da's sister.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,700
Something bad happened, right now my sister...

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,640
My sister is unconscious!

22

 When you watch a romance film, 

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,950
 does the male lead sending the female lead to another guy look cool? 

24
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,560
 In real life, that's a pathetic act. 

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,770
 Are you still going to act so pathetically? 

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,820
 Are you gonna do such a stupid thing? 

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,400

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
Oppa,

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,650
what happened to my sister? What do you mean unconscious?

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,590
She's fine. You need to calm down.

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,320
She was unconscious for a while due to a concussion.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,570
Now she's back.

36

♫  I really wanted to see you,  ♫

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,880
It is worth it that we held ancestral rites every year. Our ancestors really helped us.

41
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm glad it was a mild concussion.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,320
What could've happened if you hit your head harder?

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,220
She's right. You shouldn't have searched for it for so long. You should have given up if you weren't able to find it.

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,850
Why did you go into the water to find a ring?

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,120
What is it if we lose it?

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,710
We can't just lose it.

47
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,900
It's a really important ring to us.

48
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,750
Is it that important?

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,370
Yes, I'm sad that I couldn't find it.

50
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,160
No, I'll-I'll buy another one.

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,490
Forget it.

52
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,660
Other rings are meaningless.

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,680
   

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,990
I'm glad she wasn't hurt badly.

55
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,980
I'm really relieved.

56
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,510
 It's a precious ring to us. 

57
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,580
 Other rings are meaningless. 

58
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,070
   

59
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,810
It's really deep.

60
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,950
 It's a really important ring to us.

75
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,980
I found it!

76
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,020
- Are you tired? 
 - I'm fine.

77
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,480
- Lee Ru Da's guardian? 
 - Yes.

78
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,470
Just a minute.

79
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,670
 Oppa! 

80
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,280
 Oppa! 

81
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,050
 Here, here! 

82
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,850
 Where are looking at? Here, here. 

83
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,610
Oppa!

84
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,640
What?

85
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,490
So that's why you just came?

86
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,190
You should've said hello when she woke up.

87
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,620
You should've bragged about how you found the ring!

88
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,170
Women are always touched by things like that.

89
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,150
If she knows that you threw yourself to find the ring,

90
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,360
her heart will race.

91
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,280
That's impossible.

92
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,070
- Why? 
 - Even so,

93
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,650
how can I beat Dr. Do?

94
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,440
What's so great about Dr. Do?

95
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,290
Of course he's great.

96
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,110
What about you? What's so bad about you?

97
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,840
I haven't even gotten a job yet.

98
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,830
- You'll get sooner. 
 - I'm not rich either.

99
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,840
Who knows if we'll win the lottery tomorrow?

100
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm timid too.

101
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,480
You're just kind. Really! Aigoo!

102
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,920
From what I know,

103
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,350
I don't think you're particularly good at anything.

104
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,460
And also, I don't think there's anything particularly bad.

105
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,160
Why he's chasing me?

106
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,170
S-Save me.

107
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,240
I don't have money!

108
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,470
I forgot my wallet! Do you still want it?

109
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,230
- Yong Shik? 
 - Yes.

110
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,970
Hello, I'm your fan, Kim Cho Rong.

111
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,200
- Fan-Fan? 
 - Yes.

112
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,150
I'm nervous.

113
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,400
All this time I didn't have the courage,

114
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,920
so I just kept sending gifts. Today, I really wanted to meet you, so I waited.

115
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,620
G-Gifts?

116
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,930
D-Dolls?

117
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,110
Yes.

118
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,510
I made them.

119
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,710
To be honest, I really love quilted dolls.

120
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,410
Since I was little, I like to make a doll.

121
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,810
I don't like it when people point their fingers at me asking what sewing is.

122
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,220
So I just gave up and went to business administration.

123
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,330
A few days ago, I saw the video on social media where you were misunderstood for a kidnapper.

124
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,470
What's wrong with me? I cried a lot.

125
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,260
Seeing you confidently asking if men can't like pink.

126
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,040
I was ashamed of myself for giving up what I wanted to do because I was conscious of others.

127
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,230
So I decided to take a semester off and go to a quilting academy.

128
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,530
Thanks to you, I gained courage.

129
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,590
Okay.

130
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,600
This is a gift for the hero who changed my life.

131
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,290
Thank you, Yong Shik.

132
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,630
You are really cool.

133
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,370
Thank you.

134
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,920
 This is a gift for the hero who changed my life. 

135
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,290
 Thank you, Yong Shik. 

136
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,240
What's wrong?

137
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,570
What happened to me today?

138
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,680
 Don't you even feel bad for you, Do Yong Shik? 

139
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,620
 Even if other people curse at you, 

140
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,940
 you should love yourself. 

141
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,990
 You always say that you aren't good enough. 

142
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,500
That's right.

143
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,230
That's right... I just crouched.

144
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,350
I pity you, Do Yong Shik.

145
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,790
 What about you? What's so bad about you? 

146
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,080
Right.

147
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,180
What's wrong with me?

148
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,710
What's so bad about me?

149
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,600
Which part?

150
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,980
Which part of me is not good?

151
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,340
From this moment, I...

152
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,190
I'm going to say something rude to Do Ji Hyuk.

153
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,060
Please go on.

154
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,200
This one.

155
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,050
A few years ago, sandals and white socks didn't look good on me.

156
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,600
It's an old fashion, people say.

157
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,590
But these days, if you wear it well, it's fashionable.

158
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,290
Of course... I still look like an old man because I wore them.

159
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,900
So what?

160
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,210
So, last time you said that

161
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,170
there is also a thing called harmony between people.

162
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,440
But I think that suiting someone

163
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,520
depends on your decision.

164
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,450
So what?

165
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,290
I didn't dare to talk about it because

166
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,350
I felt like I couldn't even deal with you.

167
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,250
I like Ru Da.

168
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,400
I know that you are engaged, but

169
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,050
for one time,

170
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,040
just one time, I want to meet Ru Da.

171
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,000
A meeting?

172
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,060
I've hurt Ru Da.

173
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,290
For hurting her, I want to apologize.

174
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,430
And I sincerely really liked her.

175
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,000
I mean, I just wanted to

176
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
tell her not to get hurt too much about what I did.

177
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,180
So,

178
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,390
I'm going to meet Ru Da.

179
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,130
So, are you warning the goalkeeper

180
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,610
before shooting?

181
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,220
Yes.

182
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,860
No need to do that.

183
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes... what?

184
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm not the goalkeeper anymore.

185
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,620
I was sent off.

186
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,860
 I'm proposing. 

187
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,920
 I like it. 

188
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,800
 What I wanted was this Ji Hyuk. 

189
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,040
 Pretending to be strong, playing hard to get, without all that. 

190
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,710
 You sincerely with your whole heart expressing it. 

191
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,580
 So now I'm really touched and thankful. 

192
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,890
 But, 

193
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,970
 I can't accept this. 

194
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,170
 Now, Ji Hyuk, 

195
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,840
 I can no longer give you all my heart. 

196
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,400
 I'm sorry. 

197
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,070
 I was expecting this. 

198
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,680
 But to end without doing anything like this, 

199
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,270
 I think my crush for ten years is becoming too worthless. 

200
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,760
 So I wanted to try once. 

201
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,540
 I should have realized what I felt and cut things off earlier. 

202
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,110
 It's okay. 

203
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,650
 If that was the case, I wouldn't have been able to 

204
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,750
 confess my feelings as honestly as today. 

205
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,420
 Now are you going to him? 

206
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,020
 No. 

207
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,220
 I'm waiting. 

208
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:09,160
 Until Yong Shik comes to me with courage. 

209
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,630
 I'm a little... mature, right? 

210
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,000
 I'm not quite sure what to do now. 

211
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,580
 You're going to run into me at work. What should I do? 

212
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,400
 I think I can help you with that. 

213
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,640
 I'm quitting Jang Sunbae's hospital. 

214
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,540
 I'm going to open a business. 

215
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,350
 What? 

216
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,690
 You should go get your handkerchief now. 

217
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,860
 Let's go, Ji Hyuk. 

218
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,340
 Yes. 

219
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,450
 That's true. They've dated for a pretty long time now. 

220
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,460
 I've seen them together for a long time now, 

221
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,360
 the both of them suit each other really well. 

222
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,180
 You came. 

223
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,080
 Here. 

224
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,560
 Goodbye. 

225
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:51,850
 Aigoo. 

226
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,920
 What's the age difference between the two of them? 

227
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,650
 I'm not sure. 

228
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,030
 Hyun Bin is a year older than Son Ye Jin or the same age? 

229
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,290
 It's a perfect age. 

230
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,620
 I hope they get married soon! 

231
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,280
 I hope too... I mean nice! 

232
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,880
 - Congrats. 
 - Thank you. 

233
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,820
 Thank you. 

234
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,020
 This is so well. 

235
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,540
 - Ru Da. 
 - What? Ah! 

236
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,830
 I think the sofa is better there. 

237
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,520
 I think the leather will go bad quickly because of the sunlight over there. 

238
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,500
 It's because you were worried about Do Yong Shik, right? 

239
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,130
 Yes. 

240
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
 You're probably thinking, "Serves her right." 

241
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,640
 No. 

242
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,580
 Where's the physical therapy room? Let's go to see it. 

243
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,520
   

244
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,890
That ring then?

245
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,750
Ring?

246
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,080
This one?

247
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,480
This one is from our school.

248
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,910
What?

249
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,740
Director Jang must have had it in his hand. You didn't see it?

250
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,760
 Here. 

251
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,770
 That's a bit too much. 

252
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,360
 You must really live well. 

253
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,240
 Are you also leaving school like you are leaving here? 

254
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,280
 No way. 

255
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,130
 Our school has a strong bond. 

256
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,960
 What are you saying? 

257
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,800
 Make sure you don't leave anything behind. 

258
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,230
 Forget it. 

259
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,560
 There's no other ring like that. 

260
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,000
 That's right. 

261
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,610
 It's a ring that only the founding members of our association bought. 

262
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,910
You don't have to ask for my understanding. Right now—

263
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,850
Do Yong Shik.

264
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,760
It's an important day, so you have to pay attention to this.

265
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,660
I think I'm such a cool guy.

266
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,700
Do Yong Shik.

267
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,600
You idiot.

268
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,380
 He can't even swim. 

269
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,660
 He's even scared of water. 

270
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,600
 Hold on. Please stop there. 

271
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,680
 What? Why are you so surprised? 

272
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,610
 I didn't exercise 

273
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,110
 for too long so my body— 

274
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,700
 Do Yong Shik you really... 

275
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
After going into the pool like that,

276
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,900
why don't you have that much courage?

277
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,640
You're a jerk.

278
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,020
Live like that forever.

279
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,450
   

280
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,130
 Ru Da, I'm sorry I hurt you so much. 

281
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,860
 I'll wait for you at the Han River where we met before.

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,220
I found out that you had a pride fight with Dr. Do,

306
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,640
I was really angry.

♫  Something I do  ♫

313

and I was angry at myself because I liked you.

317
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,390
   

318
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,000
I have liked

319

you since then.

00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,910
I like you, Lee Ru Da.

I'm really sorry for hurting you then.

322
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,650
I hurt you with words that I didn't mean because of my worthless pride.

323

Honestly, I like you like crazy.

324

Every day I missed you like hell.

325

Ru Da, it turns out I'm a great person too.

326

00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,810
♫  Without a word, you stay next to me  ♫

329
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,220
♫  Another tough day has passed again  ♫

330
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:08,030
♫  I close my eyes and try to imagine tomorrow  ♫

331
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:13,330
♫  I am dreaming  ♫

332
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:19,750
♫  Just you and me  ♫

333
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,160
♫  Far, far fly higher  ♫

334
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,650
♫  I dream of flying with you  ♫

335
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,830
Did you raise up?

336
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,350
No, wait a minute.

337
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,630
It's ok. Do it slowly.

338
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,780
It's raising up!

339
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,750
It's up.

340
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,780
It's up.

341
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,090
W-wait.

342
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,430
Hold on.

343
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,280
It's sad but it still has a good vibe, right?

344
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,550
It's pretty.

345
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,200
But,

346
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:40,600
don't we need to set up something else now?

347
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,770
Oh, wait.

348
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,660
♫  I miss you everyday  ♫

349
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,730
♫  But I will never admit  ♫

350
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,980
   

351
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,390
 After a while, 

352
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:34,430
 I was notified that I had finally failed the civil service exam. 

353
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,410
 Did I do the interview too emotionally? 

354
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,360
♫  I want to get closer to you slowly  ♫

355
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,910
 And after that, I didn't prepare for the civil service exam anymore. 

356
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,280
   

357
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,380
Good Morning.

358
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,940
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

359
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,890
Good Morning.

360
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,930
Hello.

361
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,720
 Instead, I joined a small company that accepted me. 

362
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,360
   

363
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,300
   

364
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,670
By the way, what happened to your promotion?

365
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,670
- Don't bring up the promotion. 
 - Alright.

366
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,980
- Guess you didn't get it this time either. 
 - I screwed it up.

367
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,730
I heard you got a job too.

368
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,730
So how is it? Is your salary okay?

369
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,260
It's a little less than two million.

370
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,140
Hey. Why don't you just study more about civil servants?

371
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,590
No. I thought it would be a waste of time.

372
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,770
 I did my best, but my ability is up to here. 

373
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,870
 I just decided to admit my limitations. 

374
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,760
Even if you work part-time these days, wouldn't you earn that much?

375
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,600
Part-timers at my company get over two million too.

376
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,370
- Yong Shik. 
 - Yes?

377
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,020
You have to think carefully.

378
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,020
If a man isn't capable enough, then even if he has a really loving girlfriend,

379
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,210
it would take her less than a moment to break up with him.

380
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,540
What?

381
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,800
I get it.

382
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,550
Let's say cheers.

383
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,640
Cheers.

384
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,110
Yong Shik, congratulations.

385
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,240
Congratulations for the job.

386
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,210
 Maybe to someone, I'm still a loser. 

387
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,810
 I might be a humble life with only 30 points. 

388
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:18,180
 I'm 32 years old, but I still don't have a car. 

389
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,350
 I'm still living in a studio apartment. 

390
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,670
   

391
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,080
 I still live struggling with card debt. 

392
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,790
What? Why so much?

393
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,650
 But if there's anything different 

394
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,370
 I learned that there is happiness in a 30-point life. 

395
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,360
Yes?

396
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,480
Oppa, I'm craving alcohol today. Let's go drink.

397
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,350
You buy then.

398
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,860
 In my life with 30 points... 

399
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,670
 I have a friend who I can meet without worrying about money. 

400
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:01,080
 There are also neighbor friends who can communicate without saying a word. 

401
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:17,800
 Now, I'm enjoying it without being obsessed with my taste. 

402
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,350
You must be hungry, I will cook ramen for you.

403
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,040
I cook it quickly.

404
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,900
I saw on the internet that, when put clams in the ramen, it tastes very refreshing.

405
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,390
Daebak!

406
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,220
Do you want it?

407
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,230
See.

408
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,120
 My precious partner who can laugh with a few bags of ramen all night. 

409
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,420
 There are people I love, too. 

410
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,010
Surprise!

411
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,980
 Maybe my mouth might have liked ramen more 

412
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,110
 than a 200,000 won course meal on TV. 

413
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,390
 Even though I already have what I like, 

414
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:23,200
 the days where I struggled because I wasn't able to obtain what others deemed best, 

415
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,330
 now that those times have passed, when I look back, 

416
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,740
 I was a person who never had to bow. 

417
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,750
 Something that everyone is curious about. 

418
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,370
 To tell you about that... 

419
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,830
You look handsome.

420
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,820
How much?

421
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,410
To the point where Park Bo Gum kneels and Cha Eun Woo gets slapped.

422
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,670
Great.

423
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:42,070
 I am a very, very healthy and proud Korean man. 

424
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:50,000
 Channel Manager: flowersnacc 

425
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,020
 Chief Segmenter: bepina 

426
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:03,220

427
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:09,430


428
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:16,230


429
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,450


430
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:29,210

431
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:35,390

432
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:41,690
