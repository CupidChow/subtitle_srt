1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,830
   

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,540
♫  Just tell me you can get up, so, so  ♫

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,980
   

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,740
    
 ♫  Just tell me you can do anything.  ♫

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,640


6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,820
   

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,030
Are you really that Do Yong Shik?

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,990
That's not possible.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,020
 A better man than you was there for me. 

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,740
 Someone you've never met before, someone much better than you. My first love. 

11
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,460
- Are you ok? 
 - I'm sorry.

12
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,530
Excuse me... your cel-cell phone.

13
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,750
Excuse me!

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,670
Your phone!

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,280
What's wrong?

16
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,760
 In my previous life, 

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,990
 was I one of the "Five Eulsa Traitors"? 
 (T/N: Five officials serving under Emperor Gojong who signed the Eulsa Treaty of 1905 making Korea a protectorate of Japan) 

18
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,170
 Without selling out my country, 

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,490
 how could I be so humiliated? 

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,260
 Are you really Do Yong Shik? 

21
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,920
Where should we go?

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,850
Hey, seriously! Where should we go?

23
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,480
♫  In the days that have passed  ♫ 
 ♫  For me, your warm  ♫

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,640
S-S-S-Stop... Ooh!

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,720
You have to take out the ten cents that just increased.

26
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,190
You're back early. Seems like you didn't go on a date with Ji Hyuk this time.

27
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,230
What's wrong with her?

28
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,350
Have you seen a ghost or what?

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,440
It would be better if I actually saw a ghost.

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,390
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,980
Hey, I today met Do Yong Shik.

32
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,100
Do Yong Shik?

33
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,430
Your first love?

34
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,590
Yes, in the hospital as a patient.

35
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,590
Because of erectile dysfunction.

36
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,750
Oh my god! How?

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,190
I also don't know. He left immediately after the checkup.

38
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,260
Then you haven't even greeted each other properly.

39
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,980
But I am so disappointed.

40
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,420
What is Yong Shik doing now?

41
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,850
I don't know his job.

42
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,350
You don't know his job and you haven't talked to him properly,

43
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,930
- then why are you so disappointed? 
 - What?

44
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh, because of the erectile dysfunction?

45
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Didn't you tell me before that was something minor like a cold?

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,250
No, it's

47
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,550
not like that.

48
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,880
Just the vibe he gave off was...

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,590
Just like a worn-out student.

50
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,150
Isn't that just how you feel?

51
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,570
If you look at that, everything Ji Hyuk said was right.

52
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,220
Always saying a sincere heart is more important than money,

53
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,800
but you also look at appearances.

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Hey, no I don't.

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,410
If not,

56
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,320
then enquire what kind of person is Yong Shik Oppa.

57
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,950
Then you can be disappointed.

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Then the doctor who checked your erectile dysfunction

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,380
was your first love?

60
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh, it's totally your fate.

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,050
You call being half naked with your thing out fate?

62
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,090
Return the money for the talisman.

63
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,360
You said something good would happen!

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,650
Oh, sir, what's wrong?

65
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,820
Have you ever seen a fortune-telling shop that refunds? Don't talk such nonsense.

66
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,200
Okay.

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,000
It really was funny.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,690
Everyone imagines meeting their first love again.

69
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,440
Next time I meet her should I just act cool and tell her I used to like her?

70
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,690
But when I saw her wearing a doctor's gown,

71
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,090
it felt like my face got burned by fire.

72
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,760
Should you have to think so far?

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,870
She was a Two Plus rank.

74
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,400
Bottom ranks can't even go on the same plate

75
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,190
or even know them. That kind of Two Plus rank.

76
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,870
What?

77
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,870
Right now, I am

78
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,590
so embarrassed.

79
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,970
Seriously. Take it.

80
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,980
   

81
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,250
This is going too far, even if I think about it.

82
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,960
How will I find him with just the name of the neighborhood?

83
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,390
He's not even picking up the phone.

84
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,470
That's right, I lost my phone.

85
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:10,300
I thought of calling my phone when I met Kim Myung Ja, but instead, I just drank a lot.

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,520
My stomach is burning.

87
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,620
Aigoo.

88
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,070
That's right, this is where a lot of graduate students live.

89
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,560
Aish!

90
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,230
Do Yong Shik.

91
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,390
You are Do Yong Shik, right?

92
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,860
What are you doing here?

93
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,730
I came to see you.

94
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,860
If you are not busy, want to have brunch with me?

95
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,420
No,

96
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,260
- I am— 
 - It's a relief you don't seem busy right now. Let's go, get in.

97
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,160
I mean, I haven't seen you in a long time,

98
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,420
and we didn't get to talk much.

99
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,390
I thought it'd be a shame to just end it there.

100
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,800
Yes.

101
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,470
I can understand why you left so hurriedly yesterday.

102
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,440
So don't worry too much about it.

103
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,590
It's my job to look at men down there.

104
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm not so immature as to not be able to differentiate between my work and personal life.

105
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,220
Okay.

106
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,190
I was also very curious.

107
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,850
How did you live?

108
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,660
Like everyone else.

109
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,930
 This is bullcrap. I couldn't even follow others to their feet. 

110
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,190
So right now... what are you doing?

111
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,800
 Is he really Do Yong Shik? 

112
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,540
 Our class president, Yong Shik. 

113
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,770
 Ninth rank? You have been preparing for ninth rank for six years?! 

114
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,030
I have a business.

115
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,870
A business?

116
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,030
I run a small IT company.

117
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,870
- An IT company? 
 - Yeah.

118
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,400
The revenue is 30 billion won, but it'll cross 50 billion won this year.

119
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,700
Gonna take over a company using block and planning to launch a delivery app.

120
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,760
Oh, really?

121
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,300
I couldn't go home for months because of that.

122
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,130
So you don't live here.

123
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,130
My office is here.

124
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,630
I've been staying up late at my office for so many months.

125
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,710
- I look weird, right? 
 - Not at all.

126
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,900
It happens when you're so busy.

127
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,980
What?

128
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,280
After a long time, should I act cute and ask for an allowance?

129
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,740
So what are you going to do about your erectile dysfunction treatment?

130
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,020
It seems fine.

131
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,340
It seems like it'll be a temporary thing.

132
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,290
Figures. You're tired after staying up late for months.

133
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,870
It makes sense.

134
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,990
It's all right.

135
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,710
Okay.

136
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,320
Actually, yesterday, I misunderstood you.

137
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,210
Misunderstood me?

138
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,410
Men that go through erectile dysfunction at your age

139
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,520
is usually psychogenic.

140
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,820
That means they either have trauma,

141
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,510
or have low self-esteem.

142
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,920
Self-esteem.

143
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,560
I didn't even know you were such a busy company CEO.

144
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,810
I thought it was psychogenic erectile dysfunction because you were going through a rough time.

145
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,810
Did you?

146
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,170
If I just look at your outward appearance,

147
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,080
you look like a person who has been studying for the civil exam for quite a few years.

148
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,100
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

149
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,930
That was a mean joke, wasn't it?

150
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,650
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,980
- Sister-in-law! 
 - Oppa!

152
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,030
- Hello! 
 - What brings you here?

153
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,670
My sister left her purse at home, so I'm here to give it to her.

154
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,710
She hasn't come to work yet.

155
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,040
She still hasn't come?

156
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,780
She must have so much to talk about with her first love.

157
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,790
First love?

158
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,750
Please don't misunderstand.

159
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,080
They coincidentally met at the hospital yesterday.

160
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Because they met after a long time they went out for a meal.

161
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,160
Okay, you can give me the purse.

162
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,600
Sure!

163
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
- Bye! 
 - Bye.

164
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I was going to pay.

165
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,460
It's fine.

166
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,670
Okay, since you're doing well.

167
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm not going to feel any pressure.

168
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,140
Of course.

169
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,220
Instead, lend me your phone. I need to find my phone.

170
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,140
Sure, just a minute.

171
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,950
   

172
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,730
 A better man than you, was there. 

173
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,560
 For me. 

174
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,860
 Someone you've never met before, someone much better than you. My first love. 

175
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,250
Yes, I found this phone.

176
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,950
Oh, here? I'm at Hannamdong at Do Mind Clinic.

177
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,180
Please come whenever it's comfortable for you.

178
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,110
Yes.

179
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,520
What's this?

180
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
This is Ru Da's number.

181
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,310
 She must have so much to talk about with her first love. 

182
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,390
 They coincidently met at the hospital yesterday. 

183
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,650
 I'm sorry. 

184
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,260
 - Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry. 

185
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,220
 Excuse me! 

186
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,350
Then this person

187
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,870
is Ru Da's first love.

188
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,060
Thanks for lending me your phone.

189
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,320
Is it all right if I contact you occasionally?

190
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,710
No.

191
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,190
My girlfriend wouldn't like that.

192
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,550
Ah, so you have a girlfriend.

193
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,260
Keeping contact with a friend that's a girl,

194
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,410
no girl would like that.

195
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,020
Right.

196
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,990
Okay, then. It was nice seeing you.

197
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,780
Me too.

198
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,600
Should I drive you to your office?

199
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,480
No, I'll walk for some exercise.

200
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,290
Fine.

201
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,920
Do Yong Shik's still the same.

202
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,840
I would have been really sorry.

203
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,360
Wait, but did he have to be so firm?

204
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,040
Well, his girlfriend must be happy.

205
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,260
The food was too expensive...

206
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,790
It's okay. I won't see her again anyway.

207
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,080
You did well. You did well, Do Yong Shik.

208
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,270
   

209
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,010
Why did I have to drop my phone here of all places?

210
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,810
   

211
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,270
I heard there was a phone here.

212
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,460
Please wait for a minute.

213
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,150
Sure.

214
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,520
Are you here for your phone?

215
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,330
Ah, yes.

216
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,140
While you're here, please have a cup of tea before you leave.

217
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,400
Oh, no, no, there's no need.

218
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,420
Still, it must have been hard getting here.

219
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,940
No, it's all right.

220
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,980
I have to go to my part-time job.

221
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,720
I'll leave after collecting my phone.

222
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,670
Part-time job.

223
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,710
Here.

224
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,520
I should pay you for the nuisance, but I have no money to spare.

225
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,890
- I'm sorry 
 - It's all right.

226
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,900
Sure, sure.

227
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,630
Excuse me.

228
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,300
Yes?

229
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,140
Your sneakers are pretty.

230
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,720
I like pink too.

231
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,620
Oh, I see.

232
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,680
- Bye. 
 - Ah, yes.

233
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,900
Here, Ru Ri dropped it off earlier.

234
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,300
Thanks.

235
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,750
Where did you go without your purse and came to work late?

236
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,070
I met my first love.

237
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,060
Oh, how was he?

238
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,320
He was amazing as usual.

239
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,300
He's the CEO of an IT company that has a revenue of 50 billion won.

240
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,460
 I need to go to my part-time job. 

241
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,380
Because he was so busy he didn't know how to groom himself,

242
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,900
and for someone who can even research that, someone who is like a genius engineering student,

243
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,040
he seemed very intelligent.

244
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,930
So don't be too arrogant.

245
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,590
There are a lot of men in the world who are better than you, Do Ji Hyuk.

246
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,560
I have to go see patients.

247
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
What do I do with her?

248
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,070
Did she always lie that well?

249
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,040
I parted ways with Ru Da, and now I'm on my way after collecting my phone.

250
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,480
I see.

251
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
But did you meet someone other than your first love?

252
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,850
Why?

253
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,570
Your fortune says there is a special person

254
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,050
who will change your life.

255
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,450
Really?

256
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,350
The people I met today were Ru Da,

257
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,850
and the person who found my phone.

258
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,780
 I like pink too. 

259
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,470
I did meet a psychiatrist.

260
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:18,600
It must be him! You said the erectile dysfunction happened because of psychological issues. Maybe he will fix it.

261
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,970
  Hold on to him.  

262
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,910
 Just because you are afraid of maggots does not mean you cannot make a fermented paste. 
 (T/N: Korean proverb, even if there are obstacles, you got to do what you got to do) 

263
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,270
 Of all things, he might be the one to fix my erectile dysfunction. 

264
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,350
  I can't lose him.  

265
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,560
Erectile dysfunction... Consultation?

266
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,390
Yes.

267
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,530
I probably have psychogenic erectile dysfunction.

268
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,160
May I know about the condition in detail?

269
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,910
It doesn't stand even by itself.

270
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,120
In the morning too, it doesn't stand.

271
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,290
Oh, okay.

272
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,260
Since it's our first day,

273
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,650
I need to listen to your story. The story of how you've lived so far.

274
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,880
When I was young, it was easy

275
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,320
but when I was in high school, 3rd grade, there was something wrong with the insurance that my dad made

276
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,990
and things got difficult for our family.

277
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,370
I needed to raise money for the school fees, rent and living expenses.

278
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,770
Improving my resume...

279
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,780
there was no time for that.

280
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,740
It must've been since then.

281
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,460
That I thought I was falling behind compared to others.

282
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,910
After failing my civil service exam twice,

283
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,650
my attachment to the color pink became more serious.

284
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:22,690
That probably means that I became less sure about my self and anxious.

285
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,710
Yes, thank you.

286
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,690
Your erectile dysfunction,

287
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,400
as predicted, seems to be psychological.

288
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,820
If your self esteem continues to fall, then people tend to get lethargic

289
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,820
then even when is alone, one tends to get sullen.

290
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,870
And that turned into erectile dysfunction.

291
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,280
Ah, yes.

292
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,520
Today I'll put together a treatment program with a test and consultation.

293
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,100
Till the next consultancy,

294
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
you should think of one of your strengths everyday.

295
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,850
S-Strengths?

296
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,560
It's the basic training to raise your self-esteem.

297
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,370
You will be able to do well.

298
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,590
Okay.

299
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,830
Thank you, doctor.

300
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,930
My strengths?

301
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:47,340
The perseverance to not give up civil service for six years?

302
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,060
How is that perseverance?

303
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,970
Frugality.

304
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,280
My foot. I'm just frugal because I don't have money.

305
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,840
Height?

306
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:13,460
I am a bit taller than the average Korean man.

307
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,180
This size is good enough.

308
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
Ah.

309
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,330
   
   

310
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,960
   

311
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,020
It was too sudden.

312
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,160
Way to treat erectile dysfunction?

313
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,370
Yeah, there was a patient who came to consult about psychogenic erectile dysfunction

314
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,260
and it might be helpful to also treat the urological issues.

315
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,190
I will pay for the urology treatment. How about you help me?

316
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,550
Since when did you become Hippocrates?

317
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,100
I want to help this patient.

318
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,590
As I was consulting him, a 31 years old, jobless,

319
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:17,040
his self-esteem is at rock bottom, and erectile dysfunction is on top of that. It's such a pity.

320
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,530
If that's your intention, then okay.

321
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,760
Work is work.

322
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,090
Thanks.

323
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,960
Send me the consultation files.

324
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,880
I haven't gotten his approval yet, so I can't hand them over right now.

325
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,790
Next time, why don't you match to his appointment schedule?

326
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,570
Okay.

327
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,780
   

328
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,680
Okay, it's our second consultation.

329
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,030
Has there been any progression?

330
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,470
No, not yet.

331
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,220
Well, it's just the start, so don't be too disappointed.

332
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,790
In the meantime, I've put together a treatment program for you.

333
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:10,770
I think it would be helpful to treat the urological issues too.

334
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,010
Sorry?

335
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,690
Our hospital has a connection with a urology center, so I tried getting a consultation.

336
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,100
The treatment fee is covered with the consultation, so don't feel pressured.

337
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,290
- Yes. 
 - I see.

338
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,420
Yes, doctor?

339
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,940
Do Yong Shik.

340
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,520
The life story of Yong Shik, current personal life, and the situation has all been said

341
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,170
so the treatment consultation should be easy.

342
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,450
Sorry?

343
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,580
Why are you here?

344
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,540
 At the age of 31, he's still jobless. 

345
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,120
 His self-esteem is at rock bottom, and erectile dysfunction is on top of that. 

346
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,550
You're the CEO of an IT company—

347
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,090
Excuse me!

348
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,760
Do Yong Shik.

349
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,520
How can you leave like that, Yong Shik?

350
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,020
- Why did you do that? 
 - What?

351
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,160
I requested to be treated only by you.

352
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,920
It is erectile dysfunction and nothing else, right?

353
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,110
Don't you want to fix it as soon as possible?

354
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,280
If someone was to ask if I want to live with erectile dysfunction all my life or to die,

355
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,810
then I think it is embarrassing and awful enough to say that I will die.

356
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,580
Let's go in. First, get treated—

357
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,690
The patient gave up on the treatment.

358
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,680
He must have been embarrassed since he was in front of a female doctor.

359
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,000
Stop acting.

360
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
That's right. But, why?

361
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,920
I was wondering why you felt this much care as a doctor.

362
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,360
- Ru Da— 
 - You set it all up knowing everything.

363
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,420
How did you find out? Did you do a background check? Did you follow me?

364
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,020
Okay. I know it was a pathetic move.

365
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,710
But I didn't stalk nor did a background search.

366
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,320
I coincidently found out that he was your first love.

367
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,980
Fine. It's not important how you found out.

368
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,250
You've would've found out by using any means.

369
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,560
You must have been surprised after you found out the truth about my first lover.

370
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,400
I must've been a joke to you.

371
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,730
Also like this, I don't have a man in life.

372
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,840
You checked it out and would have been satisfied.

373
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,380
Don't be sarcastic.

374
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,400
Do you not know why I went this far?

375
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,930
I know. Since you've found out anyway,

376
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,980
you are saying that I should stop being stubborn and admit that you are the best one in my life.

377
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,570
- Lee Ru Da. 
 - How

378
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,060
can you

379
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,530
play such tricks on humans?

380
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,170
 Someone better than him was there for me. 

381
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,910
 He's the CEO of an IT company with a revenue of 50 billion won. 

382
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:53,840
 There are a lot of men in the world who are better than you. 

383
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,850
 You're the CEO of an IT company— 

384
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,490
 With nothing to see in a pitiful life, 

385
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,120
 the reason why humans still live on, 

386
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,590
 is because once in a while when one is tired there is a day that comes that is better. 

387
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,350
 But my life, 

388
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:19,160
 is like a room that is ten floors down 

389
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,730
 without any windows and walls that are moist and dark. 

390
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:32,860
 Every day is pathetic. A life without hope. 

391
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,130
 A life without a reason to live. 

392
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,330
 Bottom ranks need to be disposed of as soon as possible. 

393
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,580
Let's go, I'll drop you off.

394
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,110
Stop acting like this.

395
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,910
There's a limit to me holding on to you.

396
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,950
Hold on to me?

397
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,910
Does it look like I'm still childishly playing hard to get?

398
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,740
Yes, I see you like that and that's not good.

399
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,640
What did you say?

400
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,410
You said that he was your first love earlier.

401
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,890
If you even like someone like that, why are you treating me like this?

402
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,260
I didn't lie.

403
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,430
What?

404
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,970
He was a great guy.

405
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,530
As much as I've known until now.

406
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,970
You saw him with your own eyes. Are you going to be like this till the end?

407
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,250
You didn't see Yong Shik from the past.

408
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:03,580
His life has gotten a little complicated, and so he's become insecure.

409
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,550
He'll change after receiving treatment.

410
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,290
Stop... wow.

411
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,140
If I fix his erectile dysfunction, he won't live like that anymore.

412
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,980
So what? Are you going to treat his illness?

413
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,290
Yes, I will.

414
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,250
And then I will turn him back to how he used to be.

415
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,690
I'll show you that I didn't like a worthless person.

416
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,180
- Have you gone crazy? 
 - No.

417
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,010
I'm a psychiatrist. His case is basically impossible to fix.

418
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,380
I'm a urologist.

419
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,690
His case still has hope.

420
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,990
Okay, fine.

421
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:58,560
Instead, show me within a month.

422
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,110
The man in your life who is better than me.

423
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,850
Show me what he really is like within a month.

424
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:12,150
Then, I will admit that I was arrogant and I will apologize neatly.

425
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,840
Happy?

426
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,950
   

427
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:32,850
♫  The bird with bent wings  ♫

428
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:38,840
♫  In the dark room, It stays alone  ♫

429
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:46,330
♫  Tears fall down endlessly   ♫

430
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:53,180
♫  Leaning on the wall today it also closes its eyes  ♫

431
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,370
♫  I am dreaming  ♫

432
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:06,220
♫  A dream about flying  ♫

433
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,160
♫  Far, far...  ♫

434
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,890
 The bottom rank needs to be disposed of as soon as possible. 

435
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,190
 If God has a conscience, he'd send me to heaven.  

436
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,000
It will be a nuisance if you fall from there.

437
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,350
Do you want to look pitiful even in the end?

438
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,110
What are you doing here?

439
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,810
I found the most pathetic house in this neighborhood.

440
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:58,190
I had hoped that this wasn't your house, and then I saw you going up to the roof.

441
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,250
Yes.

442
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,770
I'm a pathetic person.

443
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,440
Even if I hold on every day, I don't deserve to live.

444
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,570
There's no hope either.

445
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,540
And you have erectile dysfunction on top of that.

446
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,080
If you want to die because of that, stop it and come down.

447
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,500
I can't change your pathetic life instantly, but

448
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,620
I can at least treat that.

449
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,720
Really.

450
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,260
Let me treat your erectile dysfunction, Do Yong Shik.

451
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:47,430
I— How much more pathetic can I get?

452
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,650
Can't you just leave and pretend you didn't see me?

453
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,130
Why exactly...?

454
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,220
Why are you doing this to me?

455
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,120
Because you were my first love!

456
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,710
   

457
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,230
