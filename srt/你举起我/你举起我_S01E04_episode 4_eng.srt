1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,800
   

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,770
♫  Just tell me you can get up, so, so  ♫

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,590
   

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,020
   

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,740
    
 ♫  Just tell me you can do anything  ♫

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,120
♫  Right now  ♫

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,600
   

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,310
Welcome.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,120
We've booked a couple's massage.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,740
- It's under Lee Ru Da. 
 - Yes.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,180
You made a reservation to meet Hee Jin and Yu Ri.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,330
Please, wait a minute.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,950
 The customer has arrived. 

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,740
They'll be here soon.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,230
Hello.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:07,020


17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,410
My shoulder muscles are tight, aren't they?

18
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,770
Yes, they are.

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,450
Ugh, I knew they would be.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,160
It gets like this all the time after I go on a date with my boyfriend.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,890
Why?

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,400
Because my boyfriend doesn't let me sleep at night.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,980
Others have eel or octopus

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,350
or even those herbal drinks.

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,050
I'm afraid my boyfriend will get a taste of those things.

26
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,660
It's already too much for me to handle.

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,650
His stamina is very good.

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,000
Unni, you're bragging, right?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,430
Is that so?

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,060
Well, it is something to brag about if

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,600
a man isn't tired of dating one woman.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,250
That's right. My friend says she feels unsatisfied with sleeping with her boyfriend.

33
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,400
She's wondering if she should break up with him.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,190
Ah, I don't understand the girls who blame the guys for sleeping.

35
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,830
How is that just the boyfriend's fault?

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,010
If she is very attractive then the boyfriend can't stop himself, even if he wants to.

37
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,070
Isn't that so? Right?

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,600
Oppa, you haven't slept, have you?

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,210
How is it? It's refreshing, right?

40
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,380
It's nice, right?

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,990
It's nice.

42
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,770
Do Yong Shik's style is that?

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,370
I feel so refreshed.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,270
Good.

45
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,670
I did so well.

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,030
It's been a while.

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,330
Have you been well?

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,000
I didn't know you worked here.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,920
You looked good.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,630
It seems like you're doing well with your girlfriend too.

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,050
Anyway, congratulations on your new relationship.

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,310
Hee Jin.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,220
Thank you for everything.

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,420
What?

55
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,080
A guy like me...

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,200
For liking me for a long time.

57
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,230
For such a long time,

58
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,400
you stayed by my side so I feel so thankful.

59
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,260
Not being able to tell you this after we broke up,

60
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,750
weighed on my mind.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,080
I told you I was sorry so many times,

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,840
but no thank you.

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,740
Truthfully, there were more times where I felt thankful towards you.

64
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,060
If you weren't by my side then...

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,190
I would've broken down even earlier.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,700
I only endured it since you were there.

67
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,330
Thank you very much.

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,920
What are you doing?

69
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,450
Why did you say that?

70
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,410
Your erectile dysfunction started with that woman.

71
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,360
The words she said caused you trauma.

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,160
Even if it's a treatment for trauma, I don't think this is the right way.

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,970
You've hurt Hee Jin.

74
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,500
Is her pain more important to you right now?

75
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,280
You don't remember the horrible things she said to you?

76
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,090
You don't even want to get revenge?

77
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,280
I don't want to.

78
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,820
You guys broke up a while ago. Do you still have feelings for her?

79
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,230
She was once a person I loved.

80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,830
Even though we broke up, she's a person I once truly loved.

81
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,730
Hurting someone I loved in order to erase my scars?

82
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,430
What kind of person could do that?

83
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,850
I feel thankful that you're thinking of me,

84
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,380
but I think you crossed the line.

85
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,300
If this is the method for treatment

86
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,080
then I don't need it.

87
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,000
   

88
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,030
 Hurting someone I loved in order to erase my scars? 

89
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,780
  What kind of person could do that? 

90
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,740
  Do I still look like I'm childishly playing a game with you? 

91
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,590
 Yeah, you look like that even though you're not fit to be in that position. 

92
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,420
Why aren't you getting out? You're leaving work.

93
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,660
I... I forgot something.

94
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,900
What about you?

95
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,290
I need to study something.

96
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,930
I guess the treatment for that friend isn't going too well?

97
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,620
That's what I'm saying. You're now feeling it, right? You've done something unnecessary.

98
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,460
That's not pride. It's just you acting rashly.

99
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,220
Ji Hyuk.

100
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,460
Yeah?

101
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,830
During the one and half year we dated,

102
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,550
did we love each other?

103
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
Someone said,

104
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,660
that they couldn't hurt someone they loved in order to get rid of their own scars.

105
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,330
But I feel like we always did that.

106
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,940
If I thought I took a blow, I would deliver a blow to my opponent to restore my pride.

107
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,640
I hurt you a lot by doing that.

108
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,000
But, was that love?

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,150
I'm questioning if it was.

110
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,950
   

111
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,670
   

112
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,570
 Are you okay? Don't move your hand. 

113
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,570
 Show me your hand. 

114
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,890
 Does it hurt? 

115
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,690
  I think it's a fracture. 

116
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,090
 Forget it and please call 119. 

117
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,530
  I already called them. While waiting we should at least do some emergency treatment. 

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,640
 Wait a minute. 

119
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,180
 Hold it like this. 

120
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,320
  Are you a medical student? 

121
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,180
 Yes, a freshman. 

122
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,060
 Oh, you must've learned this. 

123
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,450
 I'm a medical student so you can rest assured. I'm doing this after learning how to do so. 

124
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,880
 Okay. 

125
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,170
 It's done. 

126
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,350
 Until the ambulance arrives, raise your arm higher than where your heart is. 

127
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,400
 I don't think we have to go that far. 

128
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,990
  You don't even know, so just listen to the future doctor. 

129
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,590
 I will help you. 

130
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,020
 Like this? 

131
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,550
 - What? Have you fallen for me? 
 - No way. 

132
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,180
 Okay then. 

133
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,020
 Is that better? 

134
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,760
   

135
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,150
 Hey, it's been three hours. Aren't you tired? 

136
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,320
 Just leave me be. This is the best thing to do when I'm stressed. 

137
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,240
 Why are you so sad for breaking up with a guy like that? 

138
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,030
 I'm angry that I got dumped. 

139
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,040
 Still, relieving stress by overexerting your body is foolish. 

140
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,720
 Why don't you spend time doing something more productive? 

141
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,890
 If it's like this 

142
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,980
 Would you like to date me? 

143
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,770
 I feel thankful that you're thinking of me, but I think you crossed the line. 

144
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,290
Still...

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,750
Do Yong Shik is still the same.

146
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,760
   

147
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,790
 Wow! 

148
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,550
 Aigoo, you guys are all Chunsam's kiddos. 

149
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,600
 There are too many! 

150
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,580
 What did you feed him to get him so productive? 

151
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,690
 Chunsam, you're really amazing. 

152
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,790
 Don't look. 

153
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,150
 Don't look at it. 

154
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,890
 Don't look. 

155
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,960
 Don't look. 

156
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,320
 Don't look. 

157
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,820
 Don't look. 

158
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,980
 Hey! 

159
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm even getting looked down on by a dog.

160
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,940
It was all a dream.

161
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,850
You are paying with a credit card when it's not even 2,000₩.

162
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,330
No.

163
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,070
Sorry.

164
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,490
Let's pay the bill together.

165
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,460
It may be more burdensome for you to take credit cards, but you do know it's illegal to refuse them, don't you?

166
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,030
Thank you.

167
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,990
Today the weather is really nice, right?

168
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,920
It said the fine dust level today is bad.

169
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,690
Very bad.

170
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,310
Why are you in our neighborhood this morning?

171
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,090
Do you have to be so straightforward?

172
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,610
Sorry.

173
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,000
Yesterday, I didn't think things through.

174
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,810
I was so focused on treating you that I hurt both you and Hee Jin.

175
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,450
Sorry for crossing the line.

176
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,370
I was sensitive too.

177
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:07,080
Then will you continue to get treated by me?

178
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,950
Even if I treat your trauma, it won't be in such a disrespectful way as last time.

179
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,770
I will study and do more research on it.

180
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,270
- Lee Ru Da. 
 - Yeah?

181
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,120
Thank you for putting so much effort.

182
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,990
Even though we have a history as classmates, you could've just ignored me.

183
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:48,210
Helping like this... not everybody will act like this, right?

184
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,320
I will try hard too so that your effort isn't wasted.

185
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,550
You came to work late today too.

186
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,320
I told you that I would come in whenever if I didn't have any appointments.

187
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,780
What if Lee Ru Da actually wins?

188
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,610
What?

189
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,880
You've been so hooked on treating your erectile dysfunction patient.

190
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
But that's because you made a bet with Ji Hyuk?

191
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,380
So, are there any improvements with that friend?

192
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,390
It's none of your business.

193
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,150
Why?

194
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,200
Are things looking worse than you expected?

195
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,650
I told you.

196
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,120
There's only one sure way to treat erectile dysfunction.

197
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,230
A new woman.

198
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,430
Really, Sunbae.

199
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,060
Wait a minute.

200
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,390
He met a new woman.

201
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,650
Who?

202
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,400
- You. 
 - What?

203
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,050
Yes, you.

204
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,920
You said you were the patient's first love.

205
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,500
Although he's been going around with you,

206
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,960
he hasn't changed much?

207
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,420
- Sunbae. 
 - That's weird.

208
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,930
Guys usually have that fantasy of their first loves

209
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,970
that lasts forever.

210
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,190
How ridiculous.

211
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,930
But now that I think about it...

212
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,640
Why hasn't Do Yong Shik changed even one bit since he met me?

213
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,880
The more I think about it, the more it hurts my pride.

214
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,930
Aish.

215
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,350
Do I have to use that method?

216
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,620
A $200 course meal?

217
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,330
Some people are cutting $200 worth steak

218
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,840
and here I am eating 70 cent ramen.

219
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,750
   

220
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,560
Ru Da.

221
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
Your lamp went out?

222
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,360
You're here.

223
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,150
Come in.

224
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,870
I was going to just leave,

225
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,930
but my younger sister won't be back until tomorrow

226
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,900
and I'm scared to be alone so I can't just do that.

227
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,130
Right here.

228
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,800
Wait.

229
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,450
Here.

230
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,780
You can stand here.

231
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,420
Okay.

232
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,430
When the light is off, suddenly It feels so hot.

233
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,990
 Want me to hold you? 

234
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,460
 N-No w-wait. 

235
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,200
 Why? 

236
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,970
 Something came up, I think I need to go. 

237
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,710
 Sorry. 

238
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,100
 Yes! 

239
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,650
It's hot in here.

240
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,380
Want me to hold you?

241
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,770
No need it's all done.

242
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,850
It's done.

243
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,610
Okay?

244
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,120
Why did you fix it so quickly?

245
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,910
In the military, I handled all the maintenance.

246
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,380
Maintenance?

247
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,020
Do you need to fix anything else?

248
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,430
No.

249
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,620
What a shame.

250
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,950
Good job.

251
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,460
Okay.

252
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,260
You can go.

253
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,680
Are you okay?

254
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,030
You said you were in charge of maintenance?

255
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,880
What was this?

256
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,510
I'm sorry.

257
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,860
I'm okay, you can let go of me.

258
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,530
Ru Da.

259
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,070
I said I'm okay. You can let go of me.

260
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,430
You make me embarrassed.

261
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,330
What is this?

262
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,390
I couldn't let go and talk to you.

263
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,540
Stay still I'll take it out.

264
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,160
I can't see. Wait just wait a minute.

265
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm sorry, please wait.

266
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
Let's go to my room and take it out.

267
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,810
W-Wait.

268
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,510
Room? Stand up.

269
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,530
One, two.

270
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,670
One, two.

271
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,630
One, two.

272
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,060
Why? Why?

273
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,750
Why? Why? I'm sorry.

274
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,960
Okay.

275
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,160
Okay. Okay.

276
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,810
Sorry.

277
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,980
You stupid.

278
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,320
- Wait. 
 - Here. It's right here.

279
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,820
I know but—

280
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,860
Right foot, left foot.

281
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,740
I was so scared.

282
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,260
I almost cut my hair.

283
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,980
You know, right? I'm not suitable for short hair.

284
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,160
I said it suits you.

285
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,420
Like Matilda.

286
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,090
Matilda?

287
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,850
 You're really going abroad to the US? 

288
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,320
 Yes. 

289
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,290
 When will you come back? 

290
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,460
 Don't know. 

291
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,760
♫  I've walked around  ♫

292
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,010
 I see. 

293
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,200
♫  I arrived at where we used to go before.  ♫

294
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,190
 Why is your hair like that? 

295
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,870
 My father got mad at me so he cut it. 

296
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,290
 What? 

297
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,370
 He found out I watched The Chaser on the day we got into an accident. 

298
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,380
♫  It hurts  ♫

299
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,190
 I look like Choi Young Rak, right? 

300
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,280
 No you don't. 

301
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,960
 You look like Matilda for me. 

302
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,610
 Like the heroine in the movie "Matilda." 

303
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,480
 Really? 

304
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,190
♫  In your heart  ♫

305
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,160
♫  I really want to save you  ♫

00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,390
♫  Wanna be with you  ♫

307
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,550
 Even being abroad I will contact you. 

308
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,730
 Don't change your mail address. 

309
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,350
 Of course. 

310
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,430
 You must contact me. 

311
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,180
 Ru Da. 

312
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,210
 Lee Ru Da. 

313
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,350
♫  My cold hand  ♫

314
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,320
♫  In your warm hand  ♫

♫  Hold me in your heart  ♫

323
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,480
I wanted to contact you...

324
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,860
but I lost the note that had your email address.

325
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,300
After that, I was busy with many things.

326
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,790
That's life, I guess.

327
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,590
But sometimes I was curious

328
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:58,080
how you changed and what person you had become.

329
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,140
You must really be disappointed with me.

330
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,050
I was a little disappointed...

331
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,180
but you are still cool.

332
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,660
What?

333
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:21,190
When I saw you yesterday, I thought you still seemed like the same person you were back then.

334
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:30,660
Even though that person was someone you loved, protecting that person even if they hurt you and left you

335
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,290
is not an easy thing.

336
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,960
Humans, after all, put their hurt first.

337
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,720
♫  The bird with bent wings  ♫

338
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,670
Well.

339
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,980
♫  In the dark room  ♫

340
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,600
You were so cool.

341
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,320
And once again, I'm sorry.

342
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,080
♫  Tears fall down endlessly   ♫

343
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,760
♫  Leaning on the wall today it also closes its eyes  ♫

344
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,840
It's the perfect weather to have a cup of coffee.

345
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,010
Isn't it?

346
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:16,860
♫  A dream about flying  ♫

347
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,360
♫  Far, far, to far away  ♫

348
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,950
It is nice.

349
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,520
♫  Dream of flying high to reach the sky  ♫

350
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,460
♫  You quietly came to me  ♫

351
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,520
♫  Without a word, you stay next to me  ♫

352
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,260
 You are so cool. 

353
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,040
♫  Has passed again  ♫

354
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,370
♫  I close my eyes   ♫

355
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,740
She just happened to say that stuff.

356
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,990
♫   I am dreaming   ♫

357
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,550
♫   Just you and me   ♫

358
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,560
♫   Far, far, to far away   ♫

359
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,790
 Are you okay? 

360
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,920
♫  A dream with you and me  ♫

361
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,280
 It hurts. 

362
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,090
♫  Far, far...  ♫

363
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,770
Let's sleep.

364
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:46,360
♫   A dream that reaches space   ♫

365
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,260
The car key is on the kitchen table, take it.

366
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,390
Today's the 10th day.

367
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,080
Hey, Lee Ru Ri.

368
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,630
Do I look pretty?

369
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,340
Are you crazy?

370
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,400
Why is she like that?

371
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,790
It's like she's got a new man.

372
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,380
Hello.

373
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,170
- You came by. 
 - Yes.

374
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,970
Want me to give you the usual?

375
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,220
No, today... make them more beautiful.

376
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,140
Is it a special day?

377
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,990
Nothing like that.

378
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,930
Just to look good in front of my girlfriend.

379
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,990
Yes, please wait for some time.

380
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,830
Are you okay, Ru Da?

381
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,260
Let's get up.

382
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,760
Ji Hyuk, are you okay?

383
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,510
Yes, I'm okay.

384
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,140
The fracture isn't too deep so he just needs to have a cast on for three weeks.

385
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,050
Then.

386
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,190
Thank you.

387
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,180
It could have been really bad. Do you know how surprised I was?

388
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,960
Do you still think that I don't like you after this?

389
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,840
What?

390
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,280
Ru Da.

391
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,160
When you chose urology, the seniors all tried to stop you.

392
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,970
With such good academic grades, they were wondering why you chose such a bad major.

393
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,540
Suddenly why?

394
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,970
At that time you said this:

395
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,220
"Must I stay off a path just because everyone tells me to avoid it?

396
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,900
Why can't I pave the way by going there first?"

397
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,430
You were so brave back then.

398
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,540
And I thought it was so cool because it was something I lacked.

399
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,000
I might have even

400
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,350
had some kind of inferiority complex

401
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,420
towards you.

402
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,110
What do you mean with this so out of the blue?

403
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,150
That's why I thought you were cool,

404
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,520
and I also pushed you down

405
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,630
in order to raise my own pride.

406
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,900
Ji Hyuk.

407
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,590
You were asking if there was love while we were dating.

408
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:39,000
I really regret the way we spent our time together, too.

409
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,980
So... Let's start over again.

410
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,920
♫  I miss you everyday  ♫

411
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,170
How do you want me to cut it?

412
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,780
J-Just to look neat and likable.

413
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,250
Are you going on a blind date?

414
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,560
No.

415
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,280
Then you are meeting someone you like?

416
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,410
♫  I want to get closer to you slowly  ♫

417
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,580
♫  So that I don't make you uncomfortable   ♫

418
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,100
♫  Now I even talk the way you do  ♫

419
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,890
♫  I make it obvious like a fool  ♫

420
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,120
Let's go drink some coffee.

421
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,240
I already have plans.

422
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,430
Who? With Do Yong Shik?

423
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,550
Yes.

424
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,460
Wait a minute.

425
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,160
That person's treatment... let's hand it over to Jang Sunbae.

426
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,190
Let's not talk about your pride or whatsoever.

427
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,580
Even though you can't treat that person, I will not look down on you.

428
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,630
Perhaps are you worried because he's your first love?

429
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,660
No. There's no way.

430
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,490
Maybe it was like that in the past, but what can I do with a guy like that?

431
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,830
So...

432
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,050
let's wrap this bet and focus only on us.

433
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,100
That's what it was.

434
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,940
A bet between the two of you.

435
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,020
Yong Shik, that's not it.

436
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,910
 You can do it, Yong Shik. 

437
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,290
 I will help you. 

438
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,450
   

439
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,570
What should I do?

440
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,880
 Perhaps you're worried because he's your first love? 

441
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,900
 No, it's not like that. 

442
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,390
 Maybe in the past, 

443
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,400
 but what can I do with a guy like that? 

444
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,720
Do Yong Shik.

445
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,520
You didn't even know it was like that.

446
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,260
 Lee Ru Da. 

447
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,800
 Yeah? 

448
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,360
 Thanks. 

449
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,590
 For caring this much. 

450
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,810
 You were cool. 

451
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,290
♫  Holding on to the time  ♫

452

 How do you want me to cut it? 

453

455
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,950

You said that, with your help,
