1
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,763
Tell Joo-won

2
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,966
that I'm not going to lose you to him.

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,202
Tell him that it doesn't matter
if he doesn't settle.

4
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,665
What's the point of all this--

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,667
Sorry, did I startle you?

6
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,238
I'm really sorry.

7
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,641
Do you think she was upset?

8
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,709
I hope she was.

9
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,879
I hope she cries so much

10
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,982
that she can't open her eyes, wash,
or even sleep.

11
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,251
I hope she turns out ugly.

12
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,088
So you're saying that you used me?

13
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,723
I might do this a few more times.

14
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,193
So please help me out.

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,094
Why should I...

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,431
-help?
-She left me behind,

17
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,568
and returned one day to start a fight
and agitate me.

18
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,370
I just want to

19
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,840
prolong the fight for as long as I can.

20
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,210
To prevent her from leaving.

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,512
He's being serious.

22
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,318
Hey! What are you doing there?

23
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,987
Aren't you going to get me out?
You're really going to get it.

24
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,891
Ra-im, if you help me out,
then I'll help you too.

25
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,127
I know exactly what's on his mind.

26
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,630
What is on his mind?

27
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,500
Didn't he tell you about
The Little Mermaid?

28
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,542
That guy is a total freak who believes

29
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,579
the tragic fairy tale is humanity's
first story about having mistresses.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,451
If he dumps you,
I'll help you get back at him.

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,293
Fine. Please help me.

32
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,867
Actually,

33
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,303
he didn't steal the car.

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,540
Why is he acting like that?

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,834
Move.

36
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,745
Nice shot!

37
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,547
You're so good.

38
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,140
Nice shot.

39
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,120
You scared me.

40
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,621
Why don't you pick up my calls?

41
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,057
Didn't you hear I'm leaving
as soon as I finish shooting this movie?

42
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,292
Yes, I heard.

43
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,760
Have a safe trip.

44
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,729
-I asked you to come with me!
-And I told you I have no reason to.

45
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,302
Is it because of U-yeong?

46
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,570
Do you like him that much?

47
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,039
Yes.

48
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,409
I really like him.

49
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,944
And he really likes me too.

50
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,646
Is that what he said?

51
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,581
That he likes you? Do you believe him?

52
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,550
Yes, I believe him.

53
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,454
U-yeong is different from guys like you,
who only know how to bluff.

54
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,089
He's always truthful.

55
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,992
Truthful? Are you stupid?

56
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,262
Men don't differentiate
between bluffs and truth.

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,963
You think U-yeong is any different?

58
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,066
Want me to show you
whether he's any different?

59
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,500
What do you mean?

60
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,423
You guys should know better.

61
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,128
The car's over there.

62
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,498
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

63
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,107
Get over here.

64
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,742
You're dead.

65
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,044
What's wrong?

66
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,847
-Help me.
-Why should I?

67
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,882
Didn't you decide to help each other?

68
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,286
-Hey!
-Where are you going?

69
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,756
You're getting better
at getting me into trouble,

70
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,624
but I'm getting better at retaliating too.

71
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,659
You are so dead today.

72
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,496
I really didn't mean to do that...

73
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,433
You didn't mean to? Then what's with
this police station meet-up?

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,770
How dare you let them
handcuff a famous star like me?

75
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,205
Do you want to get doxed by my fans?

76
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,208
If you keep this up,
I have no choice but to--

77
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,677
What? What can you do?

78
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,150
Hey, stop it!

79
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,585
Stop it! Stop!

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,643
Where are you going? Let's go together--

81
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,012
Don't come near me. Go away!

82
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,714
Ra-im, come grab him.

83
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,685
How can you just leave like that?
This was just an accident.

84
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,954
Accident? Was it really an accident?

85
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,226
What are you going to do about my lips?

86
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,462
Scrub them thoroughly! Now!

87
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,131
Tell me the truth.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

88
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,935
Unless you want to be buried
in clothing that an artisan with

89
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,571
40 years of experience
made stitch-by-stitch,

90
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,272
just drive.

91
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,711
Stop right there! My lips!

92
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,248
You devalued my lips!
And ruined their history.

93
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,484
What are you going to do
about my dirtied lips?

94
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,777
Sir, do you know
the golf course by the beach?

95
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,147
I need to get there,
but can I pay when I arrive?

96
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,850
Hold on!

97
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,453
Don't you know me?

98
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,422
You should.

99
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,460
You know me, right?

100
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,328
You know who I am, right?

101
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,464
Who are you?

102
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,733
Are you serious?

103
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,401
Look closely.

104
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,038
You'll remember.

105
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,007
Now you remember me.

106
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,143
I'm staring

107
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,846
At the place you left me

108
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,048
I'm staring

109
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,617
But I know you're not coming

110
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,886
There are so many crazy people
in this world.

111
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,655
If you're going to impersonate him,
do it right.

112
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,127
Mister!

113
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,031
Hey! How can you just leave?

114
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,900
Hey!

115
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,078
I'm heading to the beach golf course,
so look carefully.

116
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,647
I'm staring

117
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,440
Don't take it out on my innocent car!

118
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,609
Just say it to me.

119
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,578
Go ahead first. I'm going to get U-yeong.

120
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,647
I promised Mr. Choi, too.

121
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,549
You're a really weird woman.

122
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,451
Why keep that promise?

123
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,686
Do you like U-yeong? As a man?

124
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,088
Well, I don't like him as a girl.

125
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,656
Don't avoid the question.

126
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,124
What if I like him?

127
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,659
Are you jealous?

128
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,827
Jealous?

129
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,495
My goodness.

130
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,964
You think I'm that immature?

131
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,301
Honestly, you want me
to be jealous, right?

132
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,436
What's wrong with women?

133
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,773
Of course, women would love it
if a man like me was jealous over them.

134
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,775
It'd feel like owning the whole world.

135
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,310
Unbelievable.

136
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,313
I should make you come to your senses.

137
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,783
Fine. Let's do this.

138
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,186
I'll be jealous, so forget about U-yeong.

139
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,789
He's not your family or your ex.

140
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,125
Why would you worry about him?

141
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,794
Because I'm his fan.

142
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,295
That's it?

143
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,497
"That's it?"

144
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,167
When I'd head home after a shoot
with bandages and pain relief patches...

145
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,904
When I'd have to apologize for being told
that I was worthless because

146
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,674
I was a stuntwoman,
didn't have college education or parents.

147
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,678
When I heard that a colleague
who was so happy the day before

148
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,881
will never be able to walk again...

149
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,550
And

150
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,586
when my father passed away...

151
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,257
When these painful things happened to me,

152
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,826
Oska's songs were like
a pain reliever for me.

153
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,829
This is the first time

154
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,498
I feel grateful
that our bodies are switched.

155
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,303
Because I can be of help to Oska.

156
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,338
Although you feel like that,
it's still not right.

157
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,276
I'll make you regret being grateful
that our bodies switched.

158
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,278
-Just you wait.
-What are you going to do?

159
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,962
Thank you, sir.
Keep up the great work! Drive safe!

160
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,402
How did you come in a police car?

161
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,970
You thought I would walk here?

162
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,706
How could you leave me in that situation?
And you call yourself family?

163
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,675
It's not Joo-won's fault.

164
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
I'm the one who said
we should just leave you.

165
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,145
That's right.

166
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,881
She strongly stated
that we should leave you.

167
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,282
Ra-im?

168
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,985
-Why?
-Why do you think?

169
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,021
I really don't like you, U-yeong.

170
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,324
Hey!

171
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,261
Does he think he's some idol star?

172
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,296
You're too old for that.

173
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,399
Then you should be more mature
instead of stealing your cousin's car.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,435
And that hair!

175
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,771
Even my mom
doesn't perm her hair like that.

176
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,274
Looks fine to me.

177
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,144
I heard you took some strange pictures
with Chae-rin.

178
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,678
Disgusting.

179
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,814
You jerk!

180
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,249
You told her all that?

181
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,586
Ra-im, about those pictures...

182
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,655
You'd know if you've seen them, but...

183
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,758
-Didn't I come out really well?
-The angles were amazing.

184
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,828
Great timing. Here comes Yoon Seul.

185
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,664
I should show her too.

186
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,132
Ra-im, please.

187
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,404
I thought you'd go straight to Seoul,
but you're all here.

188
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,773
This womanizer right here left his bags.

189
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,383
It's difficult for us to meet like this.
Why don't you all stay here tonight?

190
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,918
I'll invite you all.

191
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,754
The golf course here belongs to my family.

192
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,688
Here?

193
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,758
You didn't know?
Is that why you were so cold to me?

194
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,828
These people always claim
everything is theirs.

195
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,064
I'm sorry, but we're a bit busy.

196
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,333
Then you should go first.

197
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,936
I'm not busy at all,
so I'll just stay here.

198
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,937
What?

199
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,140
Are you saying you'll stay with just Seul?

200
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,309
This is nice.

201
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,744
Then I hope you two have a safe trip.

202
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,754
The sunset is very beautiful here.

203
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,859
It's like a deserted island.

204
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,564
Let's go for a walk
while dinner is being prepared.

205
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:36,642
Don't women prefer men who hold hands
instead of linking arms?

206
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,451
Like this.

207
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,320
So we can feel each other's warmth.

208
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,890
That crazy...

209
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,658
Why you...

210
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,793
Let's go.

211
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,863
This place is so nice.

212
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,765
I should come more often.

213
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,133
Let's talk.

214
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,037
What a waste.

215
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,506
I should have been more cheesy.

216
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:09,942
Are you crazy?

217
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,710
You started it.

218
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,413
It was cute compared to your havoc.

219
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,951
I'll make you regret the fact
that our bodies are switched, too.

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,654
Hey!

221
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,858
Why did you come here?

222
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,460
I should be the one asking you.

223
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,896
I just guessed you would be here,
but why are you really here?

224
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
As if you still couldn't get over me.

225
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,567
You seem to like this place.

226
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,504
-Is it because of our memories?
-Don't get the wrong idea.

227
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,872
I don't have such memories.

228
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,840
I don't care about what you do
with Joo-won.

229
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,443
But why do you have to do it
in front of me?

230
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,147
You'll see that a lot from now.
Are you going to lecture me every time?

231
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,348
Joo-won is my cousin.

232
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,784
You can't give up on Ra-im.
You have no right to say this.

233
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,118
He's like my younger brother.

234
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,354
Ra-im is probably his girl.

235
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,690
Then leave out my story.

236
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,692
Then what are you planning to do with him?

237
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,962
It's okay. I have plenty of experience
with a man who had lots of girls.

238
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,835
Joo-won is not interested in you.

239
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,236
How backward.

240
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,906
I'm not interested in Joo-won either.

241
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,674
I'm interested in his background.

242
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,409
Why are you doing this?

243
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,446
Did I break up with you? No!
It's you who broke up with me.

244
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,116
Are you sure I broke up with you?

245
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,201
Are you sure you can hang out
like this before your premier?

246
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:47,339
Why? I can't even hang out since
I took the movie you rejected?

247
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,241
Why do you say it like that?

248
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,810
Should I call her my sister-in-law now?

249
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,947
What do you mean?

250
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,116
I'm talking about Seul.

251
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,819
You could've called her sister-in-law.

252
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,789
Did you sleep with her?

253
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,357
Are you drunk?

254
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,560
You fool. Why are you so dumb?

255
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,396
You think you're the only one
who slept with her?

256
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,033
She's a real player.
All the celebrities know about her.

257
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,936
Everyone's saying she's toying
with the naive Choi U-yeong.

258
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,474
You guys aren't really going out, are you?

259
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,111
You're ruining my mood.

260
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,380
Am I crazy? Why would I go out with her?

261
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,115
Seul...

262
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,920
is just my side fling.

263
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,189
Are you satisfied?

264
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,991
Just drink up.

265
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,778
What are you talking about?

266
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,613
Are you saying I'm the one
who broke us up?

267
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,918
You rejected my proposal
and went to study abroad with Jun-hyeok.

268
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,220
-I did.
-So?

269
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,755
Now that I think about it,

270
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,891
I was really pretty and naive back then.

271
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,626
What am I Iike in your memories?

272
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,463
-Are you messing with me?
-I'm just curious all of a sudden.

273
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,498
What was I...

274
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,534
to you back then?

275
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,304
You really don't know?

276
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,839
What was I?

277
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,308
Don't you remember what I said
when I proposed to you?

278
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,476
Well,

279
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,644
it didn't sound like the truth.

280
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,280
I trust what people say behind my back

281
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,649
more than what they say to my face.

282
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,520
I should go now.
Joo-won is probably waiting for me.

283
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,388
And about the music video--

284
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,857
Don't bring that up.

285
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,959
I'm calling quits on this album.

286
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,096
Wow, we were thinking the same thing.
I was going to tell you to do that too.

287
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,632
The real reason I directed
your music video is because

288
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,002
I wanted to use it as an excuse
to see more of Joo-won.

289
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,505
But after seeing Joo-won today,

290
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,007
I think it'd be faster to marry him

291
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,843
instead of trying to get you
to do the music video again.

292
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,736
What are you doing out here?

293
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,205
I was just looking around.

294
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,375
I've been to all the golf courses
in this country,

295
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,410
but this place is the best.

296
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,613
It must feel like you're playing golf
on the ocean.

297
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,584
Did you work as a caddy before?

298
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,920
If you don't believe me, whatever.

299
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,790
-But why are you coming alone?
-Why do you care, Ra-im?

300
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,860
You've been bothering me
since Jeju Island.

301
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,596
Is it Choi U-yeong or Kim Joo-won?

302
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,331
Can you make it clear?

303
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,700
I swear to the heavens.

304
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,202
I'm Kim Joo-won.

305
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,006
Then can you get lost
and stop bugging U-yeong?

306
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,709
How can a lady say such a thing?

307
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,479
Why can't you say, "Can you please keep
your distance from U-yeong?"

308
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,382
You're not much different from Gil Ra-im.

309
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,017
What?

310
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,420
Your reaction is terrible.
I'm sure you heard me.

311
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,122
I'm hungry, so let's go eat.

312
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,991
You invited us but served us nothing.

313
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,899
Darn it! Don't they have a towel inside?

314
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,337
That shirt was made stitch-by-stitch
by a master tailor from New Zealand--

315
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,572
When did you get here?

316
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,477
Your cheeks are red. Are you cold?

317
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,685
Isn't it warm now?

318
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,055
What do you think you're doing?

319
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,523
Get your hands off.

320
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,130
I don't want to be warm...

321
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,532
all by myself.

322
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,304
You two! Get your hands off!

323
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,501
I think a man is attractive
when he knows how to cook.

324
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,238
Not you, U-yeong.
I'm talking about Joo-won.

325
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,575
Really?

326
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,812
A woman looks prettiest
when she enjoys my cooking.

327
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,280
Really?

328
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:59,484
Then you'll see the prettiest woman
in the world today.

329
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,119
It can't be just for today.

330
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,056
You should come over to my house sometime.
I'll cook for you.

331
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,492
You should come when it's dark outside.

332
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,161
So you can sleep over.

333
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,332
Then that leaves me no choice.

334
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,703
My eyesight is terrible at night.
So I easily get lost on my way home.

335
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,383
I can't do this anymore.

336
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,617
Follow me.

337
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,121
Where? What's wrong?

338
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,924
Let's go scrub so we can be born again.

339
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,659
Especially, this part.

340
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,160
Come with me!

341
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,295
Where are you going?

342
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,197
I think they are going to the sauna.

343
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,733
The sauna?

344
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,068
Our resort is famous for its sauna.

345
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,004
Some people come just for the sauna.

346
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,975
Do you want to go with me?

347
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,343
Do you think I'm crazy...

348
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,384
Sure, if you want.

349
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:28,840
Do you want to die?

350
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,909
Why?

351
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,044
You're doing that on purpose
to make me mad!

352
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,813
What did I do?

353
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,290
Don't come in here!

354
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,758
Go over there!

355
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,228
Sorry.

356
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,803
Are you serious?

357
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,039
Fine. I'll go out then.

358
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,111
What on earth? What is it?

359
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,683
I've been working out.

360
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,770
Aren't my legs too long?

361
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,742
Some people say that I look like a doll.

362
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,412
I guess they feel that way.

363
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,915
My body is so unrealistic.

364
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,051
It upsets me at times.

365
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,452
I know how you feel.

366
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,056
Perfect complexion and proportions,

367
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,591
the overall sex appeal.

368
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,428
I'm sick and tired of people saying that.

369
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,934
But Yoon Seul,

370
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,438
this is all fat, right?

371
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,940
But a real woman

372
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,843
has muscle. All muscle.

373
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,480
I look good.

374
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,450
But these are a little short.

375
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,575
What kind of woman drinks like that?

376
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,910
Don't you have a glass?
Why are you drinking it like that?

377
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,546
Whether you drink from a glass
or straight from the bottle,

378
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,248
You get drunk the same.

379
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,136
Did you enjoy the sauna?

380
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,341
The 36-24-34.

381
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,744
How did it feel washing
next to your ideal type?

382
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,779
My ideal type changed long ago

383
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,715
to a woman who can never be Miss Korea.

384
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,488
It's not that I can't.
I just didn't go for it.

385
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,590
Right, because you're dark and ugly.

386
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,327
You have an uneven butt.

387
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,765
So you checked me out.

388
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,800
You are so perverted.

389
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,002
You didn't know?

390
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,405
Again with that!

391
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,910
Just go to sleep.

392
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,946
Why did you follow me here to nag?

393
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,648
I was about to go to sleep.

394
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,952
I usually don't care about these things,

395
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,455
but I was curious why you don't
have what everyone else has.

396
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,491
I couldn't sleep from curiosity.

397
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,092
There are so many things
that I don't have.

398
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,929
Which one? Money? A house?

399
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,265
Family.

400
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,842
My mom

401
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:02,013
passed away soon after I was born.

402
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,718
My eyes and the way I smile...

403
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,587
are exactly the same as my mom.

404
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,023
That's what Dad told me.

405
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,028
My dad was a fireman.

406
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,864
But he passed away when I was 17

407
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:24,469
while trying to rescue someone.

408
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,041
He was a very brave man

409
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,512
who saved a lot of people.

410
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,022
Then who raised you?

411
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,357
I raised myself.

412
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,561
As a poor and alienated neighbor.

413
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,796
What about your monthly expenses?

414
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,299
Money from the government.

415
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,503
I see where all the tax I paid went to.

416
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,338
Do you regret it?

417
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,340
I would've paid more,

418
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,709
had I known I was raising you.

419
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,846
You don't seem too bad

420
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,548
when you're like this.

421
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,151
I told you, I'm not.

422
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,583
What are you doing?

423
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,984
What is it?

424
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,922
What's wrong?

425
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,592
Did you have a nightmare?

426
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,407
Darn it.

427
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,509
Oh my god!

428
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,317
This is crazy. I'm crazy.

429
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,285
What time is it?

430
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,023
What's wrong?

431
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,925
Sorry. I'm Sorry.

432
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,480
You bastard!

433
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,816
Why are you coming out from that room?

434
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,820
What's all this noise?

435
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,661
I didn't know about this either.
I just found out.

436
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,428
That's okay.

437
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,701
The number you have dialed...

438
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,936
It's an emergency
and you still won't answer?

439
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,673
Where is he and what is he doing?

440
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,077
What do we do?
The song is already posted on YouTube.

441
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,346
It's being sold for 40 won on other sites.

442
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,017
This jerk's selling it with
the MR removed as well.

443
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,785
He must be an anti-fan.

444
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,354
Take screenshots of everything

445
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,923
and report it to the cyber police.

446
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,291
I already did.

447
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,460
The number you have dialed--

448
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,395
This jerk!

449
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,433
Mr. Choi! There's an article about
the leaking already. People left comments.

450
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,404
"Isn't this noise marketing?
Oska is going to fail."

451
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,406
"A has-been singer's last effort?"

452
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,142
These jerks are driving me crazy!

453
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,578
I'm going crazy.

454
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,857
It's me. Are you with U-yeong?

455
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,492
Yes, he's here next to me.

456
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,861
What?

457
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,663
The title song was leaked?

458
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,564
What?

459
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,735
It's me. What's going on?

460
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,371
This is crazy.

461
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,108
Call my lawyer
and find out who released it first.

462
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,310
And send messages to the jerks
who uploaded the file.

463
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,213
Tell them if they say how they got it,
we might go light on them.

464
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,984
Call the portal sites, tell them
to delete the songs on blogs and sites.

465
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,720
Tell them if they don't, we'll sue them.

466
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,091
I'm leaving right now,
so block as much as you can.

467
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,793
That song...

468
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,127
It's plagiarized.

469
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,263
What? What do you mean?

470
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,765
I'll talk to you when I get there.
And let me talk to Jong-heon.

471
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:28,900
Why?

472
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,501
I think I know who did it.

473
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,207
Find out where Han Tae-seon is,
and call me right away.

474
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,410
I need to leave.

475
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,581
You knew it was plagiarized?
And you went ahead with the music video?

476
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,384
If you want to report it, go on.

477
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,887
I should go with him too.

478
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,123
You two can take my car.

479
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,562
That jerk. Is he stealing my car again?

480
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,100
Stop that.

481
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,903
Hey! Give me my phone!

482
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,850
What are you doing? Get out.

483
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,086
You want to fight again?
Do you have the time?

484
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,890
Hurry up and drive.
My career is at stake too.

485
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,203
Give it to me!

486
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,739
-You have a new message.
-Give it.

487
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,641
You have a new message.

488
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,010
Are you crazy?

489
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,812
How can Kim Joo-won say such a thing?

490
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,748
Did you read through the scenario?
I applied for your audition.

491
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,416
You should prepare your demo clip.

492
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,951
When are you going to come?

493
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,688
You got the script
from the director, right?

494
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,590
Dark Blood. Where is it now?

495
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,628
Jumping out from a speeding car when
a truck suddenly comes out of nowhere?

496
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,931
That utterly ridiculous script?

497
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,167
There's a scene like that?

498
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,902
That'd be so fun.

499
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,403
I've always wanted to do such a scene.

500
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,571
Sometimes I really think

501
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:17,074
you do physically demanding work
because you're too dumb for anything else.

502
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,976
How will you do that scene?

503
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,912
You're the CEO of a department store.

504
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,614
Right.

505
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,519
-But you're a stuntwoman.
-What?

506
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,222
I've been waiting
a year and a half for that script.

507
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,424
It's a rare opportunity.

508
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,260
This might be my last chance.

509
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,497
So what?
You want me to go to the audition?

510
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,831
-Yes.
-You're insane.

511
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,166
Look here.

512
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,335
Just as you've spent your life
using your body

513
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,937
I've spent my life using my head.

514
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,338
How am I supposed to audition?

515
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,573
It's my body.

516
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,909
You can learn it. I can teach you.
It'll be easy once you get used to it.

517
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,678
Please make some sense!

518
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,747
You'll get another chance.
Life isn't that short.

519
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,621
Fine. I'll do whatever I want
with your company!

520
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,855
Don't regret it!

521
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,368
Don't give me that look.

522
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,137
Don't worry about me,

523
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:21,939
and don't try to console me.

524
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,808
You expect too much.

525
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,412
This is my first time

526
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,449
in the passenger seat of your car.

527
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:39,890
Back then

528
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,560
I couldn't dare get in here.

529
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,698
It's makes me so mad
now that I think about it.

530
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,601
What's so special about this,
that you never drove me around?

531
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,972
Don't lie and say it was to protect me.

532
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,111
What you really wanted to protect
was yourself, wasn't it?

533
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,755
Get out.

534
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,757
Get out of the car!

535
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,694
We're in the middle of the freeway.

536
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,298
Joo-won should be on his way.
I'll call him, so take his car.

537
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,968
I can't drive safely to Seoul
with you sitting there.

538
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,138
The lights, the lanes, the cars front
and back. I can't focus on anything.

539
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,107
And I have to rush to Seoul. Get out.

540
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,769
Are you going somewhere?

541
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,406
The deposit isn't that expensive here.
You should just stay.

542
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,943
There's nowhere with cheaper rent
than my place.

543
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,915
I'm going to leave Korea.

544
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,386
Leave where?

545
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,490
Thank you for everything.

546
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,225
Sure. Take care.

547
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,531
You started this,
and now it's beyond your control, huh?

548
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,736
And I see you're trying to run away.

549
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,871
It was you who leaked the file, right?

550
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,607
Is that why you wanted to see me?
And you came all the way here?

551
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,877
That's right.
Only someone this vicious could do it.

552
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,913
Telling me that it was plagiarized
was to trick me, right?

553
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,382
To make it more dramatic.

554
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,618
-I didn't do it.
-If you say that,

555
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,554
you think I'll let you off that easy?

556
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,924
You did it to get at me
and now you're on the run.

557
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,926
I don't usually stay long in one place.

558
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,295
If you have time for this,
go and question your staff.

559
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,831
Usually sources leak from within--

560
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,869
You're the only one
who would do this to me.

561
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,504
Come with me.

562
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,508
What if it wasn't me?
How will you bear the shame?

563
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,377
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

564
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,518
Reporter Kim, how can you say that?

565
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,989
We don't do noise marketing this way.
Oska has plenty of scandals.

566
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,424
-I'm hanging up!
-Yes.

567
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,959
We filed a report.

568
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,496
Who would promote themselves like that?

569
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,831
Oska has his pride.

570
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,566
-This is Choi Dong-gyu.
-We are the victims too.

571
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,368
-Yes.
-Yes.

572
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,305
Do you see what you did?

573
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,774
Hey, he's the one who released my music.

574
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,077
Sure. I will call you right away.

575
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,547
Who is he?

576
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,484
I lost my MP3 player in Jeju Island,
and I had all my new songs on it.

577
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,252
He's the one who found it.

578
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,089
It's the police. They found the IP address
of the original uploader.

579
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,258
Yes, I'm ready.

580
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,260
You are in trouble now.

581
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:07,364
Okay. 989 Sanho Building,
Sinsa-dong, Gangnam.

582
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,732
Thank you.

583
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,335
Wow. You live in Gangnam?

584
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,338
Are you stupid? That was my house earlier.

585
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,540
Sanho Building?

586
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,843
Isn't this Seul's office address?

587
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:19,777
What?

588
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,446
What's going on? Why would she do this?

589
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,352
I guess everyone is after you.

590
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,721
You are not cleared yet.

591
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,224
Dong-gyu, don't let him go anywhere.

592
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:43,868
He's the one that was being rude
when Oska wanted him as his protege.

593
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,037
Should I tie him up?

594
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,511
Who do you think you are
to do that to Oska?

595
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,212
Are you that confident in your music?

596
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,780
What does that have to do with you?

597
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,452
He's just about as polite as Oska.

598
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,923
What are you doing?

599
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,492
Director Lim is waiting for you.

600
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,562
He's not waiting for me.
I called and said I'll be there tomorrow.

601
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,796
Says who?

602
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,699
I need to get ready for the audition.
I don't have time to do this.

603
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:16,901
Also,

604
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,137
what about rumors? Why are you buying
women's clothes in your department store?

605
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,574
Why would I spend this much money
at someone else's department store?

606
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,745
I can't wear the stuff that you wear
even if my life depended on it. Back off.

607
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,014
So what you're saying is

608
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,750
that you're going to put this on?

609
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,418
On my body?

610
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,255
I like this style.
See-through and revealing clothing.

611
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,231
Ring it up.

612
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,933
That comes to 9,700,000 won.

613
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,936
How much? It's 9,700,000 won?

614
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,942
Are you crazy?
With this money, people can rent a house.

615
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,244
You're spending that much on clothes?

616
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,746
I won't tell you to wear it,
so stop overreacting.

617
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,715
I'm taking everything once we switch.

618
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,220
-Just sign it.
-Never.

619
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,000
Give it to me.

620
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,073
What?

621
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,208
Are you serious?

622
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,677
Yes, there were a lot of witnesses.

623
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,181
That stuntwoman even signs for the CEO.

624
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,515
Why on earth?

625
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,120
Does she know some secret
and is blackmailing him?

626
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,823
Oh, yes. Bingo.

627
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,194
There's only one situation
when a woman can act like this.

628
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:52,863
She either got pregnant,

629
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,400
is pregnant,

630
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:01,305
or is going through pregnancy.

631
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,244
Is it finally the time
to change the CEO name plaque?

632
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:16,754
Speak.

633
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,357
He's weird these days.

634
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,126
Be more specific.

635
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,794
He cooks on his own.

636
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,396
What?

637
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,565
He's polite to the employees.
He even greets them first.

638
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,334
What? And?

639
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,270
He washed his own underwear
and hung them out to dry on the terrace.

640
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,805
Stop.

641
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,274
That's enough.

642
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,810
What about that girl?

643
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,312
That weird girl. Did she ever come back?

644
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,249
She never came back to the house.

645
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,786
But U-yeong, Joo-won and the girl
were spotted at Oska Entertainment.

646
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,288
Then Joo-won and the girl left

647
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,557
and they haven't been back.

648
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,160
You mean they spent the night together?

649
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,129
Mr. Kang!

650
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,366
Yes, madam.

651
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,035
What's that girl's number?

652
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,704
Tell me right now.

653
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,011
You sure you want to go to action school
like this?

654
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,245
Of course.

655
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,549
Leopard print is perfect.
But it's not in my size.

656
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,752
Why are you embarrassing me?

657
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,254
Is this a training outfit someone
in their right mind would wear?

658
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,191
I'm going to kill that Italian artisan!

659
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,095
Hello?

660
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:32,763
Hello?

661
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,165
Hello?

662
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,601
Isn't this Gil Ra-im's phone?

663
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,737
Yes, it is. Who is this?

664
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,038
Is this Joo-won?

665
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,640
Well...

666
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,942
Yes. I mean...

667
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,643
You really have gone insane.

668
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,846
Now you even pick up her calls?

669
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,647
Hand her the phone!

670
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:55,119
What do we do? I think it's your mother.
She wants to talk to me.

671
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,554
My mom? Why did you pick up?

672
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,694
Hello?

673
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,696
How dare you make me wait so long?

674
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,266
I'll get straight to the point.
Come see me right now.

675
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,634
All right.

676
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,703
Where?

677
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,105
Yes. All right.

678
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,176
-What did she say?
-You don't have to know.

679
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:23,213
You just go to my office, sit around
for 30 minutes then say you're going home.

680
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,048
Bye.

681
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:27,918
What did she say?

682
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,053
What are you going to do?

683
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,626
Have you two been to Italy?

684
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:38,262
This?

685
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,464
They launched this in Korea last year.

686
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,367
So you're wearing matching outfits now?

687
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,203
Do you even know the value of that outfit?

688
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:50,741
I clearly said
I don't want to see you again.

689
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,410
But you called me out today.

690
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,414
You must take me as a joke.

691
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,551
Fine. You've gotten a car and clothing.

692
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,487
Here's what you really want.

693
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,964
There. You're uneducated
but you should know what this means.

694
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,333
Let's end it with this.

695
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,803
Stamp your fingerprint here.

696
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,106
-If not...
-Are you going to pour water on me?

697
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,308
You think I can't?

698
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,109
Okay. Let me check it first.

699
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,383
This is a lot less than I expected.

700
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:37,020
Is this going to be a monthly thing?

701
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,021
What?

702
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,328
By the way,

703
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,299
Have you ever done this
to other women besides me?

704
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,002
As if I haven't!

705
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,280
It's you, right?
You came with Joo-won once.

706
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,483
What brought you here?

707
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,918
A taxi.

708
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,053
You are funny.

709
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,423
Can I get a consultation?

710
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,928
Have a seat
since you've registered and paid.

711
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,032
PSYCHIATRIST PARK JI-HYEON

712
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,039
What's the problem? I think I know...

713
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,643
I've been seeing some rich guy
a couple times

714
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,414
and his mother came
and handed me an envelope full of money.

715
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:39,917
I think you'll know.

716
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,318
"Take it and leave."

717
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,656
Is this what you pictured?

718
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,259
Did you meet Joo-won's mother?

719
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,163
Does she still act like that?

720
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,900
Go on.

721
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,771
What would happen

722
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,407
if I keep seeing him?

723
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,812
You'll feel like you're alone on Earth.

724
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,050
Don't see that guy.

725
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,118
He won't be able to protect you.

726
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,325
He doesn't have a reason
to protect an average girl.

727
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,399
This is insane.

728
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,935
What are we going to do about this?

729
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,470
OSKA'S SONG LEAKED

730
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,838
I don't know.

731
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,790
Where's Director Yoon?

732
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,692
She's not here today.

733
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,795
Try calling her.
She's not picking up my calls.

734
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,899
I spoke to her earlier, and she said
she'll be out of touch for a few days.

735
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,268
She told us not to come to work--

736
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,636
Call her again!

737
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,478
The number you have dialed is turned off.

738
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,048
Her phone is off.

739
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,600
Until now, my love songs
were all about you.

740
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:42,039
But I don't want to write
any more songs about you.

741
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,276
Now, please come out of my songs.

742
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,112
Please be the heroine of my life.

743
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,451
I can't drive safely to Seoul
with you sitting there.

744
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,120
The lights, the lanes, the cars front
and back. I can't focus on anything.

745
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,731
You said I can leave in 30 minutes.

746
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,267
But the executives are coming
to get my signature.

747
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,902
What should I do?

748
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,411
How are you? Have you had dinner?

749
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,621
Would you like some coffee for dessert?

750
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,459
Thank you for the thought.

751
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,829
If I drink coffee
when I'm just an employee...

752
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,397
Hold on, please.

753
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:44,034
Ask him, "Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?"

754
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,368
Don't sign the documents at all.

755
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,437
Geez. What kind of answer is that?

756
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,673
By any chance, are you talking to me?

757
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:50,907
What?

758
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,609
No way.

759
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,344
You are much older than me.

760
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,146
I'm sure you did your best.

761
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,618
What's his strategy now?

762
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,893
Since you weren't here,

763
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,797
I took care of most of them.

764
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,098
All of these?

765
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,667
If you were at work on time,
this wouldn't have happened.

766
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,171
I'm sorry. I'll be here on time.

767
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,512
I didn't mean to blame you.

768
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,314
To make it up to you,

769
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:36,653
Should I take care of
the Jecheon Project plans while I'm at it?

770
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,861
No, I will.

771
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,964
I want to do this one.

772
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:54,037
Since you are here,
I think you should sign it now.

773
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,573
Right now?

774
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,462
What is this?

775
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,265
What made him become so respectful?

776
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,468
What is it?

777
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,005
His signature has changed.

778
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:30,106
What?

779
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,576
What is this?

780
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:33,476
KIM JOO-WON

781
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,580
Why did he change it?
I just mastered his signature.

782
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,593
I didn't have a chance to say this...

783
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,263
What...

784
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,800
Your voice is really awesome.

785
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,936
Have a nice day.

786
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,580
What's wrong with him?

787
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,049
Why?

788
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,893
Is something wrong these days?

789
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,796
Are you sick?

790
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:29,432
Maybe a concussion?

791
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,239
What kind of boss was I?

792
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:37,841
Pardon?

793
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,177
I was always angry, arrogant,
and shameless, right?

794
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,579
Because I'm rude.

795
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,714
I didn't say anything.

796
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,716
I really didn't say anything.

797
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,386
If you did,
I was going to raise your salary.

798
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,054
What do you think you're doing?

799
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,393
You just touched me here.

800
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,529
Me?

801
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,598
I did?

802
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,334
Excuse me.

803
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,871
Aren't you the one
who rubbed yourself against me?

804
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,340
Who rubbed against you?

805
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,608
I was measuring your size.

806
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,277
You pretended to,
and rubbed your body against me.

807
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,681
You pervert!
You pressed your body against me.

808
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,884
I had to measure your chest a few times
because of it!

809
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,187
As if that wasn't enough,
you touched my butt.

810
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,022
What? A pervert?

811
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,426
I've been a VVIP here for ten years.

812
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,760
Do you want to be fired?

813
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:34,164
Are you threatening me?
This is not your first time either.

814
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,132
You touched me last month too.

815
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:40,370
Last time, I withstood it to earn money.
But now...

816
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:45,875
I can't even face
my two-year-old daughter, you asshole!

817
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:47,877
Asshole?

818
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,449
I don't have anything to say to you.
Bring your boss here, now.

819
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,255
I'm here. I'm the president.

820
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,857
Oh, no.

821
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,361
Sir, she didn't do anything wrong.

822
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,762
He's the one...

823
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,465
Sir, I will take care of this.

824
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,999
He called me.

825
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,104
I'm here.
So if you have anything to say, go ahead.

826
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,774
Maybe it's because you're young...

827
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,745
But your employees aren't well-trained.

828
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:27,317
You must have heard of me before.

829
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:31,521
I'm sorry, but could you shut up
and clench your jaw?

830
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,423
It's about to be broken.

831
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,862
Goodbye.

832
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,296
Take care.

833
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,967
Hey! Wait!

834
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,235
Hey!

835
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,571
Don't get too shocked
and listen carefully.

836
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,974
Today, we had a pervert at the store,

837
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,010
and our CEO punched him in the face,

838
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,280
Then he went for a left and a right,
a hook, and finished him with an uppercut.

839
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,848
He was bleeding from both nostrils!

840
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,085
Our CEO looked so cool!

841
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,487
What? That psycho.

842
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,791
Call our attorney and stop the press.

843
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,492
Hey, where are you going?

844
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,528
And who were you talking to?

845
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,363
Gil Taeng-ja!

846
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,706
Call our attorney immediately
and stop the press.

847
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,346
I already called our attorney.

848
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,714
The attorney?

849
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,017
You didn't have to...

850
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,253
I finally get to see his face.

851
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,052
Enjoying your meal?

852
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,288
Why don't you get something better
since you've done so much good?

853
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,693
Seolleongtang tastes best
at the police station--

854
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,328
Are you really insane?

855
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,430
You're doing this on purpose
to piss me off, right?

856
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,832
Do you even know what you just did?

857
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,468
You punched a department store VVIP!

858
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,803
If you were in that situation--

859
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,706
I would call the police, check his ID
and the gather security camera evidence.

860
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,441
Then sue him.

861
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,410
What else are you going to show me?

862
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,180
You haven't changed one bit.

863
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:41,117
Ever since you came to me with that bag
that's worse than a garbage bag...

864
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,488
You haven't thought about me
for even five minutes.

865
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,573
I'm never going to let you out.

866
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,408
If you want to settle,
do it with your own money.

867
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,311
I'm so outraged
that I told the lawyer to not to come.

868
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,613
So good luck.

869
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,082
Wait.

870
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,187
I know I was wrong,

871
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,191
but this is your body, Joo-won.

872
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,832
Hey, pervert.

873
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,736
Don't come to a settlement with that thug.

874
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,406
He needs to learn his lesson.

875
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,775
Chin up.

876
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,613
Hey! How can you just leave?

877
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,117
What did you say to me?

878
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,051
How dare you?

879
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,754
-But you did feel her butt.
-Please sit down.

880
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,824
He deserves to rot in prison.

881
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:34,831
Are you okay?

882
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,535
What is this? What happened?

883
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:45,708
I'm...

884
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,744
me again.

885
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,195
