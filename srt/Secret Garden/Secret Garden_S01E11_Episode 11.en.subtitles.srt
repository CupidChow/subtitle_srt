1
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:30,964
If my life starts to depend on her,
then you can intervene.

2
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,467
This is just temporary.
Can't you wait that long?

3
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,137
Are you serious?

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,838
Have I ever made empty promises?

5
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,941
This woman has no interest in me
despite my obsession.

6
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,879
So don't embarrass yourself
by making her come at your whim.

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:52,385
If I ever say, "I can't live without her,"
then please stop me.

8
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,155
-What?
-Even if she changes her mind

9
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,423
and agrees to marry me,

10
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,924
don't give her your blessing.

11
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,861
Just keep saying no,
and separate me from her at all costs.

12
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,363
Okay?

13
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,231
Wait...

14
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,201
Say no instead of yes?

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,805
The things I do best like
acting crazy and keep disapproving?

16
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,206
You want me to do that?

17
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,140
Yes.

18
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,875
Really?

19
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,645
Do you agree with this too?

20
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,514
I'm sorry,

21
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,317
but your son seems to be mistaken.

22
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,220
That isn't what you want, right?

23
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,321
Yes.

24
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:34,494
Your son may think of me just as
a woman he can have a fling with,

25
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,229
but to me,

26
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,431
he isn't even that.

27
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,100
What?

28
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,206
I've tried getting angry, punching him
and even throwing him into the ground.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,975
But he has such strange taste,

30
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,645
the more I act like that,
the more he likes me.

31
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,682
-Hey!
-You've done what?

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,251
Threw him? Into the ground?

33
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,154
I heard you had someone tail me.

34
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:06,993
But I think it would be wiser
to tail your son rather than me.

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,896
I would appreciate it if you make sure

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,365
he never comes near me

37
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,900
ever again.

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,803
What did you...

39
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,271
My goodness...

40
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,710
If you'll excuse me--

41
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,412
How dare you get up
while your elder is talking?

42
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,216
Take this back with you!

43
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,386
You should've just come empty-handed
if you're that poor.

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,655
Are you trying to show the world
how poor you are?

45
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,191
Why did you bring
such an outrageous basket?

46
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,227
Can't you tell this is not the place

47
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,329
to bring such street-bought fruit garbage?

48
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,866
You bought this?

49
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,737
You think I did, then?
This is what you like, huh?

50
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,739
Do you think I sent you to art classes
since you were 12

51
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,275
to have to this kind of taste?

52
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,043
Follow me!

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,855
Let's get out of here.

54
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,259
Let's just go!

55
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,795
Don't you dare touch me.

56
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,264
Why did you have to bring this?

57
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,334
Is anyone here? No one?

58
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,771
Clean this up.

59
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,306
Come on!

60
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,576
Let go. I'm taking that with me.

61
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,680
I said let go of me. Let go!

62
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,649
This is my house.

63
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,618
You can hit me outside.

64
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,390
Where are you going? I'll take you--

65
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,692
You psycho!

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,961
This is my house.

67
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,864
So what if this is your house?
Are you trying to show off?

68
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
You really are a psycho

69
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,301
just like you say you are.

70
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,637
What? "Temporary"?

71
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,807
Do I become temporary

72
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,609
just because you say so?

73
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,944
Who are you to treat me like this?

74
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,647
Listen carefully.

75
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,482
I don't want to spend

76
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,417
a single second with you anymore.

77
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,486
I'm warning you.

78
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,955
Don't ever touch me again.

79
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,824
All right?

80
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,043
Get in.

81
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,246
I said, get in.

82
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,117
There are no buses around here.
And it's too long of a walk.

83
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,757
Fine.

84
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,126
I'll drive. Give me your keys.

85
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,025
What are you doing? Stop!

86
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,668
Stop playing around!

87
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,744
Hey!

88
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,733
What are you doing?

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,634
Why?

90
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,036
Can't I have some fun
with a rich man like you?

91
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,139
-What?
-How does it feel?

92
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,309
Was it fun? Enjoyable? Exciting?
Want me to do that again?

93
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,746
See?

94
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,948
You're angry being toyed with too, right?

95
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,485
This is how I always felt around you.

96
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,488
Where is your common sense?

97
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,525
I told you to return the money.

98
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,895
-Let's first calm--
-Shut it.

99
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,898
Am I being too nice right now?

100
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,134
I wish I could beat you half to death,

101
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,138
but I'm holding it together for my sake,

102
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,008
because I once had feelings for you.

103
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,143
So shut up.

104
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,746
You think I have no pride

105
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,581
because I don't earn a lot of money?

106
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,417
My father taught me to

107
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,187
never visit someone's home empty-handed.

108
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,823
But how could she mock me like that?

109
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,927
Is your family and wealth that great?

110
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,398
She would've reacted the same,
no matter what you brought.

111
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,535
It's you she doesn't like,
not what you brought.

112
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,570
I know.

113
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,839
That's why I don't like her either.

114
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,707
At all.

115
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,876
Fair enough.

116
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,346
-What?
-I understand why you're mad. I really do.

117
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,850
So shouldn't you try to understand me too?

118
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,018
Understand what?

119
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,856
Were you expecting me to side with you
in that situation?

120
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,060
If you were, then you're the one
living in a fairy tale.

121
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,631
Should I behave that way
to simply impress you?

122
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,967
Don't you know that
it would've made her even angrier?

123
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,338
I'm doing the best I can right now.

124
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,140
So can't you endure situations like this
for me?

125
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,911
Didn't you know the amount of endurance
you would need to date a guy like me?

126
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,180
You should know better at your age.

127
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,984
Am I wrong?

128
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,621
No, you're right.

129
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,289
You are

130
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:44,957
absolutely right.

131
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,727
You're always right.

132
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,196
But the fact that

133
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,065
everything you say is true

134
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,668
hurts me a lot.

135
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:02,909
I apologize

136
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,878
if you were upset. I'm sorry.

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,315
Don't apologize.

138
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,751
You are not sorry at all.

139
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,097
Since when were you so pretty,
Ms. Gil Ra-im?

140
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,644
Congratulations

141
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,713
on becoming Gil Ra-im again.

142
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,217
Why do women act that way?

143
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,855
They always make a foam mustache
and pretend not to know in front of guys.

144
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,523
Gross.

145
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,458
Come here.

146
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,693
I did it to make you laugh...

147
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,569
Earlier...

148
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,672
You said you once had feelings for me...

149
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,374
Is it true?

150
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,876
You just pretended

151
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:52,845
that you never did?

152
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,787
In this world,

153
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,990
there are some things

154
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,793
that you're better off not knowing.

155
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,464
I think for me,

156
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,366
one of those things is you.

157
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,670
Find a better woman.

158
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,574
And make your mother happy.

159
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,788
Find a better woman.

160
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,390
And make your mother happy.

161
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,366
Yes.

162
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,935
Where are you? Still in Pyeongchang-dong?

163
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,970
No, I'm home.

164
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,971
What about Ra-im?

165
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,273
She left.

166
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,742
I can tell something happened
by your voice.

167
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,544
What did your mother say?

168
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,412
Did she pay Ra-im to get lost?

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,915
She did that a while ago.

170
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,651
But your mom called Ra-im again?

171
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,519
Did Ra-im cry?

172
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,955
Not in front of me,

173
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,090
but maybe on her way home.

174
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,625
On her way home?

175
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,895
Don't tell me you made her go home alone.

176
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,598
Do you think
she would have listened to me?

177
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,400
You still should've taken her home.

178
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,268
Your mom wouldn't have called her over
to be nice.

179
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,272
I bet your mom shredded Ra-im's heart.
How could you make her go alone like that?

180
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,209
-My mom didn't. I did.
-What?

181
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,678
You shouldn't have called me.

182
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,615
Then should I have done nothing
and watched Ra-im get hurt by your mom?

183
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,119
You know I always protect my fans.
What did you exactly say to her?

184
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,922
U-yeong...

185
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,593
I really thought I could...

186
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,328
That you could do what?

187
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,098
Not fall

188
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,234
in love with her.

189
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,639
I thought I would be fine,

190
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,843
since she was just ordinary.

191
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,146
But...

192
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,050
nothing's going my way.

193
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,655
You idiot. You can't plan those things.
People's minds are not vending machines.

194
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,590
It's not like picking a soda.

195
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,525
Rest. I'll see you later.

196
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,708
Would you like some tea, sir?

197
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,649
-Miss.
-Yes?

198
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,018
I had an autograph event a few days ago.

199
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,522
And I saw a fan in her 40s

200
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,091
with the exact same hairstyle as me.

201
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:27,960
What do you think?

202
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,632
She must be a client of ours. Right?

203
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,302
Right. Exactly.

204
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,505
I don't want to look like an idol.

205
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:44,810
But it's a problem when I look like
some 40-year-old woman's sister.

206
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,914
I even looked prettier from behind!

207
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,985
-Oska!
-What?

208
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,788
There's an article about
the original composer of the title song

209
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,856
and it's someone we know.

210
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:58,924
Someone we know?

211
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,859
Who? Bring it here.

212
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,399
What the heck?

213
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,834
Seriously?

214
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,338
I WROTE THE PLAGIARIZED SONG...

215
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,573
He was the original composer?

216
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,508
Geez...

217
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,714
HAN TAE-SEON

218
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,583
Where is he? Did he leave the country?

219
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,885
I told you to find out!

220
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,254
-Hello?
-Hey.

221
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,690
-Where are you?
-Why?

222
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,392
Where the heck are you?

223
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,260
You're still in Korea, right?

224
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,964
I'm heading there now, so don't move.

225
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,501
-Oska, you have a meeting.
-Delay it for two hours!

226
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,669
I said, where are you?

227
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,638
I already delayed it once!
I can't do that again!

228
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,617
Don't you have anything to say to me?

229
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,252
-Nope.
-No?

230
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,854
Don't make me...

231
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,392
You made me become a fool.

232
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,961
You should've told me
that you were the original composer.

233
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,529
Why are you blaming me for your stupidity?

234
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,165
I gave you a chance. Twice.

235
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,433
When?

236
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,038
Why do you have this?

237
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,340
I put in a song that you should listen to.

238
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,208
Make sure you listen to it.

239
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,677
Did you find out who leaked your song?

240
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,281
Why not try looking
for the original composer?

241
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,284
How was I supposed to know from just that?

242
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,621
You must have enjoyed watching me
go through all this.

243
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,856
-Thrilled, actually.
-What?

244
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,461
I knew you would come find me.

245
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,963
Why would I?

246
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,068
Don't you have anything to say to me?

247
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,037
Like what?

248
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,509
-Not a bit of conscience, huh?
-Conscience?

249
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,512
I thought the first thing you would do
is apologize

250
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,581
when you found out
that I was the composer.

251
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,851
Do you think saying you didn't know
it was plagiarized is enough?

252
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,755
You're a brat with no respect for artists.

253
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,423
What? Brat?

254
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,559
Hey!

255
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,761
I'm a victim too.

256
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,898
My seventh album and my reputation
are ruined. What more do you want?

257
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,734
You got your apology too.

258
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,103
An apology?

259
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,073
Did you fully work for that apology?

260
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,808
What?

261
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,381
An unexpected guest, I see.

262
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,418
Did you wait long?

263
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,088
You two know each other?

264
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,156
How do you know her?

265
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,224
We know each other well.

266
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,528
Actually, I would say a little too well.

267
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,237
Do you mind stepping out if you're done?
It's important.

268
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,772
How important? What is it?

269
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,407
Did you release the article, ma'am?

270
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,146
I did release the article.
But I'm not at the age for "ma'am" yet.

271
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,150
It was you who released the story? Why?

272
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,353
Think of it as a preview
of our agency's new musician.

273
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,188
I hope you liked it.

274
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,992
What are you talking about?
Whose new musician?

275
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,965
It's not a formal contract.
But we agreed to all of your terms.

276
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:31,203
Your personal studio and apartment
should be ready by next week.

277
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,873
Have you thought about it?

278
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,709
Yes.

279
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,313
I just decided. It's a deal.

280
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,049
What? Why you, out of all people?

281
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,653
You passed up and embarrassed me
just for this?

282
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,757
Just this? At least she had the sincerity
to find out the original composer.

283
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,194
-I mean, this middle-aged woman.
-I'm not a middle-aged woman!

284
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,697
You promised you wouldn't go anywhere.

285
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,299
What are you going to do with that?

286
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,401
What promise?

287
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,438
I never make promises.
I've been betrayed too many times.

288
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,311
I'll call you after I read it.

289
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,848
Hey! Where are you going?
We're not done talking here!

290
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,717
That punk...

291
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,186
Since when did you know him?

292
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,523
You're doing this knowing full well
I tried very hard to scout him.

293
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,592
You did?

294
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,161
We must have similar tastes.

295
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,597
What a shame.

296
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,800
You're probably already upset

297
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,236
over the song I leaked.

298
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,240
Did you actually leak it?

299
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,345
You said it was me.

300
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,914
So it must be.

301
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,716
Stop avoiding the question.

302
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,120
Who else would put
in so much effort to ruin me?

303
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,791
You should've shown me
your scary side earlier.

304
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,860
If I had known,

305
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,096
things would've worked out easier.

306
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,031
You were

307
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,700
the worst gossip

308
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,003
of my life.

309
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,267
Hi, Mom!

310
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,268
How are you?

311
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,140
I know that no news is good news,

312
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,243
but I just miss hearing your voice
some days.

313
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,813
Today is one of those days.

314
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,516
Is everything well?

315
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,252
Of course. Did something good
happen to you?

316
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,186
Yes.

317
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,255
In the near future, maybe.

318
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,425
Are you busy these days?

319
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,494
No, actually. I'm not. Why?

320
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,364
Then why haven't there been any scandals?

321
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,966
Are you religious now?

322
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,502
What about scandals?

323
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,406
I guess I'm getting old.
I want a daughter-in-law.

324
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,576
Is there anyone around you?

325
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,180
No.

326
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,491
All right. I'll look for a good,

327
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,828
kind woman.

328
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,811
So, what brings you here?

329
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,448
This office seems a bit empty.

330
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,050
Doesn't it?

331
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,819
Joo-won's office was very nice.

332
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,087
That's

333
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,490
because he is the president.

334
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,225
Oh, no.

335
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,328
You must have no ambition.

336
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:20,098
After all, you've been with
the Loel Group for over 30 years...

337
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,669
Well, my style is

338
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,374
to accept things the way they are.

339
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:34,112
Having that style is fine,
but you think on a very small scale.

340
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,452
I could easily work day and night
to help you become the president

341
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,756
or prevent you from becoming one,
even more than Joo-won's mother.

342
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,459
Which would you prefer?

343
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:48,894
What do you mean--

344
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,763
Isn't Joo-won a difficult person
to deal with?

345
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,433
-Excuse me?
-I'll get to the point.

346
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,605
If I make you the president, can you
make U-yeong become vice president?

347
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,376
U-yeong can't sing and dance forever.

348
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:11,716
Don't you think it would be much easier
to deal with U-yeong than Joo-won?

349
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,754
He has a lot of fans,

350
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,458
so that might make it more difficult.

351
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,530
Right! That's very true!

352
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,669
Of course, it will be a national loss
when U-yeong retires,

353
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,138
but he needs to think of his age.

354
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,274
What do you say?

355
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,884
I was the one who took a photo of him
at his high school graduation.

356
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,385
He's basically family.

357
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:52,691
In that sense, I feel closer to him
than to President Kim.

358
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,027
So I'll take that as a yes, then.

359
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,515

00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,383
"Alice asked,

361
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,420
'Could you tell me
which road I must take?'"

362
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,591
"The Cheshire Cat replied,

363
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,195
'That depends on where you want to go.'"

364
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,174
DON'T YOU DARE SMILE AT OTHER WOMEN!

365
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,776
STUDIO? LIAR!
YOU WERE WITH CHUN JI-AE!

366
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,379
"'I don't really care where.'"

367
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:27,118
"'Then it doesn't matter
which one you take.'"

368
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,290
"'I want to arrive at somewhere.'"

369
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,063
"'You will surely end up somewhere

370
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,133
if you keep walking long enough,
that is.'"

371
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,723
Gil Ra-im!

372
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,560
I'm in the locker room.
I'll be down there soon.

373
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,491
Gil Ra-im!

374
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,997
What is that? Is that for me?

375
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,866
Good evening, ma'am.

376
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,768
Good evening, sir.

377
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,471
-You bought this?
-The fire chief, Mr. Kim,

378
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,041
bought one for his daughter, so...

379
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,277
No wonder.

380
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,179
But why a cat?

381
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,782
My friends call me "Gil Nyangi."

382
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:04,816
"Gil Nyangi"?

383
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,685
What's that?

384
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,819
It means stray cat.

385
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,357
They say I have a wild, untamed charm
to me or something...

386
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,461
You are not going around
and beating other kids up, right?

387
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,830
Dad! What do you take your daughter for?

388
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,635
I was going to make you
an awesome seafood dinner...

389
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,037
Guess I'll eat by myself.

390
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,174
Did I hurt your feelings?

391
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,377
I'll help with the crabs, okay?

392
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,446
No, I can do it myself!

393
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,427
Why aren't you out?
I called you several times.

394
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,565
I'm sorry. Did something happen?

395
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,234
They called asking for a demo video

396
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,403
for the Hollywood movie Dark Blood.

397
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,272
Really? They really called?

398
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,974
The director just got off the phone.

399
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,811
Only about 40 people in Korea, China
and Japan got this call. Congratulations!

400
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,680
Oh, my goodness!

401
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,849
I'll go see the director!

402
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,057
Director!

403
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,227
Director!

404
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,497
Congratulations.

405
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,998
It's all thanks to you, sir.

406
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,768
I'll start focusing on the demo video now.

407
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,469
Make sure not to overwork though.

408
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,806
Do you have free time this evening?
Let's all have dinner!

409
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,008
I'll treat you all to grilled pork rinds.

410
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,411
-You go ahead.
-You're not coming, Director?

411
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,381
-I have plans.
-How about tomorrow?

412
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,949
Does tomorrow work for you?

413
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,022
I have plans tomorrow

414
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,057
and the day after.

415
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,228
If you're worried about me, then don't be.

416
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,902
I'm like this because I think
I just need some distance and time.

417
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,237
I'm sorry,

418
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,072
but what are you trying to say here?

419
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,974
I think it was wise of you

420
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,443
to have said that to me.

421
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,848
That it was necessary to draw
a clear line at some point.

422
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,586
I didn't think that you were so keen.

423
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,622
It is my fault for getting caught,

424
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,826
but don't make me feel sorry about it.

425
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:33,264
Just keep pretending that didn't happen.

426
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,900
Don't worry about me at all,

427
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,403
and focus on your work.

428
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,905
I'll make sure

429
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,107
that I never get caught again.

430
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,723
Just leave it there, please.
I'll take care of it.

431
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,091
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,796
Is there construction going on?
It's noisy outside.

433
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,565
We're setting up
the Christmas tree right now.

434
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,568
Should we do it later if it's too noisy?

435
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,138
It's already Christmas.

436
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,009
How is it coming along?

437
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,211
Pardon?

438
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,639
It's so pretty!

439
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,183
Thank you very much, sir.

440
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,285
It went very smoothly because you helped.

441
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,353
Of course.

442
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,358
Well, good night, sir.

443
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,000
Do you like decorating trees?

444
00:33:58,836 --> 00:33:59,904
I don't.

445
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,206
I don't like making a big deal

446
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,208
about someone else's birthday.

447
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:07,879
But

448
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,982
I thought you would like it

449
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,351
since

450
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,255
you like everything that I don't.

451
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,191
Even those socks...

452
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,562
But those socks won't help you
get any presents.

453
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,566
Why not?

454
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,870
Santa doesn't give presents
to those who cry.

455
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,607
He has such strict rules.

456
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,877
You made me cry, though.

457
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,515
Santa doesn't care.

458
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,151
Jerk.

459
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,358
Who said it was okay

460
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:56,961
to cry?

461
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,990
Are you the real Gil Ra-im?

462
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,559
Are you kidding me?

463
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,495
Seeing those eyes,

464
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,030
it must be you.

465
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,533
Why are you here all of a sudden?

466
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,467
Why are you smiling?

467
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,903
After all you put me through.

468
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,071
What?

469
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,340
What did you say exactly to Director Lim?

470
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,342
What did you say to him?

471
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,078
Why is he telling me
not to make him feel sorry?

472
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,213
You came here to ask me that?
This late at night?

473
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,414
I need an answer.

474
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,283
I told you on Jeju Island

475
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,485
that the director likes you.

476
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,422
So I told him to never ask you out.

477
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,624
Why?

478
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,827
-What?
-Shouldn't you be thankful?

479
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,932
-You two wouldn't have lasted long.
-So you think you did a good job?

480
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,135
You think there's only two kinds of
relationships between men and women, huh?

481
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,304
We've worked together for seven years.

482
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:18,543
He's my mentor, my father,
and the one person whom I can depend on,

483
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,945
and the person whom I most respect.

484
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,082
A guy like you can't just interfere
and ruin our relationship.

485
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,717
Who ruined what?

486
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,386
I took care of it for you.

487
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,857
His feelings for you
are not as pure and innocent as you think.

488
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,126
I could tell right away.

489
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,761
Are you that slow?

490
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,263
Or are you just pretending to be slow?

491
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,334
Fine. Let's assume
that the director likes me as you say.

492
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,037
That makes it more of my problem.

493
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,272
Just between me and the director.

494
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,576
What gives you the right to hurt him?

495
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,477
Especially a guy like you?

496
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,247
You hurting him while you were me

497
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:00,718
is more painful than when you hurt me.

498
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,186
If I stop intervening,

499
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,988
are you going to go out with him?

500
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,825
-Do you even like him?
-Yes. I do.

501
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,596
Thanks to you,
I've found out he feels the same,

502
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,265
so I'm going to give it a try.

503
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,529
I have the right now, don't I?

504
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,135
I'm warning you.

505
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,771
Don't ever get angry at me,

506
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,608
tell me that you're hurt,

507
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,343
or come find me

508
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,579
because of some other guy.

509
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,187
What are you doing?

510
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,356
Are you two fighting?

511
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,359
Is he giving you a hard time?

512
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,363
-You're late.
-So you two did fight.

513
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:24,201
You have no right to start a fight.
You deserve to be hit and yelled at.

514
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,836
Are you okay, Ra-im?

515
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,607
I'm sorry about leaving
like that yesterday.

516
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,544
Don't worry about that.
I'm sure you haven't recovered yet.

517
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:39,650
You probably know this, but the women
in our family are bit on the extreme side.

518
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,819
Upsetting, wasn't it?

519
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,022
-Why bring up the past?
-For you, it may be just the past.

520
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,793
You might not know, but Ra-im even now

521
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,463
is living in that moment
in your living room with your mother.

522
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,598
Do you know how a woman's heart works?

523
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,868
Ra-im, just kick him to the curb.

524
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,304
I would like to,

525
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,274
but he fails to realize it every time.

526
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,843
That's my strength.

527
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,414
-I'll be going then.
-I'll take you.

528
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,483
I heard we're training
tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

529
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,286
You're my mentor now.
I should take care of you.

530
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,187
Don't worry.

531
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,388
I'll take her.

532
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,322
Yes.

533
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:19,990
Please take me home.

534
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,693
It's been a rough day.

535
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,662
Let's go then.

536
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,266
You stay here
and think about what you've done.

537
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,619
You're drilling a hole into my face!

538
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,589
That's why I was staring at you.

539
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,493
Where do you think
the hole in your face will be at?

540
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,530
I did that so you won't get hurt.

541
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,032
These pretty hands have to play the piano.

542
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,869
I guess you don't hold grudges.

543
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,204
You resolve things right away, right?

544
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,039
Everyone holds grudges.

545
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:13,477
I've pushed students off of high places
for not listening.

546
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,954
I wish you could join us.

547
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,358
It would be rude for me to climb up
and try to defeat gravity.

548
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,827
Obesity leads to all types of diseases.

549
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,997
You have to at least stay fit
to live long.

550
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,300
Why do you think I overeat?

551
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,037
That nagging Dong-gyu!

552
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,073
Don't worry. I'll tell him for you.

553
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:47,077
I'll make a diet
and exercise plan for you.

554
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,312
Thank you.

555
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,016
-Shall we start?
-Sure.

556
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,425
All you have to do is

557
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,930
put your foot here, grab the hold,
and pull yourself up.

558
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,236
There's nothing to fear!

559
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,705
Just trust me, okay?

560
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,243
Don't look down. Only look up.

561
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,212
I'm used to

562
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,114
looking down from up top.

563
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,685
Apply chalk when your hands get sweaty.

564
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,487
The thing on your waist...

565
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,492
Wait, I forgot!

566
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,661
A beautiful mentor with too many flaws

567
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,598
makes it difficult for me to concentrate.

568
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,900
Hey, use mine!

569
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,535
Here.

570
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,875
I'm so sorry.

571
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,513
You just made a big mistake.

572
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,848
-It wasn't on purpose--
-That's not enough.

573
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,984
You may not know me.

574
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,255
If you slap me on the left cheek,
I'm the type that offers you my right.

575
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,057
So, same for this one too!

576
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,059
What?

577
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,428
My butt isn't that flabby.

578
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,339
Yes, I've been working out.

579
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,778
It's all right.

580
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,917
I've already seen things I shouldn't have.

581
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,652
Things you shouldn't have?

582
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,058
Did you really see those pictures?

583
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,227
VVIP NEW YEAR'S EVE PROGRAM

584
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,164
This is the program and the guest list
for the VVIP New Year's Eve party.

585
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,899
There are a total of 473 guests.

586
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,968
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

587
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,971
I knew you would ask,
so I counted each and every guest.

588
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,839
What did you do that for?

589
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,776
Do I really need to say
the best answer myself?

590
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,179
Cut it down to the top 47 shoppers.

591
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,317
-What?
-Invite 47, with a budget for 470.

592
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:11,555
It will appeal to those 47 that
they are the top 10 percent of the VVIPs.

593
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,859
That way, the other 426 customers
will fight for that spot next year.

594
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,563
Also,

595
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,267
there's a guest waiting
who refuses to leave...

596
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,538
-Who is it?
-She keeps saying you're her fan...

597
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,641
-Park Chae-rin?
-Yes.

598
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,211
-Should I send her back?
-You call that a question?

599
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,281
Wait!

600
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,250
Send her in.

601
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,421
Tell me where U-yeong is.

602
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:48,993
I've been calling him every day,
but he is not picking up his phone.

603
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,196
You promised that if this happened,
you would tell me where he is.

604
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,198
Why now? You should've come sooner.

605
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,767
I always keep my promise.

606
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,202
Really?

607
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,376
You're pretty athletic,
so you learn quickly.

608
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,878
I think one week will be enough.

609
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,513
One week?

610
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,750
You're really strange.

611
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,586
You said ten days.
You can't change it now.

612
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,921
This isn't funny.

613
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:22,226
Do you know how sad I was
when our romantic getaway was cut short?

614
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,327
Really?

615
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,365
To be honest, I was actually glad
our getaway was cut short.

616
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,600
What?

617
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,934
Why?

618
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:35,806
I wanted us to meet in a film
rather than a variety program.

619
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,112
I didn't want to remain in your memories
just as a contest winner.

620
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,483
And I lied

621
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,153
when I said I've been your fan

622
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,588
for three years.

623
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,624
You lied to me?

624
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,059
So you're not my fan?

625
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,160
Actually,

626
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,996
I liked you even before you debuted.

627
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,365
So it's been thirteen years,

628
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,133
not three.

629
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,903
Thirteen years ago,

630
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,505
I was in a band in Hongdae.

631
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,942
Yes, and your singing was worse back then.

632
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,313
But I was more handsome instead.

633
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,148
Wait,

634
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,117
why did you lie though?

635
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,654
If I said I liked you for 13 years,
I thought it might scare you.

636
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,091
It is a bit scary...

637
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,960
You must have seen me age, then.

638
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,395
We both aged.

639
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,668
You aged well.

640
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,004
Thank you.

641
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,341
Can I ask you something?

642
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,011
When you made that bet on Jeju Island,

643
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,615
you said it had something to do with me.

644
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:57,020
What was it exactly?

645
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,323
You said Joo-won told you.

646
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,361
So were you completely bluffing
at the police station?

647
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,030
I had to

648
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,768
in that situation.

649
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,903
We made a bet over you.

650
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,805
It's our little rule...

651
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:19,376
To steal or get stolen
what we desire the most from each other.

652
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:24,381
Joo-won bet you and I bet a house.
Ultimately, I won.

653
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,518
So technically,

654
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,286
you belong to me now.

655
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,021
What would you do

656
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,823
if I asserted

657
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,191
that right?

658
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:43,734
Then do I get to meet
the famous Oska's mother this time?

659
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:51,008
No need to be afraid.
If you get the chance to meet her,

660
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,944
you would be the 35th person

661
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,147
and might get screened right
at the front door through the intercom.

662
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,851
Oh, I look great on screen.

663
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,586
Really?

664
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:04,521
Oh, no.

665
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,657
You'll get married to me.

666
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,828
Oska!

667
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,602
How can you be eating so normally
after ignoring all my phone calls?

668
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,637
Haven't you heard the song,

669
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,440
"Still Eating Well"?

670
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,310
But how did you know I was here?

671
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,245
Joo-won told me

672
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,515
and insisted that I hurry,
because you were with a weird woman.

673
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,387
Why did you meet him?

674
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,323
Did you really sell

675
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,525
those pictures to Joo-won?

676
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,426
Pictures?

677
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:43,727
What pictures?

678
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,729
You said you took pictures at the hotel.

679
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,731
It apparently had beautiful angles.

680
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,800
Oh, that?

681
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,802
It was all a lie.

682
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:52,870
What?

683
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,605
Why, that little...

684
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,976
Let's eat. Have you eaten?

685
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,211
Go eat over there.

686
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,781
To Yoon Seul.

687
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:09,353
Thank you for loving me so much.

688
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,194
He said what?

689
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,730
That he liked you? And you believe him?

690
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:21,899
Yes, I do.

691
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:26,870
Unlike you and all other boastful fakers,
he has something called sincerity.

692
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,372
"Sincerity"?

693
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,873
Are you stupid?

694
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,243
To men, sincerity and boasting
mean the same thing.

695
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,544
You think he's different?

696
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,246
The U-yeong that I know is.

697
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,282
Want me to show you his real side?

698
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,483
What do you mean?

699
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,152
Do you know how much bluffing
he does to keep his pride?

700
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,188
See for yourself his willingness
to give up anything

701
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,291
just for his pride.

702
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,861
You'll see his sincerity then.

703
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,134
You think Seul only slept with you?

704
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,971
She's a party girl.
Every male celebrity knows about her.

705
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,074
You're not actually dating her, are you?

706
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,277
You're ruining the mood.

707
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,446
You think I'm crazy? To go out with her?

708
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:10,847
She's just

709
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,884
an obsessed fan of mine.

710
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:15,919
Okay?

711
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,313
Hey, it's me.

712
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,717
You'll have to help me.

713
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,322
Have the mall's profits increased?

714
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:57,260
Joo-won's been doing this
for 13 years straight.

715
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,262
Why wouldn't it?

716
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,065
The mall's been flourishing
since he became CEO.

717
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,601
Don't give him all the credit.

718
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,005
He couldn't have done it
without the help of his staff.

719
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,641
Honestly, after that accident,

720
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,012
he still can't remember what happened,

721
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,347
so you can't say he's normal.

722
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,083
-Yeon-hong!
-I'm saying this because I'm worried.

723
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,121
I heard such trauma can last a lifetime.

724
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,189
Shouldn't you worry about your own son?

725
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,991
U-yeong needs to get married.

726
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,228
I'm sick and tired of clearing
his scandals at every social meeting.

727
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,063
I'm sick and tired of it!

728
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,373
The water here is so refreshing!

729
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,344
By the way, how did your blind date go?

730
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,112
I'm not so sure,

731
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,881
but I think I got rejected.

732
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,216
Wait? Are you serious?

733
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:57,087
His family owns a mall, a hotel, a resort,
and even this spa.

734
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,488
You must go out with him!

735
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,991
Aren't they talking about Joo-won?

736
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,860
I don't care about his assets.

737
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,997
I have a decent amount myself.

738
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,167
It's just a pure crush,

739
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:16,139
but people keep mentioning his wealth
and family, and it doesn't feel right.

740
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,075
So I stopped calling him.

741
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,610
Then you're not going to see him?

742
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:21,745
How can I?

743
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,348
He loves someone else, anyway.

744
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:30,520
I don't want to interfere
and look like a gold digger.

745
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,421
I understand.

746
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,623
I don't want others to think

747
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,626
that my kind friend is materialistic too.

748
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,030
Oh, my god!

749
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,201
I'm so sorry.

750
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,937
Were we too loud?

751
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,973
It's not that. She's his mother.

752
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,742
-Excuse me?
-I'm Kim Joo-won's mother.

753
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,345
Oh, my!

754
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,249
I sincerely apologize, ma'am.

755
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,220
I usually don't speak of others
when they're not present.

756
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,421
It's all right.

757
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,591
When else would I get to listen to others
gossip about my son?

758
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,193
Want to have some tea together?

759
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,464
I remember you now.

760
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,567
You're much prettier in person.

761
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,103
You resemble Secretary Yoon.

762
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,072
Thank you.

763
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,042
So you don't speak to Joo-won at all?

764
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:28,879
That's right.

765
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:30,814
I don't want to make him

766
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,616
feel uncomfortable.

767
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,818
People who were raised right like you

768
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,654
are simply too kind for their own good.

769
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,225
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

770
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,561
No need to apologize.

771
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,166
Can you give me more details

772
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,568
about the woman Joo-won is seeing?

773
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,370
Is it

774
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,540
that stuntwoman, by any chance?

775
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,341
You know already?

776
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,411
I'm sure she's a fine lady

777
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,080
since Joo-won chose her.

778
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,985
I was too nice in sending her off.

779
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,655
Way too nice...

780
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,503
You deserve an Oscar award.

781
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,240
What character version
did you just play now?

782
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:32,676
Morning soap opera.

783
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:35,679
Wait.

784
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,583
Who was the woman
next to Joo-won's mother?

785
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,685
You didn't know?

786
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:43,520
She was U-yeong's mother.

787
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,289
What?

788
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,649
PRESIDENT KIM

789
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,618
Damn it.

790
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,125
So, I guess you love waffles.

791
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,594
Yes, especially the ones here.

792
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,130
You do? We'll have to come more often.

793
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,299
By the way,

794
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,167
has Joo-won

795
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,535
been in your house lately?

796
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,671
Yes, a few days ago.

797
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,340
He did? Why? To come and see you?

798
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,576
PRESIDENT KIM

799
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,379
Maybe. I'm not so sure, though.

800
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,049
He's been weird these days. Ra-im as well.

801
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,386
-So confusing...
-What's there to be confused about?

802
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,688
Let's just focus on us.

803
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,292
Oh, right. Did I tell you?
I bought a new car.

804
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,127
You did?

805
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,728
You didn't know?

806
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,097
I just got my car last week.

807
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,067
Something that fits you better.

808
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:09,005
It's not entirely mine yet,
but sooner or later--

809
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,774
PRESIDENT KIM

810
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,712
What?

811
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,515
Can't you just assume I'm busy,
when I don't pick up?

812
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,518
How can you keep calling until I pick up?
We're not friends!

813
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:23,520
Are you

814
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:24,821
out of your mind?

815
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,157
Don't you know who I am?

816
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,227
It was you, sir?

817
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:35,565
I thought it was another Mr. Kim...

818
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,669
I'm so sorry...

819
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,137
Another Mr. Kim?

820
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,040
That didn't seem like a mistake.

821
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,875
Right?

822
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,178
What? I can't hear you.

823
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,314
I really can't hear you...

824
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,149
What?

825
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,484
You want A-yeong?

826
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,455
What do you want with her?

827
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:06,863
CEO KIM JOO-WON

828
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,231
Have some tea.

829
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,599
Yes, sir.

830
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,872
Just relax.

831
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,212
If only I knew

832
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,448
why I was called here,

833
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,852
I would drink more comfortably.

834
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,553
I'll ask you one thing.

835
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,789
Are you free tonight?

836
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:34,591
What?

837
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,726
Let's have dinner.

838
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,462
Dinner with me?

839
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,864
You can't?

840
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,266
I can, but--

841
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,701
Under one condition.

842
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,203
-A condition?
-That it's not just us two.

843
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,806
We each have to bring our closest friend.

844
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,279
Do we have to dress up very nicely?

845
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:57,947
Of course.

846
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,733
Your closest friend is--

847
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:18,968
Yes,

848
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,637
we're practically buddies.

849
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,074
This is usually only possible
in Western culture...

850
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:30,814
A-yeong,

851
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,849
you must have many friends.

852
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,352
I clearly said, "Closest friend..."

853
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,456
She is my closest friend.

854
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,426
To be honest, Ra-im and I have been
a bit distant lately.

855
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,030
How can your friendship change?

856
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,733
-Excuse me?
-The reason I organized this dinner...

857
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,045
How well do you know A-yeong?

858
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,746
What?

859
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,617
A-yeong doesn't like it

860
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,753
when you sleep with your back
turned towards her.

861
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,958
She believes that you need to break up
with the guy to make him yours.

862
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,993
So if you get dumped, just wait.

863
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,430
If you want to become hers.

864
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,601
If she wants to go see a fortune teller,

865
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,736
don't fuss and just go with her.

866
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,306
Won Bin and Jo In-sung weren't a match,

867
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,542
so she'll check Gang Dong-won next.

868
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,945
When she uses the bathroom,

869
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,983
she always leaves the door slightly open.

870
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,585
Then, she asks,

871
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,854
"Does it smell?"

872
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,526
After washing her face,
she applies seven different creams.

873
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,528
Make sure to buy her moisturizer.

874
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,496
I noticed she ran out.

875
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,899
Mr. Kim...

876
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,536
Take good care of her.

877
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,473
Come home late today.

878
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:05,241
What?

879
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:18,982
Why didn't you pick up?

880
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:20,416
Why are you ignoring my calls?

881
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,718
Am I your secretary?

882
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,753
I can do whatever I want.

883
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,922
What's so great about you?
Who do you think you are?

884
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,758
Do you know what I did today
because of you?

885
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,426
I'm not interested. Move.

886
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,529
How could you not be interested?

887
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,232
You should be. We've even kissed.

888
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,137
How could you be so detached?
How could you act so indifferent?

889
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,240
Do you know how many hours
I waited for you here?

890
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,210
With my personality and status,
do you think that makes sense?

891
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,778
Why is it only me?

892
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,179
Why am I the only one like this?

893
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,815
How is that my fault?

894
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,183
You think it isn't?

895
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,086
When I first asked if you knew Oska,
what did you say?

896
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,288
"Why do you want to know?"

897
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,858
You shouldn't have answered like that.

898
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,994
You should've said,
"I do, but I'm not Park Chae-rin."

899
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,363
Then none of this would've happened.

900
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,199
You psycho...

901
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:13,169
Yes, but you made me this way.

902
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:16,673
But you're perfectly fine,
going to action school and meeting Oska.

903
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,675
Nothing has changed for you,

904
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,411
while my simple life
has been turned upside down.

905
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,580
It's so unfair and infuriating.

906
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,115
So what?

907
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,384
So I'm going to do whatever it takes.

908
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,588
That includes waiting for hours
in front of your home like a fool.

909
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,390
So I need you to cooperate.

910
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,625
What?

911
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,894
You have no desire
to be the little mermaid.

912
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:39,095
So

913
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,763
I'm going to take that role.

914
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:42,665
What?

915
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,034
I'll be your little mermaid.

916
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:49,305
I'll stay quietly next to you,
then disappear like foam.

917
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,374
So that's why

918
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,543
starting now

919
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,279
I'm going to swallow my pride
and cling onto you.

920
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,265
