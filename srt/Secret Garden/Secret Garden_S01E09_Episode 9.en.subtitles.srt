1
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,397
Are you okay?

2
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,901
What the...

3
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,202
What happened?

4
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,442
I'm...

5
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,077
me again.

6
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,462
I'm...

7
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,297
me again.

8
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:40,834
I think...

9
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,369
I'm me again!

10
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm back to normal!

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,434
I'm back to normal!

12
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,416
We are back to normal, right?

13
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,218
We must be,
since I'm seeing your puffy face

14
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,454
after seeing my handsome face for so long.

15
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,222
Since I'm hearing your rude tone,

16
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,158
we definitely are.

17
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,660
Anyway...

18
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,796
it's been a while.

19
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,599
I guess so.

20
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,401
But...

21
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,670
what about this?

22
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,672
Oh, right!

23
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,309
Seeing as we changed back to normal now,

24
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,379
God must really exist.

25
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,647
What?

26
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,950
"Poetic justice. You reap what you sow.
You did this to yourself."

27
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,186
You've heard of those phrases, right?

28
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,655
"I'm never letting you out.
You need to learn your lesson."

29
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,123
Who said that?

30
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,325
I mean...

31
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,262
I only yelled
because it was so noisy in here.

32
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,697
I was being nice.

33
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,265
For you to cheer up with my voice.

34
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,533
I know.

35
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,570
I'm all cheered up now,
so, I'm heading home.

36
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,307
You must be full
since you gulped down that seolleongtang.

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,474
Well,

38
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,876
I hope you learn your lesson!

39
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,711
Hey! Wait!

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,180
Mr. Pervert!

41
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,848
Don't settle no matter what!

42
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,717
He punched you really hard, right?

43
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,052
Also,

44
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,120
unless you want a new spinal cord,

45
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,022
beg the employee for forgiveness, okay?

46
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,691
Or you're dead meat.

47
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,726
Stop that!

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,094
Who do you think you are?

49
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,530
Who are you to keep pissing me off?

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,666
You might not know me,

51
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,634
but

52
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,871
I am an honest, upright man
who has never settled in his life!

53
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,508
Can you be quiet?
You've got no right to raise your voice.

54
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,511
Good night, Officer!

55
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,447
Goodbye!

56
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,183
Where are you going? Don't leave me here!

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,584
You should stay with me to the end!

58
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,753
Quiet down.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,556
Lock him up until his attorney arrives.

60
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,457
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,325
Wait, where? Why?

62
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,464
Where's Attorney Park?
What did Prosecutor Song say?

63
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,432
His tone changed again.

64
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,702
Times have changed.
You can't rely on connections anymore.

65
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,405
And you told Mr. Park not to come.

66
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,873
I know. I did, but...

67
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,209
How can he really not come
just because I said not to?

68
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,380
He could have dropped by just in case.
He could have easily dropped by!

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,716
He said he was on his way again,
so, he's probably coming.

70
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,051
I'll check.

71
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,321
Tell him to hurry!
I'll pay for any of his speeding tickets!

72
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,324
Hey, Mr. Chatty!

73
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,326
Shut up already!

74
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,194
If you keep yelling at me like that...

75
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,012
Hey!

76
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,547
Hey!

77
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,783
I don't usually ask this,

78
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,785
but where did you get this track suit?

79
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,422
This outfit does not deserve
such abuse from you!

80
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,392
Hey.

81
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,127
Where did you get this track suit?

82
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,397
You can't ignore me like this.

83
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,932
When you find out who I am, you'll think,

84
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,402
"I shared a cell
with such a respectable..."

85
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,406
HYUN BIN AT THE ENTRANCE

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,576
HYUN BIN AT THE ENTRANCE

87
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,392
A-yeong!

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,494
You're so cold!

89
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,630
Why did you wander around in the rain?

90
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,898
It's been so long!

91
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,066
How have you been?

92
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,469
Was everything fine?
I missed you so much, girl!

93
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,372
What are you talking about?
I saw you earlier today.

94
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,342
You have ruined these good clothes.

95
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,309
Oh, my gosh.

96
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,545
Have I been running around in this?

97
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,713
What?

98
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,749
Never mind. Let's go inside.
I have so much to tell you.

99
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,862
What is all this?

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,365
What do you mean? You bought all of them.

101
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,299
I did?

102
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,604
Why didn't you say something?
You should have stopped me.

103
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,841
What's gotten into you?
How could I stop you?

104
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,743
The house was normal in the morning

105
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,745
but it'd turn to this when I get back.

106
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,214
And I did this without you knowing?

107
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,016
What is with you these days?

108
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,785
There's no place to even sit anymore.

109
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,289
You went all out with that chandelier.

110
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,492
I can't even open the fridge
because of this stupid table!

111
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,127
I'll get rid of it. Don't worry.

112
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,696
I can't believe him...

113
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,164
Hey, what are you doing?

114
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,166
What?

115
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,203
We agreed to change clothes
in our own rooms with the doors closed!

116
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,773
You said that I had poor manners
and that I needed to be taught by you!

117
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,174
I said that to you?

118
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,679
You told me not to air dry my underwear
where you can see them!

119
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,649
I went through so much trouble
blow drying them every night.

120
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,685
You wouldn't even scrub my back either!

121
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,688
How could you say
it was too dirty to scrub?

122
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,023
That's not what I meant.

123
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,692
That wasn't me who...

124
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,927
This is driving me nuts!

125
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,662
A-yeong!

126
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,198
That really wasn't me!

127
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,703
What did you just say?

128
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,605
Joo-won did what?

129
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:30,543
He beat a VVIP customer black and blue,
so he is being held at the police station.

130
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,878
"The police station"?

131
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,579
He got arrested?

132
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,315
That's not all.
He even changed his signature.

133
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,085
That has never happened
ever since the company was founded--

134
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,621
That grandson of mine still hasn't come
to his senses, has he?

135
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,892
It's about time to revise the will.

136
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,295
But for what reason?
Why would he beat up a customer?

137
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,798
There was some physical contact
between the customer and a female employee

138
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,567
and she overreacted--

139
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,536
That is such nonsense.

140
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,438
It's sexual harassment as long as

141
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,774
the victim feels harassed,

142
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,676
regardless of the situation.

143
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,746
Why would you say, "she overreacted"?

144
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,916
And a man should do nothing
after witnessing that?

145
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,685
No matter how you look at it,
Joo-won did the right thing.

146
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,953
Ma'am, it's not that--

147
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,087
Be quiet!

148
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,189
Leave if you're going to say
such nonsense.

149
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,158
Continue what you were doing, Mr. Moon.

150
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,862
Oh, right. I am doing it, see?

151
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,166
But, what exactly are you--

152
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,467
Oh, this?

153
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:33,039
Tomorrow is our 300th day anniversary.

154
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,842
She wanted some chocolate,
so, I am making it myself.

155
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,278
And he's doing this
in front of the person he's giving it to.

156
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,413
Oh, come on.

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,015
You know we don't have much time left.

158
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,620
If I can't see you while I do this,
I would rather not do it at all.

159
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,726
The color looks pretty good, doesn't it?

160
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,261
It does.

161
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,403
Ms. Moon!

162
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,739
Your son is apparently
at the police station.

163
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,708
Wait, where?

164
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,343
"The police station"?

165
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,111
Why is he there?

166
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,213
Yes,

167
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,616
we finally came to a settlement.

168
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,818
Wait, who?

169
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,553
President Kim?

170
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,957
He went home already.

171
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,393
I will give you the details tomorrow.

172
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,028
All right. Thank you.

173
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,932
-Mom already found out?
-It appears that Mr. Park dropped by.

174
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,900
She sounded very angry.

175
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,036
He really gets on my nerves.

176
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,145
Why are you standing next to me?

177
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,115
You should have parked the car
in front of me. Where is it?

178
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,483
What car?

179
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,885
We both rode the police car here.

180
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,787
What?

181
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,890
Then, what are we waiting here for?

182
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,558
Santa Claus?

183
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,695
You should have arranged
another car for me if mine isn't here!

184
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,330
People are staring at me!

185
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,198
They wouldn't if you stop yelling.

186
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,166
How dare you.

187
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,335
Have I been too nice to you lately?

188
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,905
So, now you want to talk back
whenever I am mean to you?

189
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,307
You're dead meat.

190
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,676
Umbrella.

191
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,844
I don't have one.

192
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,220
Would you like to share?

193
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,657
You will run through the rain,

194
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,026
and you will buy me a top-notch umbrella.

195
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,695
Or, you'll be dead meat.

196
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,048
You haven't changed one bit.

197
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,286
Ever since you came to me with that bag
that's worse than a garbage bag...

198
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,688
You haven't thought about me
for even five minutes.

199
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,829
Who is it?

200
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,497
It's me. Open up.

201
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,139
You got out quicker than I thought.

202
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,174
Is it because you're rich?

203
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,244
I can't stay long at a place
with horrible interior design.

204
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,950
But thanks to you, I have now started
interacting with the lower social class.

205
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,220
You did the wrongdoing,
but I got arrested.

206
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,789
But you bail on me
the moment we switch back?

207
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,227
Oh, my goodness!

208
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,661
President Kim!

209
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,263
Hey, you're here.

210
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,599
Eating at night again?

211
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,666
What?

212
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,036
Come inside.

213
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,005
You! Follow me outside.

214
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,944
Why is he here?

215
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,614
Is he here for me?

216
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,948
I'll be right back.

217
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,689
"Hey, you're here.

218
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
Come inside."

219
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,261
Didn't that sound a bit intimate?

220
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,897
It was a very intimate tone.

221
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,510
Tell me.

222
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,814
How does it feel to bail on me like that?

223
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,451
I'm sorry about that.

224
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,355
I was just so happy to be myself again.

225
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,659
I thought

226
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,261
we might switch again if we stayed close.

227
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,131
That's why I bailed. I'm sorry.

228
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,668
"We'll switch again if we stay close"?

229
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,002
Who said that?

230
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,173
That's just what I thought.

231
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,344
Then, we can't see each other from now on.

232
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,517
Wouldn't that be better
for the both of us?

233
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,856
And I'm sorry for using violence
while I was you.

234
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,560
But I would do the same thing
if that happened again.

235
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,363
The law

236
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,665
doesn't punish the rich after all.

237
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,806
It might take some time,
but I'll pay you back for the settlement.

238
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,507
Because it was my fault.

239
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,045
And take all those luxury items

240
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,981
out of my house.

241
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,683
Why are they luxury items?
They're basic necessities.

242
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,987
You have a weird way of saying thank you.

243
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,089
If you are done arguing, leave.

244
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,325
I am not here to argue with you.

245
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,528
Then, why are you here?

246
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,419
I came here to do this.

247
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,312
Congratulations...

248
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,348
on becoming Gil Ra-im again.

249
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,152
You too.

250
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,389
Paying back the settlement

251
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,024
is a good idea.

252
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,528
I love that you are taking responsibility.

253
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,199
Come to my office tomorrow.

254
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,302
Decide if you want to pay me all at once
or in installments.

255
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,104
I'll get going.

256
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,581
I left a top-notch umbrella
by your front door.

257
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,965
Why are you alone?

258
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,900
They all left a while ago.

259
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,802
Why didn't you go?

260
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,938
I need to clear myself of suspicion.

261
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,974
Things always get out of hand
if I don't clear things up.

262
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,311
Seeing that you know a lot of legal terms,

263
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,747
you must have your go-to police station.

264
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,416
Did you catch the culprit

265
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,917
who leaked your song?

266
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,188
Why don't you look
for the original songwriter?

267
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,490
What for?

268
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,492
I'll just get criticized for plagiarism.

269
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,264
I suppose that means
things are cleared up, then.

270
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,033
Where do you think you're going?

271
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,301
You're not off the hook yet.

272
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,570
Is there something wrong?

273
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,040
Do you personally know who leaked it?

274
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,375
You can't pin it on someone you know,

275
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,544
but someone must take the fall
to wrap it up.

276
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,279
Do you want me to take the fall?

277
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,347
Would you?

278
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,383
Scaredy cat.

279
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,052
It's raining a lot outside.

280
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,453
Just stay here for the night.

281
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,687
You don't even have a car.

282
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,324
I don't have the energy to put you back
to where I got you from.

283
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,593
Leave tomorrow morning.

284
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,002
Would you like dinner?

285
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,104
I'm fine, and just prepare some food
for him.

286
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,140
And please prepare a room
in the guest house.

287
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,055
What do you think?

288
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,590
There's no doubt.

289
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,992
This will be considered as a plagiarism.

290
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:14,960
I think so too.

291
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,362
We can't even consider it as a reference.

292
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,099
There must be some other artists
who got duped by this composer.

293
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,266
They're just not famous.

294
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,367
So, now what?

295
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,002
Isn't there any other way?

296
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,472
Unless the composer confesses,

297
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,906
there will be none.

298
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,342
It will be all over the media by tomorrow.

299
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,744
It looks like Oska will take the blame.

300
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,714
Did he really say that he had no idea?

301
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,082
How can you say that?

302
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,051
Do you think he did this on purpose?

303
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,353
He would never do such a thing.

304
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,491
Is there any way

305
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,694
to find out
who the original songwriter is?

306
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,365
Passcode is incorrect.

307
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,334
Darn that woman...

308
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,438
What the...

309
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,808
Right! My cell phone.

310
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,077
Such poor taste in men.

311
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,779
KIM MORON

312
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,483
"Moron"?

313
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,090
What?

314
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,625
This is Kim Moron.

315
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,161
Our phones seem to have changed.

316
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,629
So, I noticed.

317
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,631
Bring my phone tomorrow,

318
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,966
and what's the passcode to my house?

319
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,668
The passcode?

320
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,337
The passcode is...

321
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,675
I think I'm losing you!

322
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,611
Hello?

323
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,313
Hello?

324
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,887
The number you're trying to reach
is not available.

325
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,137
I'll try 30-27-32.

326
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,471
Wrong passcode.

327
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,540
Those are your measurements!

328
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,943
You have a new message.

329
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,113
I will give you a hint.

330
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,548
It has to do

331
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,816
with a constellation.

332
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,884
"A constellation"?

333
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,452
Stars?

334
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,890
Perhaps the beauty of my eyes owes itself

335
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,193
to the star before me

336
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,763
briefly visiting from the sky above.

337
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,435
If this is the right answer,

338
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,103
you're going to pay.

339
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,973
Okay, 76-08-18.

340
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,708
Door unlocked.

341
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,377
I'll get you for this!

342
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,550
I love it!

343
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,153
It's so awesome!

344
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,955
Home sweet home!

345
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,293
By the way,

346
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,062
nothing happened between us

347
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,098
these past few days, right?

348
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,805
Did I act in any way different or weird?

349
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,140
Like

350
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,342
when you were sleeping,

351
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,411
did I ever do something disturbing

352
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,446
or

353
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,648
freak you out or anything?

354
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,217
What's next?

355
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,020
You're really hurting my feelings.

356
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,190
You said the bed was yours,
and you made me sleep on the floor!

357
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,624
I made you sleep on the floor?

358
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,028
you have really changed.

359
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,897
It's not like you can afford any of this.

360
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,933
You think I don't know
Joo-won bought all of them?

361
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,837
And yet, you wouldn't even give me
three days to pay the rent.

362
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,773
I didn't?

363
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,275
You said all thieves start out small,

364
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,312
and that you like to be extra careful
about fiscal matters!

365
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,248
Why, that Joo-won...

366
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,817
A-yeong,

367
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,919
I didn't mean to do any of that.

368
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,187
I swear!

369
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,490
Whatever!
I have to wake up early tomorrow,

370
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,125
so, just set my alarm for 6 a.m.

371
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,626
Okay.

372
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,727
Don't worry.

373
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,629
I'll make sure you wake up.

374
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,937
PHOTOS

375
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,098
I came here to do this.

376
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,116
What am I Iike in your memories?

377
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,585
What was I

378
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,755
to you then?

379
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,154
Pity.

380
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,589
I feel so bad.

381
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,760
You're a has-been star to me...

382
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,531
but it appears you planned to marry me.

383
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,334
You're naiver than I thought.

384
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,202
How disappointing.

385
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,840
I was getting tired of you anyway.
You should have waited a bit longer.

386
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,841
Then,

387
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,345
at least we wouldn't have to end it
like this.

388
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,691
While our relationship
didn't end amicably,

389
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,561
it was not passionate enough
for us to be hung up about it.

390
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,063
We weren't in love.

391
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,165
At least, that's what I thought.

392
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,602
Who was that woman earlier,

393
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,672
the lowbrow woman whom Joo-won was with?

394
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,107
I told you to watch your mouth.

395
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,708
She is with me.

396
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,510
Do you not get what I mean?

397
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,612
I'm seeing her.

398
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,914
You're lying.

399
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,716
She isn't your type.

400
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,718
Neither were you.

401
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,662
Don't lie and say it was to protect me.

402
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,964
What you really wanted to protect

403
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,866
was yourself, wasn't it?

404
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,118
Long time no see.

405
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,386
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

406
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,387
It's not a joke.

407
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:33,959
You couldn't imagine
how far away I've been.

408
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,060
Are you drunk?

409
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,161
I know this sounds strange,

410
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,963
but you weren't

411
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,364
with the real me.

412
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,800
Are you

413
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,234
on drugs?

414
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:47,072
I'm guessing that I've been very sweet
to you for the past few days.

415
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,208
Just know that I meant none of it,
so, erase it from your memory.

416
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,077
I told you that I'm not in the mood
for jokes.

417
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,045
Just leave me alone if you're here
out of boredom.

418
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,181
Is it because your song got leaked?

419
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,049
Did you stop it?

420
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,319
How can I stop the internet?

421
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,521
And if the plagiarism story breaks...

422
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,689
Then, what happens?

423
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,626
I'll be known as a plagiarizer.

424
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,337
Hello. This is Gil Ra-im.

425
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,374
How did everything go?

426
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,809
Don't worry too much.

427
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,078
Everything will be fine.

428
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,446
How did she know my number?

429
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:29,881
Who is it?

430
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:30,949
None of your business.

431
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,084
I'm fine.

432
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,020
I believe things will turn out fine too.

433
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,421
Thank you

434
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,889
for your concern!

435
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:44,896
NEW MESSAGE

436
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,098
I'M FINE. I BELIEVE THE SAME.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERNS!

437
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,067
Oh, wow.

438
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,102
So, she went through my contacts, huh?

439
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,137
What?

440
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:54,839
That was Ra-im, right?

441
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,877
I thought you seemed strange recently.
Are you a psychic now?

442
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,312
I know a thing or two
about how women are on the inside.

443
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,248
Quick question, though.

444
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,217
Why do your fans wear socks
with your face on them?

445
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,921
Do you like your face being stuffed
inside dirty, sweaty shoes?

446
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:10,855
Why?

447
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,624
Does Ra-im wear my socks?

448
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:13,825
Are you crazy?

449
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,627
Why would she do such a thing?

450
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,663
Her feelings for you aren't serious.

451
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,900
If you ask which celebrity she likes,

452
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,269
she will think for three seconds

453
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,339
before saying, "Oska?"

454
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,741
Bye.

455
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,809
But wait.

456
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,245
Why aren't you wearing
that glittery jacket nowadays?

457
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,681
Never mention that jacket again.

458
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,451
I'm switching to a brand
that hasn't been launched in Korea yet.

459
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,252
I'm sure

460
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,588
whatever I wear will start showing up
in stores anyway.

461
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,727
You really need to call Ji-hyeon.
You're getting weirder and weirder!

462
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,637
-We're preparing to sue the songwriter!
-We really had no idea.

463
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,772
PLAGIARIZED TITLE SONG LEAKED?

464
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,541
How should I know where he is?

465
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,976
I told you that we had no idea.

466
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,245
We are the real victims here.

467
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,680
Yes.

468
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,448
What do you mean, "intentional"?

469
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,349
Hello--

470
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,017
Yes.

471
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,853
Hey, what are you doing?

472
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,790
Why are you answering every phone call?

473
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,058
Then, should I do nothing?

474
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,026
With all the plagiarism articles
out there?

475
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,496
We knew that this would happen.

476
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,532
Does that make it okay?
Should we just sit back and watch?

477
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,102
At least, I'd get to be the top trending
term in the Internet for a change.

478
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,570
This isn't the time for jokes.

479
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,206
What did Seul say? Why did she do it?

480
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,510
I'm wondering about that too.

481
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,311
What do you mean? You didn't see her?

482
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,580
What about our autograph session today?

483
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,082
We have to do it, of course!

484
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,417
An autograph session during this crisis?

485
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,386
That's exactly why you can't cancel it.

486
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,422
If you don't show up,
you're admitting to plagiarism.

487
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,391
I'll take care of the press,

488
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,293
so, just get dressed up
and autograph your heart out.

489
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,095
I'll release a rebuttal article

490
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,530
saying that we are the victims here.

491
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,831
Who would believe that?

492
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,666
It's not for that reason.

493
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,036
We halted the music video for a song
that's not out yet. What's the problem?

494
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,638
People don't care about facts.

495
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,040
If it's gotten this bad,

496
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,643
I am already a plagiarizer.

497
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,745
Cancel the event.

498
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,146
Hey!

499
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,414
Where are you going?

500
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,049
Hey!

501
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,251
Unless you want severance pay this month,

502
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,053
make sure he sticks to the schedule. Okay?

503
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,656
He always makes me do the hard stuff.

504
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:25,990
What?

505
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,797
Where did Oska throw away my phone?
It was new, too.

506
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,034
I'm serious!

507
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,937
He said, "I'm the CEO.
What are you going to do about it?"

508
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,773
And he punched the pervert
right in the face.

509
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,175
It was so awesome!

510
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,111
I got in trouble for clapping so much.

511
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,213
Really?

512
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,616
I missed you so much, girl!

513
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,352
Oh, my!

514
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,721
I'm sorry.

515
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,591
I have so much to tell you,

516
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,360
but I'm going crazy because I can't.

517
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,566
Seung-mi didn't show up today.

518
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,935
The boss told her to take a few days off.

519
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,104
He even bought some toys for her daughter.

520
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,472
Seriously?

521
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,876
How could a person change so suddenly?

522
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,246
Maybe he finally understands
the plight of his employees.

523
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,314
Perhaps due to

524
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,949
the power of his love for someone.

525
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,217
"The power of love"?

526
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,686
Who is that "someone"?

527
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,055
I'm not sure...

528
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,592
The boss is here. Hurry on out!

529
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,860
Let's go.

530
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,030
What's with everyone?

531
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,466
You defeated a villain yesterday,
and now you're their hero.

532
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,269
Such love for violence...

533
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,638
What?

534
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,539
KIM JOO-WON

535
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,473
He started

536
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,242
taking the escalators again?

537
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,176
Yes,

538
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,478
and he didn't greet any of the employees.

539
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,981
What is he up to?

540
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,051
What's with him and all the changes?

541
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,486
Maybe he's using
advanced psychological warfare

542
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,854
to cloud our judgment.

543
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,956
"Psychological warfare"?

544
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,024
But wait.

545
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,759
But what judgment of ours

546
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,928
is he attempting to cloud?

547
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:48,499
Well, he told us to gather in his office,
so, it might be best to go and find out.

548
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,600
Of course.

549
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,602
But wait.

550
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,237
What would be

551
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,740
the most spiteful line
I could say to him today?

552
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,976
I wrote a few down...

553
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,829
Why are you looking at me like that?

554
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,532
Does something displease you?

555
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,837
Do you find me pleasing?

556
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,038
Pardon me?

557
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,773
Do you have time after work?

558
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,142
This is confidential,

559
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,479
but I'd like to discuss with you
some personnel changes for next year.

560
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,047
With me, sir?

561
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,015
Why?

562
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,983
Are you tired of me relying on you?

563
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,520
Of course, not.

564
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,791
First, I'm thinking of firing A-yeong
from the VVIP lounge. What do you think?

565
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,593
But, sir...

566
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,961
What's wrong?

567
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,162
Are you her boyfriend?

568
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,197
You aren't dating.

569
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,167
I'm sure you may have seen each other
in passing. So, what's wrong?

570
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,635
There's nothing between us...

571
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,838
but the thing is,

572
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,541
-I mean--
-Save the details for tonight.

573
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,078
Bring me all the delayed work.

574
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,382
There isn't any.

575
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,786
You signed everything last time.

576
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:15,887
I did?

577
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,789
I approved everything?

578
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,090
They're on your desk, sir.

579
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,796
CEO KIM JOO-WON

580
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,731
Why on earth didn't you stop me?

581
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,367
Is saying, "Don't do that, sir,"
that hard?

582
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,735
This is a heart!

583
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,837
I was surprised when I first saw it,

584
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,573
but I thought you just changed it
to look pretty.

585
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,711
CEO KIM JOO-WON

586
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,894
May I ask...

587
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,630
whose idea

588
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,100
the Christmas event was?

589
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,938
It was from our planning department.

590
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,743
"A blizzard of free gifts for couples
if it snows on Christmas Eve..."

591
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,646
And because we have
the same events every year,

592
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,815
the range of what we can do
is narrower than expected.

593
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,717
Is that why you brought me this idea?

594
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,352
It's too late now, sir.

595
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,288
You've already signed the papers.

596
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,924
So, didn't you just notice
my embarrassed look

597
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,661
and how extra polite I was
when I asked whose idea it was?

598
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,500
Randomly giving the winners gift cards

599
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,503
if it snows on Christmas Eve
is nice and simple.

600
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:39,537
But,

601
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:43,641
do we really need to do
these cliché events like everyone else?

602
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,244
Why is it always an event for couples?

603
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,315
What about singles who want to spend money
on Christmas, but have no place to do so?

604
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,384
Can't we target them instead?

605
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,920
There aren't many singles these days.

606
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,255
Are you single, Mr. Park?

607
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,790
I have a wife, sir.

608
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,225
You see?

609
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,795
I know a woman who's chic and cool,
but she's single, too.

610
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,465
The words to bring joy to those singles...

611
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,235
"Let it pour on Christmas."

612
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,874
If it rains on Christmas,
the grand prize winner

613
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,143
gets a parcel of the Bisong Resort.

614
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,511
A surprise event!

615
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,612
-What?
-What?

616
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:23,881
Sir,

617
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,517
a parcel of the Bisong Resort
costs over 70 million won--

618
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,286
I didn't ask you to stop me on this.

619
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,957
Is it more likely to snow or rain
on Christmas?

620
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,259
Why, snow, of course.

621
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,863
No, it is most likely
that neither will happen.

622
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:43,167
Then, snow.
After that, both snow and rain together.

623
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,635
And lastly, rain.

624
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,872
The slimmer the chances,
the more exciting it gets.

625
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:48,839
Why?

626
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,043
The lower the chances,
the greater the prize.

627
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,048
I guess you have to work late again.

628
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,692
LEAKED SONG AND PLAGIARISM
CONTROVERSY FOR OSKA

629
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,332
When did you come?

630
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,200
You said you wouldn't come
for a few days...

631
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,236
I'm just frustrated.

632
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,937
Did anything happen?

633
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,472
Yesterday,

634
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,141
Oska came by...

635
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:25,776
Here?

636
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,044
Why?

637
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,115
I'm not sure, but he was really angry
and kept looking for you.

638
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,883
Angry?

639
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,564
I heard that you'd be gone for a few days.

640
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,834
-No, it's not that--
-At first, I thought so.

641
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,036
But I had to take care of some things.

642
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,739
What is it?

643
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,841
We need to talk.
Please give us some privacy.

644
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,422
What is it?

645
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,624
Do you have time to be here

646
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,126
with all those articles out?

647
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,994
-Was it you?
-What?

648
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,963
The original leaker's IP address is here.

649
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,867
So, are you the leaker?

650
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,803
Are you...

651
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,339
suspecting me now?

652
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,940
You must have some sort of conscience...

653
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,410
seeing as your face has turned pale.

654
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:34,912
Why did you do it?

655
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,281
Because I ruined the music video?

656
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,749
Or,

657
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,551
was it to gain my attention

658
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,720
because I don't show interest in you
like I did before?

659
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,189
You didn't come to check.

660
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,660
You truly believe
that it was me who did it.

661
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,962
But,

662
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,399
-I am not desperate enough to do that.
-No.

663
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,935
You can do anything with ease.

664
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:01,572
You betrayed me
and ran off with the guy I hated the most.

665
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,875
You're capable of marrying my cousin
just to get back at me.

666
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,446
Wouldn't this be too easy
compared to what you have done?

667
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,720
I'm flattered that you overestimate me.

668
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,789
So, thank you.

669
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,458
But just sue me.

670
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,527
I have nothing more to say,

671
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,795
so, go ahead and sue me.

672
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,599
You wouldn't believe anything I say.

673
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,502
You never have.

674
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,838
You always...

675
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,807
believed other people over me.

676
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,577
Maybe what they said was more accurate.

677
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,514
Despite your feigned ignorance,
the police traced the IP address

678
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,516
to here.

679
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,693
Do me a favor.

680
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,461
Please...

681
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,164
let's never meet again.

682
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,018
Didn't you download a video
on the director's computer

683
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,721
a few days ago during a meeting?

684
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,688
Yes.

685
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,223
Wasn't that site

686
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,792
peer to peer?

687
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:28,993
Yes.

688
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,461
Are you crazy?

689
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,763
Oska's new song was on a shareable folder!

690
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,999
-Oh, no!
-How could you...

691
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,303
Just stay quiet for now.
Or else we're all dead. Understood?

692
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,636
-Isn't that Oska?
-There's an outrage over his plagiarism.

693
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,211
Get up.

694
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,546
People are staring at you. Come on.

695
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,618
And what about the autograph session?

696
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,941
Oh, hey!

697
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,809
Hello, everyone!

698
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,449
Hey, what's wrong?

699
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,653
How have you been?

700
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,788
I really missed all of you.

701
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:38,789
What the heck?

702
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,457
Did we do something wrong?

703
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:41,759
Not at all.

704
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,461
Anyway, you were all worried
about me, right?

705
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,564
Well, you don't have to anymore.

706
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,766
I am perfectly fine now.

707
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,701
Are you sure about that?

708
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,038
I'm going to say hello to the director.

709
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,943
Why is she so happy all of a sudden?
It's creepy.

710
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,312
I am worried

711
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,613
that she might be bipolar.

712
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,365
Director Lim,

713
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,667
you've just been caught.

714
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,338
You have feelings for me.

715
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,007
Then, let me ask for a favor.

716
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,811
I'll pretend I didn't find out.

717
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,215
So, don't ever tell me that you like me.

718
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,235
Director!

719
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:03,540
I'm back! I'm back again, Director!

720
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,551
You're back from what?

721
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,820
The explanation is a bit complicated.

722
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,288
But the important thing is

723
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,091
that I won't be weird again.

724
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,427
Not anymore. Not ever.

725
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,830
I apologize for my previous behavior.

726
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,167
I read the script you sent me.

727
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,403
But it's all in English,

728
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,105
so, I think I'll need your help.

729
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,540
What do you mean?

730
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,109
Surprisingly, you did way better
than I thought you would.

731
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,244
I did?

732
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:46,617
You can just think that
it wasn't the real me at that time.

733
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:51,321
After finishing the script analysis,
I am going to plan my concept of the demo.

734
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,458
I would appreciate it
if you took a look at it.

735
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,994
I'll go practice now.

736
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,665
Oh, right...

737
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,236
Thank you very much.

738
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,105
For what?

739
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,842
For entering the giveaway.

740
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,257
Report.

741
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,563
This is the data you requested.

742
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,132
President Kim came to work today.

743
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,469
From home or elsewhere?

744
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,070
From home.

745
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,873
Good.

746
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,043
Wait,

747
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,344
what are these?

748
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,747
It seems she spent all the money

749
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,749
that you gave her
on the day she received it.

750
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,450
What?

751
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,386
So, that brat knows how to spend money.

752
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,422
Hold on.

753
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,226
This can't possibly
be a stuntwoman's taste.

754
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,062
This isn't an average case.

755
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,933
Find out specifically who her parents are,
and where and how she grew up.

756
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,968
Yes, ma'am.

757
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,786
I can't go on. It's too much.

758
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,654
It's killing me.

759
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,989
After being absent for a few days,

760
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,724
why do you suddenly overdo it?

761
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,826
I can't go any further.

762
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:36,960
We must.

763
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:41,598
I have to film my audition demo video,
but my body is all stiff and out of shape.

764
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,167
It's a catastrophe.

765
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,301
Please, help me out.

766
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,836
Are you trying to confuse us?

767
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,539
Did Mr. Money-maker dump you?

768
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,407
No more fancy clothes, I see.

769
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,309
Did you come again for another try?

770
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,346
I thought you said you quit.
I thought you'd rather use your brain.

771
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,415
Why? Did your brain stop working again?

772
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,351
Did you just let me say those things?

773
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:02,920
Why didn't you just kill me?

774
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,121
Can I still kill you now?

775
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,522
It's too late.

776
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,424
Ready? Here I go.

777
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,360
We should kill her now.

778
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,540
Can I help you?

779
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,442
Are you an actress?

780
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,543
No,

781
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,711
I didn't come to learn.

782
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,113
I asked if you were an actress.

783
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,215
What?

784
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,219
I'm not even that pretty,

785
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,020
but I hear that often.

786
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,758
Do you work here?

787
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,828
If so, do you know who Gil Ra-im is?

788
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,364
What do you need her for?

789
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,632
Watch out!

790
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,439
Are you okay?

791
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:56,707
Who was that?

792
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,109
Which one of you was being so careless?

793
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,711
Did you just

794
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,346
save me?

795
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,348
Well, I couldn't let you get hurt.

796
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,850
I don't believe this.

797
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,256
In a situation like this
when a man saves a woman,

798
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,826
shouldn't you have pulled me towards you,
taken the hit for me,

799
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,596
or jumped in the air
and catch it spectacularly?

800
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,300
Or at least something similar?

801
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,937
How could you just push my head
to the ground like that?

802
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,305
I had to think fast.

803
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,008
You could've broken a bone if you got hit.

804
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,777
I apologize.

805
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,648
Our director lacks such common sense.

806
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,018
My name is Hwang Jeong-hwan.

807
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,421
Haven't we met before?

808
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,225
You're right.

809
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,893
Have you ever studied in New York?

810
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,794
What?

811
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,296
No...

812
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,098
Then, where was it?

813
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,302
I remember now!

814
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,137
The boulevard in Sinsa-dong.

815
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,572
I'm Kim Hui-won, Joo-won's little sister.

816
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,242
Kim Joo-won?

817
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,912
If she's Mr. Money-maker's sister,
then, she must also--

818
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,418
But what brings you here?

819
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,254
So, are you Gil Ra-im?

820
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,091
-Did you come here to see me?
-Yes.

821
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,362
But this isn't the place,
so, let's go somewhere else.

822
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,665
Excuse me.

823
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,170
I usually don't ask this
to people I just met,

824
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,307
but are you married?

825
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,111
You guys look good together.

826
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,679
Not bad!

827
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:46,883
What's his blood type?

828
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:49,786
Maybe, type A?

829
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,722
What about his zodiac sign?

830
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,760
-His birthday is mid-April, so--
-Aries!

831
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,795
People of that type

832
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:03,900
are quiet, serious, adventurous
and competitive.

833
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,970
And they're passionate about what they do.

834
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,372
Is that true?

835
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,375
Yes, pretty much...

836
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,743
I see.

837
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,579
By the way,

838
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,582
I heard the others call him "Director"...

839
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,516
Yes,

840
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,184
he's our martial arts director.

841
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:22,719
Really?

842
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,221
He's the director?

843
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,790
Excuse me, but...

844
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,459
Did you come just to ask that?

845
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,030
Oh, I forgot. I'm like this sometimes.

846
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,968
Well, I was curious about something,
and I wanted to tip you off too.

847
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:39,870
First,

848
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,472
what kind of relationship do you have

849
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:44,374
with my brother and U-yeong?

850
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,650
I'm not in any relationship
with either of them.

851
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,320
If you're going to ask me questions
with obvious answers,

852
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:58,922
don't ever come again--

853
00:50:58,989 --> 00:50:59,990
Wait a second.

854
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,759
Do you really have nothing
going on with my brother?

855
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,296
Then, why did you accept my mom's money?

856
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,766
-"Money"?
-I heard that you met her.

857
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,968
I heard she gave you money,

858
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,271
and you spent all of it on that same day.

859
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,345
So, I accepted an envelope full of money?

860
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,882
I'm sorry to ask this,
but how much was it?

861
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,219
Didn't you even check before spending it?

862
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,222
Wow, you're pretty cool.

863
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,124
Anyway,

864
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,359
my mom is keeping tabs on you.

865
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,395
I wanted to let you know.

866
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,665
Why would you do that?

867
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,468
I'm somewhat the most normal one
in my family.

868
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,371
My brother is like my mom,
and I'm like my dad.

869
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,443
GIL RA-IM

870
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,682
-Hello?
-Do you know what time it is?

871
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:02,319
I told you to bring me my cell phone.
Why aren't you bringing it?

872
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,522
All right, I'm going right now,

873
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,824
so, don't go anywhere!

874
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,502
Are you glaring at me right now?

875
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,803
What for?

876
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,806
I'm the one who should be mad.

877
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,509
Do you know how long it took me
to get the passcode?

878
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,711
And, what? "Kim Moron"?

879
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,045
What do you mean by that?

880
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,482
Is it because of the track jacket?

881
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,988
Geez. Would you stop glaring at me?

882
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,524
You went through my cell phone, too.

883
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,660
Who gave you permission to do that?
Do you want to meet my lawyer?

884
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:44,561
Yes,

885
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:45,762
I want to.

886
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,064
Let me finally meet him.

887
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,134
I think I should meet your lawyer
and your mother

888
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,803
to tell them that it wasn't me
who accepted the money.

889
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,705
What do you think?

890
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,873
Did you meet my mom?

891
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,309
Is that so important?

892
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:03,547
I found out that you accepted the money
that your mom offered

893
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,249
to stop me from meeting you at all.

894
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,884
You would have found out anyway.

895
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,321
Yes, I accepted it. So, what?

896
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,356
"So, what?"

897
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,160
Why, you no-good woman.

898
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,728
Use words!

899
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:23,633
Why do you think God gave us language?
So that we can communicate with words!

900
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,335
Do you ever think?

901
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,103
How could you accept that money?

902
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,840
Do you think I have no pride at all
because I'm poor?

903
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,809
How do you think accepting it
would make me look?

904
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,244
How could you accept that money?

905
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,480
How poorly did you think of me to do that?

906
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,848
Of course, you have to accept it.

907
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,984
It throws people off more when you say,

908
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,520
"I want more" than "I can't accept this."

909
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,522
What?

910
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,757
I wanted you to beat my mom.

911
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,162
I didn't want her to underestimate
and look down on you.

912
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,966
I was actually glad
that I met her on your behalf.

913
00:53:56,333 --> 00:54:00,604
If it were you, you would have apologized
at least 100 times before leaving.

914
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,173
Do you think my mom would've praised you

915
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,675
for choosing pride over money?

916
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,811
She'd never do that.

917
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,548
Either way,
the result would have been the same.

918
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,984
We'd still see each other.

919
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,652
On what grounds?

920
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,388
Because I just said so.

921
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,196
You're mistaken.

922
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:30,200
I don't ever want to see you again.

923
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,203
I don't know how much it was,

924
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,640
but apologize to your mother
and refund it.

925
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,850
And tell her

926
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,552
that since there's nothing going on
between us,

927
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,454
she has nothing to worry about.

928
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,056
Why is there nothing between us?

929
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,191
You can't be so certain

930
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,626
because there's definitely something.

931
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,295
Right, there is.

932
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,698
Your favorite, The Little Mermaid.

933
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,869
You told me to think about it, so, I did.

934
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:07,771
But,

935
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,673
I didn't deserve it.

936
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,742
Do you know why?

937
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,944
At least, the little mermaid...

938
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,447
loved her prince.

939
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,884
Get off.

940
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,421
I said, get off.

941
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,465
Are you really sending these back?

942
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,235
Yes. I'll start with these first.

943
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,237
Why, all of a sudden?

944
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,505
Did you fight

945
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,039
with Joo-won?

946
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,407
Basically.

947
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,276
Put these in the box for me.

948
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,544
Really?

949
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,045
Why did you fight?

950
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,847
Was it

951
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,115
because of me?

952
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,218
What are you talking about?

953
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:43,753
How could it be because of you?

954
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,591
Oh, no. It must be because of me...

955
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,760
TONE-DEAF ARTIST
KING OF CASANOVAS

956
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,395
What in the world?

957
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,163
Who did this?

958
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,699
What do you mean? It was you.

959
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,169
You stayed up all night
to dig Oska's eyes out.

960
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,007
He is such a pervert!

961
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:24,527
FROM THE DIRTY CLOTHING.

962
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,264
SECRET PLACE TO SEE OSKA!

963
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,070
SECRET PLACE TO SEE OSKA!
OSKA'S DANCE STUDIO, A MUST-GO PLACE

964
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,877
HOUSE, A LIBRARY-LIKE STUDY,
OSKA, EMPLOYEES' HOUSE!

965
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,982
MR. NO-GOOD JOO-WON'S HOUSE!

966
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,170
Are you crazy?

967
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,038
With the leaked song
and the plagiarism issue,

968
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,774
a comeback at a time like this?
That's ridiculous!

969
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,744
I know it doesn't make sense.
But what does these days?

970
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,215
So, why did you cancel
the autograph session?

971
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,352
We will lose everything
if you keep holding off.

972
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:25,321
We'll have wasted everything we spent on
the lyrics, composer, choreography,

973
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,823
production, recording, and music video!

974
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,891
Okay, fine. I understand how you feel.

975
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,160
But is it easy to convince the public?

976
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,030
We need to catch the plagiarizer
and deal with that issue first.

977
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:37,367
He'll be back this week,
so, just focus on your schedule.

978
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,335
We're innocent!

979
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,771
We need to show
that we have nothing to be ashamed of!

980
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,806
We may be innocent,

981
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,176
but we're also ignorant fools
who didn't know a song was plagiarized.

982
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:51,047
And without a title song,
what comeback can I make?

983
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,049
There's the follow-up track
that you practiced.

984
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,817
The dance is complete
and you practiced enough!

985
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:55,785
What's the problem?

986
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,587
We'll release it

987
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,155
as a digital single.

988
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,391
"A digital single"?

989
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:02,992
Are you seriously telling me

990
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,227
to release a digital single?

991
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,662
Dong-kyu,

992
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:06,963
I am a Korean wave star.

993
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,965
How can I release
something so embarrassing?

994
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,267
Then, what?

995
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,203
Your Christmas concert is finished
unless you start working now!

996
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,074
We already paid for the venue.
How will you fill up all those seats?

997
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,144
We're done for if we flop
on both the album and the concert.

998
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,312
At least, you have your inheritance.

999
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:24,514
But what about me?

1000
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,182
What about Jong-heon?

1001
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,318
Damn it!

1002
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,689
Reporters will be all over me...

1003
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,660
Love is all just a lie

1004
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,696
I need to forget it all

1005
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,297
I need to erase it all

1006
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:45,435
The part of you that I loved so much

1007
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:49,072
I need to let it go now
I need to push away now

1008
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,643
It's time for me to live without you now

1009
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,046
You're such a bad woman
The woman who left me

1010
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:01,317
Even if I see you again
You'll still hurt me then

1011
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:05,088
You're such a bad woman
The woman who left me

1012
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:09,358
This is the end of our relationship

1013
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:12,495
Let me go away, love is not the way

1014
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:16,866
No more love for me, no more tears for me

1015
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:20,169
Let me go away, love is not the way

1016
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:24,841
No more regrets for me
Nothing more to look back on now

1017
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,179
He's coming out!

1018
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,814
We have some questions!

1019
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,149
Mr. Oska!

1020
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,352
Don't say anything. Not even a word!

1021
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:37,587
All right.

1022
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,523
Your issues have not been resolved.
Why are you promoting?

1023
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,092
-We believe in you, Oska!
-Be strong!

1024
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,660
I love you, Oska!

1025
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,096
Mr. Oska, over here!

1026
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,400
Are you admitting to plagiarism
by promoting your follow-up track instead?

1027
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,037
When will the songwriter
be returning to Korea?

1028
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,572
Say something, Mr. Oska!

1029
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,341
-Give us an answer, Mr. Oska!
-Mr. Oska!

1030
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,276
Mr. Oska!

1031
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,578
Were you wrongfully accused?

1032
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,081
Do you plan to have
an official press conference?

1033
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,249
Look this way, please.

1034
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,451
I need a response, please.

1035
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,554
Are you admitting to plagiarism
by removing your title song?

1036
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,123
-Are you, sir?
-Are you admitting to it?

1037
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,805
OSKA

1038
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:34,744
Hello?

1039
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,619
Aren't you busy?

1040
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:44,520
Not at all.

1041
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,755
After my controversies...

1042
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:50,760
You're lucky to have
a one-on-one fan meeting with me.

1043
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,562
You're lucky too

1044
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,832
that your fan at the fan meeting
just happens to be pretty.

1045
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,404
Gil Ra-im,

1046
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,773
you really are quite something.

1047
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,941
I suppose...

1048
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:08,945
Did you come to see my show?

1049
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:12,949
I was a bit worried,

1050
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,851
and I wanted to hear you sing too.

1051
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,787
You were the best ever today!

1052
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,388
And your voice didn't crack...

1053
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,523
Right?

1054
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,561
I really fall for people
who recognize my skills.

1055
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,597
Congratulations on your seventh album!

1056
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:31,167
I know it must be hard,
but thank you for being brave.

1057
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:33,970
You saw, right?

1058
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,573
The fans are still staying strong,

1059
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,275
so, be strong!

1060
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:42,979
Well,

1061
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,882
compared to other fans, Oska fans...

1062
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,885
know how to endure things better.

1063
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:55,524
Why?

1064
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,126
What do you have to endure?

1065
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,062
Your countless scandals

1066
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:01,430
with women?

1067
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,270
But

1068
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,672
it's better than scandals
with men though, right?

1069
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,212
It's hot!

1070
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,325
High places like this

1071
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,960
have the best night view.

1072
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,496
The lights in each and every alley
are so nice.

1073
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:35,464
This neighborhood is quite picturesque.

1074
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:37,900
Thank you for driving me home.

1075
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,669
-Go on inside.
-Okay.

1076
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,042
Is everything all right

1077
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:47,677
with Director Yoon?

1078
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,781
The day you left her on the expressway,

1079
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,117
she cried the entire way back...

1080
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,889
I know it's none of my business,

1081
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,526
but a man who makes a woman cry

1082
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:05,962
is a bad man...

1083
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,901
I'm sorry.

1084
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,469
I shouldn't have--

1085
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:14,870
Twenty-five years ago,

1086
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,106
I was ten years old.

1087
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,376
Fifteen years ago, twenty.

1088
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,545
Five years ago, thirty.

1089
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,347
And then

1090
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,748
five more years passed.

1091
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,150
But I still feel

1092
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:29,952
like a ten-year-old.

1093
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,322
Why am I still such a child?

1094
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,728
You're not a child.

1095
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,030
A real child

1096
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,699
would say that he's an adult.

1097
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,840
You really seem to be

1098
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,808
a lot cooler

1099
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,177
than what I thought at first.

1100
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,333
What a sight.

1101
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,760
