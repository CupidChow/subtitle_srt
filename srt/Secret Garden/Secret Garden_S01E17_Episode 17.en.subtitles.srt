1
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,295
Is what you just said

2
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,065
really true?

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,569
Did my dad...

4
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,207
Was the man who saved Kim Joo-won

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,611
really my father?

6
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,079
You said it yourself.

7
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,049
That your father saved many lives.

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,218
Joo-won just happened to be one of them.

9
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,255
Don't try to attach any meaning to it.

10
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,737
I'll compensate you with money.

11
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,639
I'll compensate you with more than enough.

12
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,441
I'll compensate you
with as much as you ask.

13
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,044
So please,
don't drag Joo-won down because of this.

14
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,679
Please

15
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,948
let him go now.

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,651
I beg you.

17
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,020
Please.

18
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,589
I will do whatever you want.

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,793
Whatever it is, I'll give you more.
Please...

20
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,863
Just not Joo-won.

21
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,631
He is not for you.

22
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,200
Please.

23
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,136
Please. I beg you.

24
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,578
Answer me.

25
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,747
Don't you see me begging you?

26
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,288
I just said I would compensate you.

27
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,891
I will compensate you
for your father's death.

28
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,693
You just saw how low I stooped.

29
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,862
If I were you,
I would agree just to get rid of me!

30
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,131
How could you still be crying?

31
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,169
Do you wish to know what it feels like
to truly lose everything?

32
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,305
Don't let your father's life go to waste.

33
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,008
End things with Joo-won
without hurting him.

34
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,577
Once you've ended it,

35
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,646
come to me for your money.

36
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,092
Dad.

37
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,427
Dad.

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,365
Dad.

39
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,169
Dad.

40
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,505
Dad!

41
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,146
Dad!

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,290
You're Mr. Tough Guy, aren't you?

43
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,992
That's why Director Lim likes me.

44
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,661
Hey, Joo-won.

45
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,629
What are you doing here
at this ungodly hour?

46
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,665
This ungodly hour is the perfect time
to see my Ra-im.

47
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,935
Why isn't she here?
Isn't the shoot over yet?

48
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,803
Did Ra-im have a shoot?

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,905
Not that I know of.

50
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,440
What do you mean?

51
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,509
I heard there was an additional scene.

52
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,710
Is that true?

53
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,346
Then we would've known about it.

54
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,920
Stop crying.

55
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,124
Gil Ra-im!

56
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,427
I think President Kim is here.

57
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,463
I'll go wash my face.

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,466
Don't say anything. Okay?

59
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,403
Geez, you dummy.

60
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,508
Hello, sir.

61
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,279
Is Ra-im here?

62
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,748
She's in the bathroom. Come in.

63
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,421
What are you doing here all of a sudden?

64
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,458
Did you do well at the shoot?

65
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,892
I have to if I want to get paid.

66
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,429
What are you doing here at this hour?

67
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,332
Shouldn't you offer me tea
or something first?

68
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,702
I'm so forgetful.
Would you like a hot cup of green tea?

69
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,437
-Do you have coffee?
-Sure.

70
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,207
What about fruit? Do you have fruit?

71
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,776
We don't have fruit...

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,810
Then I'll have that.

73
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,480
Don't just stand there. Go buy some.

74
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,048
We told you we don't have any.

75
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,917
I'll go buy some. You guys can talk.

76
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,787
Stay, A-yeong.
I need to ask you about Mr. Kim.

77
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,455
What about him?

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,524
What kind of fruit?

79
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,659
Anything tropical.

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,703
-It's about Ra-im actually.
-Excuse me?

81
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,940
Ra-im left during the middle of our date
saying she had to go to an urgent shoot.

82
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,676
But there was no shoot.

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,111
I just checked with the action school.

84
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,382
Where did Ra-im go
after lying about the shoot?

85
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,817
I'm not sure.

86
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,854
I came home and she was here.

87
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,890
I doubt that.

88
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,560
It's probably because it's the anniversary
of her father's death today.

89
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,363
She's usually down on this day.

90
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,598
Is that what she told you to tell me?

91
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,437
Where is the nearest fruit vendor?

92
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,119
Why are you crying?

93
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,421
You can't cry after lying.

94
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,857
You lied that there was a shoot,

95
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,459
and now you're crying out here
in the cold!

96
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,597
Did my mom come by again? Is that why?

97
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,001
Tell me.

98
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,871
She did, didn't she?

99
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,439
It's not that.

100
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,142
It's not that...

101
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,215
It's just that the prices
have gone up so much.

102
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,184
There's nothing to buy.

103
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,421
Why did you have to ask
for such expensive fruit?

104
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,956
I'm broke.

105
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,692
Why ask for expensive fruit?

106
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,660
Stop crying!

107
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,497
Don't you know how much uglier
an ugly person is when they cry?

108
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,378
Your face is ice cold.

109
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,689
You know this is expensive, right?

110
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,860
Never forget how expensive this scarf
around your neck is.

111
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,799
I'll buy the fruit next time, so go home.

112
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,915
Don't think about anything,
and just go to sleep.

113
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,919
Where are you going?

114
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,490
You're not going to tell me,
so I'm going to find the person that will.

115
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,728
Don't. I told you it's not that.

116
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,598
It's not!

117
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,666
Please don't.

118
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,212
She went to Ra-im's house, didn't she?

119
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,781
Answer me.

120
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,285
I can't beat the answer out of someone
who works for Mom.

121
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
She went to Ra-im's house, right?

122
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,556
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything.

123
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:49,028
I just said I couldn't beat the answer
out of you in a very intimidating way.

124
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,731
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything.

125
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,974
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

126
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,844
Where is my mom now?

127
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,380
She had a lot on her mind,
so she went to Hong Kong.

128
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,282
And yet you didn't go with her.

129
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,316
Excuse me?

130
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,686
-Well, I--
-It's fine.

131
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,890
I'm guessing she doesn't wish to see me.
Tell her that is fine with me.

132
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,827
Tell her that I'll do as I please now.

133
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,064
If she's already listening,
then that's even better.

134
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,710
Look how smart he is.

135
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,346
He takes after me.

136
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,849
Have someone follow the girl
24 hours a day.

137
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,452
He says he'll do as he pleases,

138
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,487
so I should at least watch.

139
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:49,822
Yes, madam.

140
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,895
Han Tae-seon is leaving Korea today.

141
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,030
Really?

142
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,399
So that's what he's going to do.

143
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:06,038
No woman I ever met played
this hard-to-get.

144
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,341
-What?
-What?

145
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,243
No, what I mean is...

146
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,547
Why are you telling me about him anyway?

147
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,117
Because you wanted him enough
to follow him to Jeju Island.

148
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,053
Is he that great?

149
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,690
If I say he is,
will you glare at me again?

150
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,793
He is that great.

151
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,794
Don't.

152
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,831
Where are you going?

153
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:36,402
The only great person to me right now
is Han Tae-seon.

154
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,603
Hey!

155
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,006
I rushed over here because I thought
we would be talking about us.

156
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,274
Thank you for telling me about Tae-seon.

157
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,044
But I would like to hear about us, too.

158
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,315
You really can't forgive me?

159
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,186
If you give me another chance,
I know I can do it right.

160
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,289
I know that my crimes are heinous.

161
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,260
So can't I get sentenced
to be with you for life?

162
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,963
Cling on to me then.

163
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,298
-What?
-Cling on to me.

164
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,601
Cling on whenever you see me.

165
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,536
Then I'll consider it.

166
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,538
Really? You're serious, right?

167
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,839
I'm really going to do it.

168
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,841
I'll cling on with all my charms.

169
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,410
Like this!

170
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,438
Where do you think you're going?

171
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,140
I told you to think about it,
not run away thoughtlessly.

172
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,509
And why are you taking a boat to China?

173
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,678
Then would I ride a cab?

174
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,280
Can't you act with common sense?

175
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,981
I went all the way to the airport!

176
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,417
If I acted with common sense,
I would make music like yours.

177
00:11:59,018 --> 00:11:59,985
Give me my MP3 player.

178
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,921
You think that's why I'm here?

179
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,056
I told you to come fetch it.

180
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,625
It was full of music that you wrote.

181
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,729
What were you going to do if I stole it?

182
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,430
-But you won't.
-How do you know that?

183
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,832
You don't have the guts.

184
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,833
You little...

185
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,604
I'll cut to the chase.
Let's write a new contract.

186
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:20,906
I said no.

187
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,808
Stop holding out already.

188
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,177
What? Are you shy?

189
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,213
I know.

190
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,583
You were probably shocked
when I said I would take you in.

191
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,386
So I was thinking. Can you take me in?

192
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,856
-What?
-Let's write a new contract.

193
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,992
Take me under your wing. Be my producer.

194
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,331
Help me out here.
Be honest. You want to help me.

195
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,066
Why keep hiding it?

196
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,668
I love your songs. Give them to me.

197
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,004
The songs in here. You wrote them for me.

198
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,807
Even the file name is "Oska."
So give them to me.

199
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,811
Get lost. I have to get on the boat.

200
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,979
Seriously!

201
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,517
You don't want to produce me? Fine.

202
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,053
How about if I'm produced by you?
Sound good?

203
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,923
You really have no sincerity.

204
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,526
-I hate it.
-You sure have a lot of things you hate.

205
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,194
How are you going to succeed like that?

206
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,996
Come here. You need to be tied up.

207
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,433
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
Let me down!

208
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,669
You should've listened
when I asked nicely.

209
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,805
Do I look like I'm enjoying this,
you pain in the butt?

210
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,484
I'll compensate you with money.

211
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,619
I'll compensate you with more than enough.

212
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,156
So please don't drag Joo-won down
because of this.

213
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,726
End things with Joo-won
without hurting him.

214
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,430
Once you've ended it,
come to me for your money.

215
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,741
This is the action school.

216
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,981
What do you mean by that?

217
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,583
You got the part for Dark Blood.

218
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,718
I did?

219
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,355
But I missed the audition. How?

220
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,357
You should thank Joo-won.

221
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,658
What?

222
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,029
He sent a private jet to Japan
and flew the director here.

223
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,532
They decided on you
after watching you on set.

224
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,639
Please believe in me.

225
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,641
I'll make that miracle happen.

226
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,878
A private jet?

227
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,215
He's really on a different level.

228
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,287
He's not interested in men, is he?

229
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,555
I would like to go out with him.

230
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,124
Congratulations.

231
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,893
Director, I'll be right back.

232
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,337
Our goal is to make this place
a must-see site

233
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:43,342
for tourists from all over Asia,
including Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong.

234
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,813
Currently, we are holding an event

235
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,051
where you wish upon a star by placing
your hand over a star's handprint.

236
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,421
The promotional clip will be
completed by next week as well.

237
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,790
It's a nice idea.

238
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,829
If I place my hand here
and wish sincerely for you to fall over...

239
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,798
-Sir!
-Oh my goodness!

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,637
I think this place will be thriving
by next month, not in a year.

241
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,906
You have a call.

242
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,108
It's an important call,
but you left your phone behind.

243
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,209
Is it my mom?

244
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,213
Hey, it's me.

245
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,681
Are you busy?

246
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,716
No.

247
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,151
All right. Go on now.

248
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,723
Where are you? I called you before,
but you didn't pick up.

249
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,324
I was shooting.

250
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,193
I'm in Cheonan.

251
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,663
The day and night scenes
are mostly dissolves,

252
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,000
so don't be mad if I can't pick up.

253
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,168
Are you lying again?

254
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,770
Let me speak to anyone standing near you.

255
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,538
I'm not lying.

256
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,410
I can't talk for long right now,

257
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,979
so I'll get straight to it.

258
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,115
You see,

259
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,119
a miracle has happened.

260
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,790
I passed that audition.

261
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,726
You did? You passed?

262
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,430
That's my Ra-im. So cool.

263
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,400
And that cool girl is my girl.

264
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,237
I heard about everything.

265
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,440
You sent a private jet?

266
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,808
Come on.

267
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,878
You think that's why you passed?

268
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,679
Are you a dummy?

269
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,249
That director watched you
for five minutes.

270
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,452
You're the one that made
the miracle happen in five minutes.

271
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,720
Where are you going?

272
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,890
How did you know?

273
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,591
I just did.

274
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,261
Your surroundings sounded different.

275
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,631
Why does your voice sound different?

276
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,299
Are you crying?

277
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,569
I'm just so happy for passing.

278
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,072
Sorry,

279
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,741
but I have to go film.

280
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,409
All right.

281
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,578
Don't get hurt, and hurry back.

282
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,947
Bye.

283
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,165
Ra-im?

284
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,671
Did something happen?

285
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,622
Why are we here?

286
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,326
I've always wanted to come here once.

287
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,930
You come to places like this often, right?

288
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,065
Yes.

289
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,202
Sometimes just to look, sometimes to buy.

290
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,538
I see.

291
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,676
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

292
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,615
What do you think of
when you look at paintings like these?

293
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:14,453
Other than recognizing it's a Picasso,
or that I've seen it in a textbook,

294
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,256
what am I supposed to feel?

295
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,193
What's going on?

296
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,164
I told you that I want to help.

297
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,136
You told me that you and Joo-won

298
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:36,141
live with much of your lives on display.

299
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,644
On the other hand,

300
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,482
I am a stuntwoman who shines the most

301
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,851
when no one can see me.

302
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,087
Joo-won and I

303
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,057
are that far apart.

304
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,629
It's like standing next to each other
and yet being worlds apart.

305
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,365
I didn't think that it would be easy,

306
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,103
but this issue is too predictable.

307
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,241
I didn't give him up for this.

308
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,214
The problem isn't between you two,
it's outside factors.

309
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,683
And yet you're going to leave him?

310
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,352
Were you always this indifferent?

311
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,223
If you're too far apart, then run to him.

312
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,926
If you can't feel him next to you,
then hold onto him.

313
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,964
Even if it makes things difficult
for Joo-won?

314
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,436
Is that what the problem is?

315
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,905
I guess

316
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,142
there is no such thing as easy love.

317
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,363
What? A private jet?

318
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:09,501
He chartered a private jet
because she missed her audition?

319
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,209
What a clever girl.

320
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,712
She has him completely wrapped
around her finger.

321
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,717
That's right. I chose the wrong target.

322
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,520
I shouldn't have gone after her.

323
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,958
-Leave.
-Excuse me?

324
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,927
Yes, madam.

325
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,106
LOEL MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS

326
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,579
Hello.

327
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,083
Thank you.

328
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,019
Happy New Year to you too, Chairman Park.

329
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,257
Do you have time for dinner tonight?

330
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,261
I have a favor to ask of you.

331
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,358
I welcome you to Loel.

332
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,160
Thank you.
We have high expectations as well.

333
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,795
And you should.

334
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,299
Please recommend a jacket
that would look good on me.

335
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,669
Please, you don't have to.
Your visit is more than enough.

336
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,305
This is a long time tradition of ours.

337
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,741
"Anyone can bring flowers.

338
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,710
Instead, be their very first customer."

339
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,247
How about this one?

340
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,182
Would you like to try it on?

341
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,729
-I like it. I'll take this one.
-Hello?

342
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,966
What? What did you say?

343
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,169
All right. Hang up for now.

344
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,006
Sir, I need to speak to you...

345
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,474
What is it?

346
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,644
An emergency shareholders meeting
will be held in an hour.

347
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,714
They're meeting to dismiss the CEO.

348
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,748
What?

349
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,886
And the person who called the meeting
was your mother.

350
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,587
What?

351
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,124
JOO-WON

352
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,071
It was about time you came for your money,

353
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,140
but you never called,
so I called you first.

354
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,044
I trust that you ended things well
with Joo-won.

355
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,015
How much do you want? Tell me.

356
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,685
There is no use for your pride.

357
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,457
I acknowledge you put up a good fight.
So how much?

358
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,992
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,536
Why are you sorry?

360
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,475
I thought long and hard about it.

361
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,077
But

362
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,179
I can't break up with him.

363
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,284
That isn't the answer I wanted to hear.

364
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,386
I'm really sorry.

365
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,188
But

366
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,090
if my father

367
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,060
sacrificed his life to save him,

368
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,164
then Joo-won is even more precious
to me now.

369
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,235
My father sacrificed his life for him.

370
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,173
I will do the same and protect him
with my life.

371
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,041
How could you be so vicious?

372
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,644
I didn't call you here to accept you.

373
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,480
You'll forever be his weak point.

374
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,750
You are my perfect son's only flaw.

375
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:24,089
Why does he have to endure people
whispering behind his back because of you?

376
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,525
I'll be better.

377
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:31,463
I'll do whatever it takes for Joo-won
not to be harmed because of me.

378
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,564
Shut your mouth.

379
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,700
There's only one thing you can do for him.

380
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,569
And that is to disappear.

381
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,773
I truly love Joo-won.

382
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,510
We both truly love each other.

383
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,846
Is that not enough?

384
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,015
Can it never be me?

385
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,584
Please give us your blessing, Mother.

386
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,353
Please allow us to be together.

387
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,424
So you're saying you can't give him up.

388
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,726
Fine, then.

389
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,828
Do as you like.

390
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,836
JOO-WON

391
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,040
Yes, it's me.

392
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,708
What are you trying to do?

393
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,711
Who said you could call this meeting?

394
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,147
Who said you can dismiss me?

395
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,516
Are you really going to go this far?

396
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,720
You should at least expect this much if
you're going to betray me for a poor girl.

397
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,855
I told you before.

398
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,092
You are responsible
for the things you were given.

399
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,595
I have made myself clear.

400
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,631
Now, it is your turn. What will it be?

401
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,167
Fine.

402
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,402
Take everything. All of it.

403
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,739
I will never give her up.

404
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,343
Is that so?

405
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,112
All right, then.

406
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,748
Do as you wish.

407
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,490
There's no reason to look at me that way.

408
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,559
I'm through with you.

409
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,828
To be fair, how is any of this your fault?

410
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,298
I'm just going to ruin Joo-won's life.

411
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,839
You doubt me, don't you?

412
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,607
You think I'm just saying this
to scare you.

413
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,342
Do you want to see

414
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,111
just how far I can go?

415
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,647
Joo-won can never beat me.

416
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,184
When a child goes too far,
the parent has to go even further to win.

417
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,720
That means there is no limit
to what I will do.

418
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,023
Even if I have to break him.

419
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,993
The shareholders meeting is in an hour.

420
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,395
Unfortunately for Joo-won,

421
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,732
he will learn the most bitter lesson
of failure and betrayal in his life

422
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,335
all because of you.

423
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,738
Because he will be brought down
by his own mother.

424
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,612
Wait!

425
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,313
Wait, mother!

426
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,116
Wait!

427
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,288
I'll stop.

428
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,024
I will leave him.

429
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,562
I will let him go.

430
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,400
I will disappear.

431
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,504
I will disappear like foam.

432
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,474
So please don't do this.

433
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,577
Don't ruin him.

434
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,280
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,650
I was wrong.

436
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,754
Forgive me.

437
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,857
I have to take such extreme measures
to make you understand.

438
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,527
-I'm sorry!
-How frustrating.

439
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,114
President Kim.

440
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,117
Don't call me that anymore.

441
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,620
I'm being fired soon.

442
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,123
Are you really going to let her do this?

443
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,161
I can't break up with Gil Ra-im.

444
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,929
This is the better option.

445
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,698
Wow. How...

446
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,900
How is losing your job
as a department store CEO

447
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,702
over a girl the better option?

448
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,003
I know, right?

449
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,807
Isn't Gil Ra-im amazing?

450
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,510
How could she shake someone like me
by the roots?

451
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,712
This will go down in history.

452
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,516
Goodness. You're a true Romeo, aren't you?

453
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,951
Are you really going to take this?

454
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,520
I have to.

455
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,158
If I try to strike back,
my mom will only strike harder.

456
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,762
And it's too obvious who she'll strike.

457
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,631
Do you mean

458
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,833
Ra-im?

459
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,871
I guess being rich
isn't so great after all.

460
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,176
Sir, don't worry.

461
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,546
If you really do get fired,

462
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,115
I will hand in my resignation.

463
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,449
What for?

464
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,451
You'll automatically be fired.

465
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,187
What? Why?

466
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,555
Because I hired you.

467
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,957
Then what do I do?

468
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,927
Love doesn't put food on the table.
Money does!

469
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,363
Should we start farming?
Want to raise the cattle?

470
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:33,932
President Kim!

471
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,533
I'm not the president anymore.

472
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,302
Joo-won!

473
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,238
Are you insane?

474
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,675
Don't move. Stop right there.

475
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,310
Come back here!

476
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,775
It is you.

477
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,010
When did you get here?

478
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,812
Are you here for Joo-won? He left.

479
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,982
I saw him leave.

480
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,351
You did? Did he tell you to wait?

481
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,053
No,

482
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,889
it's just...

483
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,058
I wanted to tell you

484
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,194
that I don't think we can hold
our exclusive fan meetings anymore.

485
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,397
Why?

486
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,768
Did you get the part
for Lian Jackson's movie?

487
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,803
You got the part!

488
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,839
Do you know how many times I called Japan?

489
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,908
I'm a total beginner,

490
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,912
so I just said, "I love you too"
around a million times.

491
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,182
Thank you so much.

492
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,984
No need for that between us.

493
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,020
But nothing comes for free.

494
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,056
Buy me grilled pork rinds.

495
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,973
How could you make me buy flowers?
You amazing woman.

496
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,587
I heard from A-yeong.

497
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,158
That doll was a gift
from your father, right?

498
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,497
Use this instead of tying it up
with a handkerchief.

499
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,899
Handkerchief?

500
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,785
Did you see it?

501
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,355
I'm much more poetic than you think I am.

502
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,658
I can move you in ways you did not expect.

503
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,529
All done.

504
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,464
Try it.

505
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,671
Forget it.

506
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,806
I said try it on.

507
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,411
I said forget it.

508
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,689
Are you trying to remind me
that I'm the type of girl

509
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,793
who carries around a bag like this?

510
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,629
Or do you want me to feel that shame

511
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:29,467
over and over again
by carrying this around?

512
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,036
You know that's not it. All I wanted was--

513
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:36,541
I feel as if I have to bear suffering
that isn't even mine all because of you.

514
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,709
But why are you

515
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,812
always so carefree?

516
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,182
Did I do something wrong?

517
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,117
I have no time for this.

518
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,455
Let's not see each other for a while.

519
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,191
-What?
-I'm going to start filming soon.

520
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,060
People like you who were born
with opportunities at every turn

521
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,431
don't understand
what this opportunity means to me.

522
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:06,037
It's the most important phase of my life
and I don't want to be distracted by love.

523
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,339
So don't call me.

524
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,275
It's bothersome and exhausting.

525
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,377
Okay. I know it's been hard on you.

526
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,115
But I'm sorry.
I have no intention to do as you say.

527
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,450
What kind of ridiculous notice is this?

528
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,619
Geez.

529
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,155
How could you do this?

530
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,656
I've been...

531
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:33,030
Do you even know what I gave up
to be with you?

532
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,565
If you were going to give it up anyway,

533
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,601
why didn't you do it sooner?

534
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,837
Before I got tired of you.

535
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,840
Please leave now.

536
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,677
I don't want to see anyone
from your family.

537
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,559
You're early...

538
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,935
I asked A-yeong.

539
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,704
She's my fairy godmother.

540
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,340
Don't do this from now on.

541
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,743
If you need something, talk to me outside.

542
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,046
Don't be like this.
I don't have a guideline for these fights.

543
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,184
I want to fight over things like...

544
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,889
"Why are you late?"
"Why are you looking at him?"

545
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,926
"Why did you only cook for Oska?"
I want to fight over childish things.

546
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,528
-So--
-The accident

547
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,898
you had 13 years ago.

548
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,534
The one

549
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,103
you can't remember.

550
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,640
During that accident,

551
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,712
a firefighter

552
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,815
lost his life to rescue you.

553
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,218
That firefighter

554
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,721
was my father.

555
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,191
What?

556
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,260
It's easy for you
since you don't remember.

557
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,495
But for me,

558
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,133
every time I look at you,
I think of my dad.

559
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,237
I can't bear to look at you anymore

560
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,442
without feeling sorry for my dad.

561
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:10,548
Because of you,
I lived for 13 years without a father.

562
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,986
Can you imagine what that was like?

563
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,056
Do you remember when you said

564
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,625
you would be the little mermaid?

565
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,828
So please

566
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,197
disappear

567
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,333
just like foam.

568
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:44,315
A firefighter lost his life to rescue you.

569
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,052
That firefighter was my father.

570
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,584
FIREFIGHTER DIES WHILE PUTTING OUT FIRE

571
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,259
FIREFIGHTER GIL IK-SEON

572
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,333
When the smoke is thick
and the air is thin...

573
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,970
I hope that you prepare me for the time

574
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,407
when the fate of a life is unknown.

575
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,511
And...

576
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,149
If I die by your will,

577
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,219
by your grace,

578
00:40:55,653 --> 00:41:00,424
please look over my wife and family.

579
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,625
GIL IK-SEON

580
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,960
Dad.

581
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,563
I'm back.

582
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,733
Was it

583
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,003
really you who saved him?

584
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,241
You told me to wait for dinner

585
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:22,880
because you would be home early.

586
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,318
Then you never came.

587
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,891
Was it because you were saving him?

588
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,428
Is that why you never came?

589
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,702
I'm sorry, Dad.

590
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,739
I'm sorry

591
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,976
for loving him.

592
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,580
Dad,

593
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,017
I'm really sorry.

594
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,901
I'm sorry, Dad.

595
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,718
Aren't you nervous? It's your first shoot.

596
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,887
I'm so nervous

597
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,290
that it's taking me forever
to do these buttons.

598
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,692
I can't find the button holes.

599
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,163
Do you want to buy my dream?
I had a really good one.

600
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:47,831
Do you need money?

601
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,701
That's not why.
I seriously had the best dream.

602
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:55,706
There was this beautiful table set
in the middle of a field covered in snow.

603
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,209
And on that table, you and the president
were facing each other

604
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,744
drinking this lovely flower tea.

605
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,212
Flower tea?

606
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,416
Are you sure it wasn't flower liquor?

607
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,551
How would I know?
I can't taste in my dream.

608
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,622
But there was someone else.

609
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,124
I don't know who it was.

610
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,227
Anyway, when you two drank the tea,

611
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:21,365
deep red rose petals
started raining from the sky.

612
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,500
I'm telling you, it was spellbinding.

613
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,703
Why sell such a good dream to me?

614
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,471
Because it was about you and the CEO.

615
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,274
You said there was someone else.
It was probably you.

616
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:32,610
Is that how it works?

617
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,080
Anyway, good luck today!

618
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,014
Thanks!

619
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,087
NO VEHICLES ALLOWED

620
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,625
Please cooperate.

621
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,019
Okay.

622
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,810
He said the turn was a bit slow, so...

623
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,011
-Okay.
-Try it faster.

624
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,585
The director wants to do it one more time.

625
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,587
You look good on the monitor.

626
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,689
All right. I'll be right back!

627
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,004
DARK BLOOD SHOOT IN PROGRESS
WE ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION

628
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,409
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you blocking the roads?

629
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,179
There's a shooting going on.
Please take a different route.

630
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,547
Whatever.

631
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,949
Wait.

632
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,988
Hey, stop!

633
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,313
Gil Ra-im!

634
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,145
Sir!

635
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,995
Ra-im!

636
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,941
Oh, no!

637
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,949
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

638
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,826
She may never wake up.

639
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,928
I believe

640
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,130
she's brain dead.

641
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,293
It has been two weeks.

642
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,932
She is still in her dreams.

643
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,335
Her face looks peaceful,

644
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,004
which means

645
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,540
she is not dreaming about me.

646
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,378
I think she is waiting

647
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,814
for me.

648
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,251
She is waiting for me

649
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,720
to come.

650
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:20,590
Tomorrow and the next day...

651
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,656
ILWON, GYEONGGI PROVINCE,
NORTH CHUNGCHEONG PROVINCE

652
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,162
20-30MM PER HOUR

653
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,498
REPORTS OF RAIN

654
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,874
REPORTS OF RAIN

655
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,209
There you are.

656
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,748
Hey. What is it?

657
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,384
Well, actually...

658
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,455
I saw Ra-im here a few days ago.

659
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,058
-Here?
-Yes.

660
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,494
Before she got hurt.

661
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,497
Why was she here? To see me?

662
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,066
She said it wasn't.

663
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,934
But

664
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,104
she told me to be happy.

665
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,273
As if we would never see each other again.

666
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,076
It felt weird.

667
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,813
How is she?

668
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,984
What was she doing here?

669
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,686
She was looking at your books.

670
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,326
Right about here.

671
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,295
Which book?

672
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,063
I couldn't see that.

673
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:44,367
But I doubt she came here
just to look at books.

674
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,105
I only thought of it today.

675
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,404
ALICE IN WONDERLAND

676
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,081
THE KNIFE TREMBLED
IN THE LITTLE MERMAID'S HAND

677
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,649
SHE THEN THREW THE KNIFE
FAR INTO THE WAVES

678
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,821
THE WAVES TURNED RED
AS THE KNIFE DROPPED INTO THEM

679
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,222
THE SUN WAS NOW RISING OVER THE OCEAN

680
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,399
THE LITTLE MERMAID STARED
AT THE PRINCE FADING IN THE DISTANCE

681
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,301
AND TOSSED HERSELF INTO THE WAVES

682
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,676
AND THEN THE LITTLE MERMAID TURNED TO FOAM
AND DISAPPEARED

683
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,426
AND THEN THE LITTLE MERMAID TURNED TO FOAM
AND DISAPPEARED

684
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:39,716
AND THEN THE LITTLE MERMAID TURNED TO FOAM
AND DISAPPEARED

685
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,730
You have a flower delivery.

686
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,098
For me?

687
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,710
I love you, Mom.

688
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,846
Always and always.

689
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,715
From Joo-won.

690
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,952
You were going
to surrender like this anyway.

691
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,022
This feels like

692
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,158
Joo-won in his twenties.

693
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,396
Ms. Nam, bring a vase.
The prettiest one we have.

694
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:27,664
Yes, madam.

695
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,341
So Jong-heon went to pay,

696
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,413
and the restaurant owner
asked what the camera was for.

697
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,249
When he told her I was a singer,

698
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:50,687
she said, "I want a singer's autograph!
but who is it?"

699
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,290
Jong-heon told her I was Oska,
and she was all like,

700
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:58,094
"Oh, Oska! I need to get his autograph!

701
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:02,299
But is Oska a man or a woman?"

702
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,707
Hey, punk.

703
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,209
Do you know your laughter sounds fake?

704
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,711
This story isn't that funny.

705
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,080
What do you mean? It's hilarious.

706
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,083
Are you pitying me because I'm old?

707
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,419
Pity me with money, then.

708
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,220
So funny.

709
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,591
All right, I'll give you something
that is worth money.

710
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,595
Here.

711
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,033
What is it? Is it a bomb?

712
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,403
Or a dead bird?

713
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,106
Why didn't I think of that?

714
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,575
What's with you today?

715
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,849
What the...

716
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,453
These are all the things
I tried to get from you.

717
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,622
Are you really giving them to me?

718
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,726
Yes. I'm paying rent.

719
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,961
Why are you doing this?
Are you in trouble?

720
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,229
Forget it then.

721
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,731
No, no!

722
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,333
Thank you! Thanks, Joo-won.

723
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:16,106
Then let's take a picture.

724
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,974
That's gross.
Why would I take a photo with you?

725
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,909
And I have portrait rights.

726
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,212
We haven't taken one together
since I was 21.

727
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,081
You'll regret it later.

728
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:28,084
Half my life is regret and reflection.

729
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,520
That kind of regret
won't even make a dent.

730
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,691
True.

731
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,693
You really are a bad person.

732
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,037
Diamond.

733
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,198
U-yeong.

734
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,870
I always knew.

735
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,645
That you always let me win on purpose.

736
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,885
Seriously...

737
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,156
Thank you for everything.

738
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,239
See? This is you.

739
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,709
This is how amazing you are.

740
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:02,445
Can you see it?

741
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:07,884
You're strong and bright,
so you can overcome this.

742
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,087
Hurry and wake up, Ra-im.

743
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:15,291
Who sleeps this long?

744
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,995
Can't you see that we're all worried?

745
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,831
Wake up.

746
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,234
Just wake up.

747
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,369
If you do,

748
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,307
I'll send you to Joo-won.

749
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,011
I'll send you with a smile.

750
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,916
So please just wake up, kiddo.

751
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,655
I'm letting you know beforehand

752
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,424
that you are

753
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,160
the first and last alienated neighbor

754
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,797
to receive a letter from Kim Joo-won

755
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,966
from the leading social upper class.

756
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:01,771
So you can have a little pride.

757
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,745
The branches on the trees
are rustling fiercely in the wind.

758
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,782
I hope you read this letter

759
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:18,254
on a similar afternoon
when the wind is rustling the trees.

760
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,125
So that you can see

761
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,994
exactly what I saw.

762
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,337
If you stand before the window
where I stood,

763
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:40,109
lay on the bed where I lay,

764
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:48,451
read the books that I read...

765
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,657
If we can share these moments...

766
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,642
Then that's enough to say

767
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,745
that we're with each other.

768
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,228
That's enough to say

769
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,465
that we're as happy

770
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,536
as other couples.

771
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,490
Don't love any other guy.

772
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,995
Be alone and love me forever.

773
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,500
Don't even get too close with U-yeong.

774
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,436
That's incest.

775
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:30,780
This will probably be

776
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,818
the most selfish decision of my life,

777
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:42,558
but respect it, as the decision
of the leading upper class.

778
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,330
You were always so amazing.

779
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,034
Promise me

780
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,936
that you'll stay amazing forever.

781
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,886
I'm going to miss you

782
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,557
very much.

783
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,364
I love you.

784
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,934
I love you.

785
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,138
