1
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,701
What are you doing here at this hour?

2
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,369
I work today.

3
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,338
But everyone's getting off at this time.

4
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,878
Call the stores listed here
and bring me their new winter catalog...

5
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,910
So, you're saying

6
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,413
you never made a purchase here

7
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,283
nor did you ever enter a giveaway.

8
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,020
And yet, you were told you came third
and won a vacuum cleaner?

9
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,489
I know it doesn't make sense.

10
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,462
But by any chance,
did you enter my name...

11
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,335
Do I look like I have that much
time on my hands?

12
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,738
Just to give you a crummy vacuum cleaner?

13
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,441
Are you really here
for the vacuum cleaner?

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,178
Wasn't it enough to carry a bag
shabbier than a plastic bag?

15
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,851
I must have been crazy.

16
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,187
You're just a girl who came all the way
here just for a vacuum cleaner.

17
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,190
What did you...

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,826
just say?

19
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,294
I'm sure you heard.

20
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,130
I heard, but I was wondering

21
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,532
if I heard correctly--

22
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,167
"I must have been crazy.

23
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,037
You're just a girl who came all the way
here just for a vacuum cleaner."

24
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,040
Did you hear it clearly now?

25
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,612
Were you always such a jerk?

26
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,548
That depends on the perspective.

27
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,050
Then, which perspective is this?

28
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,586
It's a case where the woman

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,655
who interested me briefly
has no decent family,

30
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,457
educational background,
and even self-respect.

31
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,358
What?

32
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,927
Do you know how many people
are watching me here?

33
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,230
I let you film your movie here.

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,433
I set up a dinner for the first time
in my life because of you.

35
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,171
And do you really have to show
my employees see you walking out

36
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,972
from my office with a giveaway prize?

37
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,643
Can't you treat me with the same respect
that I have treated you with?

38
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,281
I just...

39
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,556
Are you smiling?

40
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,160
You thought I was pretty
only when I'm angry,

41
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,062
but I'm prettier when I smile, right?

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,532
What you said is all true.

43
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,735
Regardless of the reason...

44
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,171
I shouldn't have come here.

45
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,007
I didn't think about how you'd look.

46
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,210
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,946
If I embarrassed you...

48
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,049
I'm sorry about that too.

49
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,722
I'll leave now...

50
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,592
but I must claim my vacuum cleaner.

51
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,260
Give it to me.

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,696
I hesitated for a moment.

53
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,000
Whether I should hit you as usual,

54
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,438
or walk out with a sad face
so, I can be ingrained in your memory.

55
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,708
But what will I get out of that?

56
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,143
So, I'm just going to get my prize.

57
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,349
It wouldn't break just because a poor,
uneducated woman is using it, right?

58
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,851
-That's enough.
-If you're that embarrassed,

59
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,520
just say that I was just a fling
you got tired of--

60
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,888
I said, enough!

61
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,926
"a fling you got tired of"?
I can't say that.

62
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,661
Should I show you why?

63
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,932
Follow me.

64
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,135
Let go! Where are we going?

65
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,603
Let go of me!

66
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,506
Let go.

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,942
-Excuse us.
-Good evening, sir.

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,957
-Put them on.
-What are you doing?

69
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,525
You don't even have a clue, right?

70
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,861
And what did you say?

71
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,230
Did you think you're even worth
having a fling with?

72
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,300
If that's what you want,
you need to meet a certain standard.

73
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,102
I don't care about race, religion,
skin color, or sexual preference.

74
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,804
But I can't forgive looking cheap.

75
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,943
What's with that face?
Being cheap and pitiful is your specialty.

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,779
"What do you take me for?

77
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,814
Someone who pretends not to like
luxury items?"

78
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,850
They look incompetent and cheap
to a man like me.

79
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,754
Where are you going? You asked for this.

80
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,358
Try it on to see if it's pretty.

81
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,859
Let go. I said, let go.

82
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,083
Put it on.

83
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,319
Should I dress you?

84
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,857
If I wear this,

85
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,592
what's next?

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,961
If I wear it, what are you going to do

87
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,365
with me who's not even worth a fling?

88
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,635
Nothing. Not a thing.

89
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,305
I just wanted you to realize

90
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,841
how different I am compared to you.

91
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,283
I think I know where you belong.

92
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,485
What?

93
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,321
But I don't completely understand you,
so, I wanted to study you.

94
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,789
You should've given me some time.

95
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,191
"Time"? Time for what?

96
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,761
Time to study poverty?

97
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,563
What do you think I did?

98
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,566
At least, I tried. What have you done?

99
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,271
I'd be mad if you came to buy that vacuum.
But what? You came to claim it?

100
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,207
Do you know what really makes me mad?

101
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,678
Despite the fact that I previously warned
you about who I was and what I do,

102
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,715
You didn't even spend five minutes
to think about me.

103
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,785
On three. One, two, three.

104
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,485
Wire action is about the coordination
between the rider and the puller.

105
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,654
When three people pull the wire...

106
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,058
the rider needs to trust the three pullers

107
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,994
and understand how
to utilize their strength.

108
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,964
I'm sorry I'm late.

109
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,600
Why do you look so depressed?

110
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,868
No, I'm not.

111
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,303
You lie a lot lately.

112
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,238
It's the truth.

113
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,375
I'm just hungry because I skipped lunch.

114
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,676
Your acting has improved too.

115
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,446
Thank you for your compliment.

116
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,750
-Rookies!
-Yes, ma'am!

117
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,818
Keep your eyes peeled and learn.

118
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,255
I'll be practicing on my own
just for two hours.

119
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,574
You've improved a lot.

120
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,646
I can do it with my eyes closed now.

121
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,949
You might have to retire soon
if I ever go out on site.

122
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,117
What's the use?

123
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,454
There aren't any car stunts for women,
so why go through the trouble?

124
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,422
That's why I'm challenging myself.

125
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,524
Fine, go ahead. A challenge can't hurt.

126
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,695
What happened to...
I mean, is he not visiting anymore?

127
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,165
You know, Mr. Money-maker,
who actually makes a lot of money.

128
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,101
Is he not coming?

129
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,436
How would I know?

130
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,107
Hey, you're his Jeon Do-yeon
and Kim Tae-hee. You must know.

131
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,808
Shoot.

132
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,544
Clench your jaw.

133
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,647
What?

134
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,883
Is what I almost said as if I've gone mad.

135
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,358
CALLING JI-HYEON

136
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,043
It hasn't been acting up lately.
Is something stressing you out?

137
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,514
I'm not asking as a friend
but as your physician.

138
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,449
Not to comfort you but to treat you.

139
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,653
It's because of U-yeong.
He keeps causing trouble.

140
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,722
Is he your only excuse?

141
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,024
I have to know exactly what...

142
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,192
I'm sleepy.

143
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,599
Don't go to work for a while.
I won't increase your medication though.

144
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,236
Hey...

145
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,840
Don't take it the wrong way.
I was just curious while reading a book.

146
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,879
What are the symptoms of lovesickness?

147
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,117
She hates me. She hates me not.

148
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,155
She hates me. She hates me not.

149
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,524
She hates me. She hates me not.

150
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,260
She hates me. She hates me not.

151
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,563
She hates me. She hates me not.

152
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,366
She hates me. She hates me not.

153
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,602
She hates me. She hates me not.

154
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,238
She hates me. She hates me not.

155
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,274
She hates me...

156
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,113
Why? She's the one who did wrong.

157
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,749
She's so weird.

158
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,382
He uploaded new pictures.

159
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,788
It says, "Three days with fish stench."

160
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,191
He's showing off.

161
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,060
Find out where this is immediately.

162
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,597
What more is there to find?

163
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,902
Seongsan Ilchulbong. And a boat.
Where else could he be, but Seongsan Port?

164
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,006
Why do you even work for me?

165
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,009
-Does it look like I work for you?
-You punk!

166
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,214
Why is this being delivered here?
Did my friend not show up?

167
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,417
She did, but she left
after fighting with the CEO.

168
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,220
"Fighting"? Really?

169
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,423
Then, the rumor about him making a scene
at the luxury--

170
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,994
Don't you know everyone is keeping quiet?

171
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,864
Then, is it true that the CEO

172
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,733
picked my friend to be the winner?

173
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,301
What are you talking about?

174
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,771
The promotion department picked her.
He doesn't want to start a scandal.

175
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,274
Really? Is it really not true?

176
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,341
Hey.

177
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,544
Don't get so wide-eyed
because it's too cute.

178
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,180
I can't help it if I look cute.

179
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,549
It's humanly impossible.

180
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,021
I didn't know
you had that kind of problem.

181
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,925
So, do I just give this to her?
Is there anything else to tell her?

182
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,993
What was it again?

183
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,196
Wait.

184
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,799
Yes, why?

185
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,269
Minister Yoon?

186
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,572
A gift?

187
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,744
Yes, it's to celebrate the special meeting
between you and Yoon Seul...

188
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,579
"Special"? Yeah, right.

189
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,448
How could you accept it?

190
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:54,453
Well, it was a difficult gift
to decline...

191
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,555
What is it?

192
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,732
What is this excessively
environment-friendly gift?

193
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,035
Mr. Yoon was the former Minister
of Food, Agriculture and Forestry.

194
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,403
Why did he send this?

195
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,138
So, that I can eat them?

196
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,306
Oh my.

197
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,175
Do you like that idea?

198
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,409
Oh, my goodness.

199
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,415
How could you say such a thing?

200
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,453
It's sent by the former Minister
of Food, Agriculture and Forestry,

201
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,623
but it's not agriculture or forestry.
So, it must be food. Health food.

202
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,229
Mr. Yoon said that he is certain the deer,

203
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:42,501
which represents nobility and aristocracy,
is the most suitable gift for you.

204
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,837
Well, he was wrong.

205
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:45,971
Return it.

206
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,675
-Yes?
-Sir.

207
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,745
Oh, it's today? I understand.

208
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,748
Get ready to go to Pyeongchang-dong.

209
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,020
He's such a filial son that every month,
he attends the family meeting--

210
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,087
I'm not filial.

211
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,591
My grandfather revises his will
at these meetings

212
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,326
once every month.

213
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,664
Sir...

214
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,800
Here.

215
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,276
Father, I'm here.

216
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,311
There was so much traffic.

217
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,047
Skip the appetizer
and get to the main course.

218
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:02,981
Yes, madam.

219
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,418
What was everyone talking about?

220
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,188
Is there anyone else here
whose mouth is as big as yours?

221
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,757
Can't you fix that temper?

222
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,095
It feels so empty without my U-yeong.

223
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,430
Why did my Korean Wave star
go to Jeju Island?

224
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,966
It's not Jeju. He went to Thailand
to film his music video.

225
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,000
"Thailand"?

226
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,403
No.

227
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,941
I just talked to him
and he said he was in Jeju Island.

228
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,710
Well, that's how he is.
He doesn't even know where he is.

229
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,213
-Mom!
-You need to fix that.

230
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,448
You badmouth U-yeong all the time.

231
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,384
He's treated like a national guest
whenever he goes abroad.

232
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,224
You've become younger
since you've married.

233
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,128
Ms. Park must be your anti-aging secret.

234
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,262
"Ms. Park"?

235
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,198
Is she some stranger
that you met at a sauna?

236
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,033
Or do you not know the word, "mother"?

237
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,970
Take it easy. Let us get acquainted first.

238
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,306
If you continue to act this way,
you only make things harder for Ms. Park.

239
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,945
Where's my attorney? Call him!

240
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,147
Yes, sir.

241
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,585
I'm always grateful to you.
Please support Joo-won well.

242
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,856
Don't worry. For him, I'd do anything.

243
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,861
Of course.
I think as if I've left him to your care.

244
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:27,166
He is so passionate
that there is so much for me to learn.

245
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,605
The only problem
is that he works twice a week...

246
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,643
I heard about that too. That he...

247
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,282
I heard that Mr. Park signs
everything for you, right?

248
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,218
Is this true?
Is he signing instead of you?

249
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:47,819
Yes,

250
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,322
He can forge quite well.

251
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,391
Kim Joo-won!

252
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,660
But that's not the problem.

253
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,130
Do you know what the employees
are saying about you?

254
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,067
Of course, I do. How could I not?

255
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,169
They all despise me so much.

256
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,573
I play around. I'm rude. I'm hysterical.

257
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,007
I would hate myself too.

258
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,377
At my department store,

259
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,981
CEO stands for "Can't Enter On time."

260
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,085
If anyone says that to me directly,
I'm going to promote that employee.

261
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,187
Then, wouldn't I look so cool?

262
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,591
Only Westerners would think this way.

263
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,193
It's rare for Koreans
to have my kind of mindset.

264
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,232
Do you even care
about the department store?

265
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,801
Or are you going to keep goofing around?

266
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,036
It won't go bankrupt just because of me.

267
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,173
Also, Mr. Park is always there for me.

268
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,711
Then, why don't you
just leave everything to him?

269
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,781
Father, the sales have hiked
since Joo-won took over.

270
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,050
Those sales would've gone up anyway.

271
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,686
Don't rely on him

272
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,658
and take care of it as if it were
your own business.

273
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,826
Please, don't worry.

274
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,911
Mr. Park.

275
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,116
What were you trying to pull
at the family dinner?

276
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,986
From now on, please bring up
your complaints when we're at work--

277
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,124
Since this is a family meeting,
shouldn't you call me, "great-uncle"?

278
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,328
Of course, I understand your situation.

279
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,132
Naturally, you'd hate that
your employee became your great-uncle

280
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,199
overnight.

281
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,668
-Mr. Park.
-However,

282
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,972
the chairman and my sister are so in love.
You should do your part as the grandson.

283
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,073
What are you trying to do?

284
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,175
Let's say you hate me, but why my sister?

285
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:55,113
She is much more poised and refined

286
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,050
than the stuntwoman you're dating.

287
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,385
The rumor has spread all around.

288
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,223
So, does this mean
I am better at work than you?

289
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,238
You should have seen the CEO's face.

290
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,710
You know that when I boot someone,
I do it well.

291
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,647
By the way, sir,
I overheard while waiting.

292
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,217
It seems like you forgot a "grand."

293
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,251
What do you mean?

294
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,320
If you're the sibling of the grandmother,

295
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,291
you're a "grand-uncle", not "great-uncle."

296
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,594
What? Are you sure?

297
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,429
-Does it make a big difference?
-Yes.

298
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,201
I see.

299
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,645
This is the right place.

300
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,723
There he is.

301
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,661
Han Tae-seon!

302
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,868
You know me, right?

303
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,803
WHO IS MODEL K, OSKA'S LOVER?

304
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,106
-Who is "Model K"?
-That's right!

305
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,575
The one you don't know is Model K,
not Oska.

306
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,544
But why did you lie
that you don't know me?

307
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,781
Did you come all the way here for me?

308
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,983
Yes, so that I can beat you to death.

309
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,886
How dare you hang up on me like that?

310
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,053
Can't you see that I'm working?

311
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,189
I'm busy. Get lost.

312
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,760
Think logically. Who'd be busier?

313
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,362
I'm a Korean Wave star.

314
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,999
Look here, Korean Wave loser.

315
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,334
Isn't the 7th album important to you?

316
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,770
You're on the verge of being forgotten.

317
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,739
Why do you waste time like this?

318
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,774
Listen to him.

319
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,243
You said you don't know about me,
but look at you talking.

320
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,213
Tell me the truth. You're my fan, right?

321
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,815
You're crazy.

322
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,919
Fine. How much do you want for a contract?

323
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,320
Do you want a blank check?

324
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,354
MR. CHOI

325
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,056
Even if I wanted to,
I'd never sign with you.

326
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,559
I told you that your music sucks.

327
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,560
Hey!

328
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,665
Be specific.

329
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,135
Is it the sound, melody, session,
or my live performance?

330
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,772
You rip off American music
and make a few tweaks.

331
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,740
The melody is
for commercial purposes only.

332
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,244
And the session? It's all computerized,
so, can it be called a session?

333
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,647
And when you sing live,
it's all fake, right?

334
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,319
You lip-sync
to your studio recordings, right?

335
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,654
I don't think so.

336
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,223
Liar.

337
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,059
If you had the will to come here,
at least be honest.

338
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,866
Who is he?

339
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,601
How does he know everything?

340
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,905
Hey! Did you join my anti-fan club?

341
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,108
What?

342
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,679
Why won't you pick up the phone?

343
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,717
I heard there's a typhoon in Thailand.
How's the shooting going?

344
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,853
What? Where?

345
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,789
You're in Jeju Island, not Thailand?

346
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,360
You crazy punks!
Are you guys out of your minds?

347
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,298
Hey, Director Lee is calling.
I'll call you back, so wait for my call.

348
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,204
Yes, Director Lee.
I was just about to call you.

349
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,641
Oska is not there, right?
There was an emergency.

350
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:44,976
Excuse me?

351
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,013
What does that mean?

352
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,587
Thank you for taking care of that.

353
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,188
Well, I won't lose anything from it.

354
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,927
SEHAN BANK
LEE SANG-IL ACCOUNT NUMBER

355
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,130
It will be sent to you by today.

356
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,369
Thanks to you, things are working out.

357
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,675
Yes, Mr. Choi. What is going on?

358
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,846
The director I worked so hard to get
suddenly said he can't do it.

359
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,848
Really? You must have been upset.

360
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,919
U-yeong ran away to Jeju Island.
I found out yesterday.

361
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,322
Jeju Island? Why?

362
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,456
I don't know.

363
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:35,894
He wanted to scout a new talent,
but the talent's not giving in.

364
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,762
That's why he left.

365
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,398
He doesn't care about the consequences
once he's hung on an idea.

366
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,802
Wealthy kids are always like that.
They don't thirst for success.

367
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,137
Look who's talking.

368
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,207
That's why you need a director like me.

369
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,143
I can relate with the wealthy.

370
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,445
Sure.

371
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,716
Anyway, we need to start shooting
next week in order to release

372
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,619
the song track
and teaser before the showcase.

373
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,123
We're short on time, but it can be done.

374
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,061
Also, you can rest assured
that what you worry about won't happen.

375
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,765
My parents just want me to take
bridal classes and get married.

376
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,334
I have a pretty face,
so, I don't need plastic surgery.

377
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,269
I have a diploma
from a prestigious school.

378
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,406
So, before I marry a rich husband
and play house,

379
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,309
I just wanted to play around
with some celebrities.

380
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,212
But I'm too old for games now.

381
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,514
I need to find a rich husband, too.

382
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,719
Hello, I'm Yoon Seul.
I called you earlier.

383
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,987
I'm Lim Jong-su.

384
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,660
You had an impressive resume.
You even worked in Hollywood.

385
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,430
I just happened to be lucky.

386
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,788
Then, let's get to the main point.

387
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,562
We need your help because we have
action scenes, but we don't have time.

388
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,599
In other words, this sequence
will reveal if you're capable or not.

389
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,071
Sounds thrilling.
Who is the main character?

390
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,373
Oska. You know who he is, right?

391
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,286
This piece is by the new artist
Kim Su-gyeong,

392
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,388
who is currently active in Germany.

393
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:55,093
This piece, based on cars, was completed
in three years and uses various colors...

394
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,176
Its greatest feature is the use
of specific expressions.

395
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:18,983
Sir.

396
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,351
Next.

397
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,401
This is killing me.

398
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,579
What's this?

399
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,747
I heard that you just left.

400
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,516
I was told to give it to you.

401
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,718
I received it yesterday, but...

402
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,087
Who told you to give it to me?

403
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,889
Who do you think? The CEO, of course.

404
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,557
I heard that you asked for it.

405
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,493
What did he say again?

406
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,797
He said that this vacuum cleaner
is exactly your level.

407
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,199
Why? Is this not the right model?

408
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,702
Yeah, I thought he would
give you a robot one--

409
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,237
Why did you accept it?

410
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,840
You scared me! You won it!
Of course, you should take it!

411
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,143
Did you expect me to act coy
and not take it?

412
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,387
This piece is valued highly both
domestically and internationally.

413
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,860
-Sir.
-Next.

414
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,063
No, there is an incoming call.

415
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,501
GIL RA-IM

416
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,143
Hello.

417
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:53,978
Hello?

418
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,481
Hello!

419
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,484
Can't you hear me? Hello!

420
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,320
I hear you. Speak.

421
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,890
Why didn't you answer me?
What is this vacuum cleaner?

422
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,792
Come take it right now.

423
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,694
Who are you telling to come and go?

424
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,397
If you don't want it,
just throw it away or return it yourself.

425
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,801
Next.

426
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:22,774
Wait.

427
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,645
Was it like that a while ago?

428
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,416
-Excuse me?
-It wasn't.

429
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,820
Just a moment ago,
the lights were on inside that house.

430
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,221
"Lights"?

431
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,893
The lights were clearly
on inside the house.

432
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,099
The title of that piece is
Dark House, sir.

433
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,338
I must have seen wrong.

434
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,842
Let's stop here.
All the paintings are creepy.

435
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,997
The number you have dialed
is unavailable...

436
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,331
You're avoiding my calls?

437
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,335
Where on earth are you going?

438
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,205
The CEO doesn't come into work today.

439
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,342
He didn't go to work?
He's not at the department store?

440
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,317
Yes, it's me.

441
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,021
Could you find an address
in the directory for me?

442
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,523
It's Kim Joo-won.

443
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,158
Kim Joo-won?

444
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,260
Why do you need Money-maker's address?

445
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,728
Did you get invited?

446
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,832
Gil Ra-im, were you pretending to be coy?

447
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,235
Oh, you scared me.

448
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,606
I'm looking for it.
You're in such a hurry, madam.

449
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:38,309
BETTING ON FAMINE:
WHY THE WORLD STILL GOES HUNGRY

450
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,032
You can leave deliveries here.

451
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,334
I'm not here for delivery.

452
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,136
I'm here to see Kim Joo-won.

453
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,504
Did you arrange an appointment?

454
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,342
Pretty much.
He told me to return it in person.

455
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,280
Leave your ID and provide your number
on the guest list, please.

456
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,282
My ID?

457
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,767
Excuse me.

458
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,171
Do you know Kim Joo-won's neighborhood
and room number?

459
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,109
This is where President Kim lives.

460
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,245
Yes, but which house is it?

461
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,916
This entire place

462
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,951
belongs to President Kim.

463
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,152
What?

464
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,591
All of it?

465
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,127
What is this?

466
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:11,829
You wanted it.

467
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,999
Then, you should have given it to me
when I asked. Why now?

468
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,667
Why did you send this?

469
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,070
Do you want some tea? Or coffee?

470
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,705
Why did you send this to me?

471
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,240
To set myself straight.

472
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,241
What?

473
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,876
Of course, there is nothing you did wrong.

474
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,645
You must be dumbfounded too.

475
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,184
I'm the one who chased after you first,
but I'm the one getting angry that

476
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,887
you don't meet my standards when even
just flowers and candles surprise you.

477
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,590
Do you remember when we first met?

478
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,326
I took you to the hospital as a good deed.

479
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,763
We should have stopped at that time.

480
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:50,401
"A kind deed and concern
for a poor, isolated neighbor."

481
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:55,806
To me, you're a poor, isolated neighbor.
Nothing more or less.

482
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,010
So, take it and use it.

483
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,548
Every and each word
you say makes me laugh.

484
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,450
What?

485
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,020
Thanks to you,
I can't wait for the end of this year.

486
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,356
Why I ought to...

487
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,330
Right, it's true that I am poor,

488
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,666
but why am I your neighbor?

489
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,001
Do you know the distance
from here to my house?

490
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,472
I don't need a neighbor like you,
so, you can use it.

491
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,146
Take this.

492
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,332
What did you do just now?

493
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,802
You said you weren't taking it.
I don't need it either.

494
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,371
If you change your mind, go fish it out.

495
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,559
What are you doing?

496
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:22,893
Come out!

497
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,225
Stop.

498
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,292
Let go.

499
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,964
What are you doing?

500
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,465
What are you?

501
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,300
What kind of woman is this spiteful?

502
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,704
If I threw the box, you should ask me
to pick it up or apologize.

503
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,073
Give me some room
to squeeze into your heart.

504
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,343
How could you walk in yourself?
How could you go that far?

505
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,645
Didn't you throw it away
to make me look like this?

506
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,180
I didn't think you'd actually do it!

507
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,182
Is that why you threw away
my bike key too?

508
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,252
Go get it right now.
You told me to ask you!

509
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,520
Can't I just apologize?

510
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,725
Look at you. You better not go in again.

511
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,494
I will buy 100 of those, so wash up first.

512
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,730
Let go. Let me go.

513
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,712
What brings you here? When did you come?

514
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,849
I wanted to discuss with you

515
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,684
about the gift that Minister Yoon sent.

516
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,054
Doesn't it seem like the wrong time?

517
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,123
And who are you?

518
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,829
She's someone I met recently.
I will let you know later.

519
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,766
Is she not decent enough
to introduce herself?

520
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,568
Mom.

521
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,070
If you two just met recently
and she came over to the house,

522
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,139
does it mean you're intimate?

523
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,107
How many times has it been?

524
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,443
How many times have you been here?

525
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,913
-This is the first time.
-Did you get paid?

526
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,248
-What?
-Mom!

527
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,616
Don't be so naive.

528
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,985
Don't you know what I mean?

529
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,825
I clearly understood what you said.

530
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,728
I, too, found out just now

531
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,432
that I'm just a poor, isolated neighbor

532
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,934
that causes Kim Joo-won concern.

533
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,436
What?

534
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,172
Just be quiet.

535
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,774
-Mom--
-Must you disappoint me like this?

536
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,044
How could you let someone like her
in the house?

537
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,047
Even if you mess around,
have some standards

538
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,885
so that I'm not disappointed, Kim Joo-won.

539
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:01,919
Mom!

540
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,588
I don't think you have to worry
about anything like that.

541
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:09,593
A man who just randomly happened
to be born rich and live comfortably

542
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,929
is not worthy of messing around with me.

543
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,233
I will leave now, then.

544
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:23,207
What did she just say?

545
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,975
Where did you get her from?

546
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,811
Why are you acting like this lately?

547
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,815
Even the incident with Mr. Park.
How can you tell a cat to mind your fish?

548
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,785
What's happening
with Minister Yoon's daughter?

549
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,555
I don't believe that you were rejected.

550
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:38,989
Let's talk about it later.

551
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,426
What do you want?

552
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,863
What about Dong-gyu?

553
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,966
So, where is Choi U-yeong now?

554
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,334
Jeju Island.

555
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,037
I don't have the confidence nor time
to chase him down,

556
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,306
catch him, punish him,
and board him on a plane to Thailand.

557
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:58,042
So, I'm planning to go to Jeju Island
with the music video staff.

558
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:01,178
Then, what is the problem?
Our event is also on Jeju Island.

559
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,148
The schedules conflict.
I'm about to go mad.

560
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,951
The album release date is soon
and we have to find new staff

561
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,619
and new locations. Everything!

562
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,754
No, we can't change our schedule.

563
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,957
That's why I'm here
to ask you for a favor.

564
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,658
Let's delay it for just ten days.

565
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,394
Since the event schedule is printed
on the poster,

566
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,331
the prize winner can sue us.

567
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,900
And we've also scheduled
to guest on Entertainment Tonight.

568
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,336
Shall I beg? Should I beg, President Kim?

569
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,573
First off, meet the prize winner
and see if the schedule can be adjusted.

570
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,942
If not, we'll have to provide
monetary compensation.

571
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,744
Also, try to adjust the TV schedule.

572
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,713
President Kim!

573
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,849
But start with suing Oska Entertainment.

574
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,651
Make sure it's reported
on the evening news.

575
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,622
President Kim! Hey, Joo-won!

576
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,492
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message...

577
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,230
Do you want to die? Are you a kid?

578
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,399
When will you ever grow up?

579
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,135
If you don't want Oska Entertainment
to go bankrupt, call me right away!

580
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,554
How did you find out where I am?

581
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,723
Do you know what I hate the most?

582
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,726
I can understand people
who don't recognize me.

583
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,730
I can forgive those
who mispronounce my name.

584
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,867
But I can't tolerate people who ignore me

585
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,702
even though they recognize me.

586
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:39,703
So, what do you want?

587
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,305
I know agencies are trying to scout you.

588
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,973
That's why you think you're special, but--

589
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,409
Leave that kind of advice
for celebrity hopefuls.

590
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:47,978
Fine.

591
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,015
I know my singing was pretty bad

592
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,684
over the phone last time.

593
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,919
I wasn't feeling so great--

594
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:56,987
Then, try again.

595
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,924
-What?
-If that's your excuse, try again.

596
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,861
What is this kid saying?

597
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,463
I'm Oska, the Korean Wave star! So...

598
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,532
I'll sing quietly.

599
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,201
Geez...

600
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,175
That's enough.

601
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,610
Stop him better next time.

602
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,481
Hey, if I tried this much,
shouldn't you at least listen to me?

603
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,151
Why listen to something that
everyone knows? You want to scout me?

604
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,554
But you're not a person
who can train anyone.

605
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,223
You're someone who wants
to shine on your own.

606
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,627
I don't want to be in your shadow. Got it?

607
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,467
He's a total psychic.

608
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,602
You, wait here.

609
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,070
Oska.

610
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,172
Why?

611
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,373
I can sing quite well too.

612
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,208
Then, sing while you wait for me.

613
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,013
I know you.

614
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,749
Everyone in the country knows me.

615
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,286
Did you come to travel?

616
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,488
Are you alone?

617
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,624
People are all alone.

618
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,063
How about a light drink
since we're both here alone?

619
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,799
Geez...

620
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,380
How about a strong drink?

621
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,423
How about at this point...

622
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,393
It's a car stunt.

623
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,398
Jeong-hwan will flip the car
and Ju-man will do the chase scene.

624
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:22,499
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

625
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,434
What is the plot?
Is there a female role too?

626
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,638
Gil Ra-im, you won the lottery.
This is Oska's music video.

627
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,940
-The entire shoot is on Jeju Island.
-"Oska"?

628
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,542
Really? When is it?

629
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:33,543
Focus.

630
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,146
We have to leave tomorrow,
so, we don't have much time.

631
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,782
Check the gear before getting off work

632
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:42,019
and gather at the airport by 9 a.m.
Don't be late. Dismissed.

633
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:42,953
Yes, sir!

634
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,855
What about me?
What will I be doing, Director?

635
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,657
You will not be included in this shoot.

636
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,726
What? Why?

637
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,396
Do I have to wear a wig again?
We should just take her.

638
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,898
Do you want to be removed too?
Let me know now.

639
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,700
Where's the wig? Let's give it some curls.

640
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,769
I'm quite good at curling.

641
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,604
Why can't I do it?

642
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,974
Experience is the most important thing
for car stunts and you don't have any.

643
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,509
That's why I should do it.

644
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,511
I really practiced a lot.

645
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,479
I can do this.

646
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,182
Director, you've seen Death Proof too.

647
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,685
I can do a good job like Zoë Bell.

648
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,821
Then, you should go to Hollywood.
I can't turn you into her.

649
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,357
-Why? I--
-You can't because it's dangerous!

650
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,694
Honestly,
I want to make you quit this job...

651
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,701
But I'm holding back
because I respect your decision.

652
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,337
Go now.
I have to look through the storyboard.

653
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,065
A-yeong, this is Director Lim.

654
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,335
I called to request a favor.

655
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,237
It's difficult.

656
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,842
I was wondering if you could lie to Ra-im.

657
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,684
I almost forgot.

658
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,620
I bought an extra bag when I bought mine.

659
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,088
I thought you could use a new one.

660
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,289
It's a bag?

661
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,525
I was going to buy one anyway.

662
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,927
Are you sure it's not expensive?

663
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,464
It's not. I get an employee discount.

664
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,368
You know, a woman's life
depends on her bag.

665
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,571
How did you know that?
I realized it only recently.

666
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,411
It's so pretty!
I think I'm going to faint.

667
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,313
Thank you so much.

668
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,548
It's nothing.

669
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,317
Did you return the vacuum cleaner?

670
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,454
Don't even say any word
that starts with "V."

671
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,023
Why am I so unlucky these days?

672
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,793
It's our unlucky year. What's wrong?

673
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,495
I lost my chance to do a car stunt today.

674
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:06,963
It was Oska's music video, too.

675
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,833
The director said that he won't take me.

676
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,768
Who? Oska?

677
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,704
Hold on.

678
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,408
If I had the money for a plane ticket,
I would just fly there.

679
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,012
What is it, Mr. Kim?

680
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:25,749
Ra-im did?

681
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,851
-Really?
-Why?

682
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:29,786
What about me?

683
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:39,296
This is the Jaecheon promotion schedule
and its brochures for Bisong.

684
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,499
The construction is nearly complete
and will finish in early December.

685
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,436
Good. I will personally
work on the sales this time,

686
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,038
so, don't let Mr. Park lay a hand on it.

687
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,540
Tell them to report
the Bisong Resort reports directly to me.

688
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,509
I have to impress grandfather.

689
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,744
I will do the presentation,
so, arrange the schedule.

690
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,745
Understood.

691
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,882
Have you met the prize winner?

692
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,818
Yes, I was just about to tell you.

693
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,355
One moment.

694
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,226
Choi U-yeong, do you want to die?

695
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:12,696
That's right. You want to kill me, right?

696
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,098
Then, let me out of here first.

697
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,633
I'm at the police station.

698
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,601
Where?

699
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,836
I met someone for business yesterday.

700
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,778
What you said was right.

701
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,747
You should never work under me.

702
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,552
It doesn't look good
to be jealous of your protégé.

703
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,622
But keep on singing.

704
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,791
Instead, don't work
with anyone else either.

705
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,362
Goodbye.

706
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,735
I looked super cool
the moment I turned around.

707
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,141
At first, I thought they wanted
my autograph.

708
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:01,311
But you know I don't give my autograph
to anyone.

709
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,715
Would you like an autograph?

710
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:11,087
I was going to walk away proudly
but they wouldn't get out of my way.

711
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,257
So, I said it more dominantly...

712
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,725
Do you want an autograph on your back?

713
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,495
"Autograph"? That sounds good.

714
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,398
Would you like to sign a contract
to give up your body?

715
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,367
We're the Silver Hairtail Gang

716
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,704
because once we bite, we don't let go.

717
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,706
Was the hairtail such a ferocious fish?

718
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,779
They're claiming that

719
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,348
I insulted their boss' lover.

720
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,817
You know me. I might sleep with...

721
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,421
I'm the type to sleep with someone,

722
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,089
not insult them.

723
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,457
Of course, I know.

724
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,294
I also know that this
shouldn't be exposed to the press

725
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,363
and I know that you don't want
to be imprisoned.

726
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:58,501
Most of all,
I know that you've messed up my promotion.

727
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,805
But you also know that I wouldn't
let you out for free.

728
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,473
Are you serious?

729
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,608
Should I not be?

730
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,678
Then, have you thought about
what you can do for me?

731
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,714
Have you ever asked for my opinion?

732
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,983
Stop beating around the bush
and just say it!

733
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,321
I'll tell you later.
Look forward to it as always.

734
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,659
Call our attorney
and tell him to let Choi U-yeong out.

735
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,494
He's in a police station on Jeju Island.

736
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,564
Are you that excited?

737
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,869
What were you about to say
about the meeting with the prize winner?

738
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,804
It's not a big problem.

739
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:39,676
I met the first-place winner
yesterday after several phone calls.

740
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,178
ROMANTIC GETAWAY WITH OSKA
ON JEJU ISLAND

741
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,949
I didn't think I would win
the first prize.

742
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,053
I've been a fan of Oskie
for eight years now.

743
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,890
Do you call him, "Oskie"?

744
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,626
He's handsome, tall, and wealthy!
He deserves to be called, "Oskie"!

745
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,096
Oskie...

746
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,600
Please call the second-place prize winner.

747
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,567
Yes, sir.

748
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,710
Do you happen to know Oska?

749
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,215
The calcium supplement?

750
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,620
Thus, the first prize winner received

751
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,755
pregnancy items
amounting to the travel prize

752
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,791
and the second prize went to
the second winner.

753
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,894
So, we had to settle
on the third prize winner.

754
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,799
What? Which prize winner? Who?

755
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,300
Yes, her.

756
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,869
She said she'd do anything
if we just sent her to Jeju Island.

757
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,272
No! Send the fourth prize winner!

758
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,475
No, check Oska's anti-fan club,

759
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,210
and find the person
who uploads Oska's singing

760
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,611
with the backing track removed.

761
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,046
Tell the person we'll pay for the trip.

762
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,482
But Gil Ra-im has already left.

763
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:53,616
What?

764
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,491
SEOGWIPO JUNGMUN-DONG 2563-1
I'M OFF TO JEJU!

765
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,667
But why did she leave already?
It's scheduled for next week.

766
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,039
Gil Ra-im's stunt team is shooting
Oska's music video there.

767
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,674
That's why she wanted to go a bit early.

768
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,176
So, you're saying that

769
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:25,548
you sent Oska and Gil Ra-im on a trip
with my own money?

770
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,886
This place is a good fit
for the last location.

771
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,690
Here. Our entire staff worked on this.

772
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,659
We won't need props, costume,
or special effects. We don't have time.

773
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:40,530
The female actress will be Park Chae-rin.

774
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:41,831
Bring her, no matter what.

775
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,199
With only a week left?

776
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,436
Does that mean,
"I'm not good enough. Fire me"?

777
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,904
No.

778
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,641
Tell her it's Oska's music video.
She'll shoot tonight if she has to.

779
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:52,642
Contact her.

780
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,178
When will the stunt team get here?

781
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,482
Thank you for coming such a long way.

782
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,619
It might be inconvenient
to use the same hotel as the actors,

783
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,288
but we need to be together
for the schedule.

784
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,624
Then, will Oska also be staying
in this hotel?

785
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,826
He's already stayed for a few days now.

786
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,296
Please unpack
and we will meet here after an hour.

787
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,498
We'll go over our schedule during lunch.

788
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,699
Yes, ma'am.

789
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,802
-Let's go.
-Here's your key.

790
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:34,818
It's you!

791
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,520
How are you here? Are you on a trip?

792
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,355
Something like that.

793
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,059
I'm the winner
of the romantic getaway with Oska.

794
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,496
Who did? You? Really?

795
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,497
Isn't it weird?

796
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:48,665
It sure is!

797
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,501
This can't happen.

798
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,069
Why?

799
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,572
I believe in things like fate very easily.

800
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,108
It seems like we're
fated to be together, right?

801
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,878
Thank you for welcoming me.

802
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,448
Do you think that it ends there?
I'll treat you to lunch too.

803
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,350
Have you had lunch?

804
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,551
Man, I'm starving.

805
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,622
I just came from the police station.

806
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,857
"The police station"?

807
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,825
I stole something.

808
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,227
What did you steal?

809
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,464
A woman's heart?

810
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,905
Then, I guess you'll be going back soon.

811
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,007
Then, that would increase my penalty.

812
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:34,677
Well, I will just go again.
What shall we eat?

813
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,664
You're ten minutes late.

814
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,648
