1
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,377
You're ten minutes late.

2
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,379
What is this? Why are you here?

3
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,782
I keep track of my creditors.

4
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,519
She looks familiar.

5
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,220
I invited her.

6
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,256
Ms. Gil is my guest today.

7
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,526
But your guest can't keep her eyes off me.

8
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,198
It looks more like she's staring you down.

9
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,499
I know.

10
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,968
I told her she was prettier angry.

11
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,503
Jerk.

12
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,039
You're indeed the woman I know.

13
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,042
Let's sit here.

14
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,446
What's going on here?

15
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,749
I'm honestly curious.

16
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,618
How do you two know each other?

17
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,555
There are about 230 countries
in the world,

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,124
and people like yours truly
speak five languages.

19
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,926
Nevertheless,

20
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,629
there are no words to describe
our relationship.

21
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,033
What a load of crap.

22
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,802
What's good here?

23
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,242
I'm sorry, but all the tables are booked.

24
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,877
They are?

25
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,347
Who's the jerk who booked all the tables?

26
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,282
-Him?
-Yes.

27
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,625
Have you forgotten? If you book a table,
I just buy the whole restaurant.

28
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,895
Did Jeju Island prison food
suit your palate?

29
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,465
I see that doing time
makes your beauty shine.

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,374
Right? My beauty shines
regardless of time or place.

31
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,710
This is how he is.

32
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,279
Let us leave him out and raise a toast.

33
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,847
Sounds good.

34
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,186
To Jeju Island's blue night
that will unfold before us

35
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,724
and to your eyes,
darker and more beautiful than the night.

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,662
Perhaps the beauty of my eyes owes itself

37
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,765
to the star before me

38
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,302
briefly visiting from the sky above.

39
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,471
You found me out.

40
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,974
Let me know if I'm too dazzling.
I'll sit backwards.

41
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,911
No, I would rather

42
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,646
go blind.

43
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,419
Truth is, I have been your fan
for three years.

44
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,123
May I call you "Oskie"?

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,991
-Of course.
-"Oskie"?

46
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:16,262
You must not know,
but I'm a very easy man.

47
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,098
Well, you see,

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,235
I don't play hard-to-get, either.

49
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,270
This is nuts. Insane.

50
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,907
Be quiet.

51
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:42,622
There is a woman who loves you

52
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:49,362
The woman devotes herself to loving you

53
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,966
Like a shadow

54
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,269
She follows you around every day

55
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,707
Inwardly, the woman

56
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,376
Silently cries out

57
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:12,285
How much longer must I endure

58
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:18,891
Merely waiting for you

59
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,595
Suffering from this terrible love

60
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,898
Suffering from this terrible love

61
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,103
To get you to love me back?

62
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,919
-Who did this?
-What a mess.

63
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,220
Who did this?

64
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,791
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

65
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,893
I'll buy all of those.

66
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,960
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,600
-You got a text message!
-You got a text message!

68
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,337
Why is it so tight?

69
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,090
Ms. Gil, I'll be right back.

70
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,832
Stop right there.

71
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,670
I told you I won't play second fiddle.

72
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,606
Don't. You kissed that goodbye.

73
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,877
I was just released.
Did you call the cops?

74
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,646
You would've been killed otherwise.

75
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,516
-We pay taxes for police assistance.
-I pay more taxes than you.

76
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,187
Chump change would have settled it.
What if it made online news?

77
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,389
"Chump change would have settled it"?

78
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,325
The rich sure have it easy.

79
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,296
Yes, we do. But you put a damper
on my easygoing life.

80
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,431
-Is that why you did it?
-Did what?

81
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,901
Being rude as in reserving all the tables
just for the three of you.

82
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,004
But that was--

83
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:56,042
Do you think you can mock my performance
because you perform at Tokyo Dome?

84
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,078
And you claim to cultivate young talent?

85
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,746
Hey, that isn't what happened--

86
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,050
What can you teach if you look down
on other people's performances?

87
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,957
-Let me speak. I can mouth off too.
-Let go.

88
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,892
I didn't book the tables.

89
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,328
And I never looked down
on your performance.

90
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,831
I have never looked down on
anyone's performance.

91
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,236
Because everyone is better than me.

92
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,441
You told me to be honest
if I took pains to come all this way.

93
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,644
I understand.

94
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,113
So let go while I'm being nice.

95
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,116
Then be mean.

96
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,687
I'm looking out for you
for the first time by telling you this.

97
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,790
I like men.

98
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,326
What?

99
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,528
I'm gay.

100
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,032
Get out of here.

101
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,536
That desperate to be rid of me?

102
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,137
Is that the approach that's in right now?

103
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,379
Right. There are quite a few
in our industry.

104
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,982
Isn't that just a difference in taste?

105
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,584
Who cares?

106
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,620
Do you really think so?

107
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,323
I'll think about it again.

108
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,559
Wuss.

109
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,610
What?

110
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,313
"I would rather go blind."

111
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,250
"May I call you 'Oskie'?"

112
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,752
When was my voice that nasal?

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,721
See? Why do you give me

114
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,924
the death stare but turn into
a doe-eyed teen in front of U-yeong?

115
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,927
Because unlike someone,
Oskie makes me feel like a girl,

116
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,331
not a poor, marginalized charity case.

117
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,468
Your Oskie has a horde of girls
just like you on a global scale.

118
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,772
What is important is that right now,
my dear Oskie is right in front of me.

119
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,407
This is driving me crazy.

120
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,209
Don't you read the papers?

121
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,946
Your "dear Oskie" is a womanizer.

122
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,681
The women I got off his back alone--

123
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,483
Get that woman off your back then.

124
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,852
She has been staring intently at you.

125
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,691
It really is you.

126
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,563
I was thinking about you
as I strolled down the beach.

127
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,899
And then I magically run into you.

128
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,236
What brings you all the way
to Jeju Island?

129
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,605
Work. I'm location scouting.

130
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,875
If I had known
we would meet as if by fate,

131
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,113
we would not have had to suffer
such a stuffy start.

132
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,450
Or we might have never had
to start at all.

133
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,285
Your friends are waiting.

134
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,188
Oh, please.

135
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,957
I far outrank them.

136
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,092
You can go ahead.

137
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,130
I see

138
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,798
that you're with someone.

139
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,602
Yes. I have never had a tougher time
getting a woman to dine with me.

140
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,146
I hate to pry, but who are your parents?

141
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,181
Please go if you know you're prying.

142
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,519
This woman has a temper.
I'm worried that she'll up and leave.

143
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,855
I asked you twice to go.

144
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,394
Let us magically run into each other
like this again.

145
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,298
It was nice meeting you.

146
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,143
What is it? Where are you going?

147
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,788
Excuse me.

148
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,064
You know me, right?

149
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,166
I do. I just saw you.

150
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,268
That isn't what I mean. You know me.

151
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,370
Do you know me?

152
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,574
You know me. Do you really not remember?

153
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,743
No, I don't. Who are you?

154
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,011
You're a twit if you ask me who I am.

155
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,981
I found your friend's purse.

156
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,417
Purse?

157
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,620
Yes, it's me.

158
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,189
The world is smaller than people think.

159
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,995
You have the wrong person.

160
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,264
No, I don't.

161
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,501
I'm telling you
that you have the wrong person.

162
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,170
-Then why is your voice shaking?
-Excuse me!

163
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,772
Drop the act.

164
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,075
Should I make you say
that apologizing was the easiest?

165
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,110
Is this how rich folks are?

166
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,715
You almost cost my friend her job
to which she devoted five years.

167
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,251
We agreed to call it even,
yet you broke your end of the deal

168
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,919
and called the department store?

169
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,188
Do you enjoy living like that?
Is it rewarding?

170
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,289
That's enough.

171
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,462
Why are you acting like this
in a public place?

172
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,731
Are you okay?

173
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,070
I can't breathe.

174
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,907
As if.

175
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,710
You know nothing, so don't butt in.

176
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,379
I wish that were the case,

177
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,582
but I was briefed
and Ms. Lim explained what happened,

178
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,584
so I know more about it than you do.

179
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,052
-So simmer down and apologize.
-What?

180
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,887
Apologize to her.

181
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,723
Why should I?

182
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,926
People who use our VVIP lounge
earned that right

183
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,662
by spending
100 million won or more per year.

184
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,065
But because of you,
their right was violated that day.

185
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,469
Fine. Let's say it was.

186
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,207
But was me entering that stupid lounge
that grave an offense?

187
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,275
Did I sell out my country?

188
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,045
He who steals an egg will steal an ox.

189
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,953
If I had known
things would get so out of hand,

190
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,722
I wouldn't have said anything.

191
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,792
I'm upset at my moral rectitude
as I must speak up

192
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,894
when I see injustice.

193
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,231
There is no need for you to be upset.
You apologize too.

194
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,132
Pardon?

195
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,001
If you agreed to call it even,
you should have.

196
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,903
A promise is a promise.

197
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,072
I never made such a promise.

198
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,541
She found your friend's purse.

199
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,910
It was not my purse.

200
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,313
You haven't learned your lesson yet.

201
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,148
-Come here.
-Stop it.

202
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,584
Would the two of you

203
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,120
give us a moment?

204
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,989
Please.

205
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,757
Please, Ms. Gil.

206
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,610
Are you sulking?

207
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,913
Are you?

208
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,049
How can you ignore me when I'm--

209
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,886
How could you do that?

210
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,554
Just as I expected.

211
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,424
I was not defending her.

212
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,192
I was merely defending a principle--

213
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,428
Who are these people
who spend 100 million won

214
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,399
at a department store
and in just a year at that?

215
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,769
What makes them so vastly greater than me?

216
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,406
You wouldn't understand
even if I explained it.

217
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,775
Will you explain in English?

218
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,678
Explain. I'll do the understanding.

219
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,147
How much do you have in the bank?

220
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,884
Not much. Why?

221
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,853
That is it. That is what's different.

222
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,021
What?

223
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,490
You know your bank balance,

224
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,993
but those people
who are different from you don't,

225
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,163
since their local and overseas
bank balances grow by the second.

226
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,700
This was the easy part.

227
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,034
Now, do you know

228
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:14,606
what is engendered by the different
means and amount of wealth allocation?

229
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:16,976
Social classes.

230
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,112
They spend 100 million won a year
for just two goals:

231
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,448
inequality and discrimination.

232
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,151
If they can't rule and dominate,
they want to utterly discriminate.

233
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,954
That is their mindset and rationale.

234
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,259
Is that how you think too?

235
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,295
There is no reason not to.

236
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,235
Find my bike key.
I'll pick it up when I return to Seoul.

237
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,617
What happened? Why are you here?

238
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,586
Well...

239
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,321
What's going on?

240
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,390
Aren't you here for a music video shoot?

241
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,891
I'm asking you what happened.

242
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,559
Why are you here, not in Seoul?

243
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,731
You can scold me.

244
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,334
You don't have to give me a part.

245
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,936
I'll just watch the car stunt scene.

246
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,139
Or I can be a helper.

247
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,474
Please just don't tell me to leave.

248
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,744
So you followed us in secret
all the way here?

249
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,848
I happened to score a free flight.

250
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,683
No wonder you called.

251
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,992
Where are you staying?

252
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,327
You don't need to worry about that.

253
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,264
I know there is a 24-hour Jjimjilbang
20 minutes away.

254
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,433
What? A Jjimjilbang?

255
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,936
Have you always been this reckless?

256
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,441
Or are you ignoring what I'm saying
because you got too big for your britches?

257
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,209
That isn't true.

258
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,410
Yet this is what you do?

259
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,852
We'll finish location scouting
in two hours, so wait in my room.

260
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,387
We need to talk today.

261
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,388
Yes, sir.

262
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,690
See you later.

263
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,592
Score.

264
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,295
How can you be happy about this?

265
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,363
A man asked you to wait in his hotel room.

266
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,200
It is windy on Jeju Island.

267
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,436
Should I take a shower?

268
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,271
Do what?

269
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,213
Oh, hey. I need a room--

270
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,981
Welcome, sir.

271
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,816
All is well here, right?

272
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,352
As I briefed you at the meeting,

273
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,855
overseas visitors are responding
very positively--

274
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,257
Relax. I'm here to unwind.

275
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,726
Set up a room right away.

276
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,094
Because of the music video shoot

277
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,465
and the sudden influx of Oska fans,

278
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,900
there aren't any vacancies.

279
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,103
We just barely managed
to get you a room...

280
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,839
"Just barely"? What are you talking about?

281
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,508
There's the room I always stay at.

282
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,378
Someone else's luggage has been there
for several days already...

283
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,646
"Someone else's luggage"?

284
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,749
Is it Choi U-yeong's?

285
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,585
That bastard.

286
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,625
Was this a coincidence?

287
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,227
Don't you know me?

288
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,830
So you came all this way to see me?

289
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,964
Is that how it works out?

290
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,134
How did you know I was here?

291
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,602
That wasn't hard to find out.

292
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,071
Even Oska's middle school fans
can look it up easily.

293
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,410
Was there a reason for us
to see each other again?

294
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,379
No, so I created a reason.

295
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,480
"Created"?

296
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,082
Oh, Joo-won?

297
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,885
-You went on a blind date.
-So you know.

298
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,522
Talks between my parents and his
seem to be quite far along.

299
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,559
And you? How do you feel about him?

300
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,595
He is the top one percent
of the top one percent.

301
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,431
He is probably
the number one most eligible bachelor.

302
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,734
But like I said, I'm here because of you,
not Kim Joo-won.

303
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,938
I want us to be friends again.

304
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,975
We'll become family soon.
Won't it be uncomfortable as is?

305
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,643
You're something else.

306
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,948
-How can it be that easy?
-Why not?

307
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,351
While our relationship
didn't end amicably,

308
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,254
it wasn't passionate enough
for us to be hung up about it.

309
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:23,956
What?

310
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,924
We weren't in love.

311
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,960
That is what I thought.

312
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,532
Who was that woman earlier,

313
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,501
the lowbrow woman Joo-won was with?

314
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,838
Watch your mouth. She isn't with Joo-won.
She's with me.

315
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,873
You have got to be kidding.

316
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,142
What happened to your standards?

317
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,079
I told you to watch your mouth.
She's with me.

318
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,814
Do you not get what I mean?

319
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,149
I'm seeing her.

320
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,219
You're lying.

321
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,388
She isn't your type.

322
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,025
Neither were you.

323
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,562
The love songs I have written thus far
have been about you.

324
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,534
But I don't want to write
any more songs about you.

325
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,838
Please step out of my songs now

326
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,342
and be the heroine of my life.

327
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,432
This is the biggest diamond they had here.

328
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,334
Should it be bigger?

329
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,036
Pity. I feel so bad.

330
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,877
You're a has-been star to me,

331
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,715
but it appears you planned to marry me.

332
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,551
You're more naive than I thought.

333
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,353
How disappointing.

334
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,491
You fool around briefly with celebrities
when you're young, not marry them.

335
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,227
Don't you know I'm inheriting
my dad's business?

336
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,832
I was getting tired of you anyway.
You should have waited a bit longer.

337
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:47,866
Then,

338
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,969
at least we wouldn't have to end it
like this.

339
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,738
Did you break your finger?

340
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,974
Why bang on the door
when there is a doorbell?

341
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,276
Should we work out if you're free?

342
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,512
How about mountain biking?
All the gear is still here.

343
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,714
No. It's cold.

344
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,115
Just give me back my room.

345
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,521
If you beat me, I'll move to Gangnam.

346
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,628
I mean it. The Icheon house will be yours.
And I'll vacate the room here too.

347
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,130
What do you want
that you're raising the stakes this high?

348
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,799
Gil Ra-im.

349
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,133
Stop joking.

350
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,335
This isn't a joke. I desperately need her.

351
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,305
Scared you'll lose?

352
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,328
Let's just take one car. Where's the map?

353
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,830
In the car.

354
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,272
Get my bike from U-yeong's room.

355
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,240
Yes, sir.

356
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,620
The trail here is treacherous.
You can still speak up if you're scared.

357
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,489
It's not that you're the one who's scared?

358
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,460
If you lose, you have no say
in my relationship with Gil Ra-im.

359
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,630
She will not fall for you.

360
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,365
Maybe you don't know each other well.

361
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:05,504
You can't give up anything for a woman,
but I can give up everything.

362
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,573
Women instinctively know that,

363
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,609
especially poor women.

364
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,013
We are all set. Shall we go?

365
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,047
Shall we?

366
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:20,285
-Yes. But I won't cut you any slack.
-Fine.

367
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,788
She's someone I need, albeit by chance,

368
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,557
so I can't let you win either.

369
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,660
Fine. Let's go.

370
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,729
Wait.

371
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,233
May I come along too?
I'm a pretty good biker.

372
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,368
You can't ride in the back.

373
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,869
I'm not asking you.

374
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,438
A chance to bike with Oska

375
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,574
doesn't come often.

376
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,576
Sounds great. Come with us.

377
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,380
But this is a race to take
what the other wants.

378
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,381
Are you okay with that?

379
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,950
Really? That's great.

380
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,954
I was actually going to
plead you for a favor.

381
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,057
But all I have to do now is win.

382
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,860
I knew we had a connection.
What's the favor?

383
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,032
If I win,
please cast me in your music video.

384
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,466
That's it?

385
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,403
It's way too easy.

386
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,638
What did you two wager?

387
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,473
What will you wager?

388
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,289
We are at the summit here.
The finish line is that lighthouse.

389
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,092
Whoever gets there first wins.

390
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:35,961
There is basically only one trail.

391
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,698
No shortcuts here. You can't get back out
if you go into the woods to shave time.

392
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,600
Are you telling me so I don't make it out?

393
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,368
I'm saying it because I'm worried.

394
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,270
Are you sure about this?

395
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,005
If I say no,
will you carry me on your back?

396
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,107
I'll carry you in my arms
so I can see you.

397
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,777
Let's go.

398
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,146
Take a deep breath. Ready?

399
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,953
Here I go!

400
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,391
WAY TO COASTAL ROAD

401
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,338
Dear A-yeong,

402
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,875
The brilliant sun is
about to set before me.

403
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,912
When you first came
to submit your job application,

404
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,048
I wonder what the sunset was like.

405
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,384
The moment you said, "Excuse me,"

406
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,521
that day,

407
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,492
you already had my everything.

408
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,429
So please don't stay angry.

409
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,566
Because to So-mi in PR,

410
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,936
I'm just some guy next door.

411
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,305
Love

412
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,208
will return!

413
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,646
Dang.

414
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,716
Creepy.

415
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,252
How was it? It was a masterpiece, right?

416
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,988
I'm going to send it to A-yeong
right away, so...

417
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,091
Hey, they're coming. They're coming.

418
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,956
-Go!
-Quick!

419
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,225
-Go!
-Here!

420
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,927
Go!

421
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,502
What is it? What's wrong?

422
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,107
I won!

423
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,610
Gil Ra-im, do you hear me? No?

424
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,245
I won!

425
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,546
Gil Ra-im, what's wrong?

426
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,382
Gil Ra-im!

427
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,785
Answer me!

428
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,221
Look at you.

429
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,756
Faking it because you're embarrassed
you lost, right?

430
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,292
I heard a scream just now.

431
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,629
Ra-im, Ra-im, Gil Ra-im, come in, over.

432
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,998
There was no scream--

433
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,568
I heard it. I heard it. We hear you.

434
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,638
Hey, Gil Ra-im, where are you right now?

435
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,440
Where are you?

436
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,575
Respond, you stupid girl!

437
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,644
Did she take a tumble somewhere?
Get the map.

438
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,946
Call 911.

439
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,615
-You search the coastal road.
-Okay.

440
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,187
Gil Ra-im.

441
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,456
Gil Ra-im!

442
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,092
Gil Ra-im, where are you?

443
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,828
Gil Ra-im.

444
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,201
Gil Ra-im, where are you?

445
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,504
Respond, will you?

446
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,908
Gil Ra-im.

447
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,679
Gil Ra-im!

448
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,050
Gil Ra-im!

449
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,522
Gil Ra-im, where are you?

450
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,146
You're done for once I find you.

451
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,617
U-yeong.

452
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,519
Hey. Did you find her?

453
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,288
No. Anything on your end?

454
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:41,192
No. We backtracked the whole way down
the coastal road, but we didn't see her.

455
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,194
Could something have happened?

456
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,531
Even if it did, she would be
the perpetrator, not the victim.

457
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,666
I'll look again as I make my way down.

458
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,640
What does she look like?

459
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,042
Her attire?

460
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,410
What was she wearing?

461
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,479
Her clothes?

462
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,915
If President Kim dressed her,

463
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,650
something nice?

464
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,418
Pardon?

465
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,255
She was on a bike.
She went missing around here.

466
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,257
-I haven't seen her.
-She has short hair.

467
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,660
May I ask you a question?

468
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:20,098
Have you seen a woman around 163cm tall
on a bike?

469
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,100
Gil Ra-im.

470
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,904
Gil Ra-im!

471
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,815
WAY TO COASTAL ROAD

472
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,794
Gil Ra-im.

473
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,564
Gil Ra-im!

474
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,235
Gil Ra-im!

475
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,238
Gil Ra-im!

476
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,375
Gil Ra-im, where are you?

477
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,212
Gil Ra-im, where are you?

478
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,516
Gil Ra-im!

479
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,292
Gil Ra-im.

480
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,761
Gil Taeng-ja!

481
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,663
Where are you?

482
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,886
What are you doing here?

483
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:50,888
You haven't gone back?

484
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,290
What?

485
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,659
"What are you doing here?"

486
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,595
Have you gone mad?
Do you have a death wish?

487
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,497
Why did you join the race
when you suck at biking?

488
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,466
You bragged that much
but couldn't even follow us?

489
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,534
You don't know your way around,
so why enter the woods?

490
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,837
I followed the map to a tee.

491
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,606
But the trail disappeared,
so what could I do?

492
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,475
Are you saving your phone
for a special occasion?

493
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,010
Do you carry a walkie-talkie for show?
Why didn't you answer?

494
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,614
This whole area is kooky.

495
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,650
The walkie-talkie is dead,
and the phone gets no signal.

496
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,488
And that broke down too.

497
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,523
That's expensive, right?

498
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,924
Who cares about that right now?

499
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,228
Are you okay? You're not hurt anywhere?

500
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,297
I ruined my chances
of doing my first car stunt.

501
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,201
Is Oska looking for me too by any chance?

502
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,837
So what if he is?

503
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,907
You scared me half to death.

504
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,376
Then what were those screams about?

505
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,744
"Screams"?

506
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,513
I never screamed.

507
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,016
What are you talking about?
You yelled over the walkie-talkie twice.

508
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:53,918
No, I didn't.

509
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,555
What is a scream?
A sound you make when startled.

510
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,259
But if I were startled, would I take out
my walkie-talkie, press a button,

511
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,594
and scream into it
not just once but twice?

512
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,263
I'm going mad.

513
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,265
I definitely heard screams.

514
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,966
Fine. Let's say you did.

515
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,868
But it wasn't me.

516
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,104
You said you heard screeching
on your walkie-talkie.

517
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,140
But when I get startled, I yelp

518
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,110
in a very cute, pretty way, okay?

519
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,579
"Cute and pretty"?

520
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,783
You've gotten weird because I keep
telling you that you're pretty.

521
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,151
Where are you going?

522
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,721
There is a restaurant over there,
so I'll go call a cab.

523
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,989
Unbelievable.

524
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,425
What restaurant is this deep
in the mountains, you dimwit?

525
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,261
"Dimwit"?

526
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,897
What is that then?

527
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,133

Excuse us. We are kind of stranded.

534
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,036
Could we use your phone--

535
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,805
Baeksuk, 30,000 won.
Dakbokkeumtang, 20,000 won.

536
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:55,740
Which will it be?

537
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,009
We won't be eating.
We will just pay 30,000 won for--

538
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,113
You can have half of each too.

539
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,447
What is wrong with this area?

540
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,149
Am I getting through or not?

541
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,452
SECRET GARDEN

542
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,337
This looks delicious.

543
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,311
We can do that...

544
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,427
Eat away. That'll make me happy.

545
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,238
You're not sick, are you?

546
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,242
You don't have
cancer, leukemia, or some such--

547
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,377
Pardon?

548
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,779
No, right? You're rich and young.

549
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,686
As for you, young lady,

550
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,355
nice to see you.

551
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,924
It is very nice to see you.

552
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,094
Yes. Likewise.

553
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,931
You must enjoy making wines.

554
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,467
That's my only pastime.

555
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:07,438
My dad's pastime was winemaking too.

556
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,907
He preferred drinking wine to making it.

557
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,108
Pardon?

558
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,611
You like wine with your meals, right?

559
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,280
I bet you started drinking
when you were in high school.

560
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,782
How did you know?

561
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,751
My dad taught me how to drink
over dinners when I was in high school.

562
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,387
What? When did you learn how to drink?

563
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,589
You drank in high school?

564
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,525
The wine you have with dinner is medicine.

565
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,963
Are those healthy medicinal wines?

566
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,299
They are medicinal wines

567
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,869
that will save our daughter's life.

568
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,340
I see. Is your daughter ill?

569
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,777
That is her fate.

570
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,447
Pardon?

571
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,791
Yes. We just pulled into the hotel.

572
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,595
We're fine, so don't worry and go to bed.

573
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,330
Okay.

574
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,633
Was that Oska?
Was he worried sick about me?

575
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,968
What if he was?

576
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,471
I can't even ask?

577
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,339
No. Don't ask. Because it pisses me off.

578
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,341
Why did you accept those?

579
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,443
Was I to refuse a gift from an elder?

580
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,679
She said they were
healthful medicinal wines.

581
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,714
You will drink yourself to good health?

582
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,484
Tell me the truth.
There is a dude inside of you, right?

583
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,186
There are a few of them.

584
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,455
The shy one

585
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,858
among them

586
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,993
wants me to relay a message to you.

587
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,127
What message?

588
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,730
That he thanks you for earlier

589
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,900
for coming to get him.

590
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,705
Then you should have thanked me
when I came to get you.

591
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,574
Why wait until now to thank me, mister?

592
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,677
If you keep this up,
the fistfighting dude might pay a visit.

593
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,680
Here.

594
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,351
No, thanks.
I don't consume goods of spurious origins.

595
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,919
This isn't for you.

596
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,754
I want you to give it to Oska.

597
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,756
God and man alike would be appalled.

598
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,425
I saved you, so why give this to him?

599
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,694
But you don't consume goods
of spurious origins.

600
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,096
I didn't know until just now.

601
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,597
Forget about it. Give it back.

602
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,666
I'll give it to him myself.

603
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,935
You can't take a gift back.

604
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:19,904
Give it back.

605
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,105
-No.
-Give it back.

606
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,773
-The have-nots are worse.
-Give--

607
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,441
I'm sorry.

608
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,182
I thought I told you to wait in the room.

609
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,653
I stepped out briefly--

610
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,954
To go where?

611
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,390
Why did you come to Jeju Island?

612
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,859
On vacation because Seoul was boring?

613
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,762
That isn't it.

614
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,463
Do you know how late it is?

615
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,265
Come with me.

616
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:50,935
Wait.

617
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,538
There are no vacancies here today.

618
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,274
Are you going to stay in the same room?

619
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:02,413
It isn't weird for members of
our action school family to share rooms.

620
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,989
It is weird. Of course it's weird.

621
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,429
It was wrong of me to leave the room.

622
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,465
But I'm not here on vacation.

623
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,701
This is a rare opportunity for me--

624
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,336
Am I stupid?

625
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,838
Or do I not want you to do well?

626
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,408
I told you you're still insufficient
and you should wait.

627
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,744
Why do you want to do something
that dangerous?

628
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,548
I would not have started this work
if I was scared of getting hurt.

629
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,151
If I'm good, I don't want to lose out
because I'm a woman.

630
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:46,056
Find another job or team if you don't want
to lose out for being a woman.

631
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,826
I'll make you lose out
until the day I die.

632
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,930
Pack your stuff and come to my room.

633
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,098
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

634
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,635
Go to their room.
I can't stand the sight of you.

635
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,573
Sir.

636
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,353
What is it?

637
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,322
You may be okay
with men and women sharing a room,

638
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,824
but I find it very weird.

639
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,360
I vacated my room. Let's go.

640
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,762
She is my family.

641
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,597
I'll take care of her for a few days

642
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,465
since she won my department store's event.

643
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,671
What is he talking about? What event?

644
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,639
What are you doing?

645
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,941
I won't convince you otherwise
if you're uncomfortable,

646
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,277
but would you really be against
using an empty room?

647
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,146
I can stay with U-yeong.

648
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,447
Does he mean

649
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:48,686
"Romantic Getaway with Oska" or something?

650
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,154
Yes.

651
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,856
So you actually won that?

652
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:54,825
Pardon?

653
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,562
What have I done?

654
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,698
Then was it you--

655
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,467
Get going. Why are you standing there?

656
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,803
Just a moment.

657
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:07,905
What is the room number?

658
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,447
Rather than inconvenience you
and the guys,

659
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,849
I'll just inconvenience him.

660
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,852
I'm sorry.

661
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,988
But I really want to go to the shoot.

662
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,924
I'll just watch if nothing else.

663
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:28,926
See you in the morning.

664
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,011
What exactly is
the nature of your relationship with him?

665
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,380
The kind that is okay for you
to be alone in a room with him?

666
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,151
Teacher and student will not cut it.
I won't fall for it.

667
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,954
Does he have feelings for you?

668
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,323
Or did you two used to date?

669
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,659
So what if we dated?

670
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,028
What is it to you whom I date

671
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:09,032
or whether I'm alone with a man
in a room or outside?

672
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,336
-I can't even ask?
-No. Don't ask because it pisses me off.

673
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,438
Why are you here?

674
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,406
Why are you following me around
and harassing me?

675
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,842
What are you truly after?

676
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,644
-You know what.
-No, I don't.

677
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,846
-How would I know?
-You know.

678
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,681
You do know.

679
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,420
If you're feeling me out to see
if my feelings have changed, stop.

680
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,991
I have way too much
to lose it all for a woman.

681
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,993
That being the case,

682
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,028
let me hold you.

683
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,165
-What?
-To me, there are two kinds of women:

684
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:44,434
the kind I'll marry
and the kind I'll drop after a few trysts.

685
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,004
But you hover somewhere in between.

686
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,772
So let me hold you.

687
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,875
If you hold me and like it,

688
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,244
what will you do then?

689
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,680
I'll give you a different life.

690
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,981
Awesome.

691
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,250
Do I get to be Cinderella?

692
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:01,985
No.

693
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,854
The Little Mermaid.

694
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,959
Gil Ra-im's coordinates will always lie
somewhere between the two types.

695
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,164
So be invisible when you're with me
and then vanish like foam.

696
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,401
This is the mindset of yours truly.

697
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,481
Think about it carefully and let me know.

698
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,150
Gil Ra-im's coordinates will always lie
somewhere between the two types.

699
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:12,956
So be invisible when you're with me
and then vanish like foam.

700
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,225
This is the mindset of yours truly.

701
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:44,154
I searched high and low for you. Get up.
The music video director wants to see you.

702
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:46,823
Me?

703
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,193
You came all this way and caused a scene,
so what can I do but help?

704
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:53,096
I said you were good,
so do well on the interview.

705
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,631
Keep it a secret from Jong-su.

706
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,700
Okay. Thank you very much.

707
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,819
How do you do? I'm Gil Ra-im.
Nice to meet you--

708
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,860
You were right.

709
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,164
The world is indeed a lot smaller
than people think,

710
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,699
is it not?

711
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,835
I was curious
about what you do for a living.

712
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,237
You were part of Director Lim's family.

713
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,874
-Yes, ma'am.
-You mouthed off at me earlier.

714
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,711
You must be the type
that gets more polite over time.

715
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,114
What are you good at?

716
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,549
Everything

717
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,052
to a respectable degree.

718
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,254
Can you jump off the 63 Building?

719
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,792
I can jump off it.

720
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,594
But that will leave me dead.

721
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,096
Really?

722
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,033
I thought you were seeing Choi U-yeong
because you had extraordinary skills.

723
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,570
Is U-yeong good to you?

724
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,871
He is a very kind person--

725
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,506
So you two are just starting out.

726
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,510
I'll let you know
if we will be working together.

727
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,046
I have a meeting to get to.

728
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,594
What is this? Why are you here?

729
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,298
You must not have been informed yet.

730
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,268
I'm Yoon Seul.
I'll be producing your new music video.

731
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,571
Camera director, Mr. Kim Dong-hun.

732
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,073
Stunt director, Mr. Lim Jong-su--

733
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,808
Who says you can be here?

734
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,511
There must be a lot
you have not been informed of.

735
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,212
I'm quite good.

736
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,349
Even if you had supernatural powers,
you still won't do.

737
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,784
Where are you, Dong-gyu?

738
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,485
Where are you?

739
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,355
We should brace ourselves.

740
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,390
He will cause us a lot of grief.

741
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,394
Rather, he seems to be suffering himself.

742
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,899
Not only are you physically able,
but you're also very intuitive.

743
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,901
Is it because you studied overseas?

744
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,673
Where's Dong-gyu?

745
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,642
Do you realize
that you're asking that every minute?

746
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,278
He must be one minute closer
than he was one minute ago.

747
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,481
So how far did he travel
in that one minute? Call him.

748
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,117
There he is.

749
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,687
-You bastard!
-What is this?

750
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,222
How could you without a word to me?

751
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,758
How could I get a word in
when you refused to answer your phone?

752
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,193
Nevertheless, Seul can't do.

753
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,696
There are no other producers!
Do you think I was thrilled about her?

754
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,365
This is your doing
and the schedule you messed up!

755
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,667
Fine.

756
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,203
Then I'll free up your schedule.

757
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,038
I won't do it. I'm calling it quits.

758
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,005
What?

759
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,674
I'm not doing this to make money.

760
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,044
The album? No rush. Just forget it.
I didn't like the songs anyway.

761
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,412
Have you gone mad?

762
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,447
This is what you get
for not knowing me better.

763
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,153
Get out. I'm going to sleep.

764
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:08,758
What karmic offense did I commit
that I have to manage Oska?

765
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,327
Damn it.

766
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,562
Sir.

767
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,101
I'm sleeping here tonight.

768
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,203
Why are you here? Hey!

769
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,527
Man, this sucks.

770
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,500
What's this?

771
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:51,868
Is it wine?

772
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,839
Don't touch it. It's mine.

773
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,308
You startled me. What is it?

774
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,344
If you want to drink, call room service.

775
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,546
My treat.

776
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,147
Forget it. I'm not drinking.

777
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:05,715
Suit yourself.

778
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,088
How do you know Yoon Seul?
We went on a blind date.

779
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,223
I know.

780
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,791
You know?

781
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,426
But she didn't mention she knew you.

782
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,630
Because our ties are not worth mentioning.

783
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,935
What kind of ties
are not worth mentioning?

784
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:26,903
She is

785
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,272
my hater.

786
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,740
Really?

787
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,525
SECRET GARDEN

788
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,156
What is this?

789
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,158
Am I still dreaming?

790
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,127
But what a sweet dream.

791
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,500
Oska is

792
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,469
in my dream.

793
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,073
His hand!

794
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,908
Oh, my!

795
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,606
What part of my subconscious

796
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,376
is this?

797
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,678
What a strange dream.

798
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,996
Is this really a dream?

799
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,366
It feels too real.

800
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,282
What is this? What happened here?

801
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,265
What is this?

802
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,734
Where am I?

803
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,336
Who are you?

804
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,239
What's wrong with you
after a good night's sleep, Miss?

805
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,541
"Miss"?

806
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:25,975
Who?

807
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,477
Me?

808
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:39,389
