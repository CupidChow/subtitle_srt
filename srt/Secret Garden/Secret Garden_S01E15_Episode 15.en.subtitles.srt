1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,696
Kim Ji-eun passed away three years ago.

2
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,200
December 5th is not my birthday,
but Ra-im's father's death anniversary.

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,039
The girl that just left is Ji-hyeon.

4
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,876
She's your physician, Park Ji-hyeon.

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,113
There is no way Gil Ra-im would forget
what day her father passed away.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,485
She did the funeral rites for three days
when Kim Ji-eun passed away.

7
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,923
There is no way that Joo-won
would not recognize Ji-hyeon.

8
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,294
Speed dial one on his phone is Ji-hyeon.

9
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,739
You forgot your door passcode,

10
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,674
and you even cooked for me.

11
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,042
Yes,

12
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,178
this is exactly how it felt then.

13
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,414
That Joo-won wasn't Joo-won.

14
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,086
-Well--
-Are you

15
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,054
actually mentally ill?

16
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,856
Do you have to be admitted?

17
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,060
I'm going to call Ji-hyeon back.

18
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,628
Wait, Oskie!

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,698
"Oskie"?

20
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,633
I can't go to the hospital.

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,836
The truth is,

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,271
I'm not Kim Joo-won.

23
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,041
-I'm Gil Ra-im.
-What?

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,476
What's the matter with you?

25
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,977
Why are you acting like this?

26
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,447
I know very well

27
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,049
that what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense

28
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,717
nor is it scientifically possible.

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,953
I know it sounds completely insane.

30
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,421
However,

31
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,589
it is the truth.

32
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,757
Hey!

33
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,229
Hey, Joo-won?

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,864
Since when have you been like this?

35
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,866
What has Ji-hyeon been doing to you?

36
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,434
I am not crazy.

37
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,470
I really am Gil Ra-im.

38
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,641
"You are the first woman
to ask me out to a pork rind restaurant."

39
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,777
"My butt isn't that flabby."

40
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,646
You said these things to me.

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,349
What is this?

42
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,822
Is this some kind of hidden camera prank?

43
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,690
-Oskie.
-Don't call me that!

44
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,760
I'm 35 years old.
You expect me to believe this?

45
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,095
But it's the truth.

46
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,365
When I played Kim Seon-a's double
in Welcome to Dongjak-gu.

47
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,502
"You won't make a hole in your shoe
if I ask you out to coffee, right?"

48
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,505
You said that and made me remember you.

49
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,912
You are acting really weird right now.

50
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,613
You really are.

51
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,183
Did you suffer

52
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,986
a head injury while you were shooting
without me knowing?

53
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,155
I admit this is weird.

54
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,559
But it's not because of that.

55
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,961
My soul has been swapped.

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,766
-What?
-Whether you believe it or not,

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,302
these are the facts.

58
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,504
The truth is,

59
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,306
I'm Kim Joo-won.

60
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,143
The rookie Mr. Money-maker Kim Joo-won.

61
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,213
-What?
-When we were in Jeju Island

62
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,048
and for a few days after that,

63
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,351
Ra-im acted very strange.

64
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,886
Just like now.

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,588
Right?

66
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,257
Don't look at me like that.

67
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,459
She and I are victims too.

68
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,432
You see this?

69
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,901
This isn't her cell phone.

70
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,135
INCOMING CALL
GIL RA-IM

71
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,036
Right?

72
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,945
-What is it?
-I think you need to come here.

73
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,952
Oska found out.

74
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,723
The situation here isn't any better.

75
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,758
I'll call you back.

76
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,930
I'll prove it to you.

77
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,398
Follow me.

78
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,677
So you're saying

79
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,979
Gil Ra-im is in here.

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,348
And Kim Joo-won is in there?

81
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,186
-Why you...
-It's true.

82
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,589
In the "Thanks To" section
of your sixth album,

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,591
you wrote "My Baby Ring Ring."

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,028
That was your pet name for Park Chae-rin,
but you lied and said it was your pet dog.

85
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,930
The shirtless photo in your fourth album
was all photoshopped.

86
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,266
You pass the mic
whenever there's a high note.

87
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,569
Hey! Everyone knows that,
not just my fans.

88
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,971
Is that something to be proud of?

89
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,106
Now it feels real.

90
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,776
You want me to list all the women
who've stayed here overnight?

91
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,445
You're really trying hard.

92
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,617
"U-yeong. I was sure.

93
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,453
I was sure that I wouldn't fall for her.

94
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,489
I was sure

95
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,192
because she's nothing special.

96
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,195
But why didn't it turn out as planned?"

97
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,466
Are you really

98
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,802
Kim Joo-won?

99
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:37,870
Yes.

100
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,741
And this is Gil Ra-im.

101
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,380
If you get a call in the middle
of the night,

102
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,818
I know that the first thing you say is,

103
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,190
"Which hospital is it?

104
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,692
Are they dead?"

105
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,241
How did this happen?

106
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,543
We do not know yet.

107
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,748
But we believe we'll return to normal
once it rains.

108
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,518
-Once it rains?
-We're not certain, but temporarily...

109
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,687
So exactly when did this start?

110
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,855
It started in Jeju Island.

111
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,892
"Can I sleep here tonight?"

112
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,062
Remember?

113
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,065
That was Ra-im...

114
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,700
I mean,

115
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,969
that was you?

116
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,270
Darn it.

117
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,009
I can't even curse at Ra-im's face.

118
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,512
Then who was,

119
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,616
"I've caught you?"

120
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,859
Then was it you who said,
"Don't you-know-what until you die?"

121
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,295
That was all me,

122
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,834
but I've already had an earful
from Ra-im for that.

123
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,906
How about the golf course sauna?

124
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,908
Who was that?

125
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,343
Oh, my!

126
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,646
Oh, no.

127
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,617
Then Ra-im saw everything...

128
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,054
She did. She saw everything.

129
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,559
Then what about Seul and the sauna?

130
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,930
You little punk! Come over here!

131
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,166
You're hurting Ra-im's body.

132
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,938
Wait until they return to normal.
Let's beat him up then.

133
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,575
Have you forgotten
that the enemy of my enemy is a friend?

134
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,109
Just wait until you return to normal.

135
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,013
Oh, no.

136
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,782
Goodness.

137
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,916
What's the matter?

138
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,687
Oskie will think I'm a weird woman now.

139
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,857
Is that so important?

140
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,459
Is he the one you're seeing?
I'm the guy you're dating.

141
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,028
Oska and I had a special platonic thing
going on.

142
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,297
We had a special connection.

143
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,432
This is perfect.

144
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,133
How about you stop meeting Oska,

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,669
and I'll stop going to the action school?

146
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,806
The truth is, Director Lim and I had

147
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,509
a special murderous thing going on.

148
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,776
Seriously!

149
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,579
Did Director Lim leave?

150
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,814
Why should I care?

151
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,157
-Sit.
-Why?

152
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,392
Now.

153
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,030
Stop, or the punishment will be grave.

154
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,266
One, hug. Two, bear hug. Three, embrace.

155
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,368
It'll get worse from four.

156
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,578
I don't know if he's Ra-im or not,
but he is definitely not Joo-won.

157
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,519
How could this happen?

158
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,154
Can you believe this?

159
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,790
And if we don't?

160
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,161
It means that those two have gone crazy.

161
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,630
For me, that's even worse.

162
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,999
That's true.

163
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,003
Hey, did you...

164
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,708
-What are you doing?
-Did you cry?

165
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,510
Your eyes are damp.

166
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,113
They're usually damp.

167
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,217
You did cry! Right?

168
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,552
You cried, right?

169
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,421
Why?

170
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,457
You own shares
in Loel Department Store, right?

171
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,427
Why isn't he saying anything?

172
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,297
I heard you're second-in-command
of the VVIP Lounge.

173
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,235
Congratulations on your promotion!

174
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,804
What is it?

175
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,040
I was worried about you having to stand
all day.

176
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,141
Ta-da!

177
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,944
At least you'll be comfortable
before and after work.

178
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,381
I usually can't wear things like this.

179
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,816
Why not?

180
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,184
You didn't know?

181
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,088
I look super cute in these.

182
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,459
It's overwhelming having all eyes on me.

183
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,995
Oh, no.

184
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,166
Just endure it for a while.
You'll age in no time.

185
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,540
By the way, I heard you were
about to resign when I got fired.

186
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,908
Did the CEO tell you?

187
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,646
What did he tell you for?

188
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,917
This is for your ears only.

189
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,853
The truth is,

190
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,922
I can be quite defiant.

191
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,325
That's the problem.

192
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,762
If one of us becomes unemployed,
the other needs to earn money. Why resign?

193
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,298
Does love pay for rice? Money does.

194
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,805
You're quite defiant yourself.

195
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,987
She went as far as to threaten

196
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,090
to take Joo-won and live abroad.

197
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,593
It seems like she has no fear
because she grew up with nothing.

198
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,462
She has nothing to lose, basically.

199
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,565
How can I get back at her

200
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,002
to relieve my anger?

201
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,705
This is why I told you to leave her be.

202
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,109
The more you go at her,
the more she'll come back at you.

203
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,211
How can I leave this alone.

204
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,980
I can't sleep at night because of her.

205
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,018
Considering that she got someone
like Joo-won in the palm of her hands,

206
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,754
you need to acknowledge
what she's capable of.

207
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,390
Let them get married.

208
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,292
Just don't put her name
in the family registry.

209
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,962
Do that for U-yeong, if you want.

210
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:10,863
Hey,

211
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,934
U-yeong even dated a parking attendant
from your department store.

212
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,536
A stuntwoman would be a major upgrade.

213
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,643
-What?
-How did you know she was a stuntwoman?

214
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,445
I never told you.

215
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,282
You didn't?

216
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,784
What is your motive?

217
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,921
If Joo-won gets married to her,
what do you expect to fall into your lap?

218
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,326
You always pretend to seek advice,
and then release your anger out on me.

219
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,195
I forgot that I had booked a massage.

220
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,497
I'll get going.

221
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,841
How are you, my son?

222
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,678
Hello.

223
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,046
Hello.

224
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,883
-What brings you here?
-I thought you would be here like this.

225
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,185
Open it.

226
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,058
I know these times
have been trying for you.

227
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,727
I understand.

228
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,196
Here. This is from my heart.

229
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,397
Thank you.

230
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,500
You're the only one who looks after me.

231
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,472
Yes, so let's stop U-yeong
from doing these things.

232
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,508
-Excuse me?
-What you do mean?

233
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,877
You've had enough fun.

234
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,014
You living like this
is beginning to wear me out.

235
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,251
Mr. Choi, hasn't U-yeong
earned you plenty of money?

236
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,487
-Mom!
-He did...

237
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,857
But it was mostly spent
on contract penalties.

238
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,126
The fact is that you had the money to pay.

239
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,330
Why should you have to spend money
to listen to insults?

240
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,098
I've seen the articles.

241
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,668
-This is the perfect time to--
-Mom.

242
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,637
We're having an important meeting
right now.

243
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,539
I'll call you, so please go.

244
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,807
Walk her out, will you?

245
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,143
-Yes.
-Fine, I'll go.

246
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,747
Anyway, think about what I said, okay?

247
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,920
Goodbye, ma'am.

248
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,528
-What are you doing?
-I'm thinking about what she said.

249
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,129
What?

250
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,700
So you're finally calling it quits?

251
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,369
Not that. About being insulted.

252
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:36,208
I keep getting the feeling
that I've lived my life wrong.

253
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,477
Isn't that what I've been saying to you?

254
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,945
I didn't know then.

255
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,548
That's why

256
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,950
I'm thinking about apologizing.

257
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,853
Do what? Apologize?

258
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,021
Here.

259
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,656
Starting with directors
you threw scripts at.

260
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,657
In alphabetical order.

261
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,094
Hey! I told you those were synopses,
not scripts!

262
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,163
Aren't they giving us a revised copy
of X-files?

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,403
Chae-rin, Eun-sol, Cherry,
Ji-won, Min-ji...

264
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,206
Did I really make this many girls cry?

265
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,843
I thought I was looking
at an award nominee list.

266
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,282
I hurt the director of Inkigayo as well?
When?

267
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,184
You promised to do
your sixth album comeback

268
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,986
on Inkigayo then stood him up.

269
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,522
And he still aired
my seventh album comeback?

270
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,158
He must be Jesus.

271
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,861
You refused to appear for two weeks
because they gave BIGBANG the last song.

272
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,762
What?

273
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,464
I acted cocky against BIGBANG?

274
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,000
I really was full of it.

275
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,771
Seriously though, why are you doing this?

276
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,442
I'm going back to Seul.

277
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,644
What?

278
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,413
She's Joo-won now,

279
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,815
but when she was Ra-im,

280
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,218
she told me I was older than ten.

281
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,122
I'm probably about 17 right now.

282
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,494
I'll reflect on it, apologize, grow up,
and go back to Seul.

283
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,430
What are you talking about?

284
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,233
Let's see.

285
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:14,373
I have two five-star offenses.

286
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,777
To Choi Dong-gyu and Yoo Jong-heon.

287
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,480
We kept our objectivity.

288
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,851
It should tell you just how fair
we were with this list.

289
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,187
Right.

290
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm really sorry for all the hardship
and pain I've put you through.

291
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,361
I won't make you suffer anymore.

292
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,429
If I could have one wish,

293
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,333
it's that in twenty years

294
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,702
I would still be working with you two.

295
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,172
Apology accepted, right?

296
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,613
Hello, Director. It's me, Oska.

297
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,250
Please. Don't hang up and don't be scared.

298
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,820
Remember how I screwed you over
during my sixth album?

299
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,422
Yes, that!

300
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,762
I can't sign this, ma'am. Sorry.

301
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,130
Why?

302
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,033
What happened to Oska recently
is partially my fault.

303
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,202
I want to be a jerk and all,

304
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,139
but I can't live with guilt
on my conscience.

305
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,108
Will that guilt go away

306
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,577
if you don't sign with me?

307
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,747
Even if it doesn't, it won't be as bad.

308
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,116
Fine.

309
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,853
But before you say no, do me one favor.

310
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,824
Musicians have a lot of connections,
right?

311
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,394
Can you look into the other artists

312
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,763
that the composer was in contact with?

313
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,068
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

314
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,404
You too?

315
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,406
I'm sure Oska wasn't the only victim.

316
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,509
She probably sent the song out
to various artists to trap one,

317
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,978
and Oska was stupid enough to fall for it.

318
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,148
-Stupid?
-He's too old to be called naive.

319
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,452
But why are you helping Oska?

320
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,587
You didn't seem to be on good terms.

321
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,823
Because there only needs to be one person
that tortures him,

322
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,791
and that's me.

323
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,412
About Dark Blood.

324
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,952
Do you think I'll make it
to the final round?

325
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,521
If you get cast,

326
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,023
do you want to just become an actress?

327
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,695
Do you think I don't have what it takes

328
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,865
to become a director?

329
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,701
I don't know if you knew,

330
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,103
but at some point,

331
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,272
I'm becoming unable to pick up calls

332
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,207
that come late at night.

333
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,145
The first thing I say when I get
a call in the middle of the night is,

334
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,647
"Which hospital is it?

335
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,850
Are they dead?"

336
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,388
After sending three people off
without even a goodbye,

337
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,191
I wondered if it should've been me.

338
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,428
Should I have been the one?

339
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,665
Before I lose anyone else,

340
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,168
I tell myself I should quit tomorrow.

341
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,137
I tell myself I should quit the next day.

342
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,873
I think that every single day.

343
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,910
If you ever lead a team of your own,

344
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,679
you'll go through all of this.

345
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,148
So while you still can,

346
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,318
say goodbye to your colleagues

347
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,055
and before someone receives a call
in the middle of the night,

348
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,126
I hope you leave this industry.

349
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,305
Look at you. Drinking a cappuccino again.

350
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,107
You have a new message.

351
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,176
"You have a new message."

352
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,478
Don't do that with my face.

353
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,949
Your demo passed.

354
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,685
They want you at the final audition.
Congratulations!

355
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,721
What?

356
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,690
My demo video passed.

357
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,592
I made it to the final audition.

358
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,826
What?

359
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,295
Oh, wow!

360
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,931
Let's redo our practice schedule.
Make it a little more hardcore.

361
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,166
What are you talking about?

362
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,036
You want me to do the audition for real?

363
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,075
You've been practicing for it
all this time.

364
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,045
I just did that to avoid offending you.

365
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,782
How am I supposed to audition for you?
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,953
Do you think that I'll actually pass?

367
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,358
No.

368
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,562
I'm not doing this so that I can pass.

369
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,833
Even if I were the one doing it,
there is no guarantee.

370
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,568
Then why?

371
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,138
I can't sit back and do nothing.

372
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,875
It was my lifelong dream to stand

373
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,244
in an audition like this one.

374
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,414
So,

375
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,184
I'm only asking you
to stand there in my place.

376
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,988
It's a closed audition,

377
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,159
but you can take one other person
with you.

378
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,596
It would be a tremendous experience

379
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,532
just to watch you audition for me.

380
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,469
Please.

381
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,873
This won't work
just because you say please.

382
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,108
I understand where you're coming from,

383
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,378
but I just can't do it.
I can't even ride elevators!

384
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,081
You can't

385
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,183
ride elevators?

386
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,286
Something like that.

387
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,155
Pick up your phone.

388
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,432
Yes, Director.

389
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,100
Hey.

390
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,769
It's me.

391
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,673
This is Ra-im, right?

392
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,477
Yes, it's me. What is it?

393
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,181
Hang up. I'll message you.

394
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,088
I don't think he's used to it yet.

395
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,556
You have a new message.

396
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,928
What will you do about the audition?
Come to the school so we can talk.

397
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,996
Sorry, but I have to go.

398
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,001
Where are you going? Let me come with you.

399
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,483
This is where I'm going to look,
so just listen, Ra-im.

400
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,818
-All right.
-Why are you looking at me?

401
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,687
Because I don't want to look at your face.

402
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,590
What will you to do about the audition?

403
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,526
If I return to normal by then,
it will be all right.

404
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,862
-And if you don't?
-I will.

405
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,064
How did this...

406
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,769
Why aren't you telling him
that you plan on training me?

407
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,338
What do you mean?

408
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,844
I wanted to see the audition somehow...

409
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,447
You fool! Do you think that makes sense?

410
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,219
You think a few days training
will be enough?

411
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,356
What do you think
you'll achieve with this jerk?

412
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,292
Your life is on the line here.

413
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,060
And what if I do the audition?

414
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,331
What?

415
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,873
What if I can do the audition?

416
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,378
Do you mean it?

417
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,581
Yes. I'll do it.

418
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,184
If you want it that badly

419
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,187
and if it has Ra-im's life on the line,
I'll do it.

420
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,025
If I give it my all,
maybe a miracle will occur.

421
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,596
Under one condition, though.

422
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,566
Condition?

423
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,619
What are you doing?

424
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,155
We're going to live together.
We talked about this already.

425
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,958
Your arms are sore. Massage them.

426
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,828
If only I didn't have to audition,

427
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,164
I would bruise myself
to hurt you right now.

428
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,700
If you want a smooth audition,
you should be nice to me.

429
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,102
Go back right this instant.
Then forget the audition.

430
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,638
Hey! There's only one bed, so let's share.

431
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,540
-Are you crazy?
-Then forget the audition.

432
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,243
There's only one bath.
We'll have to share that too, right?

433
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,577
I'll really smack you.

434
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,379
-Forget your audition then.
-Do you want to die?

435
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,548
And I won't let you go to work.

436
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,316
I've emailed Mr. Kim.

437
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,952
From tomorrow,
the meetings will be held here.

438
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,522
You can't pull these off
through your acting.

439
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,992
So we have to be together 24 hours a day.

440
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,730
I should've done this sooner.
I wonder why I didn't think of it.

441
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,734
I'm going to shower.

442
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,407
Aren't you coming?
We said we would do it together.

443
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,943
Are you ready to cash in
your saved up beatings?

444
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,044
Then forget the audition.

445
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:46,945
Hey!

446
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,187
Are you sleeping?

447
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,493
Are you asleep?

448
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,330
I know you're not.

449
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,534
I want to ask you something.

450
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,770
What is it?

451
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,878
The pills in the bathroom.

452
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,280
What are they for?

453
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,083
What pills?

454
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,785
Is it so serious

455
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,820
that you have to hide it?

456
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,534
Do you know what claustrophobia is?

457
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,805
Like when you're nervous
of being in small spaces?

458
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,040
Being nervous would be fine.

459
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,445
I get downright terrified.

460
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,383
That's why I can't even ride elevators.

461
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,187
I either faint

462
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,490
or start hyperventilating.

463
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:10,929
Worst case scenario,
I can have a heart attack.

464
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,469
This is a secret.

465
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,404
You can't tell anyone.

466
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,708
No wonder everyone was shocked

467
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,945
when I took the elevator.

468
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,047
You took the elevator?

469
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,683
The first time I went to work as you.

470
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,886
I had no idea.

471
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,890
That must've stumped Mr. Park.

472
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,292
Good job.

473
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,208
But the more I look...

474
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,544
What?

475
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,846
What is it?

476
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,349
I really am good-looking.

477
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,952
How do people speak to me?

478
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,654
They must get so nervous.

479
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,389
You're crazy.

480
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,995
Want to sleep on my arm?

481
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,196
That's my arm.

482
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,498
Why do you have to be so dry?

483
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,536
You can lie on my arm, and we can chat.

484
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,177
Look to the side. That's it.

485
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,079
Raise it slightly.

486
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,381
One, two.

487
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,192
That's it. Look to the side.

488
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,161
To the side.

489
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,766
2011 NEW YEAR'S EVENT PLAN

490
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,741
This is the table of contents
for our plans for the New Year.

491
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,843
First is our current state of affairs.

492
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,512
Second, the 2011 New Year's event.

493
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,381
Third, our differentiation strategy.

494
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,550
Fourth, our main target analysis.

495
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,218
Fifth, our expectations.

496
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,688
And lastly,
we will discuss the future of Loel.

497
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,392
Are you pleased with this sequence?

498
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,688
I can't say that this is the best.

499
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,858
-Leave them with me.
-Good work.

500
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,506
What happened to Oska is my fault.

501
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,108
You know her, right?

502
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,210
I need your help.

503
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,511
OSKA'S SEVENTH ALBUM SONGWRITER

504
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,180
What's this got to do with me?

505
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,649
Can't you reconsider?

506
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,285
I don't want to get involved
in something like this. Sorry.

507
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,533
OSKA KNEW OF PLAGIARISM
COMPOSER'S SHOCKING CONFESSION

508
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,942
IF YOU LACK TALENT,
AT LEAST HAVE A CONSCIENCE

509
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,314
I KNEW OSKA WAS LIKE THAT.
ALWAYS HATED HIM. SUCH A JERK.

510
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,059
USERNAME: 5SKAL

511
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,265
EVERYONE, I'M HIS NEIGHBOR
AND OSKA WOULD NEVER DO THAT

512
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,873
Darn it!

513
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,617
This is too tough.

514
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,788
That was amazing!

515
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,623
How do you learn so fast?

516
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,093
Are you just acting cute
to make me feel better?

517
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,995
No, I'm telling the truth
because it was so cool.

518
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,266
What if there really is a miracle
and you pass the audition?

519
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,667
You need another miracle?

520
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,037
You already got yours.

521
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:02,473
A girl with no background,
education or looks

522
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,910
has become the woman
of a guy who lacks nothing.

523
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,513
Aren't they celebrating this
in your hometown?

524
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,149
Be honest.

525
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,817
When I was hanging onto you,

526
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,119
you pretended to not like me.

527
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,156
But inside,
you squealed with pure joy, right?

528
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,160
Why don't you trust your tastes now?

529
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,328
I am a woman that's worth clinging on to

530
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,799
for a man like Kim Joo-won,
who has everything in the world.

531
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,301
See?

532
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,537
How can I not fall for you?

533
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:37,308
Talking about you squealing reminded me...

534
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,611
Did you really not scream
in the mountains that day?

535
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,612
Mountains?

536
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,548
Where? Jecheon?

537
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,416
No, Jeju Island.

538
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,552
I heard you for sure.

539
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,587
And Oska heard it too.

540
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,588
Really?

541
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,459
Are you sure it was my voice?
Maybe the signals got mixed up?

542
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,760
Who knows?

543
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,963
I just assumed it was you
since it was a girl's voice.

544
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,532
But it really wasn't me.

545
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,070
Now that I think about it,
wasn't that restaurant weird too?

546
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,240
Our phones didn't work,
and the owner lady was weird too.

547
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,277
Plus, she only gave me the drumsticks.

548
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,446
You ate it well enough.

549
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,417
But now that you mention it,
it does seem strange.

550
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,423
Then do you remember that liquor?
The one I told you to give to Oska.

551
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,759
-What?
-Did you give it to him?

552
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,462
I did. Why?

553
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,464
Did he drink it?

554
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,433
I think so.

555
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,101
-Why?
-Really?

556
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,270
I guess that's not it then.

557
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:44,375
I thought maybe it was the liquor
that did this to us.

558
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,043
But if it was,

559
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,913
then I should've switched with Oska,
not you.

560
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,783
I drank the liquor that night.

561
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,186
-What?
-What is it?

562
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,155
Actually,

563
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,390
I drank it too.

564
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,393
What? You just said you gave it to Oska!

565
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,866
That's not the problem.
That liquor is the key.

566
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,502
Hurry up and change.
Let's go back to that restaurant.

567
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,738
Right now? To Jeju Island?

568
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,640
SECRET GARDEN

569
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:40,998
It seems a lot more normal than last time.

570
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,971
Welcome. Table for two?

571
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,441
Did the owner change?

572
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,711
What do you mean?

573
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,781
Our family has been here
for the past 30 years.

574
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,669
Excuse me,
but did you change the interior recently?

575
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,304
Last time we came

576
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,341
there were homemade liquors
lining the wall.

577
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,644
We don't make our own liquor.

578
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,447
We have soju and rice wine.
Which would you like?

579
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,681
That's not what he means.

580
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,784
There used to be a wall
full of flower liquor here.

581
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,254
We've never had that.

582
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,924
How many women work here?

583
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,661
Just me and my mother-in-law. Why?

584
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,496
Besides you,

585
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,832
isn't there a lady that can
throw knives like a man,

586
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,767
and looks melancholy?

587
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,804
Why do you keep asking weird questions
about our restaurant?

588
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,208
The owner has never changed.

589
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,943
There is no melancholy lady.

590
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,544
And we don't make our own alcohol.

591
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,780
Are you going to order or not?

592
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,055
What are we going to do now?

593
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,525
If it really was the liquor,
where are we going to find it?

594
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,228
I told you not to accept it, didn't I?

595
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,965
She said it was medicinal,
so I thought it would be good for me.

596
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,100
You tried to look after your body
and ended up losing it.

597
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,735
You're so amazing.

598
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,108
We probably need the liquor to end this.
What are we supposed to do now?

599
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,211
It looks like we'll switch back and forth
until we die.

600
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,781
We'll go back to normal once it rains.

601
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,382
We're not even sure yet!

602
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,519
Why isn't that rain coming anyway?
It's been a week.

603
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,989
That storm cloud
completely passed by Korea.

604
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,891
I told you we should go to New York.

605
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,328
Why did you have to drink it?

606
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,196
You should've given it to Oska
like I told you to!

607
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,600
How do you want to be punished
for that waste of time?

608
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,703
It was your idea.

609
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,905
Then I'll receive the punishment.

610
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,139
You choose.

611
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,343
One, hug. Two, bear hug.
Three, embrace. Four...

612
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,595
Hello.

613
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,864
I already told you

614
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,200
that we decided to move in--

615
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,267
Go ahead.

616
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,303
I won't stop you.

617
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,606
However,

618
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,275
move out of here.

619
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,879
I already packed your things.

620
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,981
Take them and leave right now!

621
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,791
Director, I'm really apologizing.
Why won't you believe me?

622
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,794
I was young and immature...

623
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,235
I'll apologize later.

624
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,305
-What's going on?
-Mom kicked us out.

625
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,440
What?

626
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,445
I really can't get used to this.

627
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,713
Use name tags or something!

628
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,549
Just let us sleep here.
We'll take care of our own food.

629
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,318
Why should I? Get out!

630
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,686
Then at least take in Ra-im.

631
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,088
Take in Ra-im?

632
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,827
How? Her mind and body are separate!

633
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,829
So take both.

634
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,131
Ra-im, you can take the room.

635
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,066
He always sleeps on the couch anyway.

636
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,169
Hey! Who said you could do this?

637
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,638
If you unpack, you're dead!

638
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,774
Why is he calling?

639
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,911
Hello?

640
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,480
Tomorrow?

641
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,183
I was a bit cold on the phone
last night, wasn't I?

642
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,684
I was just taken aback.

643
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,223
In my four years as a music show director,
I've never received that kind of apology.

644
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,092
Moreover, from the artist himself.

645
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,563
Actually, I was very moved by your call.

646
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,164
I see.

647
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,868
I always manage to stand out like that.

648
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,305
I called you here

649
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,774
because I have information
that could help you.

650
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,278
I've known for a while,
but I had no reason to say anything.

651
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,782
Until last night when you called.

652
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,218
What kind of information?

653
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,087
It's about the composer who gave you
the plagiarized song.

654
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:35,826
I think she tried to scam several artists
with that same song.

655
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,197
I saw someone else sing it
before your song was leaked.

656
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,932
You should try meeting her.

657
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,969
Really? Who is it?

658
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,203
Cherry.

659
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,772
What? Cherry?

660
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,675
-From Ticket to the Moon?
-Yes.

661
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,954
Why are you two here?

662
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,358
I got involved for nothing.
Looks like you're on top of things.

663
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,928
I'm the one that's here to help,
and you haven't even greeted me.

664
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,531
Long time no see.

665
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,769
They told me everything.
I heard you need my help.

666
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,439
But what a shame.
I hate people whose names start with "O."

667
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,708
Oska. Oh Seung-a.

668
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,443
I don't like people whose names
start with "Ch."

669
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,778
Cherry. Chae-rin.

670
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,446
Are you sure you're here for my help?

671
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,016
Sorry.

672
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,120
Don't get me wrong.
She and I got caught up in a scandal--

673
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,221
I'll tell them.

674
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,989
I admitted it,

675
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,859
but his side said there was
absolutely no way

676
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,994
and totally humiliated me.

677
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,897
You really did see each other though?

678
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,666
-The thing is--
-I'll tell her.

679
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,368
He said he proposed to someone
and got rejected.

680
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,805
What a cliché thing to say, you know?

681
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,808
But I played along
even though I knew it was all a lie.

682
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,411
I drank cases of alcohol with him.

683
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,414
How could he so adamantly deny the rumors?

684
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:09,019
Anyway, I really dislike him.
But I'll do it for you guys.

685
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,289
Thank you.

686
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,594
You got a song from her too, then?

687
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,529
Yes. I wanted to become a singer,

688
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,631
so I asked for a song,
and she sent me that one.

689
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,299
I recorded it and everything.

690
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,336
Then I listened to your leaked song,
and it was the same as mine.

691
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,606
If it wasn't for you,
I could've taken the fall for it all.

692
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,674
Do you know how many singers
she gave it to?

693
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,176
I wouldn't know.

694
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,478
By the way, how old are you?

695
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,746
Do you have a girlfriend?

696
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,048
Hey! He's--

697
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,216
I have someone I like.

698
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,417
You do?

699
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,320
-Just finish talking.
-Okay.

700
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,656
-So--
-I'm done talking.

701
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,958
My agency will release
a statement tomorrow.

702
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,060
I hope it proves your innocence.

703
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,130
See you later.

704
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,837
All right. Thanks.
I'll treat you out later.

705
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,538
No, I'll buy you a purse!

706
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,781
It looks like everything worked out.

707
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,383
So I'll be going too.

708
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,318
Wait.

709
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,621
Could you give us some privacy?

710
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,464
Sit down. I have something to say.

711
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,542
You don't have to thank me.

712
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,112
I'm just paying back my debt to you.

713
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,481
So you'll stop seeing me

714
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,016
after you pay it all back?

715
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,152
Listen,

716
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,287
I remember everything.

717
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,290
The reason you were hurt by me,

718
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,426
you rejected my proposal,

719
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,830
and you showed up again
and gave me a hard time.

720
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,534
I know now.

721
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,671
I was so ashamed that I couldn't sleep.

722
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,407
I was so angry at myself
that I wanted to die.

723
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,178
Everything was a complete mess,

724
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,714
but I couldn't do anything.

725
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,851
I lied to save face.

726
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,254
I didn't realize that could hurt you.

727
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,657
I was so young,

728
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:28,859
and all I cared about

729
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,328
was myself.

730
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,564
I didn't know

731
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,602
that would make me lose you.

732
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:43,907
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,111
I'm so sorry

734
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,114
that I feel sorry about saying...

735
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,252
I'm sorry.

736
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,630
I thought

737
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,800
I was really cruel

738
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,970
and cunning,

739
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,041
but I guess I'm not.

740
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,045
I hate seeing you

741
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:24,848
feel sorry.

742
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,785
It's so pitiful.

743
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,524
I have to go.

744
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,886
Can we talk?

745
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,594
You didn't leave yet?

746
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,063
I saw some of the albums
that you collected.

747
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,701
Oska fits your type of music, not me.

748
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,771
So why did you want to sign me?

749
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,941
You said you weren't going to sign anyway.

750
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,475
But it still makes me mad.

751
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,778
You used me, right?

752
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,646
To make Oska mad.

753
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,018
He and I are not so intimate
that we have love quarrels.

754
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,957
Then what is your relationship with him?

755
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,293
Why is that

756
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,696
any of your concern?

757
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,233
You know that he ditched the music video
and came to Jeju Island to sign me, right?

758
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,735
You think I would've approached you
without even knowing that?

759
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,371
Then you probably know

760
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,140
how much he wants me.

761
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,880
What is your point?

762
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,548
You're jealous, aren't you?

763
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,852
He came to where I worked
even when I switched part-time jobs.

764
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,954
Excuse me,

765
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,992
but do you know you sound
just like a jealous woman

766
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,762
who's competing with me over the same guy?

767
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,165
At least you're quick, old lady.

768
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,414
It's so realistic.

769
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,716
Be gentle.

770
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,453
Hi.

771
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,024
Hey. Money-maker Joo-won is here!

772
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,527
Is the director here?

773
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,629
He's out at a film set.

774
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:56,300
-Why?
-I came by because I felt uneasy.

775
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,403
But why do I feel uneasy

776
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,039
by your overly formal speech?

777
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,541
You must feel guilty towards my boyfriend.

778
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,677
"Boyfriend"?

779
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,780
Never mind. I'll get going, then.

780
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,317
You know Ra-im's audition is tomorrow,
right?

781
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,986
Of course.
The people from Hollywood arrive today.

782
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,490
I begged and begged for the rain,
but it hasn't come.

783
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,592
It's driving me crazy.

784
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,195
Rain? What are you talking about?

785
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,699
Is something wrong, Joo-won?

786
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,405
KOREA LOVES DARK BLOOD

787
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,506
KOREAN FANS LOVE DARK BLOOD

788
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,566
Drink it. It's warm.

789
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,801
Are you nervous?

790
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,269
You're weird.

791
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,606
I make others nervous,
not the other way around.

792
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,111
Good luck today.

793
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:15,846
Let's go in.

794
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,814
Wait.

795
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,950
Where are you?

796
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,252
The chairman paid a surprise visit.
What do we do?

797
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,855
Why today of all days?

798
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,225
-What do I do?
-What's wrong?

799
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,926
My grandfather is at the department store.

800
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,763
He's going to be so mad
if he knows I skipped work.

801
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,031
Then you'll go to work.

802
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,635
We still have an hour. I'll go right now.

803
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,671
Then you want me to go in there alone?

804
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,006
I'll come right back.

805
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,942
Can't I just tell him
I'm at some economic meeting?

806
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,477
There are tons of meetings recently.

807
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:48,979
Give me your keys.

808
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,052
Are you sure you can pull it off
and not look strange?

809
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,354
I'm sure. I'm good at it now.

810
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,823
It's cold, so go inside. Bye!

811
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,831
What is with this punk?

812
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,069
I thought I made it clear,
but he's still slacking off?

813
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:15,839
He's been good lately.
He had to go out today of all days.

814
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,508
At times,

815
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,811
I find that his absence

816
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:23,713
is overwhelming, sir.

817
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,151
Since it is I who always has to fill

818
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,820
his empty presence.

819
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,756
How close are you? Hurry!

820
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,191
Sometimes,

821
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:38,128
I feel that perhaps it would be better
if I took that position.

822
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:40,964
What are you on about?

823
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,666
How dare you say such a thing!

824
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,302
Do you want to see me get a divorce?

825
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,938
Even the position you are in now
is undeserved.

826
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,008
Why are you so harsh on your brother?

827
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:56,213
Seeing Joo-won's behavior,
I can understand why he feels that way.

828
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,282
It is because you defend him like this

829
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,551
that he fosters false hope.

830
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,887
You pathetic soul.

831
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,290
That position is not for you.
Why don't you get it?

832
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:08,959
Bong-hui...

833
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,501
I'm sorry. I was at a meeting...

834
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,303
Do you ever think with that head of yours?

835
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,705
Sir.

836
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,907
I'm sorry for coming when you're busy.

837
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,877
We're just shopping for presents
for our friends.

838
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,146
Don't mind us.

839
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,749
We should get going too.
Let's go, Mr. Chairman.

840
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,652
I'm going to come unannounced again.

841
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,521
Watch what happens if you're not here.

842
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:39,656
Punk.

843
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,993
I'm sorry. Drive safely.

844
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,673
Did something happen?
You don't look so good.

845
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,176
You must be

846
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,980
really happy.

847
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,063
What's with him? Did something happen?

848
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,199
Don't get me started.

849
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,500
Mr. Park was like,

850
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,571
"It would be better
if I took that position."

851
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,306
Then Madam Park was like,

852
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,042
"What are you on about? Dream on!"

853
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,177
She saved the day--

854
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,212
Okay.

855
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,682
I have something urgent to take care of,
so call me if anything happens.

856
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,151
What?

857
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,720
Where are you going now?

858
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,892
What's taking her so long?

859
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,968
Darn it.

860
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,241
Hurry up and get over here.
I'm getting nervous all by myself.

861
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,979
No! I'm going to wait until you get here.

862
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,448
I don't care if my hands
and feet freeze off!

863
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,218
I just got out.

864
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,654
I'll be there in no time.

865
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,026
Why is it so slow?

866
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,631
You're taking the elevator?

867
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,432
Yes.

868
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,844
I've been taking the stairs
to conserve energy,

869
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,879
but I'm in a bit of a hurry today.

870
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,984
Okay, then.

871
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,810
STAFF ONLY

872
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,882
Go eat lunch.

873
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,116
We already ate.

874
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,786
Just go, if I tell you to.
Don't you know who I am?

875
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,255
Or do you not understand?

876
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,324
We understand, sir.

877
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,477
What? He's really taking the elevator?

878
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,513
What is wrong with him these days?

879
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,438
Hello?

880
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,507
Is anybody there?

881
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,243
Hello?

882
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,248
Hello?

883
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,358
Mr. Park?

884
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,627
You're there, right?

885
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,964
How does he know?

886
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,467
I know you're watching me.

887
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,439
What do I do? What should I do?

888
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,710
I wasn't here. I was never here.

889
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,413
I'm not here!

890
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,483
This is crazy.

891
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,619
Mr. Park.

892
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:04,921
Let's not do this.

893
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,191
I really don't have the time right now.

894
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:13,797
Hello?

895
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:15,999
Mr. Park!

896
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,005
Why isn't she coming?

897
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,114
It's rain.

898
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,982
It's rain!

899
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,051
It's rain!

900
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,561
Hello?

901
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:46,796
Is anyone out there?

902
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,899
I'm stuck in here!

903
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,262
It's me again.

904
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,999
It really must be the rain...

905
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,534
I'm back.

906
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,436
I'm back now!

907
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,742
It was the rain.

908
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,411
It really was the rain.

909
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,416
Is anyone there?

910
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,724
Open the door.

911
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,960
Open the door!

912
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,299
The audition!

913
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,872
Yes! I made it on time!

914
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,443
Joo-won, I can audition...

915
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,085
The elevator!

916
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:35,932
Open up!

917
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,267
I said open the door!

918
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,304
Open the door!

919
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:29,519
Hello?

920
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,055
Kim Joo-won!

921
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,223
Hello?

922
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,631
I told you

923
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,833
you shouldn't

924
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,602
take...

925
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,073
the elevator.

926
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,056
Hello?

927
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,193
Kim Joo-won!

928
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,528
Kim Joo-won!

929
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,997
Answer me!

930
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:21,904
Kim Joo-won!

931
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:24,674
Answer me!

932
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,976
Say something!

933
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,679
