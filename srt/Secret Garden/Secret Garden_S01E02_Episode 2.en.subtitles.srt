1
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,463
You're still as cool as ever,

2
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,598
Gil Ra-im.

3
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,736
You know her name?

4
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,806
Then how do you know my name?

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,840
You, stay quiet.

6
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,509
Stop being rude to her.

7
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,611
Don't you know the famous poem?

8
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,514
"Until I call her name,

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,948
she is but a gesture.

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,919
When I call out her name,
she would come and--"

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,521
-Do you want a tip?
-Tip me.

12
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,423
Hey!

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,859
What I meant to say is...

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,297
What's wrong with your arm? Are you hurt?

15
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,532
Obviously.

16
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,300
That's the hand that gives out tips.

17
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:11,104
You don't want those dirty hands
touching you, right, Gil Ra-im?

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,939
Geez.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,975
I was going to blow on it.

20
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,079
It might heal faster if I do.

21
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,387
Weren't you here about Park Chae-rin?
I guess you don't care anymore.

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,055
Right...

23
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,825
What happened. Did you keep her quiet?

24
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,293
-Do you want to know?
-What do you think?

25
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,463
-Then get in.
-What?

26
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,131
That Chae-rin girl takes
really good pictures.

27
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,766
-The angles--
-All right!

28
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,367
Okay, I'm getting in.

29
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,002
Get in on the count of three.

30
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,637
One.

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,206
-Until next time then.
-Two.

32
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,741
-Two and a half, two and two-thirds.
-All right. You better hurry up.

33
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,410
Two and three quarters.

34
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,347
He hits on any girl...

35
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,618
What the...

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,155
Hey, I told you! When I'm speaking...

37
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,665
Hey! Did you see the pictures?
What did she say?

38
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,267
Do the reporters know? Were there a lot?

39
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,768
Hey!

40
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,466
It's Oska!

41
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,068
Oska?

42
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,648
You can go see him if you want.

43
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,083
No, sir. I should do my job.

44
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,985
-Go.
-It's all right.

45
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,454
Aren't you his fan?

46
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,623
Didn't you do a movie together?

47
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,926
He probably doesn't remember me.

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,329
I wasn't even a lead.
I was just a stunt double.

49
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,699
It's done!

50
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,682
Really?

51
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,885
Yes. He remembers everything,
even my name.

52
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,522
He didn't say, "You're still pretty."

53
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,292
He said, "You're still cool as ever."
That was so dreamy.

54
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,860
That's a surprise.

55
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,163
He's usually surrounded by pretty girls.

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,432
Was he drunk?

57
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,700
No.

58
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,270
Hey, my socks...

59
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,207
Socks? You probably forgot to wear them.
At our age, we tend to be forgetful.

60
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,710
No, I put them on this morning...

61
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,578
How does he look in person?
Is he good-looking?

62
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,014
The rumors are crazy.
They say he's a snob.

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,549
Who cares?

64
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,585
It's not like I'll see him again.

65
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,788
Tomorrow, it'll all feel like a dream.

66
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,293
Let me enjoy it for today.

67
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,674
Hey! What happened with Chae-rin?

68
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,576
Don't talk to me, I'm in the worst mood.

69
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,279
Why are you angry?
I should be the angry one.

70
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,547
I said I'd take her home
but she rudely wouldn't let me!

71
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,116
I even offered to close the roof.

72
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,052
And why did I even offer her a ride home?
I'm so annoyed!

73
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,888
What are you talking about?
I know she's not your type.

74
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,890
You're just doing this to drive me insane.

75
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,259
You said you would tell me what happened
with Chae-rin in the car!

76
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,728
Then you should've stayed in the car.
You got out in the middle.

77
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,196
Because that girl was leaving.

78
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,032
I never said you could get out
if she left.

79
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:03,369
No, you didn't. But I still got out,
so it's my fault. Happy now?

80
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,141
Do you ever use your head?

81
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,444
If Chae-rin was going to cause trouble,
do you think I'd let you stand there

82
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,981
and say ridiculous things like
"I was going to blow on it"?

83
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,283
You punk. So you did sort it out.

84
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,219
I knew you would.
Because you're truly evil.

85
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,122
And that's why we need to
write a new contract.

86
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,559
I'd rather die than have to become her fan
over a mere contract renewal.

87
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,461
What do you mean?
Why would you be her fan?

88
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,129
If you don't want to sign, say so.

89
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,898
I'll get you the most attention
since your debut.

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,400
Is that a threat?

91
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,502
You're quick when it comes to legal terms.

92
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,139
The store events begin tomorrow.
Come dressed up and sign the autographs.

93
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,974
Yeah, right! Why would I do that?

94
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,412
Did you

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,581
buy my pictures by any chance?

96
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,286
FALL SEASON SALE
OSKA SIGNING EVENT

97
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,456
SUBMISSION BOX

98
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,163
We're doing much better than last year.

99
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,832
It's all thanks to your idea.

100
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,904
Then may I leave early today
without everyone badmouthing me?

101
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,610
Go ahead.

102
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,579
I think we'll be good
until the Christmas season.

103
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,416
So do you plan to relax until then,

104
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,818
and wait for Santa Claus?

105
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,854
I can't relax just because you do.

106
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,222
I'm just an employee.

107
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,193
Since you can't,

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,096
normally you'd do it in secret.
To keep it thrilling.

109
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,566
I don't know about that.

110
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,802
I have a weak heart.

111
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,238
And with planning for our
25th-anniversary event,

112
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,773
I'm too busy to--

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,943
I would prefer that you
didn't work overtime,

114
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,246
but I'll look forward to
what you have planned.

115
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,216
Well, it's like I said.

116
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,985
It's the same event every year,

117
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,923
so the range of events that can be run
are narrower than you might think.

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,060
Of course it'd be nice
if it were more novel and exciting.

119
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,230
That's just more work
and costs more money.

120
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:48,468
I think it's best that you refer
to last year's plan.

121
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,082
Are you all right?

122
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,417
No, I'm not.

123
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,953
I'll terminate him one way or another.

124
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,755
Do you have any ideas?

125
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,293
I'm going to tell my mom.

126
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,267
Thank you.

127
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,174
Why you...

128
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,911
Thank you.

129
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,818
Thank you.

130
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,624
Burn down that banner
when you get the chance.

131
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,094
-And where's Dong-gyu?
-He's in a meeting with the director.

132
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,030
Producer Park barely managed to find one.

133
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,866
-It's a female director.
-A female?

134
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,302
Is she hot? Yes, thank you.

135
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,404
How could you?

136
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,073
Didn't producer Park tell you
that I'm a talented director?

137
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,309
I'm embarrassed that you're so shocked.

138
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,346
I like doing commercials,
but I'm expanding my range.

139
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,782
Leave the music video up to me.

140
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,450
I don't think that's possible.

141
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,152
I don't know about you,
but U-yeong is still--

142
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,053
I know.

143
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,487
Then?

144
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,690
I'm the only one who can control him.

145
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,025
I heard no one wants this job.

146
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,128
Even if there was, who could control him?

147
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,331
Didn't the last director quit
in the middle of the shoot?

148
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,067
Just leave this one to me.

149
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,904
I'm not playing around with him.

150
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,506
I'm through with that.

151
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,946
Anyway, I made a draft of the script.

152
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,449
Why are you doing this?

153
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,318
I don't want him to remember me

154
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,454
as his first love.

155
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,489
We're going to be family soon.

156
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,625
"Family"?

157
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,894
Blind date? Sure, I'll go. Why not?

158
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,165
At seven? All right.

159
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,768
It's the same place every time.

160
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,570
Okay.

161
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,475
Why do I keep thinking about her?

162
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,747
Let's not think about it...

163
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,382
Let's not think about it.

164
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,721
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

165
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,956
Four little, five little,
Six little Indians

166
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,927
Seven little, eight little,
Nine little Indians

167
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,098
Ten little Indian boys

168
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,569
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

169
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,470
Four little...

170
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,510
CHA SANG-MUN, THE GENIUS RABBIT

171
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,094
This is driving me nuts.

172
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,931
At least change your clothes.

173
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,499
There's blood on that!

174
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,139
Look, I don't know why this is happening,

175
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,441
but you are far from my type.

176
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,876
My ideal type is...

177
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,358
When did I ever fantasize about this...

178
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,627
Okay, maybe I did.

179
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,429
But you're still not my ideal type!

180
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,798
First, she has to be intelligent.

181
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,638
Must be under 24 years.

182
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,806
Sweetie.

183
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,046
Her family has to be
in the top 30 wealthiest...

184
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,620
I must be losing my mind.

185
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,590
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

186
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,893
Four little, five little,
Six little Indians

187
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,695
Seven little, eight little,
Nine little Indians

188
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,699
Go away! Away with you.

189
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,271
One little, two little, three little...

190
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,177
Good job at the autograph event.

191
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,115
Are you still mad?

192
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,518
Okay, I'll go.

193
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,988
By the way.

194
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,457
Remember that...

195
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,963
You know, that girl we met
near Ji-hyeon's hospital?

196
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,267
Gil Ra-im? What about her.

197
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,102
Do you have her number by any chance?

198
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,739
-What if I do?
-Well, do you?

199
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,042
Of course I don't.
I only met her once a long time ago.

200
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,311
Then why didn't you just say so?

201
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,618
Then can you give me
Park Chae-rin's number?

202
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,053
Why do you want her number?

203
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,659
Are you really trying
to buy those pictures?

204
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,104
Can't you drink your coffee faster?

205
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,340
I just want to get the number and go.

206
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,076
Oh, you must be busy.

207
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,712
Give me your phone, I'll save it for you.

208
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:44,316
My boss was in when you called the office,
so it was pretty awkward when I picked up.

209
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,653
-Give me your phone.
-I don't want your number.

210
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,356
The girl who was wearing
the same outfit as you.

211
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,424
-What?
-You know.

212
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,727
She acts just like a boy.

213
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,230
Her eyes are sharp when she looks down,
but they sparkle when she looks up.

214
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,332
The one who looks like
she'll keep popping into your head.

215
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,967
Your stuntwoman.

216
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,404
Don't you have her number?

217
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,775
Is that why you called me out?

218
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,710
Why else would I?

219
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:16,015
There's nothing about her online
and it seemed rude to spy on her.

220
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,850
This seemed like the fastest way.

221
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,920
Fine, but what's in it for me?

222
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,255
I'll return the favor.
If you ever want to meet someone

223
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,725
but you can't reach them, I'll tell you.
For example,

224
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,763
someone like Oska perhaps,
who's avoiding your calls?

225
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,223
Is this Gil Ra-im?

226
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,725
Yes. Who is this?

227
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,061
You don't remember my voice?

228
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,363
It's not that easy to forget.

229
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,597
Who is this?

230
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,101
We went to the hotel together

231
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,938
and I don't care much for strangers
but I took you to the hospital.

232
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,574
I also offered you a ride home but...

233
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,942
Why did you call?

234
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,510
Let's meet up.

235
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,512
Me? Why?

236
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,682
Instead of asking why,
can't we just meet up first?

237
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,451
No, we can't.

238
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,422
Hello?

239
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,227
Why is she so unpredictable?

240
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:44,937
The phone you have dialed is turned off.

241
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,787
Good job.

242
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,565
Look at me!

243
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,016
One, two, three, four

244
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,052
Everyone look at me!

245
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,887
That's right. Everyone listen!

246
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,290
Yo, a hip hop
and brass instrument collaboration...

247
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,057
Do you know where Gil Ra-im--

248
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,193
What are your eyes for?

249
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,028
Can't you see the line?

250
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,497
I don't wait in lines, so just tell her--

251
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,366
Those who don't wait in line are asses.

252
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,470
If you want to meet Gil Ra-im,
go to the back of the line.

253
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,038
No, I just need to...

254
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,873
Where are your manners?

255
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,510
-Yeah. What a jerk.
-Go to the back of the line.

256
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,779
-What is he doing?
-Go back!

257
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,482
-Go to the back!
-We're all in line.

258
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,083
-Stand in line.
-Go to the back.

259
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,485
Go to the back of the line.

260
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,753
Don't you see the line?

261
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,156
What a jerk.

262
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,938
It's her.

263
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,749
But that's not the girl

264
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,620
who's been popping up in my mind

265
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,355
and making me feel like a loser.

266
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,164
The girl that's sitting
in front of my eyes

267
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,902
is so much cooler

268
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,105
than the girl I imagined.

269
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,425
I don't see your resume.

270
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,196
Think of it as me being considerate.

271
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,964
My credentials may shock you.

272
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,333
Then why are you here?

273
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,103
Because of the girl sitting next to you.
She wouldn't let me see her.

274
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,106
How's your arm? Did you get treatment?

275
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,445
-If you're not here to--
-What are you doing afterwards?

276
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,080
I have to tell you something.

277
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,250
-If you're not here to--
-Fine, I'll do it.

278
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,085
What should I do?

279
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,688
Do you have any special skills?

280
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,991
-I make a lot of money.
-Wow, nice!

281
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,526
That's good if you make a lot of money.

282
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,929
But we can't verify that here,
so show us something.

283
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,637
I have a lot of money.
And my hobby is to spend lots of it.

284
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,105
You're in!

285
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,408
-You pass!
-He passes!

286
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,190
He had me mistaken for Chae-rin
and many things happened after that...

287
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,994
So I ended up in the hospital somehow...

288
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,962
All right.

289
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,865
Please, don't take this the wrong way.

290
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,833
I'm not.

291
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,035
He's really weird.

292
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,337
I don't know why he came today--

293
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,605
Gil Ra-im.

294
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,573
Yes?

295
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,209
He's not weird at all. He's a man.

296
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,511
And you...

297
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,513
You're a pretty decent woman.

298
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,224
Okay, Joo-won.

299
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,160
Our rich Joo-won, how were you educated?

300
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,429
It's a standard procedure,
so no need to be nervous.

301
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,503
Oh, yeah, I know that place.

302
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,940
-They grow coffee there...
-That's right, coffee.

303
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,709
That's not the place.

304
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,011
Maybe not?

305
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,581
You haven't forgotten today's date, right?

306
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,523
Follow me.

307
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,962
What's with you?

308
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,130
What do you mean?

309
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,665
Who do you think you are?

310
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,868
Do you think I'm a pushover?
Or do you have something against me?

311
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,738
Is that the only type of people
that come for you?

312
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,106
Did you just laugh?

313
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,842
You think you're the first jerk
I've come across?

314
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,678
"Jerk"? Did you just say jerk?

315
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,646
Be quiet.

316
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,849
So you have a lot of money?
You make a lot of money?

317
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,417
Oska makes that money, not you.

318
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,220
Of course, Oska makes money too.
But I have a lot even without working.

319
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,488
I said be quiet.

320
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,291
You think our profession is a joke?

321
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:40,959
Yet you're a bum.

322
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,361
"A bum"?

323
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,996
Hey, that's my dream.

324
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,166
No matter how hard I try not to work,
everything I say is a great idea--

325
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,436
Hey! Why are you keep changing the subject
and making me mad?

326
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,207
Why are you showing up at my work
and embarrassing me?

327
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,441
Hey,

328
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,945
what kind of girl talks like you?

329
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:04,349
Can't you say it in a bashful
and cute tone?

330
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,086
You don't know who I am,
but you can't treat me like this.

331
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,554
Get over yourself.

332
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,423
Hurry up and tell me why you're here.

333
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,359
I already told you.
I'm here because of you.

334
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,495
So why are you here because of me?

335
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,097
That's what I don't get either.

336
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,202
If I tell you,
I'm just going to sound crazy.

337
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,173
So for today, let's just say that
I came for the hospital bill.

338
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,474
What?

339
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,177
I paid for your stitches.

340
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,680
You left in that director's arms,

341
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,550
without even a thank you.

342
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,853
How much was it?

343
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,289
How much?

344
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,158
Are you always here
when you don't have a shoot?

345
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,093
Can I see you if I come here?

346
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,228
Do you think I'd stay here every day
so you can see me?

347
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,997
Just tell me how much it is.

348
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:53,698
Don't you want your money?

349
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,500
This is why I keep thinking about you.

350
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,636
What?

351
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,971
I noticed this before
and I'm noticing it now again.

352
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,041
You're such a strange girl.

353
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,911
Why do you look prettier
when you're angry?

354
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,651
What are you doing?

355
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,291
Let go.

356
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,593
Let me just check on your wound.

357
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,428
I wouldn't have to do this
if you told me earlier.

358
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,555
It's scarred.

359
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,625
I guess you can't run for Miss Korea.

360
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,908
I'll get going for now.

361
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,676
I forgot I had important plans.

362
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,213
I'll help you so it won't scar.
Go to the same hospital from last time.

363
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,548
Call me when you do.

364
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,201
Her maternal grandfather was the CEO
of Daehan Shipbuilding,

365
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,104
and her maternal uncle is the dean of
Myung-Sung University.

366
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,872
She received her master's degree
in the U.S.

367
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,974
Let's hear what's going on here.

368
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,410
Last time I met you through
my father's side,

369
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,479
and this time,
it's through my mother's side.

370
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,181
I really wanted to meet you again.

371
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,286
You already know how I walk,
my tastes in perfume and such,

372
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,288
so shall we sit?

373
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,228
You've wasted your time.

374
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,698
Next time,
will it be through your uncle's side?

375
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,102
I still believe that an arranged marriage
without wasting time is the best--

376
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,037
I know.

377
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:16,074
So I've given it a lot of thought.
Over and over.

378
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,477
In the end, I still believe in fate.

379
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,080
So arranged marriages aren't for me.

380
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,015
-And?
-But I realized

381
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,352
that I have met the one.

382
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,220
It's you, Joo-won.

383
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:38,096
Sorry, but you should give it
some more thought.

384
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,267
As for me,
I will deal with my own unexpected fate.

385
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,969
Goodbye, then.

386
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,439
Haven't you ever experienced
love at first sight?

387
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,742
You have, haven't you?
Then you know why I--

388
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,878
I thought you were dumb
but I didn't think you were gullible.

389
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,414
If some guy tells you
he fell in love with you at first sight,

390
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,983
punch him.

391
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:02,153
That's just another way of saying,
"I want to hurry and get in bed with you."

392
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,434
Not all men are like that.

393
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,439
Your cousin is one such man.

394
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,308
That's what I'm saying.

395
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,777
He might not fall
for my modern girl persona,

396
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,513
but no man has resisted my Harlequin.

397
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,415
But this guy...

398
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,486
It's Oska!

399
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,121
Oh my!

400
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,023
He has such a nice face.

401
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,557
He's so my type.

402
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,026
He's so handsome.

403
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,494
Let's take a photo.

404
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,064
Guess we were too late
to avoid one another.

405
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,169
Did you lose weight?

406
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,906
If I knew I was going to run into you,
I would've dolled myself up.

407
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,177
Excuse me, please.

408
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,983
Don't stand there like that,
you're blocking the way.

409
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,419
You're still a baby, aren't you?

410
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,022
Aren't you supposed to be in the U.S.?

411
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,727
You're early. I'm from Man Korea--

412
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,096
Have fun with your interview.
We'll meet again.

413
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,899
We'll catch up on old times then.

414
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,678
I can wait if you're busy.

415
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,847
It's okay.

416
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,817
I don't stop women from approaching
nor do I hold on to those who leave.

417
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,120
I'm grateful for women who approach me
and even more so for those who leave.

418
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:46,157
In light of that, may I have your name,
beautiful reporter?

419
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,625
Oh, here.

420
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,527
Thank you. This way, please.

421
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,467
Did I say I won't go on dates?

422
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,303
I don't want a girl
who rambles about fate.

423
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,739
It just has to be a girl
who would be a good housewife and mother.

424
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,373
"Looks"?

425
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,243
Of course, she has to be pretty, Mom.

426
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:11,349
Someone with a chic bob cut,
dark skin, doesn't smile often...

427
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,629
Gets angry often and has sad eyes.

428
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,032
And someone who can't run for Miss Korea
because of a scar.

429
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,902
Am I crazy?

430
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,607
Mom, I'm just asking this

431
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,611
but if I really go crazy,
do I still get my inheritance--

432
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,247
Hello?

433
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,582
Mom?

434
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,554
This is all your fault!

435
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,689
Are you going to take responsibility
when I'm broke?

436
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,826
You always tell me to take responsibility.

437
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,529
You even talk now?

438
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,732
Why am I imagining this?

439
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,535
And when did she ever smile at me
like that?

440
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,237
Am I really going crazy?

441
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,577
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

442
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,312
Four little, five little,
Six little Indians

443
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,382
Seven little, eight little,
Nine little Indians

444
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,820
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

445
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,521
Four little, five little,
Six little Indians

446
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,693
Louder!

447
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,272
Let me just check on your wound.

448
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,849
It's scarred.

449
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,851
I guess you can't run for Miss Korea.

450
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,220
Gil Ra-im!

451
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,721
Yes. I'll be right out.

452
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,877
You're such a strange girl.

453
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,612
Why do you look prettier
when you're angry?

454
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,051
Get your head together, will you?

455
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,787
Why are you so distracted?

456
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,958
I'm sorry.

457
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,159
Is it because of your arm?

458
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,127
No.

459
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,330
If not, why are you like this?
How will you shoot in this condition?

460
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,099
Can I shoot again?

461
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,400
Don't even dream about it.

462
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,869
Starting today,
you're in charge of the rookies.

463
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:45,837
Director!

464
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,472
Don't come on set for now.

465
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,675
-The rest, prepare for the car stunt.
-Yes, sir.

466
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,844
Director!

467
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,965
Look on the bright side.
When else would you get a break?

468
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,936
That rich guy didn't show up today.
The guy who said he makes good money.

469
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,738
I really liked him. He had quick reflexes.

470
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,175
How do you know if he has quick reflexes?

471
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,844
Didn't you hear how he spoke?
He was quick with his comebacks.

472
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,915
Did you drag him outside and beat him up?

473
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,084
Am I some kind of thug?

474
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,453
He's not interested in this kind of work.

475
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,022
That's right. He's interested in you.

476
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,324
It's not like that!

477
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,125
You're denying it a little too strongly.

478
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,228
-Seriously, why are you acting like this?
-Okay, I'll stop. But give me your phone.

479
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,331
-My phone?
-I didn't bring mine, hurry.

480
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,074
A-yeong, Jeong-hwan,
dry cleaners, restaurant,

481
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,910
Shim Se-jeong FD, service center, 010...

482
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,913
Your life is really depressing.

483
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,984
This 6159 is the rich guy, right?

484
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,218
What are you doing?

485
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,853
Please don't.

486
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,121
Please give it back.

487
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,723
-What are you doing?
-I have a signal.

488
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,158
What happened at the VIP lounge?

489
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,960
It's nothing serious.

490
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,731
An employee admitted
an unqualified customer.

491
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,467
That employee is a woman, right?

492
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,835
Are you dating her?

493
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:24,769
Excuse me?

494
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,172
No, of course not.

495
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,174
Then why are you wasting time
with something so obvious?

496
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,845
Are you all sentimental now
because I haven't been yelling at you?

497
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,447
Fire her. Next.

498
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,984
But in my opinion,
she has worked diligently for five years.

499
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,787
Instead of deciding so hastily,
why don't you take this call first?

500
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,160
This is real, right?

501
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,561
It's an actual call, right?

502
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,730
I'm not daydreaming, am I?

503
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,734
I think you might be.

504
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,671
Hello?

505
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:04,675
Hello?

506
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,010
Give it to me!

507
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,647
What are you waiting for?
Tell him to hurry over.

508
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,787
This is Gil Ra-im.

509
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,224
Hey, rookie.
Get your butt over here, right now!

510
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,592
You punk.

511
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,262
Do I have to call you to get you here?

512
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,531
Get over here while I'm being nice.

513
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,167
Unless you want your fifth spinal disc
to become your sixth.

514
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:30,968
I'm hanging up.

515
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,741
Hello?

516
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,877
What's with this!

517
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,080
Who was it?

518
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,714
Who do you think?

519
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,817
The one that keeps popping up
and making me feel crazy...

520
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,194
Is what I hope none of you do.

521
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,129
By the way,

522
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,499
who knows where the fifth spinal disc is?

523
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,307
Hey, take these with you.

524
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,581
The concept for our 25th-anniversary event

525
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,516
is a prize giveaway.

526
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:23,654
The theme will be a romantic getaway
with Oska for four days.

527
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,628
The destination for the trip
will be Jeju Island.

528
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,271
Sir...

529
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,106
Yes?

530
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,887
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

531
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,358
Did you hear everything?

532
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,596
I guess this is the best solution.
Go ahead and proceed.

533
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,972
Everyone else may leave,

534
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,741
but Mr. Choi, please stay behind.

535
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,789
Mr. Choi,

536
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:36,561
I'd like our department store
to sponsor movies or dramas too.

537
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,828
Excuse me?

538
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,632
You said you hated things like that...

539
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,034
That's why I asked you politely.

540
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,671
Did you not feel how polite I was?

541
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,543
I did! I felt it deep in my bones.

542
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,679
Great.

543
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,414
But the thing is,

544
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,251
I don't want some sappy drama
with cringy lines.

545
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,921
You know action movies,
where people jump around with swords?

546
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:08,159
I'd like to sponsor something
that requires a lot of stunt work.

547
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,927
Excuse me?

548
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,151
The man who lies here
passed away in 2007 during a movie shoot.

549
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,786
His name is Ji Jung-hyeon.

550
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:40,791
He was a mentor to everyone,
including Director Lim Jong-su.

551
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,161
As you should know,

552
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,898
we don't do what we do
to be rich or famous.

553
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,336
Our seniors can hand down their expertise,

554
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,672
but they can't give you fame or money.

555
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,409
Some people may call us extras

556
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,979
and others may call us stuntmen.

557
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,816
But we are real actors
no matter what people say.

558
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,655
That is our only source of pride.

559
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:16,527
And we may become disabled or even die
for that pride.

560
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,830
If you feel you aren't sure that
this is the right path for you,

561
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,300
then quit now.

562
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,269
It may sound like I'm threatening you.

563
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,638
But this is from my heart.

564
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,712
Did you think this job would be cool?
Are you afraid?

565
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,980
-No.
-No.

566
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,381
Then lift your heads up.

567
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,988
I'll trust that you've taken
what I said to heart,

568
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,757
and we'll move on
to check your disposition.

569
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,826
Get moving.

570
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,494
Here.

571
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,496
Kick it.

572
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,002
Get the ball.

573
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,937
Yes, ma'am.

574
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,171
Excuse me! Please pass the ball.

575
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,886
Ra-im!

576
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,221
Are you all right?

577
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,156
What the heck?

578
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,429
Why would you place your head
in the path of the ball?

579
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,564
Is that a new technique?

580
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,932
Why that...

581
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,282
Attention.

582
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,819
-What?
-Attention!

583
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,854
Geez.

584
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,424
Like this?

585
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,391
Do it properly.

586
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,894
How else can I do it?
Want me to glue my arms to my body?

587
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,264
Warn me before you--

588
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,233
If you hit me in the head,
you must have decent footwork.

589
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,568
So make sure you win.

590
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,570
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

591
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,238
What? Win what?

592
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,241
Even in the army I didn't play this.

593
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,277
If you don't want to play,
would you rather be the ball?

594
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,981
Fine. But don't complain later
about your sores and bruises.

595
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,750
I won't hold back
just because you're a girl.

596
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,958
-Do you think this is dodgeball?
-What are you? The goalie?

597
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,726
It was a bad serve.

598
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,697
To the side!

599
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,333
Just kick it.

600
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,634
How can I reach that?

601
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,971
Up above!

602
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,139
What on earth are you doing?

603
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,807
Give me a good pass.

604
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,143
Kick it over!

605
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,512
Pass it right here.

606
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,782
You should've done a header!

607
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,983
That's my face!

608
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,552
Give me a heads up!

609
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,522
To be fair, that wasn't mine.

610
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,157
Geez!

611
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,762
-That's it!
-Go!

612
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,198
-Just quit.
-What are you doing?

613
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,470
Why am the only one trying?

614
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,506
Actively pursue the ball!

615
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,807
Do you play with your mouth?

616
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,548
Get ready.

617
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,250
Let's do this!

618
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,552
Hello?

619
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,387
Hey!

620
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,688
Are you okay?

621
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,724
His nose is bleeding!

622
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,959
He's bleeding.

623
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,261
Are you okay?

624
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,829
Does he look okay?

625
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,064
He's about to die.

626
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,799
Sue her.

627
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,102
It's the only way she will learn.

628
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,737
This isn't just a game.

629
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,739
She attacked you.

630
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,675
That's intent to do bodily harm.

631
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,915
To end the day, we'll be doing
100 PT sets and 100 sit-ups.

632
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,718
If I catch you slacking off,
I'll add another zero to the end.

633
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,489
You heard her. Slacking off can kill you.

634
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,590
Sue her.

635
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,728
Keep your eye on Mr. Sparkles
to make sure he does it right.

636
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,197
Let's not all suffer
from one guy's mistakes.

637
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,201
Darn it.

638
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,507
You must be mistaken.

639
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,043
-This brand--
-Let's start.

640
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,279
One, two, three. Hut!

641
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,914
Everyone, stop!

642
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,017
Not bad.

643
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,720
Gentlemen, today is your lucky day.

644
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:16,026
Whatever drink you imagine,
you can drink and have more.

645
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,027
-Drink?
-Alcohol?

646
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,935
What are you doing here?

647
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,404
I told them to keep an eye on you.

648
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,310
You washed your hair.

649
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,845
Why did you wash your hair?

650
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,247
-Move.
-It's strange.

651
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,384
You only had to wash your face
but you washed your hair too.

652
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,854
Girls always try to charm guys

653
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,856
with wet hair
and smelling like fragrant shampoo--

654
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,024
Attention.

655
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,127
Don't you dare kick me.

656
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,064
What is wrong with you?

657
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,073
What's going on? Where is everyone?

658
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,075
They left. I sent them away.

659
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,079
We needed some time alone.

660
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,582
Have you lost your mind?

661
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,418
-I am a little strange these days.
-Then visit a doctor.

662
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,854
You're not in your right mind.
Why are you getting a diagnosis here?

663
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,422
Because you're the root cause.

664
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,658
I barely got that bloodied outfit off

665
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,028
and now I guess you'll chase me around
with wet hair. What of it?

666
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,896
-Bloodied what?
-Forget it.

667
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,900
Stand there for a minute so I can decide
whether I really need a doctor or not.

668
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,103
-Are you sure you aren't crazy?
-I'm doing this so I wouldn't be.

669
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:38,042
Fine. Then let me just ask two questions.
Answer them with sincerity.

670
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,043
Okay?

671
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,746
Did you graduate from college?

672
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,416
In Seoul? Elsewhere?

673
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,619
Or perhaps overseas?

674
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,489
What's your second question?

675
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,726
Is there a family member,
including your relatives...

676
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,095
In other words, your family clan.

677
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:02,132
Could it by any chance be one
that I'm familiar with?

678
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,634
Perhaps a grandfather

679
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:08,172
or your parents have a corporation,
museum or university

680
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,175
affiliated with their names...

681
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,779
I hope you have health insurance.

682
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,114
What?

683
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,963
Stop being a wimp.

684
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,531
I'm just getting started.

685
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,279
Get off!

686
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,448
So you can throw me again?

687
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,917
All I asked was your parents' names.
Is that so wrong?

688
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,586
And why do you want to know?

689
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,087
Get off me while I'm being nice.

690
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,256
Or else you're dead.

691
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:00,991
The things you say.

692
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,826
You think I can't overpower a girl?

693
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,296
Also I've wanted to tell you this
from day one and this is the perfect time.

694
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,731
So listen up.

695
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,467
This jacket is extremely expensive.

696
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:12,803
You really are a screwball.

697
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,239
Ra-im! That crazy girl from...

698
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,580
What brings you here?

699
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,316
You didn't pick up,
so I figured you'd be training.

700
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,354
Is your next job a romance movie?

701
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,822
No.

702
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,224
What's this about a crazy girl?

703
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,796
Remember that girl who picked
a fight with us at the lounge?

704
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,465
She called the head office.

705
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,467
I just got fired.

706
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,701
What? You got fired?

707
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,671
Yes!
No wonder my mirror cracked this morning.

708
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,241
Why even go on living
in this unfair world?

709
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,609
LOEL
LIM A-YEONG

710
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,444
I know VVIPs are important,

711
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:58,448
but no one even gave me a chance
to explain myself.

712
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:02,519
Isn't the CEO such a crappy jerk?

713
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,522
You should've told them
that it was all my fault.

714
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,492
It's not your fault. It's that crazy girl.

715
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,228
I'm going to get revenge.

716
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:16,466
I'm going to write on the company forum
that the CEO is gay.

717
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,135
"Gay"?

718
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,705
You can tell by his looks.
He hates women, too.

719
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,207
By the way, who's this?

720
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,541
-Well, actually--
-He's nobody.

721
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,011
I'll close this place up, so call a cab.
Let's go together.

722
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:28,979
Go where?

723
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,881
I thought you were close to his secretary.

724
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,917
Let's ask him to explain to your CEO.

725
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,788
Forget it. I already tried. It's no use.

726
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,459
Of course it's no use. No use at all.

727
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,828
Are you trying to fan the flames?

728
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,831
Oh, right.
I was about to introduce myself.

729
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,133
-I'm the one who lit that flame.
-What?

730
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,768
I'm the crappy jerk.

731
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,905
The CEO of the department store
you just got fired from.

732
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,975
What on earth?

733
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,378
So what you're saying is...

734
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,646
That you really are the CEO!

735
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,481
He looks like you.

736
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,850
And that crazy expensive jacket.

737
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,628
You do acknowledge that you made a mistake
in ignoring the regulations, correct?

738
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,063
Of course I do.

739
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,531
Fine.

740
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,535
Then first off,
your friend doesn't know who I am.

741
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,171
And I'd like it to stay that way.

742
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,107
-Why?
-Haven't you seen it in the movies?

743
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,177
That's just how it's done.
And then later, voila!

744
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,117
But in the movies, knowing such a secret

745
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:44,354
would result in death or a reinstatement.

746
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,857
Reinstating you would cost less money.

747
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,459
You're very rational.

748
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,428
But I'm also very petty.

749
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,397
-Excuse me?
-You told your friend

750
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,066
that I'm gay and a crappy jerk.

751
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,902
I'm sorry. I was out of it earlier.

752
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,771
Please allow me to correct myself.

753
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,607
You have the looks of royalty.
Endless depth.

754
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,043
And a sexiness that makes people quiver.

755
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,712
Who dared fire such a good employee?

756
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,113
I know, right?

757
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,883
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Could you set it up--

758
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,986
Don't you worry about a thing.

759
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,723
But is there some reason
you have to impress Ra-im?

760
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,992
Does it look like
I need to impress anyone?

761
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,761
That wasn't what I meant...

762
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,997
Did you call the cab?
When will it be here?

763
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,799
We don't need to go anymore.

764
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,901
I think I just got reinstated.

765
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,271
What are you on about?
You even tossed your uniform earlier.

766
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,974
Me? When?

767
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,777
It probably slipped out of my hand.

768
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:45,716
Oh, and about my CEO being gay
and hating women...

769
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:49,920
He's not gay at all.
He loves women too much.

770
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,226
I doubt he loves women "too much."

771
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,696
Oh, dear. I guess not too much.
It's not too much.

772
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,499
What are you talking about?
Why are you talking nonsense?

773
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,102
Rookie, aren't you going home?

774
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,770
Oh my! Are you insane?

775
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,472
Don't raise your voice!
You'll startle him!

776
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,807
You're the one who's raising her voice.

777
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,410
So where does the secretary live?

778
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,278
How much will the cab cost?

779
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,314
I told you, I got my job back.

780
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,417
Let's go get a drink instead.

781
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,052
I do have some time.

782
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,420
What for?

783
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,690
Geez. You're so clueless.

784
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,558
This isn't just any drinks.

785
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,293
It's a magical drink.

786
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,332
It's magical!

787
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,379
So good.

788
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,285
Why aren't you eating? It's good.

789
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,956
A pig is a pig

790
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,125
because it has lots of meat.

791
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,695
So why would you leave out the meat
and eat the skin?

792
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,732
Haven't you tried this? It's really good.

793
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,967
Have some tripe then.

794
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,106
"Tripe"?

795
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,741
The organs?

796
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,011
You freaks.

797
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,533
You're dead if you make me
call you again tomorrow.

798
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,435
Make sure you're there on time.

799
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,439
I'm so sorry. I'll--

800
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,775
You live here?

801
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,478
Yes, it's been about four years.

802
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,347
Four years?

803
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,253
I normally don't ask things like this,

804
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,289
but is it a yearly lease? Or monthly rent?

805
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,992
Oh, it's monthly.

806
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,961
It's 300,000 won and we pay half each.

807
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,699
That's why I really thank you
for reinstating me.

808
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,002
Okay then. Go on in.

809
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,037
Thank you. Get home safe.

810
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,625
You're crazy, Kim Joo-won. Crazy...

811
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,603
Wake up!

812
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,306
Geez. What?

813
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,408
By any chance...

814
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,844
What's wrong?

815
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,713
Have you ever dated a woman
living in a rented home?

816
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,250
What? This is why you woke me up
in the middle of the night?

817
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,285
Have you or not?

818
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,920
Are you insane?

819
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,388
Of course, I have.

820
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,455
You have?

821
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,158
That model. Park something.

822
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,894
Anyway, the one I met early this year.
She didn't own a house.

823
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,298
Also that anchor.
Most girls in Gangnam rent.

824
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,533
Probably for around
three to four million a month.

825
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,903
Not that kind of rent.
I'm talking about a place for 300,000.

826
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,139
You mean 300,000 a day?

827
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,775
A hotel deluxe room costs about that much.

828
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,176
No, not a hotel room.

829
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,779
What, then? Explain it to me properly.

830
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,583
You know, like on National Geographic.

831
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,185
Where you see flies buzzing about
with those poor kids.

832
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,688
The type of house that's in the background
of those scenes.

833
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,024
So she lives overseas?

834
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,159
Darn it!

835
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,095
Forget it!

836
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,432
Wait! Are you

837
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:58,301
seeing Chae-rin?

838
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,239
She pays rent too?

839
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:05,308
Really?

840
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,376
Are you that happy?

841
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,444
Yes.

842
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,513
Park Chae-rin was nicer than I thought.

843
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,782
She wants to apologize to you in person.

844
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,186
Don't beat her up
because she makes it half-assed.

845
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,487
Director!

846
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,723
I'm the prettier one,
so I should be understanding.

847
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:35,839
I told the director that it had to be you.
Aren't you thankful?

848
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:37,974
Yes.

849
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:42,045
I'm pretty cool for someone this hot,
right?

850
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:44,614
You're right.

851
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,851
Then let me ask you something,
and be truthful.

852
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,887
How do you know Kim Joo-won?

853
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,823
Who is Kim Joo-won?

854
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,526
-You haven't met him?
-Do I know him?

855
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,962
Never mind, then.

856
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,364
Let's work hard today.

857
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,334
You're falling from over there
so no need for the script.

858
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,737
And you know the director
doesn't use wires, right?

859
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,005
Good luck.

860
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,293
Cut! That's no good.

861
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,629
What's wrong with your form?

862
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,965
I told you to stop in midair!

863
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:41,404
You have to look fantastic and enraged
with your whole body at the same time!

864
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,139
Again!

865
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,375
I'm sorry.

866
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,748
It's no good!

867
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,452
Cut! It's no good!

868
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,753
I'm sorry.

869
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,231
Darn it! Cut! No good!

870
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,100
Are we going to do this all day?

871
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,970
I can't see the agony in your arms.

872
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,606
Keep them angled until the end.

873
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,074
I'm sorry.

874
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,211
We have to wrap up in 30 minutes,
and you're wasting all of our time.

875
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,446
Do you know how hard it is to shoot here?

876
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,350
They don't let you shoot here
no matter how much you offer!

877
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,353
I'm sorry. I'll go again.

878
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,224
Director.

879
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,193
They said we can take as long as we like.

880
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:38,862
Really?

881
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,965
Are they on something?

882
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,936
It came from the CEO himself.
He's going to come and watch.

883
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,506
There he is.

884
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,288
It's an honor to have you here.

885
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:42,826
I've been watching this entire time,
but I was too angry not to come down.

886
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,328
This is what a filming set
is usually like.

887
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,799
Anyway, I don't know how to thank you
for providing us with this facility.

888
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,368
If you don't know, then I'll tell you.

889
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,875
Stop shouting at Gil Ra-im.

890
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:04,581
I just saw you push her.
I can't have you do that.

891
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,988
To me, this woman is like
actresses Kim Tae-hee and Jeon Do-yeon.

892
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,158
You see, I am a huge fan of Gil Ra-im.
