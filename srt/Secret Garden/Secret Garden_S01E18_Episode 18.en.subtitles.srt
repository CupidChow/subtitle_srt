1
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,182
Don't love any other guy.

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,754
Be alone and love me forever.

3
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,092
Don't even get too close with U-yeong.

4
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,328
That's incest.

5
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,205
This will probably be

6
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,310
the most selfish decision of my life,

7
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:24,584
but respect it, as the decision
of the upper echelons of society.

8
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,089
You were always so amazing.

9
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,662
Promise me
that you'll stay amazing forever.

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,644
I'm going to

11
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,583
miss you very much.

12
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,089
I love you.

13
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,826
I love you.

14
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,214
Let's take a picture together.

15
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,117
We haven't taken one together
since I was 21.

16
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,020
You'll regret it later.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,997
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

18
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,267
What's going on?

19
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,703
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

20
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,573
Something feels off.

21
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,275
But what?

22
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,013
It couldn't be...

23
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,586
What do you mean you didn't know?

24
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,121
This is the first time this has happened.

25
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,759
Where is Ra-im?

26
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,696
-Where is she?
-She's gone.

27
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,065
They said she was still here at dawn.

28
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,000
Check the security cameras. Now!

29
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,168
We will.

30
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,840
I think

31
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,775
I know.

32
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,678
Joo-won is gone too.

33
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,748
He has disappeared!

34
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,184
He's not picking up. He's not home either.

35
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,785
And his car is gone also.

36
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,886
What do you...

37
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,791
-You're not saying...
-He went to switch their bodies.

38
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,194
That crazy bastard made his decision.

39
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,099
I checked on my way, and it rained
in Hwaseong, Chungju and Jecheon.

40
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,134
He went to one of those places.

41
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,969
What is his license plate number?

42
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,871
First we need to report it
to the police...

43
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,872
I did on my way here.

44
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,010
We can't just stay here,
so you go to Hwaseong. I'll go to Chungju.

45
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,748
It's the police.

46
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,349
Hello?

47
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,387
Did you find them? Where are they?

48
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,131
Wait!

49
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,334
Ra-im!

50
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,869
We need to go inside.

51
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,205
I'm her guardian. Where's the guy?
Wasn't there a guy with her?

52
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,107
He's in that one.

53
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,513
Joo-won! Are you all right? Kim Joo-won!

54
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,414
Is he all right?

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,618
They were both found unconscious
on the freeway.

56
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,520
They are barely stable as of now.

57
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,057
Okay, please transfer them to Gangnam.
It's only 30 minutes away.

58
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,826
He has an attending physician there.
Take both of them.

59
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,628
Hurry. Move them.

60
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,632
Ji-hyeon, it's me.
There's something wrong with Joo-won.

61
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,269
He's being transferred to your hospital,
so come right now.

62
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,974
What happened?

63
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,711
They're both unconscious.

64
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,680
I asked them to transfer both to Seoul.
Let's go.

65
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,419
SEOUL HOSPITAL

66
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,999
What's going on? Did they wake up?

67
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,369
I don't know.
They're still being examined.

68
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,672
Do you think they switched?

69
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,776
I don't know.
We won't know until one of them wakes up.

70
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,349
What did they say?
Did you get the results? Are they awake?

71
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,252
Not yet. They're still running tests.
We'll have to wait.

72
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,121
But why did he do that?

73
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,656
Why did Joo-won take her out
when she's unconscious?

74
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,924
How is Ra-im?

75
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,893
How is she doing?

76
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,028
The results aren't out yet
for either of them--

77
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,563
When will they be out?

78
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,332
Can't you do something? You're a doctor.

79
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,267
Use your connections or whatever you can.

80
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,869
I'm already doing so.

81
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,737
I came because I knew
you would be frustrated.

82
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,474
There is nothing you can do right now,
so at least go and get something to eat.

83
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,642
I'll get going.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,181
What?

85
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,387
What happened

86
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,856
to Joo-won?

87
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,695
He's in a coma?

88
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,932
Yes.

89
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,837
Why?

90
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,307
My amazing Joo-won... Why?

91
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,077
My beautiful baby... Why?

92
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,115
Why my Joo-won?

93
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,869
How is he? She's still the same.

94
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,861
It's the same here.

95
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,298
I still don't know
if he's Joo-won or Ra-im.

96
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,276
SEOUL HOSPITAL

97
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,611
Ji-hyeon, please,

98
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,779
save my Joo-won.

99
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,815
What happened to him?

100
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,850
How could this suddenly happen
to a perfectly normal man?

101
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,118
Try to calm down, please.

102
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,686
We're still running tests, so...

103
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,622
You've been doing tests for hours!

104
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,525
You're a doctor.
You're my son's physician.

105
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,593
Anyone can say they're running tests!

106
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,029
What is wrong with my son?

107
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,198
Who did this to him?

108
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,566
Please lower your voice.

109
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,801
He's not the only patient here.

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,003
You...

111
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,205
You...

112
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,806
Dr. Park,

113
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,010
you should come to the patient's room.
Kim Joo-won has regained consciousness.

114
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,012
-He has?
-He's awake?

115
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,354
Can you see me?

116
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,989
Can you hear me?

117
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,625
Joo-won! Do you know who I am?

118
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,027
Joo-won!

119
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,795
Joo-won!

120
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,273
What's wrong?

121
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,876
What's wrong, Joo-won?

122
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,614
Rain...

123
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,817
Did it rain?

124
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,186
Did it

125
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,855
rain in Seoul?

126
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,195
Oh, no.

127
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,866
My poor brother...

128
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,970
What happened?

129
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,440
Why am I...

130
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,177
Why am I him?

131
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,581
It

132
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,484
didn't rain.

133
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,487
Joo-won took you

134
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,626
into the rain.

135
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,166
No.

136
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,271
No.

137
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,909
No.

138
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,181
No! It can't be.

139
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,251
Joo-won!

140
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,089
Joo-won, it's me.

141
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,727
Joo-won, it's Mom.

142
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,731
I'm so sorry.

143
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,334
I'm so sorry, Mother.

144
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,406
Where is Kim Joo-won?

145
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,242
Where is he?

146
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,844
Where is Kim Joo-won right now?

147
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,280
That crazy bastard.

148
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,186
You're right here.

149
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,488
You're right here, Joo-won.

150
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,692
What's wrong?
Why are you acting like this?

151
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,456
You're

152
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:05,991
awake?

153
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,160
Who are you?

154
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,096
Which one

155
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,198
are you?

156
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,066
What do I do?

157
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,737
What do I do, Director?

158
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,106
Ra-im?

159
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,275
Is it you?

160
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,811
What do I do?

161
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,948
He switched us.

162
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,518
He went to die

163
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,621
so that he could save me.

164
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,762
You punk.

165
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:44,964
Because of you, I...

166
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,001
Because of you...

167
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,703
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,608
What do I do now?

169
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,145
What's going to happen to him?

170
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,588
Who are you?

171
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,924
What...

172
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,626
What is wrong with you?

173
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,728
Why are you here?

174
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,530
Take him.

175
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,665
Get him ready to be discharged.

176
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,601
He can't stay here.

177
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,538
Tell Dr. Kang to come
to Joo-won's house immediately.

178
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,575
-Let's go.
-You can't. This isn't Joo-won.

179
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,744
How dare you lay your hands on him?

180
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,946
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

181
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,615
I said no!

182
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,751
I don't know what scum you are,

183
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,353
but if you touch my son again...

184
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,454
I'll go.

185
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,258
I'll go, Mom.

186
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,999
It's all right.
I can take care of this by myself.

187
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,236
I can do it.

188
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,307
Let's go, Mom. I want to go home.

189
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,822
They're all the same.

190
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,852
He has no internal or external injuries.

191
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,456
He just needs some rest.
We'll see how it goes.

192
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,760
So is he okay, Doctor?

193
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,128
You don't need to worry.

194
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,065
Thank you.

195
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,467
Thank you for coming.

196
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,402
See him out, Mr. Kang.

197
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,241
Your grandmother must've helped you.

198
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,609
Thank goodness.

199
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,812
-I'm so thankful.
-Yes.

200
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,048
I'm fine.

201
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,450
You heard the doctor.

202
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,987
-I'm going to rest.
-All right.

203
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,989
I'll be right here.

204
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,359
That makes me uncomfortable. Please go.

205
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,460
It is you.

206
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,529
You're my Joo-won.

207
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,065
You seemed like a stranger earlier.

208
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,435
Call me right away if you don't feel well.

209
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,704
I'll call over Dr. Kang.

210
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,340
Okay.

211
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,777
Watch over him for now.

212
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,313
All right.

213
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,419
Mom...

214
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,854
Yes?

215
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,191
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,827
What are you sorry for?

217
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,063
You'll be better in no time.

218
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,332
There has never been a moment

219
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,102
when I haven't been proud of you.

220
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,340
I have been the happiest mom
there could be.

221
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,043
Until you met that brat, that is.

222
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,814
I heard this happened to you
after you took her outside.

223
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,449
This is as much

224
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,320
as I can tolerate.

225
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,056
I want to be happy again.

226
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,094
You must be tired.

227
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,262
Get some rest.

228
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,753
He might try to go back to the hospital.

229
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,287
There's...

230
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:08,427
Anyway, prevent him from going
no matter what.

231
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,629
-Understood?
-Yes, madam.

232
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,964
But he's already sick,

233
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,800
so don't hurt him.

234
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,535
Yes, madam.

235
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,549
I have to go.

236
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,217
-Sit.
-I have to go.

237
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,986
-I said sit.
-Please let me go.

238
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,722
I have to go to him.

239
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,090
Just sit and listen.

240
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,992
If you have to go, go later.

241
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,427
Why won't you let me?

242
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,730
He's probably waiting for me.

243
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,933
He must be so scared, all alone.

244
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,002
I'm telling you it can wait.

245
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,572
I understand
that your goddamn love is a big deal,

246
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,776
but we just lost a son and a cousin.

247
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,914
Please think about us.

248
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,318
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,488
I shouldn't be taking this out on you.

250
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,191
If

251
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,259
Joo-won doesn't wake up...

252
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,595
If my aunt...

253
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,502
If my aunt hears
that you disappeared again,

254
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,772
it will be too hard on her.

255
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,743
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,014
I didn't think about that.

257
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,652
-I'm really sorry.
-Maybe Joo-won did this

258
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,689
to make you feel sorry.

259
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,826
His mom

260
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,295
has stationed guards outside.

261
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,965
Don't go now.

262
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,534
Please stay at least one more day

263
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,606
so she doesn't get upset.

264
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,818
I'll check up on him tomorrow.

265
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,988
You'll be all right on your own, right?

266
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,399
SEOUL HOSPITAL

267
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,756
You crazy...

268
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,326
How could you do this?

269
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,827
How?

270
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,164
How could you do something like this,
you crazy bastard?

271
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,668
Is she the only one that matters to you?

272
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,137
Does family and such mean nothing to you?

273
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,539
You think

274
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,112
leaving behind a glass slipper
will solve all your problems?

275
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,286
You guys switch when it rains, right?

276
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,590
It's going to rain again sooner or later.

277
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,726
What am I supposed to do then?

278
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,895
Should I respect your decision

279
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,498
and lock up Ra-im every time it rains?

280
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,300
Is that what you want from me?

281
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,071
That's too bad.

282
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,907
Because I can't.

283
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,877
Even if you end up hating me for it,

284
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,350
I won't protect that love for you.

285
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,620
Even if you cry and go crazy,

286
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,624
I would rather live

287
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,261
with my baby cousin.

288
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,813
Sir, your mother forbid you from leaving--

289
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,082
I know, but I have to go.

290
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,451
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell my mother.

291
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,586
You need to rest.

292
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,589
Please get out of my way
or you'll get hurt.

293
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:31,990
I need backup.

294
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,026
Please don't.

295
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,461
You leave us with no choice
but to use force.

296
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,497
I warned you.

297
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,319
They'll be up soon.
I avoided their pressure points.

298
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,889
Okay... I just came

299
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,025
to drop off your mail.

300
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,128
Credit card bills, golf course newsletter,

301
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,863
-Kim Moron--
-Later.

302
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,902
Who?

303
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,771
Who did you just say?

304
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,741
FROM KIM MORON TO KIM JOO-WON

305
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,943
From Kim Moron to Kim Joo-won.

306
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,013
It wasn't until now

307
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,716
that I realized that what happened to us

308
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,585
was a gift from God.

309
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:39,491
So laugh happily

310
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,294
and accept this unexpected gift.

311
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,698
If you laugh inside your heart,

312
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,134
I'll listen.

313
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:58,210
Because I am far more capable
than you think.

314
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,818
Give me a nice shave every day,

315
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,988
and dress me up with my favorite clothes.

316
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,427
Then that's enough to say

317
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,563
that we're with each other.

318
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,403
That's enough to say

319
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,406
that we're as happy

320
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,709
as other couples.

321
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,983
Director.

322
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,688
Are you okay?

323
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,791
Are you all right?

324
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,227
Why are you here?

325
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,332
I thought he might be scared

326
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,735
to be all by himself.

327
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,138
If he knows

328
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,841
someone is out here waiting for him,

329
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,144
he might come back.

330
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,853
Go on in.

331
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,567
How screwed up is this?

332
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,639
I guess

333
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,608
one of us

334
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,078
has to become foam.

335
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,784
If so, I'll be the one.

336
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,755
I'll be the foam.

337
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,092
Don't be sad.

338
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,795
Because once the little mermaid

339
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,731
falls for the prince,

340
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,002
becoming foam is her inevitable fate.

341
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,708
Why couldn't you have
broken my arms or legs?

342
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,445
How could you make my heart break

343
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,316
every time I breathe?

344
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,088
I'm going to

345
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,824
turn everything back to normal.

346
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,161
When it rains,

347
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:38,897
come back

348
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,434
to where you belong.

349
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,371
Please.

350
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,124
Is Joo-won

351
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,226
all right?

352
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,228
I heard he woke up.

353
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,263
Not yet.

354
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,898
Mr. Choi said...

355
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,199
He's not

356
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,102
our Joo-won.

357
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,072
What do you mean?

358
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,741
I wondered

359
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,245
why he was laughing so much.

360
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,947
It was so unlike him.

361
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,520
It wasn't even that funny,

362
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,357
but he was dying of laughter...

363
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,959
Like a madman.

364
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,963
But that was

365
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,602
his way of saying goodbye.

366
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,008
Can you tell me in a less cryptic way?

367
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,679
I always thought

368
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,982
I was letting him win.

369
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,656
Since I was older and I was the adult.

370
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,525
But

371
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,897
exactly how much more of an adult
do you have to be

372
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,640
to die for someone?

373
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,945
What exactly is going on?

374
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,179
There you go again.

375
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:53,418
Why are your dreams always so rough?

376
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,121
Because you

377
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,491
are in my dreams

378
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:08,333
A beautiful table is set
on top of pure white snow,

379
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,538
and you and I have been invited.

380
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,708
Dummy,

381
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,544
that's my dream.

382
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,982
You are inside my dream.

383
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:29,854
We are both fabulously dressed up.

384
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,759
Like a gentleman, I pull out your chair,

385
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,330
and you thank me with a smile.

386
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,737
We gaze at each other, smiling.

387
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:55,280
And we both wait for someone,

388
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,250
the one who invited us.

389
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,357
Dad.

390
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,526
Is it you?

391
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,496
You look familiar.

392
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,368
Haven't we met before?

393
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:34,018
This liquor is
the beginning and the end of the magic.

394
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,138
It's okay if you forget me once again.

395
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,276
And it's okay if you forget the promise
you made me.

396
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,481
You've already done more than enough.

397
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,665
Be loved.

398
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,634
For all the times you've hung your head,

399
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,438
for all the tears you've shed,

400
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:29,974
now

401
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,612
be loved, Ra-im.

402
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,191
The magic is now over.

403
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,263
The magic that I performed

404
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,802
was like that of a handshake
between two strangers.

405
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,439
It is now time

406
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,211
for you to perform the real magic.

407
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,130
I came back.

408
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,807
I'm back.

409
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,515
Kim Joo-won...

410
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,284
-Did you get some sleep?
-U-yeong?

411
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,326
-U-yeong...
-You don't have to act when we're alone.

412
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,360
U-yeong...

413
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,896
Why are you like that?

414
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,800
-And why am I like this?
-Like what?

415
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,601
What are you talking about?

416
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,304
Where am I? Why am I here?

417
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,173
I was at the hospital.

418
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,609
Are you

419
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,685
Joo-won? Joo-won, is it you?
You came back?

420
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,556
-It didn't rain though.
-What rain?

421
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,691
What the heck happened to me?

422
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,859
Joo-won!

423
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,961
It's you!

424
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,232
You were at the hospital.
Then you came here.

425
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,902
-Your mom brought you home.
-Get off me.

426
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,871
What about my friends?

427
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,240
Are they all right? Are they safe?

428
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,943
Friends?

429
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,012
-What friends?
-What's wrong with you?

430
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,115
I went to go see my friends a few days ago

431
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,351
when the building caught on fire,
and I got trapped inside an elevator.

432
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,687
You even came to visit me at the hospital.

433
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,256
-Joo-won...
-What?

434
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,658
Are my friends okay or what?

435
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,349
Why are you alone? Where's Joo-won?

436
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,451
He wanted to go home, so I let him.

437
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,220
Did you talk to him? What did he say?

438
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,056
Why is he acting like that?
Is he brain damaged?

439
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,058
Not physically,

440
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,394
but because of some form
of psychological trauma,

441
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,030
he has regained his memories
from his previous accident,

442
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,466
but has forgotten everything since.

443
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,903
Then what's going to happen?

444
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,472
Can he function in society?

445
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,841
I don't think you need
to worry about that.

446
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,311
He's accepting his current condition
much quicker than expected.

447
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,781
More surprisingly,
he's quite fascinated by it.

448
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,951
Fascinated? How?

449
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,388
He wanted to hurry up and become an adult.
Then he woke up and he was one.

450
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,656
He said it felt like a movie.

451
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,125
-That's good to hear.
-I told him he was

452
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,827
a department store president

453
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,697
and he was thrilled to find out it was him
and not you.

454
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,599
What? Why that little...

455
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,637
So he remembers everything
from the accident?

456
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,941
Aside for a few things, it appears so.

457
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,044
He remembers being trapped
in the elevator and being rescued.

458
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,747
Which parts did he forget?

459
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,785
He doesn't seem to remember
the firefighter who died.

460
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,687
Really?

461
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,456
If you're heading home, let's go together.

462
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,326
He asked me to stay with him tonight,
and I said would.

463
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,029
Okay. Can you pay for the tea?
I forgot my wallet.

464
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,232
I told them you would pay.

465
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,800
My goodness.

466
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,088
Please hurry up. Step on it, please!

467
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,006
What are you doing?

468
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,643
Who built this house?

469
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,713
You dragged an architect from New York
and let him stay here for a few days

470
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,315
and made him lay each brick one by one--

471
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,349
That's right.

472
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,486
So I'm still exacting even at this age.

473
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,254
I like it.

474
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,124
So this is my place, right?

475
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,293
No, it's your mom's.

476
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,995
Anyway, this is reassuring.

477
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,697
At least you came back.

478
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,601
She says there's something wrong
with my memory.

479
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,437
She says I'm 34.

480
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,907
Yes, you're 34 and I'm 36.

481
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,576
You look it,

482
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,880
but I don't look 34 at all.

483
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:04,815
How did I do it?

484
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,250
On top of having an attitude,

485
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,385
he now has the narcissism
of a 21-year-old.

486
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,288
Shouldn't he be institutionalized?

487
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,993
That's a typical defense mechanism
of people with a low sense of security.

488
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,195
It's the year 2011.

489
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,598
I'm president of Loel Department Store.
You're a famous singer.

490
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,000
You're no longer a medical student,
but a doctor.

491
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,503
And three months ago,
you dumped me, right?

492
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,006
You mean 13 years and 3 months ago.

493
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,243
Even after 13 years,
we're still good friends?

494
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,212
Well, I have a great personality.

495
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,281
That can't be right.

496
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,285
But are you really a famous singer?

497
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,622
I'm the main model
for your department store.

498
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,557
You turned out fine.

499
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,726
I was worried about what you would become.

500
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,161
-I guess you behave yourself out there.
-Why you little...

501
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,199
You punk! Even Japan fell in love with me.

502
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,103
Do you know how many weeks I was
at the top of the Oricon chart?

503
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,727
You jerk!

504
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,212
Who told you to do something like that?

505
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,416
I thought I would never see you again.

506
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,185
I thought I would never see you...

507
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,521
All right, just calm down.

508
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:53,991
Hey.

509
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,861
I've seen her before at the hospital.

510
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,164
Really? You remember?

511
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,599
Your memory must be coming back.

512
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,335
Yes, you two were there together.

513
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,971
I'll explain later.

514
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,175
But her face is a bit...

515
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,512
Anyway, back off.

516
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,083
Hey, I've been wanting to ask...

517
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,451
Who is Gil Ra-im?

518
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,287
You remember her?

519
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,123
You do.
You'll get your memory back in no time.

520
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,257
Who is she?

521
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,227
Her name is the first thing I remembered
after I woke up.

522
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,096
Is it someone I know?

523
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,199
Joo-won is 21 years old right now.

524
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,635
He doesn't remember anything after.

525
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,472
It looks temporary,
so don't be too worried.

526
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,016
Why are you crying?

527
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,653
Are you...

528
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,289
Gil Ra-im?

529
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,695
You?

530
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,235
Let's leave them alone.

531
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,871
Ra-im might be the quickest way.

532
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,262
Are you saying you're Gil Ra-im?

533
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:44,034
You know me? And I know you?

534
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,206
-How old are you?
-I'm 30.

535
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,176
There's no way I would know anyone
older than 24.

536
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,478
Your occupation?

537
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,381
-Stuntwoman.
-What?

538
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,183
Stuntwoman.

539
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,718
I've been hanging out with a stuntwoman?

540
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,322
Tell me, exactly what kind of relationship
were we in?

541
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,558
I'm asking you
if there is a special reason

542
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:12,129
as to why your name was
the first thing I remembered.

543
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,297
There is.

544
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,532
You

545
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,901
loved me.

546
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,104
And I loved you.

547
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,809
It wasn't enough that I knew a stuntwoman,

548
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,712
but I loved one too?

549
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,948
Yes, very much.

550
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,149
Wait a minute.

551
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,618
Are you sure you're the right one?

552
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:36,887
Isn't there another Gil Ra-im?

553
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,556
I'm sure there is.

554
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,559
But the one you loved

555
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,261
is me.

556
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,198
Fine.

557
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:52,336
I need to straighten things out first,
so leave me your number.

558
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,973
So you were a jerk
when you were young too.

559
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,940
What?

560
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,245
-Did you just call me...
-Just look in your phone.

561
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,380
My name will be there

562
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,384
along with a picture you took of me.

563
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,953
From now on,

564
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,489
whatever you do

565
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,458
is endearing to me.

566
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,426
Now,

567
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,829
I can forgive you

568
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,498
for whatever you do.

569
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,402
All for one reason...

570
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,038
The fact that you're alive.

571
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,783
Why am I thinking about her?

572
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,703
Do you want me to put rice in the soup?

573
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,171
Yes.

574
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,540
Being sick isn't so bad.

575
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,410
Don't even joke about something like that.

576
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,680
Every time I ate, I couldn't stop crying

577
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,417
because of you.

578
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,085
Because there's no one to do the dishes?

579
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,087
You evil brat!

580
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,724
Were you scared to go to the bathroom?

581
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,795
And you had no one to ask
if it smells or not.

582
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,297
You better not get hurt again.

583
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,566
Or else I'll burn all your Oska posters.

584
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,302
Hey! What did my Oskie ever do to you?

585
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,303
Stop.

586
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,774
Put your spoon down. Put it down.

587
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,884
I'll give you two some space.

588
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,387
Could you tell the man outside to come in?

589
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,322
What? Who outside?

590
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,295
Goodness.

591
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,706
Here we go.

592
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,346
His tactics haven't changed much.

593
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,483
If you think about it,
he's not very creative.

594
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,521
Are you two close?

595
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,556
You two are closer.

596
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,191
Let's go.

597
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,499
They say I hired him.
It must've been a last-minute decision.

598
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,369
First time eating hospital food like this?

599
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,906
It's okay to be surprised.
That's what I was aiming for.

600
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,884
I'm going to put these out
if you aren't going to pray.

601
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,795
Candles are a basic necessity for dinner.

602
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,901
Just in case you get the wrong idea,
this isn't for you.

603
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,736
I'm just being a good Samaritan.

604
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,871
That's how I was raised.

605
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,440
I know.

606
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,844
-You know?
-Did you get things straightened out?

607
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,547
I left my number, but you never called.

608
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,115
That's why I came.

609
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,386
I came to find out under
what circumstances I came to know you.

610
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,755
No matter how I think of it,

611
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,991
it seems impossible
that I would fall for you.

612
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:19,229
So please give me your father's name.

613
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,868
Just in case he's someone I might know.

614
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,471
You do know him.

615
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,341
I do? Really?

616
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,510
Which family is it?

617
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,149
Well, it's nothing urgent.

618
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,985
So why are you a stuntwoman?

619
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,055
Well, my stunt acting carries
the scent of lavender.

620
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,926
-What?
-You just don't remember,

621
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,197
but you even said to me,
"How can I not fall for that?"

622
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,368
Fine. Let's say that I did.

623
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,805
What do you think your greatest charm is?

624
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,474
Show me how you won me over.

625
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,843
Don't say nonsense like "try to remember."

626
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,944
Want me to beat you up?

627
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,679
I'll turn your fifth vertebrae
into your sixth.

628
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,182
-What?
-I kept beating you up

629
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:15,585
and you kept chasing after me,
saying you had never met anyone like me.

630
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:16,886
I did?

631
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,589
Look, you even came today.

632
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,559
You thought about me all day long,
didn't you?

633
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,462
And you don't even understand why, do you?

634
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,800
Should I tell you why?

635
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,335
Why?

636
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,308
Because you love me.

637
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,912
Trust your judgment.

638
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,317
I was definitely someone
that you would fall for.

639
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,824
I'm getting discharged tomorrow.

640
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,394
Are you telling me to come pick you up?

641
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,897
You'll miss me tomorrow as well,

642
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,133
so I'm giving you an excuse.

643
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,670
Then one day, you'll say to me...

644
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,977
"I find you strange and fascinating."

645
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,046
That's nonsense.

646
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,433
WELCOME BACK, GIL RA-IM

647
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,173
Hello, everyone.

648
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,943
I'm very sorry to have worried you.

649
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,045
If you get hurt one more time,

650
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,115
I don't care about your dreams.
I'm making you quit.

651
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:53,883
Yes, sir.

652
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,555
Thanks for pulling through.

653
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,826
Thank you for everything.

654
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,060
Get away from each other.

655
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,368
Were you having an affair?

656
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,171
Was I just one of your lovers?

657
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,574
How did you know to come here?

658
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,909
Did you remember?

659
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,114
I know we just met and all,

660
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,484
but I really need to speak to her,
so can everyone leave?

661
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,321
I'll explain everything later.

662
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,356
Follow me.

663
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,395
What on earth? You all know me too?

664
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,796
I told you to follow me.

665
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,668
How did you come here?

666
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:50,907
You don't seem to recognize the director,
so it can't be that you recovered.

667
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,910
I chose the quicker way.

668
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,414
I know it's not courteous,
but I had you followed.

669
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,348
Why, you...

670
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,019
What on earth?
Why did my leg automatically move?

671
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,488
Have you beaten me up before?

672
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,457
I told you at the hospital.

673
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:13,329
Your body must remember me, Kim Moron.

674
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,932
What? "Moron"?

675
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,467
Are you calling me a moron?

676
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,470
It doesn't have anything to do
with my track jacket, does it?

677
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,871
Why wouldn't it?

678
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,276
Geez.

679
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:30,447
Hey. This isn't what you think it is.

680
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:32,749
Take a good look, okay?

681
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,885
Can you see it? You can see it, right?

682
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:40,857
What are you doing?

683
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:42,959
I'm just thankful.

684
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,397
I'm thankful that you came here.

685
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:53,670
I must be falling
for the 21-year-old you too.

686
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,110
You...

687
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,746
You want to?

688
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:27,270
I heard you haven't come to your senses
and are still lingering around Joo-won.

689
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,640
Are you stupid or just brain damaged?

690
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,777
Is it that you have no fear now
since you almost died?

691
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,647
I am really sorry, but from now on,

692
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,483
for any reason whatsoever,

693
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,085
I'm not letting go of

694
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,254
Joo-won.

695
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,154
What?

696
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:50,093
Like you said,
both Joo-won and I almost died.

697
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:55,465
So each and every day is precious to us.

698
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:02,572
Now I am no longer afraid of you.

699
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,807
What?

700
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,410
Why are you so confident?

701
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,347
Joo-won doesn't remember you anymore.

702
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,515
I know.

703
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,518
But he will.

704
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,888
If he could remember you,
he would've never forgotten.

705
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:22,492
I wish his memory never came back.

706
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,529
He can still relearn everything
from his past 13 years.

707
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,499
You're afraid though, aren't you?

708
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:34,003
-What?
-Because although he can't relearn

709
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,174
who I am,
he might just remember me anyway.

710
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,645
I'm not trying to ruin him.

711
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,416
What will truly ruin us is if we separate.

712
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:51,521
Please, I beg you. Try to understand.

713
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,560
Are you a wall? Are you a cow?

714
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,996
Are you a foreigner?
Do you like being insulted?

715
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:03,166
How could you repeatedly ignore
what I say?

716
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,802
I'm really sorry.

717
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,707
Lastly,
I would like to say one more thing.

718
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,278
Please give me your son.

719
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,182
I promise I will make him happy.

720
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,352
Just exactly what kind of a girl are you?

721
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,899
It's me. Could you open the door?

722
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:45,274
Hi. A-yeong is still at work.

723
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,343
That's not why I'm here.

724
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,646
The president asked me to bring you.

725
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,816
I said, "Should I escort her?"
But he was all rude about it.

726
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,986
I was just starting to miss him.

727
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,022
Where to?

728
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,959
Sit.

729
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,051
Live here from now on.

730
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,921
-What?
-Stay beside me until I tell you to leave.

731
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,091
I need to figure out why I liked you.

732
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,161
What's so funny?

733
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,597
Because I've heard this before.

734
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,500
Have I done this before?

735
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:49,472
You would whine to try to get us
to share a bed and shower together.

736
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:54,777
Our relationship must've been deeper
than I thought.

737
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,182
So, did it work?

738
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:00,883
What?

739
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,992
All right. I'll ask it this way.

740
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:14,497
Had we ever kissed?

741
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,668
Like this...

742
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,890
