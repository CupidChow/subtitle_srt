1
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,903
Open the door!

2
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,139
Open the door.

3
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,008
Open this door!

4
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,014
Dear God.

5
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,417
When I receive your calling,

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,119
please give me the power to save one soul

7
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,923
no matter how strong the fire may be.

8
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,826
Dear God.

9
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:04,397
I am still afraid,
and I pray for the rain to come.

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,439
Hello?

11
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,074
Hello?

12
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,443
Kim Joo-won!

13
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,311
Hello?

14
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,746
I told you

15
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,115
I can't...

16
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,151
take...

17
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,288
the elevator.

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,394
Hello?

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,597
Joo-won!

20
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,266
Answer me.

21
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,168
Say something!

22
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,205
I hope that you prepare me for the time

23
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,007
when the fate of a life is unknown.

24
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:53,413
If I die by your will,

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,548
by your grace,

26
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,352
please look over my wife and family.

27
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,820
Kim Joo-won!

28
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,923
Answer me!

29
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,126
Say something!

30
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,599
A-yeong! The elevator!

31
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,434
In the elevator...

32
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,435
Ra-im?

33
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,171
-What's this number--
-Hurry, A-yeong!

34
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,639
You need to hurry.

35
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,375
Kim Joo-won is trapped inside
the elevator.

36
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,078
What do you mean?
The CEO never takes the elevator.

37
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,480
He did. He took it.

38
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,083
He's trapped inside!

39
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,287
Hurry and call Mr. Kim. Hurry!

40
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,990
EMERGENCY SERVICES

41
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,695
Someone's trapped in the elevator
at Loel Department Store.

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,533
He has claustrophobia!

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,269
Please save him!

44
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,539
Save him, please!

45
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,046
Loel Department Store!

46
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,860
Please hurry.

47
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,899
Oh, no.

48
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,936
It's all my fault.

49
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,575
Mister, please hurry!

50
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,281
Please hurry, mister!

51
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,031
President Kim!

52
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,833
President Kim, are you inside?

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,636
President Kim, please say something!

54
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,104
President Kim!

55
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,157
President Kim!

56
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,026
Open your eyes.

57
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,494
President Kim!

58
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,630
Hurry up and open this!

59
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,299
Get him out! Sir!

60
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,768
Get up, President Kim!

61
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,138
President Kim! What's wrong with him?

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,507
Hurry up and open this!

63
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,076
President Kim!

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,612
Hurry up and get him out!

65
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,116
President Kim! Please get up!

66
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,655
Oh no!

67
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,492
President Kim!

68
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,094
President Kim!

69
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,633
President Kim!

70
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,404
Out of the way, please.

71
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,814
Please follow that ambulance!

72
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,849
Hurry!

73
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,021
-What?
-Director Lian Jackson

74
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,924
asked why Ra-im wasn't there.

75
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,093
But I can't reach her.

76
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,729
Has she really gone crazy?

77
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,764
How could she miss this audition?

78
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,966
It's because

79
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,003
-Ra-im isn't Ra-im.
-What?

80
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,972
EMERGENCY ROOM

81
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,015
Mr. Park.

82
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,817
What happened?

83
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,785
What happened to President Kim?

84
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,255
Well, the security was so tight,
I couldn't really find out...

85
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,160
I didn't mean for this to happen.

86
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,997
I was just really curious.

87
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,500
You should get out of here.

88
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,501
Let's go.

89
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,604
Let's go.

90
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,905
President Kim...

91
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,574
Mr. Park.

92
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,842
President Kim...

93
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,945
President Kim...

94
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,031
Mr. Kim.

95
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,900
Ra-im.

96
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,169
What happened?

97
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,471
Is he all right?

98
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,839
I don't know yet.

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,610
Why did he have to take the elevator?

100
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,245
Oh no.

101
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,386
Is he all right? Is he awake?

102
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,892
He says to make sure word doesn't get out.
Just say it was from overworking.

103
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,395
Seeing that he's concerned more
about the press, he must be okay.

104
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,932
Sir.

105
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,370
It's been a while.

106
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,340
Do I know you?

107
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,844
I guess your visit is a secret.

108
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,548
I won't tell anyone. You can go in.

109
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,889
ABSOLUTE REST

110
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,947
Are you all right?

111
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,783
Are you really okay?

112
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,751
What were you doing in the elevator?

113
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,421
Didn't you hear what I said?

114
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,857
I told you I can't take the elevator!

115
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,726
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,095
I'm really sorry.

117
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,800
I just wanted to show that you could.

118
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,803
I never imagined it would stop.

119
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,672
I'm so sorry.

120
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,877
Come closer.

121
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,928
I thought I'd never see you again,
you woman.

122
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,065
I thought I'd never seen you again.

123
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,003
I thought something bad would happen.

124
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,878
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,047
Don't cry.

126
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,422
How was your audition?

127
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,524
Did it go well?

128
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,962
Why aren't you saying anything?

129
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,665
Don't tell me...

130
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,267
You missed it.

131
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,504
How was I supposed to audition
in such a state?

132
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,738
What?

133
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,808
Then you came here instead?

134
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,945
Are you out of your mind?

135
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,785
You said it was your lifelong dream.

136
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,119
What are you doing?

137
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,622
You need complete rest right now.

138
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,391
Be quiet and turn around so I can change.

139
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,028
There he is!

140
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,796
It's Oska.

141
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,898
Is everything cleared now, Oska?

142
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,767
Did you confront the composer?

143
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,268
How do you feel?

144
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,205
I feel relieved

145
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,875
to prove my innocence.
It's a great relief.

146
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,410
Could you look to the right, please?

147
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
But my left side is prettier.

148
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,650
Can't you take the picture
and send it to that reporter?

149
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,452
All right.

150
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,354
You received much help
from your colleagues, correct?

151
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,257
Yes. I've only realized this recently.

152
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,559
But no help is guaranteed in this world.

153
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,131
I would like to thank those who helped me
for making a difficult decision.

154
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,600
Among those who helped was Cherry.

155
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,502
Weren't you two involved
in a scandal together?

156
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,804
Since our country is surrounded by water,

157
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,007
it's difficult to avoid a scandal with me.

158
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,879
So I am especially grateful
and sorry to Cherry.

159
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,314
All right. That will be all for today.

160
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,850
Wait a minute.

161
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,986
Oska, please wait!

162
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,021
One more question!

163
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,927
Please look this way.

164
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,529
Just one photo!

165
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,476
-Where were you?
-When did you get here?

166
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,610
Just now.

167
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,781
Want some?

168
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,118
I just got back from the police station.

169
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,054
-You did?
-Hey.

170
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,756
Aren't you even worried?

171
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,391
You were responsible for the leak.

172
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,193
I told you to sue the company.

173
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,695
Get straight to the point. I'm busy.

174
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,064
You really didn't worry about me?

175
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,569
Everything's been resolved now,
thanks to Cherry.

176
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,907
I was hoping I could share this joy
with you.

177
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,346
Why with me? Share it with Cherry.

178
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,015
I have to go.

179
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,819
-Go where?
-Loel Department Store.

180
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,854
Why?

181
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,656
Are you still not over Joo-won?

182
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,860
Wouldn't it be weird if I was?

183
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,428
He's so perfect.

184
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,164
Whatever. Do you even know
what he's really like?

185
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,599
Hence I'm going to find out.

186
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,901
Hey, let me come with you.

187
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,170
I was going to go anyway.

188
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,072
Why?

189
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,342
I have to buy Cherry a bag.
Want to help me pick one?

190
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,445
Are you asking me to pick out a bag
for some other girl?

191
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,447
I'm not asking you to buy it.
No need to get mad.

192
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,783
This isn't your first time.

193
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,718
Why do you need my help?

194
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,086
I dare you to follow me.

195
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,091
Why are you smiling?

196
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,559
Don't spit.

197
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,661
-What?
-I don't know

198
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,197
why I like it when you glare.

199
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,067
Right now,
it feels like we're back to how we were.

200
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,606
With whose permission?

201
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,976
Who said you could turn back time?

202
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,714
Who said you could go back
to my most painful times?

203
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,719
How is it
that you forgive yourself so easily?

204
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,480
Don't look so upset.

205
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,484
I'll get you another audition.

206
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,191
-How?
-However I can.

207
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,693
I told you...

208
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,764
I'm much more capable than you think.

209
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,836
Are you going to tell your grandfather?

210
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,438
That's my last resort.

211
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,808
Don't cry.

212
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,345
I don't ever want to see you crying again.

213
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,315
It's too much for me to bear.

214
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,388
I really hope
that a miracle like that will occur.

215
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,722
Please believe in me.

216
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,392
I will make that miracle happen.

217
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,611
I told you to stop crying.

218
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,432
Where were you?

219
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,204
What happened? Why didn't you audition?

220
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,574
Did that punk say he couldn't help you?

221
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,810
That punk had a bit of a situation.

222
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:18,877
What kind of situation?

223
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,846
Where is he?

224
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,748
Right here.

225
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,118
-What?
-We switched back.

226
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,088
It turns out that it was the rain.

227
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,391
Then you're Kim Joo-won?

228
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,226
Are you that happy to see me?

229
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,062
Yes, I am.

230
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,264
Send the medical certificate
to the action school.

231
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,265
What?

232
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,507
You really pack a punch.

233
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,309
It's nothing compared to what you did.

234
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,243
I know.

235
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,247
Telling you not to confess your feelings
to Ra-im, let's call it even with this.

236
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,916
Be thankful that I consider you
an alienated neighbor.

237
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,318
Otherwise, you would've met my lawyer.

238
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,287
Shut your mouth,
before you're left half dead.

239
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,290
Wait, let me talk to you.

240
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,292
I have nothing to say to you.

241
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,594
It's about Ra-im.

242
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,130
We have to let her audition.

243
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,733
It's already over.

244
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,268
I'll take care of that.

245
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,804
Tell me how to get a hold
of that Hollywood director.

246
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,040
He went to Japan. How will you meet him?

247
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,708
He's in Japan?

248
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,286
I have a favor to ask.

249
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,156
Which one are you?

250
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,425
Ra-im?

251
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,227
The tone of your voice
is just like Joo-won though.

252
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,197
I wish I could tell everyone
in one sitting.

253
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,366
It's me. Remember, it rained?

254
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,734
Do I look like the weather girl?

255
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,769
This is too confusing.
Let's come up with a password.

256
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,271
I don't have a lot of time, okay?

257
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,841
You have connections in Japan,
since you're a Korean Wave star, right?

258
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,644
Yes, I have a lot of connections. So?

259
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,147
Ra-im had an important audition today,
but she missed it because of me.

260
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,183
But that director went to Japan.

261
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,720
Find out which hotel he's at
and a direct number to contact him on.

262
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,889
What do I get in return?

263
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:11,990
What do you want?

264
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,592
-Gil Ra-im.
-Just die.

265
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,762
Then get out of my house.

266
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,797
And go where? I have nowhere to go.

267
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,132
Get a hotel room.

268
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,934
And publicize that I was kicked out?

269
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,302
I hear that people are betting

270
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,204
on when I'll get kicked out,
since the party.

271
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,107
Who told you to kiss her
and publicize that you're crazy.

272
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,542
I couldn't resist.

273
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,678
It was a moment I had been waiting
too long for.

274
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,013
So will you help me?

275
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,783
You've gone crazy over her.

276
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,624
May I speak to the representative
of Yamato TV?

277
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,361
I'm the Korean singer Oska.

278
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,667
Yes, thank you.

279
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,437
I love you too.

280
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,016
DARK BLOOD SCENES

281
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,377
Hello, this is Oska.

282
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:44,116
Director Lian Jackson
is currently in Japan, right?

283
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,286
Hello, sir. How have you been?

284
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,254
It's me, Oska.

285
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,891
The representative at Yamato TV
gave me this number.

286
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,662
Oh, you got the call?

287
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,830
Yes, I have a pen.

288
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,869
Yes.

289
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,840
Yes. Thank you so much.

290
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:15,047
I will be sure to call you
the next time I'm in Japan.

291
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,355
The top is his cell phone number,

292
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,525
and the bottom is his room number.

293
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,627
I'll thank you later.

294
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,596
If you had any intention,
you would've done it already.

295
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,239
Darn it.

296
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,548
This is driving me crazy.

297
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,985
Is he the only one busy?

298
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,653
Is he the only one in the top one percent?

299
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,622
Is this even the right number?

300
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,698
Send a private jet over
to Haneda right now.

301
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,768
What? A private jet?

302
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,959
Go to the left here.

303
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,229
When he turns around.
You come in from this side.

304
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,497
Make sure you do a good job here.

305
00:24:58,897 --> 00:24:59,831
Got it.

306
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,134
How good this scene comes out
entirely depends on you,

307
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,703
so we're counting on you.

308
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,105
Thank you. I'll do my best.

309
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,306
All right, let's go.

310
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,311
Good work, everyone.

311
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,781
Good work.

312
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,985
-Turn in your outfits, please.
-I'll go change right now.

313
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,626
Do you know Choi U-yeong? I mean, Oska.

314
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,896
-Oska?
-You don't know him?

315
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,432
What if I do?

316
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,302
Let's go. His cousin wants to see you.

317
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,370
Me?

318
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:23,708
Are you sure he wants to see
stuntwoman Gil Ra-im and not the actress?

319
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,577
He sounds crazy, right?

320
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,679
He does seem to have unique taste.

321
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,950
Please raise your hand.

322
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,752
Over here.

323
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,153
Enjoy.

324
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,956
Are you going to cuss me out
for buying food again?

325
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,861
Those aren't ordinary lunch boxes.
They're our memories.

326
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,029
Did I say anything?

327
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,065
-Thank you.
-That's why I did it.

328
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,200
Wait here.

329
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,537
I'm going to go speak to that person.

330
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,807
The director? What are you going to say?

331
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,175
Just to let him know.

332
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,577
That to me,
you're Kim Tae-hee and Jeon Do-yeon.

333
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,413
You're crazy!

334
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,281
Why did you come here though?

335
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,183
Because you're here.

336
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,619
I missed you. I had no choice.

337
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,257
I got to see you, so I should go now.

338
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,393
I have to take care of some work
at the office.

339
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,262
Bye.

340
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,799
-Mr. Kim!
-Yes, sir.

341
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,471
Shall we go

342
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,908
and end the lives of the perpetrators
that stopped the elevator?

343
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,552
I'll cut to the chase.

344
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,589
Was it purely an accident
that the elevator stopped?

345
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:47,559
Yes.

346
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,161
Is that so?

347
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,032
Then is it okay if I check
all the security camera footage?

348
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,704
I will ask you again.

349
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,774
Was it purely an accident

350
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,243
that the elevator stopped?

351
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,585
Go and do your work.

352
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,120
Yes.

353
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,298
This is my letter of resignation.

354
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,869
I will take full responsibility.

355
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,637
By taking full responsibility,
are you admitting

356
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,641
that it wasn't a pure accident,
and this was your doing?

357
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,543
Yes.

358
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:39,944
Why?

359
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,212
I wanted to make sure

360
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,350
whether you could take
the elevator or not.

361
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,821
You knew about my condition?

362
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,656
Yes.

363
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,861
What were you planning to do
if your suspicions were confirmed

364
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,264
about my condition?

365
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,400
Isn't it obvious?

366
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,136
Why are you being so honest?

367
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:10,008
Because I'd rather be unemployed
than be a murderer.

368
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,678
I am happy

369
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,414
to know you are safe.

370
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,092
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

371
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,629
You made the right choice.

372
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,165
No further action will be taken.

373
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,068
I accept your resignation.

374
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,471
You've worked hard. You may go now.

375
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,295
That was a close one.

376
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,334
We'll do all the on-site work.
Just focus on the design from now on.

377
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,869
Leave if you're going to lecture me.

378
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,537
I'm back.

379
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,340
Did you get hurt?

380
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,543
He got a huge cut.
There was so much blood.

381
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,646
How was the shoot?

382
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,414
Have you gone to the hospital?

383
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,415
Do you feel better?

384
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,884
You haven't, have you?

385
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,819
Why is she so persistent?

386
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,056
Pay attention.
He asked how the shoot went.

387
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,625
You know me.

388
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,928
Once again,
I made my mark in this industry.

389
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,163
Do you feel a bit better?

390
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,698
I'm much more at peace now.

391
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,903
I told myself that it wasn't meant to be.

392
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,639
She says it wasn't meant to be.

393
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,240
Any other questions?

394
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,009
Aren't you leaving?

395
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,878
-Aren't you leaving?
-I mean you.

396
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,813
Right, Ra-im.

397
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,183
Should we order chicken,
and not give her any?

398
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,486
Are you messing with me?

399
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,721
Am I not allowed to?

400
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,556
I'm the director now.

401
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,787
GIL RA-IM

402
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,226
That's the way, Ra-im.
Don't get hung up on it.

403
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,396
It just wasn't meant to be.

404
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,867
My daughter. You're all right now.

405
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:55,073
I feel relieved now.

406
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,073
FORGIVE ME FOR FORGIVING MYSELF TOO EASILY

407
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,952
ALSO, ARE YOU SURE
THE ROASTED CHESTNUTS WASN'T YOU?

408
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,931
I HAVE TO GET GOING NOW.
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST HERE

409
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,024
Why did you want to see me?

410
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,563
Tell me why you've called me out.
Why are you just staring?

411
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,132
I want to know what's inside
that head of yours.

412
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,402
I heard that you didn't sign with Seul.

413
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:32,670
So?

414
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,106
So sign with me.

415
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,074
I'll make you rich like me.

416
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,309
-I don't want to.
-Why not?

417
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,711
-Because I don't want to.
-So why not?

418
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,613
You didn't even think about it.

419
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,684
If I've tried this hard,
shouldn't you just give in by now?

420
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,253
Why are you so obsessed with me?

421
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,890
-Do you like me?
-Would I do this if I hated you?

422
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,193
I told you, I like men.

423
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,529
Who's stopping you?
Like men all you like. I'll like women.

424
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,832
If you're going to be like this,
why did you help me?

425
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:05,103
The moment you helped me,
a bond was formed between us.

426
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,305
The tight, sticky kind.

427
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,209
It's practically destiny, I tell you.

428
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,677
Don't flatter yourself.

429
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,379
You still have no idea how to coax me.

430
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,915
Stop fooling around,
and take it while it's here.

431
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,852
What else have you got?
Are you going to catch shrimp?

432
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,587
You look like one.

433
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,857
I'm leaving Korea.

434
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,526
That's what you always say.

435
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,062
You haven't even been to the army.
Think about it,

436
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,431
and get back to me.
I'm taking this as collateral.

437
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,134
Stop bluffing
and make sure you come to get it,

438
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,236
with an answer that will please me.

439
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,537
I'll be going then.

440
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,217
You have a visitor.

441
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,125
I came to get my things.

442
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,161
Since I'm back to being myself.

443
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,998
What? Shouldn't you want
to stay here more, then?

444
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,767
You're funny.

445
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,872
Should I bring out some tea?

446
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,008
Yes, please. Have a seat.
Let's hold a New Year's fan meeting.

447
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,117
This is for 2011.

448
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,354
I'm so photogenic.

449
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,326
You are.

450
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,295
Aren't you going to sign it though?

451
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,631
With a relationship like ours?

452
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,335
It is a must.

453
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,438
So you can tell everyone we're close.

454
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,144
By the way, is Joo-won still staying here?

455
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,946
He still can't go back?

456
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,949
Aunt never takes back what she says.

457
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,787
The harder she strikes,
the harder Joo-won strikes back.

458
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,925
She's been calling to tell me
to kick him out. It's insane.

459
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,593
Here.

460
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,096
Thank you.

461
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,601
I've always wanted to ask you...

462
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,971
Why do you always let Joo-won win?

463
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,008
How did you know I let him?

464
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,677
Everyone thinks I lose to him.

465
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,713
Because, you always look happy
after you lose.

466
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,018
You really are a great catch,
the more I get to know you.

467
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,021
Be good to Joo-won for me.

468
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,959
The reason I always let him win...

469
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,095
It's because when Joo-won was 21,

470
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,564
he experienced something
he shouldn't have.

471
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,801
Because of that,
he had a really tough time,

472
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,804
and fell into something like depression.

473
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,974
It was difficult to watch him
go through that.

474
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,977
He didn't speak at all.

475
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:39,317
I started to pick fights with him,
tease him, and bother him on purpose.

476
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,120
Because then, he'd at least fight back.

477
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,059
What happened to him?

478
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,061
Hear it from Joo-won.

479
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,030
Later, if he remembers.

480
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,967
-What?
-Joo-won doesn't remember what happened.

481
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:02,039
He unconsciously erased it from his memory
in order to protect himself.

482
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,259
You should've told me you were coming.

483
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,894
I went all the way to your house.

484
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,700
What? Did U-yeong talk bad about me again?

485
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,435
Oskie isn't like that.

486
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,270
I came to get my things.

487
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,505
Oskie, my butt.

488
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,342
Hasn't anyone called you, by any chance?

489
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,443
Who?

490
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,279
No one called and said
something like, "Congratulations"?

491
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,315
What are you talking about?

492
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,016
Never mind.

493
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,586
Give it here. You're going home, right?

494
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,254
Let's stop by for some tea on the way.

495
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,324
I already had some with Oskie.

496
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,727
Woman, I'm asking you out on a date!

497
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:57,728
I know.

498
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,065
And you just got rejected.

499
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,833
What? Why?

500
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,069
So you can think about it all day.

501
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,439
Where did you learn this stuff?

502
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,576
Why are you coming in?

503
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,379
You think I drove you home
so I can stand by the doorway?

504
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,419
Are you skipping our hugs
and mistreating me like this

505
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,988
because I got kicked out of my house?

506
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,856
You have Oskie's place.

507
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,360
Sit down.

508
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,496
Why?

509
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,099
Listen carefully to what I say next.

510
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,370
Don't refer to U-yeong as "Oskie."

511
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,506
Starting today, I'm the only one
you can call by a pet name.

512
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,342
-What?
-If you give anyone else a pet name,

513
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,844
it'll be considered cheating.

514
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:51,982
I don't believe in giving each other space
and trusting the other won't cheat.

515
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,417
Understood?

516
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,653
Stop glaring.

517
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,290
You stole my heart with your weird habits.
You stole my body with your weird liquor.

518
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:03,961
You stole my lips at my party.
You have no right to always glare.

519
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,230
How could you dramatize it like that?

520
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,532
Be thankful that I can.

521
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,802
You think you'd look
this pretty to me otherwise?

522
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,506
Leave before I report you for trespassing.

523
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,277
Geez. You got another one?

524
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,382
This was your doing, wasn't it?

525
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,052
-You did this, right?
-No.

526
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,155
You did it with your hand. Shred by shred.

527
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,391
Want me to break you, bone by bone?

528
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,926
-Give it.
-No.

529
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,363
What's January 8th? What day is it?

530
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,631
You don't have to know.

531
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,666
-Give it to me.
-All right.

532
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,937
Are you crazy?
A-yeong will be here any moment.

533
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,341
My employees don't have that much
free time on their hands.

534
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,076
Seriously!

535
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,410
By the way, Ms. Gil Ra-im.

536
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,980
Your eyes are really pretty.

537
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,851
Which part will be pretty tomorrow?

538
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,288
Want me to guess?

539
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,560
I already know.

540
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,807
That was for all the hugs I owe you.

541
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,249
That's it.

542
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,320
A-yeong is working overtime tonight.

543
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,588
Hey!

544
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,726
He's at her house right now?

545
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,829
He didn't move in, did he?

546
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,731
It doesn't appear that way.

547
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,899
I think,

548
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,669
he just missed her...

549
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,836
Mr. Kang!

550
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,041
Where has he been sleeping lately?

551
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,809
He is staying with Mr. U-yeong.

552
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,645
Gil Ra-im came by today to get her things.

553
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,748
So that's why he followed her home?

554
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,384
He's totally and completely possessed.

555
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,587
Otherwise, how could he be like this?

556
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,589
I think he's in love...

557
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:12,623
Mr. Kang.

558
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,059
Did Joo-won pay you?

559
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,828
I apologize. What about tomorrow?

560
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,532
Tomorrow is the yearly visit to...

561
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,603
Yes, of course.

562
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,173
That'll be all.

563
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,883
Hey, Bun-hong!

564
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,087
Can't you call beforehand?

565
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,555
Look at this.

566
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,625
Isn't she the one who came to our dinner?

567
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,793
The one who was set up with Joo-won?

568
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,596
What are they trying to pull here?

569
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,666
That's what I'm saying.
Who does she think she is?

570
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,002
The blind date with Joo-won,
and the scandal with U-yeong.

571
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,403
Who's she going to marry?

572
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,005
What is the matter with you?

573
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,040
Why are you blaming this on her?

574
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,244
U-yeong must've seduced her
because she said she was a fan.

575
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,313
What do you mean by that?

576
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,651
Are you trying to say that my U-yeong
went after his own cousin's date?

577
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,753
If it's not true, then fine.

578
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,522
Hey!

579
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,425
Stop right there! Hey!

580
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,203
The main line will be,
"I held his hand today."

581
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,540
When a hand is placed on the handprint,

582
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:41,478
it will transform into a real hand,
as if a star is actually holding it.

583
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,715
What about post-production?

584
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,283
We got someone.

585
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,720
The ad will look cheap if the CG
is not done properly...

586
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,926
So pay special attention to it.

587
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,596
Go scout the other locations.

588
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:00,531
Okay.

589
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,473
What are you doing here?

590
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,874
To show you something.

591
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,578
Did you see this?

592
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,749
The headline is hot and straight
to the point. I love it.

593
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,785
What is this?

594
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,921
Can't you see? We're in a scandal.

595
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,589
Did you call the newspapers

596
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,224
and tell them it wasn't true?

597
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,827
Pick up every single call

598
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,996
and explain it to them.
Don't let any more articles be released.

599
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,035
What?

600
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,572
I remembered something again.

601
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,674
What?

602
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,908
This is how I told you

603
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,747
to react if we got in a scandal, huh?

604
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,817
I told you to pick up all the calls
and deny everything.

605
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,421
That it'll be a pain
if additional articles get out.

606
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,692
Whenever I thought about us,

607
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,596
I only remembered our happy moments.

608
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,431
But I guess

609
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:11,034
they were just the memories
that were convenient for me.

610
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,371
While you were hurting this much.

611
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,875
Did I just realize this?

612
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,978
Can't you see that I'm working?

613
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:22,980
Go.

614
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:28,385
What was it that I did to you?

615
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,424
Hello?

616
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,293
Is this Director Yoon Seul?

617
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,430
I'm calling from Star Daily
about your scandal with Oska.

618
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,333
The dating rumors...

619
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,003
They're...

620
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:48,972
not true.

621
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,842
I have nothing else to say.

622
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:00,551
I did as you told me.

623
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,386
So you take care of the rest--

624
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,856
Isn't it December 5th
by the lunar calendar?

625
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,858
My dad was a firefighter

626
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:45,495
but during a rescue when I was 17...

627
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,664
He passed away.

628
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,568
If she was 17...

629
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,037
That would be 13 years ago.

630
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,385
FRIDAY, JANUARY 3RD, 1997

631
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,127
U-yeong.

632
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:22,132
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to talk.

633
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,567
It's important.

634
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,435
Make it short.

635
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,007
Ra-im's father passed on December 5th
on the lunar calendar.

636
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,608
That's 13 years ago.

637
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,111
-So?
-So

638
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,581
I searched that date,

639
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,850
and it's the same day as my accident.

640
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,454
Are you sure?
You have no memory of the accident.

641
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,423
I don't have any memory,
but I do have records.

642
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,892
I looked at my hospital records.

643
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,328
In case it helped me remember.

644
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,966
It was the same day as my car accident.

645
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,101
Isn't that a strange coincidence?

646
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,837
Aren't those kinds of coincidences common?

647
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,473
Maybe.

648
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,277
But a few days ago,
I was trapped inside an elevator.

649
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,847
And I remembered something.

650
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:14,284
You were trapped in an elevator?

651
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:15,852
U-yeong.

652
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,957
The accident that I can't remember...

653
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,392
You, my mom and the entire family...

654
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,929
The one that everyone keeps telling me
was a car accident..

655
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,700
That was an elevator accident, wasn't it?

656
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:34,738
But why did you all lie and tell me
it was a minor car accident?

657
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:40,444
You all said I got into an accident
while driving by myself.

658
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,755
What are you talking about?
What do you mean it wasn't a car accident?

659
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,223
Don't pretend you don't know.

660
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,491
What is it?

661
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,993
Drop the act.

662
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,963
You knew it was an elevator accident,
didn't you?

663
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,566
You knew, didn't you?

664
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,235
Mom knew, U-yeong knew and you knew,

665
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:06,970
right?

666
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,508
Why did you lie then?

667
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,912
We wanted to protect you.

668
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:18,882
You seemed to be suffering a lot.

669
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,285
There was no reason to tell you the truth

670
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,421
when you were trying
to push back the memories.

671
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:28,191
That's why we made up that story.

672
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,894
What exactly happened inside the elevator?

673
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,029
That...

674
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,800
None of us know either.

675
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,638
We heard about the accident after
you were transferred to the hospital.

676
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,243
That means, ultimately,
I have to remember it on my own.

677
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,646
But why?

678
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,651
People try to forget things
about their lives all the time.

679
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,286
That's what you've been doing.

680
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,390
If you look at it that way, yes.

681
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,226
But I feel

682
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:08,632
as if I've lost something precious.

683
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,735
Precious?

684
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,304
I don't know exactly what it is.

685
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,108
It's just how I feel.

686
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,418
What? A terminal illness?

687
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,955
-You don't think so?
-What? More like narcissism.

688
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,324
No, think about it carefully.

689
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,393
He might be hiding it from you.

690
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,930
Why else would a healthy person
collapse inside an elevator?

691
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,600
"Severe flu from overworking."
Haven't you seen the articles?

692
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,969
That's what's weirder.

693
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,305
He barely even comes to work.
How can he be overworked?

694
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,973
He never works.

695
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,543
I heard he only has three months.

696
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,880
There was a reason why he started
to greet us back.

697
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,416
-He was saying goodbye.
-That's ridiculous.

698
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,319
How is this? It's warm.

699
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,955
Is it for the CEO?

700
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,023
He really does have three months left.

701
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,727
Hey! We came here for Mr. Kim, remember?

702
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,629
Because he got you those shoes.

703
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,866
Oh, yes. I'm so forgetful.

704
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,068
Wow. This is so pretty.

705
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,836
I need to get a necktie too.

706
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,739
You'll have to pick that out yourself.
I have to go.

707
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,840
Where?

708
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,342
I already told you.

709
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:26,743
You did?

710
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,480
Oh right. Sorry. Should I go with you?

711
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,082
No, I'll go alone.

712
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,317
Have fun on your date with Mr. Kim.

713
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,520
Have a safe trip.

714
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,624
I wonder why he hasn't been
in my dreams lately.

715
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,494
GIL IK-SEON 1958-1997

716
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,858
Of all places,
why do I have to see her here?

717
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,260
How disturbing.

718
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,410
How have you been?

719
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,245
Are you mocking me?

720
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,982
I wish I could be fine,
but because of you, I can't.

721
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:41,885
I'm sorry.

722
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,089
I'm really sorry for asking,

723
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,825
but why did you place flowers there?

724
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,629
Are you happy to see me
since we're not at my house?

725
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,233
Mind your own business.
Why do you want to know?

726
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:01,605
I was just wondering
if you came here for my dad.

727
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,173
What?

728
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,977
This man, the late Gil Ik-seon,

729
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,212
is my father.

730
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,415
What?

731
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,556
Do you know my dad?

732
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,157
My dad

733
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:57,827
sacrificed his life
to save countless others.

734
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,767
He doesn't deserve to be treated like this
by you people.

735
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,736
How...

736
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,174
How can something like this...

737
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,711
How...

738
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,275
I would like to order an accessory
for women's handbags,

739
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,213
with this character design.

740
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,448
It's a cat.

741
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,351
What kind of jewelry setting
would you like?

742
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,988
All right. Don't be nervous.

743
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,924
One, two, three!

744
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:08,098
Trust the person holding the rope,
and use that power.

745
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,266
One, two, three!

746
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,271
He's good.

747
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,975
I didn't use the power of the person.
I used the power of love.

748
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,311
Stand straight.

749
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,713
Hands behind your back.
Return to position.

750
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,052
Look, when I was a freshman in college,
you were a freshman in junior high.

751
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,487
Why does that matter?

752
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,556
Age doesn't matter
when you're standing right before me.

753
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,093
I'll kill you.

754
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,862
-Who was that?
-What?

755
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,397
Why, you little...

756
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,798
What did you say?

757
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,867
What doesn't matter?

758
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,935
Stop it. He's just a kid.

759
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,237
A kid?

760
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,774
Have you ever seen a kid
that big and dark?

761
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,609
I ought to just...

762
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,843
Ra-im.

763
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,646
Can't you see
we're in the middle of a lesson?

764
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,451
You were totally brave just now.
It was awesome.

765
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,587
What did he do?

766
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,525
I may not tell anyone,

767
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,628
but actually, I am extremely brave.

768
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:13,663
What was it?

769
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,198
Are you sure?

770
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,608
You're so dead!

771
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,612
You're laughing?

772
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:30,713
You dare laugh?

773
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,716
You two planned this!

774
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,151
"Kid"?

775
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,519
What kind of kid are you?

776
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,194
It looks like they're still together.

777
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,296
I should've hit him harder
when I had the chance.

778
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,098
You hit him?

779
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,667
You're dead!

780
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,106
Are you good at cooking?

781
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,976
Since my mother wasn't around...

782
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,418
I'm cold.

783
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,221
Stop that.

784
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,057
I'm cold, so bear with it.

785
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,792
Seriously!

786
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,627
I'm hot.

787
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,629
You're hot?

788
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,131
Yes, I'm hot when I'm with you.

789
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,667
Really?

790
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,236
Are you serious?

791
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,305
Why do you get hot when I'm around?

792
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,809
Do you have the same thoughts as I do?

793
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:38,615
No wonder your hair seems
to grow so quickly.

794
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,921
Then how about today, we...

795
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,857
-I'll cook for you.
-No, not that.

796
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,292
Take it or leave it.

797
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,961
-Then, tomorrow.
-You have a new message.

798
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,063
You have a new message.

799
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:59,402
Where are you?
The CEO's mother is here right now.

800
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,775
What? What is it?

801
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,178
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

802
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,114
I have to shoot an urgent,
additional scene.

803
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,515
I'll see you later.

804
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,851
Where are you going?

805
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,656
I should always be
the most urgent thing in your life.

806
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,192
Hey, I'll take you! My car is over there.

807
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,156
I thought you'd find out sooner or later.

808
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,327
In case you attack me with it later on,

809
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,330
I'm making the first move.

810
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,801
I don't understand...

811
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,705
The winter that Joo-won turned 21,

812
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,007
he got into an accident.

813
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,078
He only remembers it

814
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,581
as a minor car accident.

815
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,985
Perhaps because of the trauma,

816
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,255
he cannot recall it properly.

817
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,694
One of the firefighters died

818
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,466
while Joo-won was being rescued.

819
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,904
It's why I ran into you

820
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,875
at the columbarium.

821
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,582
It couldn't be...

822
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,952
Yes. It turns out

823
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,788
that he was your father.

824
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,599
I'll compensate you with money.

825
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,469
I'll compensate you with more than enough.

826
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,005
I'll compensate you
with as much as you ask.

827
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,274
So please,

828
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,744
don't drag Joo-won down because of this.

829
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,480
Please

830
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,216
let him go now.

831
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,221
I beg you.

832
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,691
Please.

833
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,546
