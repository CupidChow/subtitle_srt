1
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,930
Stop shouting at Gil Ra-im.

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,935
I just saw you push her.
I can't have you do that.

3
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,407
To me, this woman is like
actresses Kim Tae-hee and Jeon Do-yeon.

4
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,843
You see, I am a huge fan of Gil Ra-im.

5
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,820
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to treat you all to dinner.

6
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:59,092
Well, it's not like you're making us pay.
Of course, we'll go.

7
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,094
Let's all go.

8
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,195
Let's go.

9
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,201
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,603
What's going on?

11
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,672
-Please enjoy.
-Eat up.

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,109
I tried to provide food to your liking.
I hope you enjoy it.

13
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,012
-It's great.
-Thank you!

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,147
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the meal.

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,249
While you all eat...

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,622
let me borrow her.

17
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,725
Ra-im, have dinner with me
on the ninth floor. Let's go.

18
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,397
What? Hold on...

19
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,399
Bravo!

20
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,736
He sure has a fantastic taste.

21
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,505
What's so good
about a cheap girl like her?

22
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:49,209
Of course, you'd be angry
when you're the cheapest girl here.

23
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,610
What did you say?

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,628
I didn't know what you'd like,
so, I asked the friend at the lounge,

25
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,731
and she suggested quantity over quality
and that I should just provide a feast.

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,301
Have a seat.

27
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,845
I'm pulling the chair out for you.

28
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,651
I'm fine. Do it for some other girl.

29
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,225
Have you never had a man
pull the chair out for you at your age?

30
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,098
Unless you're going to pray,
I can blow these out, right?

31
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,606
But candles are a standard for dinners...

32
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,743
The standard for me is
three bottles of beer with fruit.

33
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,345
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What?

34
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,747
"What?"

35
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,917
Oh, that I'm the CEO here?

36
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,288
I told you that you would be surprised,

37
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,623
and that you shouldn't mistreat me.

38
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,158
Surprised, aren't you?

39
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,762
You thought I was a bum,
but I'm way grander than you thought.

40
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,535
I look different now, don't I?
I look more handsome and even taller.

41
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,472
"That track jacket actually
was an expensive one."

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,641
"I feel really bad now."

43
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,713
What is this?

44
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,917
If you accept it that easily,
it's embarrassing on my part as a man.

45
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,719
You said, I look pretty when I get angry.

46
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,321
So, I won't get angry anymore.

47
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,123
Don't ever do anything like this again.

48
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,292
Don't come to our action school either.

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,530
It's not a place that you can just come
to relieve your boredom.

50
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,861
I'm really sorry,
but could you sit at an empty table--

51
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,063
I was with this group.
Just give me a bowl of rice.

52
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,098
Don't give her anything.

53
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,601
It's okay, just give me a bowl.

54
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,104
Don't mind us. Just go about your job.

55
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,282
What are you doing?
I don't understand what's going on.

56
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,150
Help me understand.

57
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,321
This is the kind of meal that I like.

58
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,324
And what was wrong up there?
The candles? Wine? The chair?

59
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,425
All of the above.

60
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,034
This is all I have.

61
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,037
Twenty-thousand won for the hospital.
Twenty-thousand won for dinner.

62
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,772
I know it costs a lot more...

63
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,474
but I didn't eat,
so, let's just call it even.

64
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,244
Now, we have no reason to see each other.

65
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,748
You're going too far.

66
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,389
All I wanted was for you
to stop saying that you're sorry.

67
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,062
What are you sorry about?

69
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,298
Is that in the script?
Where? I don't see it!

70
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,202
Geez! All you have to do
is a fantastic pose on your way down!

71
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,838
Don't make me hear you say sorry again.

72
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,373
-Get back up there!
-I'm sorry.

73
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,674
Stop saying you're sorry!

74
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,219
What's wrong with saying sorry?

75
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,789
I can say it a hundred times over.

76
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:02,128
I can be grateful for the opportunity
to say sorry and say it all day long.

77
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,464
That's how I make a living.

78
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,400
But now because of you,

79
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,303
people will say,
"you've got good connections."

80
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,339
All I had to do was say,
"sorry" 100 times,

81
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,842
but how much more would I
have to say it now?

82
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,946
Do you live in a fairy tale?

83
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,950
Do you think every dinner table
has flowers, wine, and candles?

84
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,753
Im saying that I don't need
the philanthropy

85
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,023
of an immature department store CEO
who is so eager to look good.

86
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,328
I'm warning you for the last time.
I don't want to see you ever again.

87
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,495
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,565
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,067
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks for the dinner.

90
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,936
You've got good connections, Ra-im.

91
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,205
-Thanks for today.
-We had a great dinner.

92
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,773
Ms. Ra-im!

93
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,311
Why are you so early?
We haven't even finished setting up.

94
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,981
You know what? Chae-rin can do this scene.

95
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,750
Let's get a proper shot of you.

96
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,018
No, Director--

97
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm not doing this scene! Are you crazy?

98
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,656
I'm scared of heights.

99
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,425
What do you mean?
I saw you bungee jumping on TV!

100
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,896
Ra-im, you can come monitor with me
if you're uncomfortable.

101
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,331
Okay?

102
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,768
I can't believe this.

103
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,071
Excuse me. What is wrong with you?

104
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,440
What did you say when I asked you earlier?

105
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,943
"Who is Kim Joo-won?"

106
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,945
We hadn't exchanged names...

107
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,180
Are you kidding me?

108
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,015
Then, I'll ask again.

109
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,084
How do you know Kim Joo-won?

110
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,554
Aren't you answering me?
How do you know him?

111
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,024
But Ms. Park Chae-rin.

112
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,026
Why the hell are you talking down to me?

113
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,962
What's it to you what our relationship is?

114
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,464
Am I obligated to answer your questions?

115
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,401
No... I guess not.

116
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,871
That's what I think as well.

117
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,512
You don't have to answer me, but...

118
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,381
What did you eat on the ninth floor?

119
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,683
Steak? Lobster?

120
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,991
-What?
-Crazy, right?

121
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,027
It turns out Mr. Money-maker
was the CEO of Loel Department Store.

122
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,595
-The CEO?
-Yes!

123
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,531
We filmed there earlier, right?

124
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,434
The director was giving Ra-im a hard time,
but Money-maker showed up, saying,

125
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,704
"To me, she is like
Kim Tae-hee and Jeon Do-yeon."

126
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,775
He's completely head over heels for Ra-im.

127
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,745
He extended our time limit
because Ra-im was there,

128
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,447
and he bought dinner for the entire staff.
It was quite a sight.

129
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,816
I'm back.

130
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,685
Hey, what's going on?

131
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,954
Did you really not know that
Kim Joo-won was the CEO?

132
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,760
You just won the lottery.

133
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,395
Are you quitting stunt work now?

134
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,330
Why would I quit?

135
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,033
I have nothing to do with that guy.

136
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,908
Just buy a new one. It doesn't cost much.

137
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,910
Go and get one
from Money-maker's department store.

138
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,879
-Jeong-hwan!
-Gosh...

139
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,449
You see? She wasn't like this yesterday.

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,585
I have to go.

141
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,795
Do you want instant noodles?
Should I boil the water?

142
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,789
This came out nice.

143
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,192
Hey. I'm going to try and make it darker.

144
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,227
Would it work?

145
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,564
As you see, I am literally radiant.

146
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,701
Geez.

147
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,102
This one's great.

148
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,037
I saw Director Yoon yesterday.

149
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,939
-"Director Yoon"?
-Yoon Seul.

150
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,175
She does commercials now.

151
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,177
Did you not know?

152
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,012
She told me she saw you.

153
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,614
Don't you keep in touch with her?

154
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,784
Are we doing this over, or not?

155
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,675
-What?
-Well, you know what,

156
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,478
I'm here at Loel Department Store
to pick up your outfit.

157
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,613
But there's something strange here.

158
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,116
I'll send you a photo. Take a look.

159
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,083
What is it?

160
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,152
Hello? Hey!

161
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,555
Geez.

162
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,464
ROMANTIC GETAWAY WITH OSKA

163
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,534
What the heck is this?

164
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,189
Hey! Why aren't you picking up my calls?
Do you know how many times I've called?

165
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,825
How would I know when you made the calls?

166
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,332
Don't you have any respect for Chopin?
You're supposed to be an artist.

167
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,907
What is this? Huh?

168
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,442
"A romantic getaway with Oska"?
How can Oska not know about it?

169
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,345
You should change your manager.
That's been up for three days.

170
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,147
What? "Three days"?

171
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,949
You're quite popular.

172
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:41,086
Thanks to your Korean Wave stardom,
we have customers from all over the globe.

173
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,488
I thought I was in Itaewon.

174
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,323
"Itaewon"?

175
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,893
Hey, do you think I'll actually go
through with this?

176
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,928
I'm sure you'll say, "no."

177
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,897
So, you know! I won't do it!
Over my dead body!

178
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,933
You heard me loud and clear!

179
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,668
Don't worry. You'll end up doing it.

180
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,304
You can go now.

181
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,005
Hey!

182
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,607
ROMANTIC GETAWAY WITH OSKA

183
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,976
Hey, what is that? What is this?

184
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,412
Ask him yourself. There he is.

185
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm so mad!

186
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,748
Dong-gyu, you know what?

187
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,586
Are you mad? What the heck is this?

188
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,189
Yeah, it just kind of happened.

189
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,024
"It just kind of happened"?

190
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,928
This is a week after our music video.

191
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,598
So, let's push back the shoot by a week
to make them overlap.

192
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,800
Do you want to die? How can we delay it?

193
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,235
The director is already in Thailand!

194
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,603
You found a director?

195
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,839
I must not have been rude enough
seeing how they want to work with me.

196
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,408
Why, you! Are you serious?

197
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,080
Just hit me and reschedule
for a week later. Come on.

198
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,982
-Why I ought to...
-Oh, wow.

199
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,984
What is it now? What?

200
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,752
Am I in another scandal?

201
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,390
OSKA TAKES ROOKIE UNDER HIS WING

202
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,393
Oh, this is from the interview
with Man Korea.

203
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,164
The reporter said that all top stars
have someone in training,

204
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,668
and I told her that I have one too.
Looks like she exaggerated a little.

205
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,804
This is beyond exaggeration.

206
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,274
Let's just train one while we're at it.

207
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,309
I also want to see
my protege come out on TV

208
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,380
and say good things about me,
and stuff like that.

209
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:19,018
Work on your own talent!
How can you train someone?

210
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,453
You're the one who always
finds excuses to lip-sync!

211
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,888
That's why I'm awesome.

212
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,658
It's not easy to take over China, Taiwan,
Thailand, and even Japan

213
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,459
when I'm consistently getting worse.

214
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,795
Forget it.

215
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,964
Music is just a little hobby for you,
anyway.

216
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,001
Why are you so pessimistic?

217
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,636
Who knows...

218
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,873
Hey, I need you to look for someone.

219
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,443
He sings at the club in Cheongdam,
and he's about

220
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,878
this tall.

221
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,179
How tall is that?

222
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,447
How can I find him like this?

223
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,416
You're really asking for it.

224
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,017
Stand up straight!

225
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,655
Hey, Eun-sol.

226
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,158
Tonight's plans?

227
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,096
Perhaps some sweet music and a soft bed?

228
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,674
I've been wondering.

229
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,678
How does it feel
to be prettier than a rose?

230
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,714
Don't lie.

231
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,949
Am I really prettier than a rose?

232
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,586
Did you have a tough childhood?
Why can't you trust me?

233
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,421
That's not what I meant...

234
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,826
Who is it? Is someone coming?

235
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,095
Looks like it.

236
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,634
I'm sorry to disturb,
but I got a question.

237
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,537
I said I'm not going on
that romantic vacation.

238
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,307
I told you not to worry about that.
You'll end up doing it anyway.

239
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,777
Anyway, do you remember that house
I was talking about?

240
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,380
The one that looks like it would be
on National Geographic?

241
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,015
Gil Ra-im lives in that kind of house.

242
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,917
She's all you talk about these days.

243
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:03,122
She didn't get much of an education,
and she's very vulgar and violent, too.

244
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,891
Have you ever gone out
with someone like that?

245
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,426
Give me a break.

246
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,697
Of course. Chae-rin used to be like that
before she became famous.

247
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,699
Hats off to you.

248
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,834
At least Ra-im is admirable.

249
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,506
Let's say that a girl hit you.

250
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,908
Have you ever enjoyed it?

251
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,809
What?

252
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,744
"I can endure a few more hits."

253
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,014
"I'm a little looking forward to it."
Have you ever felt like that?

254
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,917
Wow.
This is why the educated ones are worse.

255
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,953
How about getting tied up?
Do you like using handcuffs, too?

256
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,922
That's not what I'm talking about!

257
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,526
Forget it. Go on with what you were doing.

258
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,596
I think Park Chae-rin also wore that robe.

259
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,832
Hey!

260
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,269
No, he got it wrong.

261
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,237
She wore mine...

262
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,387
A guest?

263
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,531
You look much better in a suit
than in a track jacket.

264
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,734
That doesn't mean I don't look good
in a track jacket.

265
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,769
What brings you here?

266
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,638
I guess you aren't happy to see me.

267
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,873
Were we ever that close?

268
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,375
I don't think I deserve
to be turned away, though.

269
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,479
Since I didn't turn you away
when you turned up at my action school

270
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,114
without even a résumé.

271
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,817
You must hold quite a grudge.

272
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:12,851
Not at all.

273
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,053
Do you normally keep your guests standing?

274
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,489
Aren't you leaving soon?

275
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,591
It won't take long. Let's sit.

276
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,674
There's no need for tea, right?
There are plenty of cafes around here.

277
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,310
I'll get straight to the point, then.

278
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,979
I heard that
you treated my boys to dinner.

279
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,482
So, I came to thank you.

280
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,552
It wasn't just your boys.
You don't need to thank--

281
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,422
Thank you for your kindness,
but I hope you never do it again.

282
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,927
How many times am I being chewed out
for buying dinner?

283
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,398
Do all stunt people react
so aggressively to kindness?

284
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,000
Or, do you teach them that way?

285
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,269
Will you still be attending
the action school?

286
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,671
There's no reason not to.

287
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,206
My boys can get rough.

288
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,208
I'm not so soft myself.

289
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,176
I have abs too actually.

290
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,047
So, stop trying to intimidate
the innocent rookie.

291
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,284
When it comes to true intimidation,
I think I have the upper hand.

292
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,852
I don't think you understand.

293
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,655
You are not that innocent.

294
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:28,327
I don't know if you know this,
but Gil Ra-im is very talented.

295
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,262
She's doing well right now.

296
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,131
So, don't get in her way.

297
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,470
Sure.

298
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,873
But I do intend on helping her.

299
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,977
That is, if you don't get in the way.

300
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,354
It's me. Where's U-yeong?

301
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,257
He's in the studio, and I'm working...

302
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,159
Studio? I got it.

303
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,834
You shouldn't do this to U-yeong.

304
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,038
How dare you show up here?
You shouldn't be coming here.

305
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,373
I didn't come here to see U-yeong.

306
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,142
I came to see Kim Joo-won.

307
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,411
Who? "Joo-won"?

308
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,413
Yes. It just kind of happened.

309
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,281
What do you mean?

310
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,016
I'll tell you next time.

311
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,219
Did you read the outline that I sent?
How was it?

312
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,423
I didn't, and I won't.
We signed with another director.

313
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,459
Someone said that they'd do it?

314
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,194
All thanks to your concerns.

315
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,863
So, let's not see each other
like this again.

316
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,834
I'm not sure if I should say this, but...

317
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,504
It's the same before and now.

318
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,076
I will decide
whether we see each other or not.

319
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,514
You'd be in a better mood
if you had read my outline.

320
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,649
It's too bad you didn't.

321
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,317
See you next time.

322
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,560
Is this Producer Park?
It's me, Director Yoon.

323
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,164
Do you still want my handbag
that you really liked?

324
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,568
There's no reason, it's just a gift.

325
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,037
Sure, come pick it up.

326
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,374
But you don't want
to come empty-handed, right?

327
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,909
Okay then.

328
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:02,347
Can you find out who's directing
Oska's new music video on your way?

329
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,583
Yes.

330
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,273
Aren't you surprised?

331
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,908
You scared me.

332
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,745
You have a cute side.

333
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,713
Yes.

334
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,520
This must be why
people call you a bad man.

335
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,922
Are you sure that's me?

336
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,357
Didn't you know?

337
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,926
You have the background, looks, and humor.

338
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,196
You're so perfect that you make others
feel bad about themselves.

339
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,500
It's not like I can apologize
to everyone who feels that way.

340
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,702
Anyway, why are you here?

341
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,205
I came to see Mr. Choi about work,

342
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,208
but I heard that this was your home.

343
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,611
I thought it'd be impolite
not to say hello.

344
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,413
Are you busy today?

345
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,748
No, I've got nothing.

346
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,316
That's great.

347
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,518
I'm not busy either for a change.

348
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,821
That's nice. Have fun, then.

349
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,357
Wait...

350
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,931
Maybe he's a bit too difficult.

351
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,099
Doesn't he have any other cousins?

352
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,348
Hey.

353
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,784
Can I get the receipt

354
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,186
for the girl that got stitches in her arm?

355
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,822
What? A receipt?

356
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,493
Hey, I didn't put myself through

357
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,396
ten years of medical school and residency

358
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,464
just to pull out receipts for you.

359
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,900
-Call up Administration yourself.
-Wait!

360
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,637
There's no benefit for you
to argue things like this.

361
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,841
Why do you need it?
I thought you barely knew her.

362
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,777
That's why.

363
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,179
Have it quick-delivered to my house.

364
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,548
Do I look like your secretary?

365
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:27,319
I'll be in the hospital in ten minutes.
You come and get it.

366
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,259
I guess he's in love.

367
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,402
To me, she is Kim Tae-hee
and Jeon Do-yeon.

368
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,904
You see, I am a huge fan of Gil Ra-im's.

369
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,669
I'm sorry.

370
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,284
Are you slacking off?
Do 100 PT sets, sit-ups--

371
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,552
You scared me!

372
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,554
Don't act cute.

373
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,222
Did you see a ghost?

374
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,325
Am I a joke to you?

375
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,528
I told you that
I never want to see you again.

376
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,762
Why are you overreacting?

377
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,665
I didn't come to see you.
I came for my money.

378
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,268
You've heard that
the rich are worse, right?

379
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,673
Your hospital bill was 45,000 won.

380
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,444
You didn't touch your food,
so, forget that.

381
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,714
I like things to be exact.
That's just how I am.

382
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,215
So, give me 5,000 won more.

383
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,470
I'll give you
the remaining 2,000 won later.

384
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,437
Later when?

385
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,705
When I go home.

386
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,841
I'm a busy person.

387
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,542
I want it now.

388
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,911
Am I asking for 2 million won
or 20 million won?

389
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,713
Just give me the 2,000 won.

390
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,953
Then, good luck.

391
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,957
How dare you slam your locker like that!

392
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,493
Where are you running off to?
Write me an IOU!

393
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,934
She didn't even close it properly...

394
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,013
She must take after her mother.

395
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,600
SHOOTING SCHEDULE

396
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,118
COUPON

397
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,913
-Ninety-four. Ninety-five.
-Ninety-four. Ninety-five.

398
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,317
-Ninety-six. Ninety-seven.
-Ninety-six. Ninety-seven.

399
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,854
-Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine.
-Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine.

400
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,689
-One hundred!
-One hundred!

401
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,192
Next are sit-ups. Pair off.

402
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,427
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

403
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,635
What are you doing?

404
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,404
Can't you see that I'm warming up?

405
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,077
Go away!

406
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,513
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

407
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,251
One, two.

408
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,752
One, two.

409
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,288
Why did you start? I don't have a partner.

410
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,090
Why are you discriminating against me?

411
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,292
I need my pair too.

412
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,394
Be fair.

413
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,763
Or, give me the 2,000 won
if you don't want to see me.

414
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,848
Do it properly.

415
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,483
You'll regret it if I do.

416
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,330
Since when have you been this pretty?

417
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,032
Since last year?

418
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,404
What?

419
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,573
I was kidding.

420
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,777
Why? Does it hurt?

421
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,779
I was kidding too.

422
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,848
Ten-minute break.

423
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,483
-Break.
-Break.

424
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,184
Stop right there!

425
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,887
You're really dead this time.

426
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,167
I'm really mad right now.

427
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,535
And do I look happy?

428
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,504
I'm really pissed off right now too.

429
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,505
There you go again.

430
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,607
Are you some drunken Irishman?
Or Sir Swears-a-Lot?

431
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,142
Why do you have such a foul mouth?

432
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,378
That was me watching my language

433
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,213
since you're a big shot CEO.

434
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,050
I can say worse things.
You hate it, right?

435
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,319
So, why do you keep bothering me?
Why do you keep showing your face?

436
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,088
Tell me the reason.

437
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,424
Do you like me by any chance?

438
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,160
Do you?

439
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,861
Do I look that crazy?

440
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,197
Or, do I look that stupid?

441
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,133
Have you ever seen someone like me
love someone like you?

442
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,968
Is that even possible?

443
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,071
For your information,

444
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,707
I have so many overly-qualified women
lined up to marry me

445
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,709
that the line would span
the Great Wall of China.

446
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,845
But you have no pedigree,
education, competence,

447
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,846
youth, or anything.

448
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,815
Raise your hand if you have anything.

449
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,286
You don't, right?

450
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,587
Then, why do you follow me around?

451
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,621
Don't ask me.

452
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,056
Who else would I ask?

453
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,458
Ask yourself.

454
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,526
You keep popping up in my head.

455
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,396
It's like you're always there.
What do you want me to do?

456
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,400
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

457
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,570
I chant like this every night
to try and get you out of my head!

458
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,272
What did you do to me?
Why did you do it to me?

459
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:09,640
What?

460
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,110
You hang up on me.
You get mad when I visit.

461
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,278
I offer dinner and you get even madder.
And you even hit me.

462
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,948
You are totally strange.

463
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,484
That's the problem, though.

464
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,254
Because you're so weird...

465
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,391
I'm puzzled and fascinated.

466
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,013
That is why right now...

467
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,450
I think I've gone crazy.

468
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,458
So, I won't be coming here anymore.

469
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,460
I'll get going.

470
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,664
I'll text you my address,
so, bring my money.

471
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,332
Bye.

472
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,623
I'm tired.
Dancing is just too much for me now.

473
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,758
Why are you so late?

474
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:08,826
Have some snacks.

475
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,628
So, did you find him?

476
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,930
-Han Tae-seon?
-Is that his name?

477
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,299
Did you meet him at the Cheongdam club?

478
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,934
I did, but...

479
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,637
What? Does he want to sign right away?
Is he asking for a lot?

480
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,105
It's not like that.

481
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,842
I gave him my business card
and told him that it was your agency.

482
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,410
Also, that you want to meet him.

483
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,080
Most people would be
surprised and happy, right?

484
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,282
-But?
-But that punk goes...

485
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,551
"Who's Oska?"

486
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,086
What?

487
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,288
He doesn't know who I am?

488
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,589
Is he from North Korea?

489
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,857
He spoke like he's from Seoul.

490
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,028
That crazy little...

491
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,230
What's his number?

492
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,933
He said not to bother him.
He's not interested in lame celebrities.

493
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,335
"Lame celebrities"?

494
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,672
Korean Wave star Oska is a lame celebrity?

495
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,777
Are you Han Tae-seon?

496
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,881
What do you mean, "who"? I'm Oska.

497
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,449
So, what if you're Oska?

498
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,518
Didn't you hear from your manager?

499
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,687
I don't know you or your music.

500
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,357
If you want to see me,
send me your music first.

501
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,526
Hello? Hello!

502
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,528
Why you...

503
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,133
Hey, if you're playing hard to get
for more money--

504
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,634
Don't you understand Korean?

505
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,569
Did I ask for your money?

506
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,738
Send me your music, moron.

507
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,007
If you have to bribe
your way in with money, get lost.

508
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,642
Hello?

509
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,013
He's even worse than I am.

510
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,585
Listen carefully.

511
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,255
I'll show you who I am.

512
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,594
I love you, oh my darling, only you

513
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,831
The only one in my heart

514
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,735
Do you know who Oska is?

515
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,170
"Oska"?

516
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,571
The singer?

517
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,313
Oh my god, it's really him!

518
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,484
Don't sell her too cheap.

519
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,052
She's a proud one.

520
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,388
I paid a lot for her, so of course.

521
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,390
Here.

522
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,826
Are you not writing songs anymore?

523
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,829
No, I'm not going to.

524
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,866
The only one in my heart

525
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,034
I love you

526
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,905
My heart is about to explode!
What do I do?

527
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,145
Heard that? You're surprised, aren't you?

528
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,013
This was number one for eight weeks--

529
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,783
You really did surprise me. Sing it again.

530
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,319
Encore!

531
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,421
Who are you? Where's Han Tae-seon?

532
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,690
Stop embarrassing yourself!

533
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,826
Right, you're right.

534
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,230
Get the car ready. He's dead meat.

535
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,599
Hurry up!

536
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,038
NO NEW MESSAGES

537
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,714
Where are you going today?

538
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,249
Blind date.

539
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,385
How is this? Isn't it super cute?

540
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,054
Doesn't it give you a rash?

541
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,625
Hey, guys like it when you cover it up.

542
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,928
I'm off.

543
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,000
Don't drink too much, okay?

544
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,172
-You got a text message!
-You got a text message!

545
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,786
What are you doing here, Mr. Kim?

546
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,255
I'm on a date.

547
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,091
-So-mi from Public Relations--
-I asked her to.

548
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,994
In fact, I'm your date.

549
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,963
-Excuse me?
-Let's have dinner first.

550
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,270
Are you ready to order?

551
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,473
What's your best dish today?

552
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,777
We have the charcoal grilled steak
with pine mushroom soup.

553
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,379
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

554
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,347
Excuse me?

555
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,049
Then, it must be. We'll have that.

556
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,117
Right.

557
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,058
The truth is, for the past five years--

558
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,626
Oh my god.

559
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,795
Have you been stalking me?

560
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,864
Goodness. Why would you--

561
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,398
If you'll excuse me...

562
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,710
Congratulations, A-yeong!

563
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,949
Congratulations, A-yeong!

564
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,820
HAPPY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

565
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,828
You joined the company
five years ago today.

566
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,831
Congratulations on your fifth anniversary.

567
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,934
Mr. Kim!

568
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,705
Isn't that Kim Joo-won?

569
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,613
It is him.

570
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,982
-He's so good-looking!
-He's so hot!

571
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,618
He is so good looking!

572
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,720
-He looks so cool.
-He's dreamy.

573
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,488
He's so handsome.

574
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,963
Isn't this place a bit too much
just to hand over 2,000 won?

575
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,801
Did you hurt your neck?

576
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,070
Are you bleeding?

577
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,413
I need to use the restroom.

578
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:22,459
I don't know what you drink,
but I can buy you a beer or two.

579
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,531
And I do owe you somewhat.

580
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:34,772
Don't you like beer?

581
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,773
You...

582
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,277
are the first woman I feel overwhelmed by.

583
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,081
I've wondered whether a woman
would help my family enterprise,

584
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,351
or whether their genes
would benefit my offspring,

585
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:52,089
but I've never wondered just
how much this kind of bag would cost.

586
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,091
What are you on about?

587
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,935
If you had any consideration for me,

588
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,505
you would've checked the mirror
at least once before you came here.

589
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,777
You know I'm not the kind of guy
who would call you here over 2,000 won.

590
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,817
Don't you have new clothes?
Don't you have a proper bag?

591
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,753
Did you not have the time?
Were you busy with something else?

592
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,356
Or, are you really too poor
to even afford a bag?

593
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,226
Answer me.

594
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,997
Was I really excited to meet a girl
on the pretense of getting money back

595
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,300
when she can't even afford a cheap bag?

596
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,078
I think you've misunderstood...

597
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,548
but I only came here

598
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,484
for this.

599
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:25,115
I'm going to wait here,
so, tell that punk to come out.

600
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,285
Let him know that I'm not the kind of man
who does this often.

601
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,686
Go!

602
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,022
But he's kind of scary.

603
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,527
Gil Ra-im?

604
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,966
It is you.
I actually wanted to see you again.

605
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,169
What are you doing here?

606
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,610
Were you seeing Joo-won?

607
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,114
I'm sorry, but I have to go...

608
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,616
Hold on.

609
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,556
I'm sorry.

610
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:09,526
I forget how strong I am sometimes.

611
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,229
It wasn't your fault.

612
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,566
Oh, you had it pinned.

613
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,202
You're so resourceful. Here, I'll fix it.

614
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,437
I'm really good at this stuff
because I have long fingers.

615
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,939
No, it's all right...

616
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,577
Hey, where are you going?
Are you just leaving?

617
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,454
What's with him? Did you two fight?

618
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,091
What do we do? He quit today.

619
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,392
"Quit"? Where'd he go?

620
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,863
They don't know. He's always on the move.
He won't even pick up his phone.

621
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,598
This is crazy.

622
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:51,435
Find him and bring him to me,
so that I can kill him. Understood?

623
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,871
Hey...

624
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,575
Do you want to go for a walk?

625
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,747
It's Oska! I don't believe it!

626
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,582
It's Oska!

627
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,486
Yes, it's me. Thank you.

628
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,421
Yes, that's me.

629
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,458
Why aren't they taking any pictures of me?

630
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,595
I can't find my pictures anywhere.
I wish they'd upload some on those forums.

631
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,800
Cheer up.

632
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,803
He's the best at saying the worst things.

633
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:30,807
He left his manners in his mother's womb.

634
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,311
So, what kind of relationship
are you in with Joo-won?

635
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,513
I've been wanting to ask you.

636
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,084
Everyone seems to want to know that.

637
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,420
Let's just say

638
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,724
we can tell what the other is thinking
through one little bag.

639
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,393
Are you that close?

640
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,228
That doesn't make sense.

641
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:52,996
Do you

642
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,732
know his secrets?

643
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,435
You do, don't you? No wonder.

644
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,205
Can you let me in on it? I really need it.

645
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,408
What about you two, then?

646
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,945
Didn't he tell you that we're cousins?

647
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,480
-"Cousins"?
-Yes.

648
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,318
He gets rid of all the articles
so, only close people know about this.

649
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,455
Our family is pretty complicated, so,
it won't help anyone if the public knows.

650
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,358
But seriously,

651
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,894
what did he do to you?

652
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:29,032
He's always talking about you.
It's got to be something big.

653
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,236
Does he always talk about me?

654
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,213
What are you doing here?

655
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,350
I was meeting some friends from New York.
Are you on a date?

656
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,419
Heck yes. We look good, right?

657
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,487
Geez.

658
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,323
Be careful. He's a player.

659
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,661
I know because I'm his cousin,
Kim Hui-won.

660
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,734
It's Joo-won's little sister.
She's nice, unlike her brother.

661
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,436
There you go again! They're so childish.

662
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,207
You're family. Try to get along.

663
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:13,410
Don't you feel sorry for him?
He got rejected again.

664
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,313
Again? How many dates has he been on?

665
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,215
He has no interest in romance.

666
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,785
I can't believe the vacation was his idea.

667
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,853
I know.

668
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,155
Who did he meet this time?
Does he have any more women left?

669
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,457
I asked around.

670
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,260
She's a commercial director
named Yoon Seul.

671
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,062
Who?

672
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,464
Do you know her too?
I heard she's really pretty.

673
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,055
I PROMISE I WAS AT THE STUDIO

674
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,718
STUDIO? LIAR! YOU WERE WITH CHEON JI-AE!

675
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,665
No, I didn't lie.

676
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,836
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SMILE FOR OTHER GIRLS

677
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,605
I told you not to smile!

678
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,441
No, I didn't.

679
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,286
Thank you.

680
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,242
-Question.
-Question.

681
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,543
-I asked first.
-I asked first.

682
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,345
-Did she get home okay?
-You went on a date?

683
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,947
It's nothing new.

684
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,117
Did you send her home? Did you drive her?

685
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,019
How was the last girl?

686
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,821
Did she talk about me?

687
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,190
Is it true that you got rejected?

688
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,925
Anything at all?

689
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,360
Is it true?

690
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,964
She kept that bag?
Even a plastic bag would be better.

691
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,801
Are you going to marry the stunt girl?
You're not.

692
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,337
If you're going to fool around with her,
don't get into the specifics.

693
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,472
You're having an arranged marriage.
What does it matter?

694
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,407
So, tell me about the last girl.

695
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,611
You already heard from Hui-won.
I was rejected, okay?

696
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,313
Tell me about Gil Ra-im.

697
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,683
What secret of yours does she know
that you're acting like this?

698
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,652
"A secret"? Me?

699
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,654
Don't act innocent.

700
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,856
Does she have pictures of you too?

701
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,957
What?

702
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,126
I took the pictures!

703
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,465
Wait.

704
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:29,366
What?

705
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,569
Why are you still doing the vacation event
when I said I'm not doing it?

706
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,237
That's why you delayed
your music video shoot.

707
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:37,540
Did you think I'd just take it?
Too bad I have something scheduled now.

708
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,577
Do you think that'd stop me or Dong-gyu?

709
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:43,313
-What?
-Only we bosses know.

710
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,215
Your shoot wasn't delayed.

711
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,050
You're off to Thailand tomorrow
as planned,

712
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,918
so, don't forget your sunscreen.

713
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,787
You look tired.

714
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,223
What?

715
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,191
Choi Dong-gyu, why you!

716
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,705
You're not picking up?

717
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,375
Pick up!

718
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,177
Pick up!

719
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,813
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

720
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:21,117
Why aren't you picking up?
Why do you even carry a phone around?

721
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,220
Without me, you'd starve!
I dare you to keep ignoring me!

722
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,325
-Hello?
-Is it Dong-gyu?

723
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,260
Did you find him? Hold on.

724
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,629
Han Tae-seon is on Jeju Island right now.

725
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,031
-"Jeju Island"?
-He uploaded a photo on Twitter today.

726
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,472
Listen to me carefully.

727
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,642
Turn off all your cell phones.

728
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,143
-What?
-What?

729
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,234
A NORMAL, CLEAR DAY

730
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,426
A NORMAL, CLEAR DAY
SOMEONE IS WALKING ON MY HEART

731
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,661
SOMETIMES RELYING ON CHANCE
MY GLOOMY, PRECIOUS DEAREST

732
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,330
YOU'VE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE

733
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,966
A NORMAL, CLEAR DAY

734
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,802
SOMEONE IS WALKING ON MY HEART

735
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,405
SOMETIMES RELYING ON CHANCE

736
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:51,274
MY GLOOMY, PRECIOUS DEAREST

737
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,177
YOU'VE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE

738
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:22,939
Hello?

739
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,342
Yes, that's me.

740
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,147
What? I did?

741
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,716
What giveaway?

742
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,187
Wasn't it you? Did you really not
enter a giveaway under my name?

743
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:38,822
I didn't.

744
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,825
Why? Did someone use your name?

745
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,460
Maybe.

746
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,596
Your department store just called

747
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,432
and said that I won a vacuum cleaner.
Third place.

748
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,368
Maybe it was a computer error.

749
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:53,837
You fool.

750
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,873
If it wasn't you or me,
who else could it be?

751
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,107
It was my CEO.

752
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,244
He did it to surprise you.

753
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,314
Wow, how adorable!

754
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,983
He would never.

755
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,053
-Where's the stew?
-Goodness.

756
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,821
I forgot.

757
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:16,326
I'm telling you, it's him for sure.

758
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,762
How else would our employee
from Public Relations know your number?

759
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:26,970
You know that bag you bought last month...

760
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,273
Can I borrow it tomorrow?

761
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,503
What are you doing here at this hour?

762
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,672
I work today.

763
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,507
But everyone's getting off at this time.

764
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:50,880
Call the stores listed here
and bring me their new winter catalog...

765
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,849
