1
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,448
Have you heard the term, "Indian summer"?

2
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,684
It is the short summer that comes
at the end of autumn,

3
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,653
right before the cold winter.

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,422
Indians hunted
during this short period of summer

5
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,791
in preparation for wintertime.

6
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,296
That is why it was considered
to be a gift from the gods.

7
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,168
This Indian summer, we're going to have
an unprecedented amount of rainfall.

8
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:47,407
Perhaps, this rain will bring with itself
a gift from the gods.

9
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,678
But we'll know
if it'll be a gift or a prank

10
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,947
only once the rain comes.

11
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,315
Right, Joo-won?

12
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,154
That's right.

13
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,357
The Netherlands conducted this research.

14
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,827
If you eat a variety of food
for breakfast,

15
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,496
your immune system will improve,

16
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,865
and it will prevent viruses.

17
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,534
So, make sure you don't skip breakfast.

18
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,101
What was that just now?

19
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,669
Who was it?

20
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,505
Oh, him?

21
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,840
He's a cousin.

22
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,708
A distant cousin at that.

23
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,978
If I buy a sports car,
he buys a dealership.

24
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:03,683
If I buy a yacht,
he just has to buy the entire wharf.

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,219
In a nutshell,
you'll soon be saying to me,

26
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,787
"You awful jerk!"

27
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,558
But he's about 100 times worse than me.

28
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,625
What?

29
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,661
"A distant cousin"?

30
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,897
What are you saying?
Why would I ever do that?

31
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,999
Chae-rin,

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,536
was it too hard to understand
just because I talked around it?

33
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,339
I meant to say, "let's break up."

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,409
I don't want to see you anymore.

35
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,311
What?

36
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,414
Then, what was that kiss?

37
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,118
I'd like to remain in your memory as a man

38
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,954
who was sweet until the very end...

39
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,723
Hey! You awful jerk!

40
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,500
Her grandfather was a minister,
and her father runs a hotel.

41
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,705
She's become a commercial director
after studying abroad.

42
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,113
Are you Yoon Seul?

43
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,418
ÉDOUARD MANET SPECIAL EXHIBIT

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,756
You must like Édouard Manet.

45
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,060
I bet we're the only ones
who go on blind dates in a museum.

46
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,162
This way, I don't waste time.

47
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,698
What do you mean?

48
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,900
Stride shows temperament,

49
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,736
and taste in paintings shows
how cultured you are.

50
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,139
Whether you belong
in a museum or a nightclub...

51
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,745
Whether you prefer your perfume
strong or weak,

52
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,246
you get your answers back quickly.

53
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,849
Do you want something to drink?

54
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,454
Darn.

55
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,323
Is it too strong?

56
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,206
We can leave if you're uncomfortable.

57
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,076
-We'll tell our parents--
-Is this uncomfortable for you?

58
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,311
Isn't it?

59
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,547
As much as we are better-off
than ordinary people,

60
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,916
we have to make some sacrifices.

61
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,419
However, I'm not interested...

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,088
in a loveless marriage.

63
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,624
I'm just too passionate

64
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,693
to be an obedient daughter.

65
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,563
So, you don't like an arranged marriage?

66
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,765
-That's right.
-Why not?

67
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,701
-Pardon?
-Love?

68
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,104
Of course, it's important to some people,

69
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,041
but do you think it's right to disregard
pedigree, education, competence,

70
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,644
and be with someone of a different class
whom you can't communicate with

71
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,413
in exchange for a mere kiss
because of a hormonal disease called love?

72
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,650
-But--
-You're naiver than you look.

73
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,153
If you're a woman who gets the hots
for a fool over prince charming,

74
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,988
then, I'll pass too.

75
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,257
Should I say that you rejected me?

76
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,393
Let's go with that then.

77
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,228
But...

78
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,699
And the Manet exhibit is next month.

79
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,005
Wait, Joo-won!

80
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,575
Really?

81
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,176
I'm telling you,

82
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,146
I've never failed
with my new woman persona.

83
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,416
But he just left like that.

84
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,084
And he looked so cool when he left.

85
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,187
-So, it means you got shut down.
-It means I've finally found my match.

86
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,223
There's a problem even if you date him.

87
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,393
-If he knew about you and Oska--
-Is that what you want?

88
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,762
Do you think he would have
come out if he knew?

89
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,997
Just drink your tea.

90
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,166
By the way,

91
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,504
this is my favorite VIP lounge among
department store lounges.

92
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,173
Even the tea cups are exquisite.

93
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,408
This is the expensive--

94
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,675
You gold digger.

95
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,611
What?

96
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,180
You're a gold digger.

97
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,284
If I'm a gold digger, then what are you?

98
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,185
Me?

99
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,854
I'm an heiress.

100
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,925
Just look at those gold diggers
making it so obvious.

101
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,395
You should wear couture,
not be overwhelmed by it.

102
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,198
What the... What is that?

103
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,266
Who?

104
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,916
Oh, my goodness!

105
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,285
It's a dragon tattoo.

106
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,954
Nanny,

107
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,389
hold Bo-gyeong tight.

108
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,062
What are you going to do?

109
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,997
Soon, I'd marry this place's owner.

110
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,900
I can't just let her turn this place
into some cheap hangout.

111
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,571
I'll put her in her place
as the owner's soon-to-be wife.

112
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,541
Hey!

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,077
Oh, no.

114
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,050
Over here.

115
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,821
Give me a moment.

116
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,157
How may I help you?

117
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,993
Since when has security gotten this lax?

118
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,930
Aren't only VVIP members who spend over
100 million won a year allowed in here?

119
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,466
Did you check for the IDs
of everyone in here?

120
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,368
Of course.

121
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,505
You didn't check me.

122
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,742
That's because everyone knows
who you are...

123
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,611
I think she means me.

124
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,513
Give me the key.

125
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,415
You don't have to blame her for anything.

126
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,917
I was just about to leave.

127
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,586
Thanks for the coffee. I'll see you later.

128
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,924
We spend the money,
and you drink our coffee?

129
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,726
What's your name?

130
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,695
I apologize.

131
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,264
I'm really sorry.

132
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,933
LIM A-YEONG

133
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,640
Where are you going?

134
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,974
Today is not our lucky day.

135
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,944
All signs point to terrible fortune today.

136
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,412
We have to get your nametag back.

137
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,016
Please! Don't cause any more trouble.

138
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,118
I just have to apologize.

139
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,287
It's not a big deal. Don't freak out.

140
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,655
What for?

141
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,590
Why do we always have to apologize?

142
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,730
There, there, baby.

143
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,567
Oh, my baby.

144
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,370
Don't cry.

145
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,516
-Hey!
-My bag!

146
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,586
He stole my bag! My bag!

147
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,288
What do I do?

148
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,424
My bag...

149
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,794
Do you know how much that's worth?
Why'd you let him go?

150
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,295
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,797
I was protecting Bo-gyeong.

152
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,533
Don't use her as an excuse.
Give her to me.

153
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,836
Aren't you an accomplice?

154
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,404
You're with him!

155
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,673
Pay for my bag!

156
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,609
-It's really not my lucky day.
-That's not true!

157
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,844
Wait here.

158
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,780
My bag...

159
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,308
I was wiping the baby's nose

160
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,877
when he appeared from over there--

161
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,379
Do you want it back that badly?

162
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,181
What brand was it?

163
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,582
It looks like an import.

164
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,885
This is it, right?

165
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,524
Check if anything is missing.

166
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,663
I found your friend's bag,

167
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,365
so, let my friend off
for what happened at the lounge.

168
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,701
Please give me her nametag.

169
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,736
I don't have it.

170
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,506
I think you do.

171
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,675
I threw it away.

172
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,344
"You threw it away"?

173
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,379
In the trash can at the entrance--

174
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,281
Excuse me...

175
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,716
Which one?

176
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,352
Whether you spend 100 million won
at a department store,

177
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,221
or get a free coffee from a friend,

178
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,757
a dirty trash can
is still a dirty trash can.

179
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,392
You threw it away, so, you dig for it.

180
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,560
Fine.

181
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,897
I'm not that unreasonable.

182
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,868
-We'll call it even.
-It's too late for that.

183
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,370
I'm not that reasonable.

184
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,773
What are you doing? Let me go.

185
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,141
-Hey!
-Let go of me.

186
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,543
Excuse me!

187
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,179
Find it.

188
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,247
It's not this one.

189
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,116
Look for it, so, I can see for myself.

190
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,159
Are you happy now?

191
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,562
Take it, so I can go.

192
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,565
That's trash, right?

193
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,672
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

194
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,607
Wasn't that the trash can?

195
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,413
How dare she!

196
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,015
Seriously.

197
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,584
How can she be so awesome?

198
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,019
I wonder who she is.

199
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,020
Hey!

200
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,470
Cut! Nice!

201
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,605
It's so tiring.

202
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,941
My arm hurts.

203
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,844
Watch where you're going!
Why is it so dirty?

204
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,013
Director, did I look cool?

205
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,948
You need to look pretty, not cool.

206
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,451
An actress doesn't need anything else.

207
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,953
All you need to do is look beautiful.

208
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,621
Aren't I right?

209
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,290
Gosh, Director.

210
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,758
-You know I can look pretty...
-Ra-im!

211
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,861
Good work. You looked very cool.

212
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,196
Thank you.

213
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,009
Just because we have
the same costume and makeup,

214
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,945
she thinks she's the star when
she's only just a stuntwoman.

215
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,657
At the place you left behind

216
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm staring

217
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,632
Are we done?

218
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,434
Next location.

219
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,504
-Is Oska consoling you?
-What?

220
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,573
I heard that Chae-rin said
something again.

221
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,176
-It's nothing.
-What did she say?

222
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,511
It's fine.

223
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,213
I don't care what she says.

224
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,815
Yeah, forget her.

225
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,785
She's just jealous
because you're 100 times prettier.

226
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,587
I know.

227
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,124
The lighting crew said
that I'm 125 times prettier.

228
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,027
Why did my mom have to make me so pretty?

229
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,764
My skin looks perfect,
even though I only use free samples,

230
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,000
and I look good in any style of clothing.

231
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,236
I thought it would die down with age,

232
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,139
but I look even more womanly
than ever as I age.

233
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,808
It's driving me crazy.

234
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,178
Come to think of it,
my mom was the pretty one.

235
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,414
Gosh! Why did her mom
have to be so pretty?

236
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,117
-We can't even sue her for it!
-That's what I'm saying.

237
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,219
-Here, I'll--
-It's fine.

238
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,831
Finish listening.
Singing would be even better.

239
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,504
Let's go!

240
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,140
Hurry up.

241
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,675
Move it.

242
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,810
Hurry it up.

243
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,245
Hurry up.

244
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,903
GIL RA-IM

245
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,684
PICTURE-PERFECT OSKA

246
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,759
Even after falling asleep,

247
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,864
I wake up over and over during the night

248
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:34,339
Unable to do anything without tears

249
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,341
I told you to take a friend.

250
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,210
I have no friends to come with.

251
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,612
All of my friends like idols.

252
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,218
I'm staring

253
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,389
At the place you left behind

254
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,791
I'm staring

255
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,663
But I know you're not coming

256
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,365
That's the only way for me

257
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,969
To put this love to rest

258
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,371
I only think of erasing you from my memory

259
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,408
For a brief moment

260
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,876
U-yeong will be disappointed.

261
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,544
It's almost over. Just wait.

262
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,479
I would if I could.

263
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,449
But how is his singing
getting worse and worse?

264
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,817
His fans will hear you.

265
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,021
If you go, I'm going to tell him
not to renew his contract.

266
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,490
Did he pay you to spy on me?

267
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,292
I'm a major stockholder
of Oska Entertainment.

268
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,660
You'd better not leave.

269
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,930
Even if my lips crack

270
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,400
Unable to hold back

271
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,503
Once again

272
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,106
I'm calling it out

273
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,477
Your painful name

274
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,013
I know

275
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,351
It'll be a painful memory

276
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,686
That's the only way

277
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,890
I'll be in so much pain

278
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,260
That I won't dare

279
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:06,398
Even think of wiping you from my thoughts

280
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,867
You and I

281
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,805
Our short romance was too much for me

282
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,875
There was no way to know

283
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,178
Even if I knew I pretended not to

284
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:25,484
And just cried

285
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,889
Why can't he just take the elevator?

286
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,392
Why? I like seeing his face.

287
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,095
He's so handsome, isn't he?

288
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,263
So, what if he is? He never works.

289
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,666
He comes to work only two days a week.

290
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,068
That's why people are saying
that the owner will change.

291
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,071
I heard that Director Park is
signing all the papers for him now.

292
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,640
Really? Director Park?

293
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,950
Just look at this place.

294
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,752
We'll change it

295
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,220
when it becomes yours.

296
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,290
Mr. Choi.

297
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,959
Yes, Mr. Park?

298
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,027
Where should we start?

299
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,062
Excuse me?

300
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,834
How about with the name plaque first?

301
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,469
That sounds good.

302
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,885
This is the fall sales plan.

303
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,686
I haven't even sat down yet.

304
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,688
Please be understanding of my haste.

305
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,690
If you're that impatient,
why didn't you finalize it?

306
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,059
Can't you forge
my signature perfectly yet?

307
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,097
Those are just rumors.

308
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,133
It was all because you don't
come to work properly--

309
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,635
I do, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

310
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,936
You must come every day.

311
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,704
No, I don't like the traffic.

312
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,415
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

313
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,051
No...

314
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,987
but what would you like us to change?

315
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,590
How would I know? I only read the title.

316
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,297
If it's not your best
and you're not sure, do it again.

317
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,833
What do you think, Mr. Park?

318
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,704
I'll redraft it as soon as possible.

319
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,706
FALL SALES PLAN

320
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,284
I can't shoot a music video in Korea
when I'm on my 7th album.

321
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,154
I sold out the concert.
What's the matter? I'll star in it too.

322
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,389
That's the problem.

323
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,493
There is no director
who wants to work with you, okay?

324
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,094
Why not?

325
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,164
Seriously? Put your hand on your heart.

326
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,199
I did. What now?

327
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,834
Don't you feel anything?

328
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,904
I do. My chest is a bit sagging.

329
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,439
Goodness.

330
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,042
Everyone in the industry knows
what a jerk you are.

331
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,312
They even know about you throwing
the script at Director Choi from SBC.

332
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,282
That's ridiculous.
I never threw the script!

333
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:18,917
I threw the synopsis.

334
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,385
Oh, did you?

335
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,221
Then, make sure you also pick up
the script and throw it next time.

336
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,824
-Goodness.
-Where are you going?

337
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,095
I'm going to look for a director
before you say you're going to do it too!

338
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,331
Jesus...

339
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,534
Me? A director?

340
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,303
Actually, that's not bad.

341
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,305
Should I make my directorial debut?

342
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,439
That solves everything.

343
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,574
Is that what you think?

344
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,276
Why you little...

345
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,810
Stay still.

346
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,715
You have time, right?
I want to go for a drink.

347
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,119
Looks like you don't have the time.

348
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,527
This is the redraft.

349
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,132
In just six hours?

350
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,234
It's not my style to put things off.

351
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,108
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

352
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,743
Yes.

353
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:25,050
Really? This is the same one from spring.
You just changed the cover to fall.

354
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,085
It's the same event every year,

355
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,188
so, the range of events that can be run
is narrower than you think.

356
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,790
And what are you going to do
if it's wider?

357
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,697
You wouldn't participate in an event
to win a small car,

358
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,265
would you?

359
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,069
Because with what I pay you,
you ride a much better one.

360
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,539
Then, can't you think of something
more sensational and exciting?

361
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,575
Do you really need to collect

362
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,444
all the dimes and nickels
from poor, pitiful people

363
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,045
who actually need that car?

364
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,315
Instead of small cars, fridges,
or vacuum cleaners,

365
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,150
I'd offer the outfits that top stars wear.

366
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:03,688
Her coat, her bag, and her watch. Why?

367
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:08,259
It's much easier to open the purse
of extravagant, vain people

368
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,995
than that of frugal minimum wage workers.

369
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,964
And that equals a fatter wallet for you.

370
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,233
What do you think?

371
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,205
You're always right, sir.

372
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,542
Then, what should we do
about the contract with Oska?

373
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,178
Renew it.

374
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,981
Our sales are rising due to the influx
of Japanese tourists--

375
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:30,882
I know.

376
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,051
If we can't renew our contract...

377
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,187
I just said, we'll renew it, didn't I?

378
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,691
Are you worried
that I can't or won't do it?

379
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,595
Would I not do it if I said I would?

380
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,265
Be ready in ten minutes.

381
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,070
Why are you standing there? You may go.

382
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,589
When was your last commercial?

383
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,758
About a year ago?

384
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,827
Why do you want to know?

385
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,196
With all the rising stars out there,

386
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,365
I can't believe that
you still didn't renew.

387
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,067
Is that what this is for?

388
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,771
This album might be your last chance
to retire while they still care about you,

389
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:30,275
and your last chance
to sign with our department store.

390
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,843
That's just your opinion.

391
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,578
Have I ever been wrong?

392
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,682
Honestly, what's money to people like us?

393
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,985
This contract is to restore your pride.

394
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,587
We'll tell the media you got paid more.

395
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,756
If money isn't important
to the both of us,

396
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,591
then, why should I take a pay cut?

397
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,892
Just pay me more.

398
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,027
That I can't do,

399
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,528
for my own pride.

400
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,564
What? That's ridiculous.

401
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,966
No way! Forget it!

402
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,401
Don't even dream about it.

403
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,972
I'm off.
That girl at the bar keeps looking at me.

404
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,373
She was looking at me, not you.

405
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,577
Are you cross-eyed?
She was looking at me since I walked in.

406
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,212
It's because I won't look at her.

407
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,613
I don't believe this.

408
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,882
She's obviously a fan of mine.
Should I ask?

409
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,517
-You're going too far.
-Do you want to bet?

410
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,418
I'll go ask.

411
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,187
You might get slapped.
I went on a date with her.

412
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,156
What?

413
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:27,198
Come before we really find someone else.
I won't wait long.

414
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,437
Hey, at least pay for the drinks!

415
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,567
PARK CHAE-RIN

416
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,580
Why aren't you answering my calls?

417
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,883
I know you picked up
After Cool Cool's Yoon-hui's call.

418
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,752
Why do you pick up only her calls?

419
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,155
My thighs are just as nice as hers!

420
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,657
I can't break up like this.

421
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:29,260
There are tons of journalists here
to report on our set today.

422
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,164
I'm going to tell everyone about us.
Got that?

423
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,602
Goodness.

424
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,008
How long have you been here?

425
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,710
Why are you loitering here?

426
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,712
The director ordered me
to rehearse the next scene.

427
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,280
How annoying!

428
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,783
What? Again? We already did.

429
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,086
We need to practice more.
It's a complicated scene,

430
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,221
and you might get hurt--

431
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,322
Don't talk back to me.

432
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,624
I can't believe you.

433
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,227
Fine. Let's do it.

434
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,028
-Hurry!
-I'll go slow.

435
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,665
One, two, three, four.

436
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,001
Again.

437
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,638
One, two, three...

438
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,207
Oh no!

439
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,879
-What's going on?
-Is she okay?

440
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,183
My nail! Oh no!

441
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,352
I'm bleeding!

442
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,786
Don't touch, it hurts.

443
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:29,921
Chae-rin!

444
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,589
Are you hurt, Chae-rin?

445
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,125
-You're bleeding!
-Don't touch it. It hurts!

446
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,159
Did you get hurt a lot?

447
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,628
Are you crazy, Ra-im?

448
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,696
How can you ruin her nails like this?

449
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:39,764
I'm sorry.

450
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,599
How are we going to shoot now?

451
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,767
I'm really sorry.

452
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,302
For what?

453
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,237
So, why didn't you practice earlier?

454
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,805
My nail!

455
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,007
Director Lim,

456
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,542
can't you see that my actress is injured?

457
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,914
-And she's not?
-I'm fine.

458
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,082
"Fine"? Do you think you're Wonder Woman?

459
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,717
I'm really okay.

460
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,353
-I can still shoot.
-Don't argue with me.

461
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,522
You're an actress too.

462
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,991
Can't you see her whining over a nail?

463
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,760
Take care of yourself!

464
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,195
What did you say, Director Lim?

465
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,531
Do you want me to fire your entire team?

466
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,501
I was just about to leave, anyway.

467
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,604
This place isn't worth our time.

468
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,207
Hurry up and get ready to leave.

469
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,609
Director!

470
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,945
I'm sorry. Please, wait.

471
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,713
Director!

472
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,517
He thinks he's a hot shot
because he had a taste of Hollywood!

473
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,252
This is stressing me out.

474
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,923
I want to cut down on your medication.

475
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,992
Don't. I need it.

476
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,361
What if my symptoms get worse?

477
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,898
Do I look like a quack?
I told you that I'll help you.

478
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,668
Can't you be nicer?
What kind of family doctor are you?

479
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,003
You can fire me if you want.

480
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,105
Are elevators still too much?

481
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,974
I wish they were just too much.

482
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,510
I can't breathe
when I stand in front of one.

483
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,914
If the company knew
about the state that I'm in...

484
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,450
Wait.

485
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,721
-What?
-You're not busy, right?

486
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,023
No. When am I ever busy?

487
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,692
Then, go to French Town in Gapyeong.

488
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,061
They're filming a movie there.

489
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:21,132
Find an actress named Park Chae-rin,
and hold onto her for three hours.

490
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,101
Are you on drugs now? I'm hanging up.

491
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,335
Wait!

492
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,472
I'm shooting Chocolate right now.

493
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,541
We just went out together for a bit,
but she's so crazy.

494
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,176
I'm dead if Dong-gyu finds out.

495
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,145
Was Dong-gyu that great a person?

496
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,981
Goodness. A bunch of reporters is there.

497
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,816
I think she knows how to bully someone.

498
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,052
She's perfect for you.

499
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,688
Please. She wants alimony!

500
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,556
She has pictures of us at the hotel.

501
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,692
She's probably not the only one
with those photos.

502
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,094
You should just collect them
and publish an album. Bye.

503
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,262
Come on!

504
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:55,967
Fine, bring the contract. I'll sign it!

505
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,202
Where did you say it was?

506
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,371
I just have to hold onto her?

507
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,906
Oh, by the way,

508
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,976
There's no need
for a signing bonus, right?

509
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,110
Times are hard.

510
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:09,447
You jerk! You said you'd
at least save my pride.

511
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,948
Do you know how much my pride is worth?

512
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,886
I'll do my best, sir.

513
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,289
Please, give me another chance.

514
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,060
Don't ask me. I didn't kick you guys out.

515
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,062
Director Lim is the one who's doing that.

516
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,865
It's all my fault.
It will never happen again.

517
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,836
I said, you're talking
to the wrong person!

518
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,106
-Do I have to cater to the stunt director?
-Excuse me.

519
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,810
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but who's Park Chae-rin?

520
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,778
Chae-rin?

521
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,748
She's over there.

522
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,489
Thank you.

523
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,324
Go back to sleep.

524
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,267
You know U-yeong... I mean, Oska, right?

525
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,536
-"Oska"?
-You don't?

526
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,306
Why do you ask?

527
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,341
Come with me. Oska wants to see you.

528
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,443
Me?

529
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,853
Can we close the roof?

530
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,855
Then, what would be the point
of having a car like this?

531
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,323
Where is it?

532
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,824
Where's what?

533
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,728
He wants to meet you
at the hotel where you two first met.

534
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,533
Are there too many to remember?

535
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,772
Ritz Hotel, Room 1210.

536
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,442
"Room 1210"?

537
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,844
Are you serious?

538
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,479
All you need is a private room.

539
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,782
What are you? The leopard from
The Snows of Kilimanjaro? Why so high?

540
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,420
Room 1210...

541
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,141
You go up first.

542
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,876
-Why?
-I...

543
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,383
The thing is,

544
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:29,654
I'm not someone who can be seen going
into a hotel room with a woman.

545
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,823
If you ever find out, you'll be like,

546
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,762
"Oh my god. I almost rode
the same elevator as him?"

547
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,131
That's the kind of person I am.

548
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,742
Oh, this outfit?

549
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,780
I don't want to brag this much but...

550
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,586
Do you see? You know what this is, right?

551
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,988
This track jacket is that very...

552
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,955
Gil Ra-im.

553
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,063
Please say hello.

554
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,534
You're Kim Seon-a's stunt double, right?

555
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,104
-Nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

556
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,582
Are you going to make a hole in your shoe
if I ask you out for coffee?

557
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,716
Excuse me?

558
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,294
We'll do it later.

559
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,997
Where's Seon-a? My hair's getting flat.

560
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,298
-Five o'clock!
-Five o'clock!

561
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,240
Water...

562
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,055
Won't you be uncomfortable?

563
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,625
It looks like you'll have to be
with me for another hour.

564
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,594
Does it make you uncomfortable?

565
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,797
I deal with mostly only men in my trade...

566
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,470
You really are pretty wild.

567
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,106
How long has it been since you met Oska?

568
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,907
Quite a while.

569
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,443
I had no idea that he remembered me.

570
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,812
Why not? You've got a memorable face.

571
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,218
I'm only asking because you seem frank,
and I hate being curious.

572
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,020
How much do you normally make

573
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,922
off of a top star like U-yeong?

574
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,229
I heard you filmed something here.
How much alimony do you get with that?

575
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,464
Are you talking about my guarantee?

576
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,701
Call it whatever you like.

577
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,403
All I want to know is how much.

578
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,339
I don't get paid more for top stars.

579
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,941
If it's outdoors or in the countryside,
I might get more.

580
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,143
"Outdoors"?

581
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,978
Rooftops and bamboo groves

582
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,046
are the trend these days.

583
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,083
"Bamboo groves"?

584
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,051
Wow. Choi U-yeong.

585
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,155
It costs the most when cars are involved.

586
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,990
Probably because it's hard.

587
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,826
Yes... Cars.

588
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,263
Of course, it's difficult.
It's so uncomfortable and cramped.

589
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,365
But men love that kind of thing.

590
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,935
Yes, men love speed and thrills.

591
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,505
You really are something.

592
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,908
Speaking so frankly about...

593
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,578
Aren't you a little embarrassed, though?

594
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,213
You're the lead actress of a movie.

595
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,348
"The lead"?

596
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,957
Excuse me. What's my name?

597
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,892
-What?
-What's my name?

598
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,029
Who did Oska want to meet?

599
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,163
Park Chae-rin.

600
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,371
Hey!

601
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,874
-"Hey"?
-Are you from the countryside?

602
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,476
When did you start work?

603
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,111
-"Countryside"?
-I know it's tough in Seoul,

604
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:25,483
but you can't dress like this.
Think of Oska's reputation.

605
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,585
I knew it.

606
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,820
You didn't look properly.

607
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,423
Look carefully this time.

608
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:36,093
This was made stitch-by-stitch,
by an artisan in Italy...

609
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,097
What's he doing with a girl like you?

610
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,434
It's not like I can stoop down
to your level.

611
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,171
Where are you?

612
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,006
You said you'd be here!

613
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,575
There was a delay with filming.
Just wait two more hours.

614
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:57,982
Excuse me. I think you asked him
to bring you Park Chae-rin,

615
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,619
but this dimwit of yours
brought me by mistake--

616
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,157
You're not Chae-rin? Who are you?

617
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,193
If you're not her, why'd you come with me?

618
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,129
You asked if I knew Oska,
not if I was Park Chae-rin.

619
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,467
Do you know how much this deal is worth?

620
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,036
What are you going to do about this?

621
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,905
Why do I have to do anything?

622
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,208
I thought you were a dimwit,
but you're actually a screwball.

623
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,944
What? "Screwball"? Why you--

624
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,914
Assistant Director!

625
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,783
Really? Of course.

626
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,452
Thank you so much!

627
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:41,025
Are you still in Gapyeong?
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

628
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,927
I'll leave right now.

629
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,898
You're not going anywhere.

630
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,334
And there's no way you can get
to Gapyeong in 30 minutes.

631
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,802
Do you want to meet Chae-rin?

632
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,604
What? Yes.

633
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,372
Then, give me your car key.

634
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,849
Hey!

635
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,187
Why? I thought guys liked fast cars.

636
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,922
Catch.

637
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,325
Look for a girl dressed exactly like me.
That's Park Chae-rin.

638
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,329
That's not what we agreed on.
You said you'd find her for me!

639
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,833
Goodness, this guy.

640
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,568
You can't keep coming here like this.

641
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,169
No autographs during filming.

642
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,938
Do you think I want an...

643
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,442
This outfit isn't what you think it is.

644
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,379
It was made stitch-by-stitch
by an artisan in Italy

645
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,180
who spent 40 years
just making tracksuits...

646
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,215
This is driving me crazy.

647
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,984
Fine, whatever.
Just tell me where Chae-rin is right now.

648
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,020
Is it true that you're dating Oska?

649
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,022
How did you two first meet?

650
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,839
I've been looking for you all day.

651
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,474
Me?

652
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,476
Why?

653
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,279
Would you believe me
if I said I was your fan?

654
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,714
Are you really?

655
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,918
You're graceful and intelligent, right?

656
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,355
-Excuse me?
-And most importantly, scandal-free.

657
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,258
"Scandal-free"?

658
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,361
Yes...

659
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:34,898
Yeah, it's me.

660
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,102
What happened? What did she say?
What about the reporters?

661
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,204
What'd she say?
Did you stop her from talking?

662
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:44,074
Why don't you stop talking?
I'm about to tell you...

663
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,344
I'll call you back.

664
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,115
Were you a stuntman?

665
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,818
It's "stuntwoman."

666
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,286
I'm returning this.

667
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,323
You got blood on this.
This leather's expensive.

668
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,558
I'm sorry!

669
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,728
Did you find Chae-rin?

670
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,497
Thanks to you.

671
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,465
But you have a unique job.

672
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,402
Are you not that smart?
Why do you do physical labor?

673
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,605
Do you want to know why?

674
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,674
It's useful at a time like this.

675
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,878
Why did you kick me?

676
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,146
Why do you think?

677
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,984
I was simply curious!
Why did you get violent all of a sudden?

678
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,453
I'm not someone who looks down
on dumb people.

679
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,224
Good for you, but be thankful
that I hurt my arm today.

680
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,259
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

681
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,828
Do you think I'm stupid?
I know it's just makeup.

682
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,231
It's not, so, get lost.

683
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,900
It is makeup. Stop right there.

684
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,970
If you don't want to meet my lawyer,
apologize to me right...

685
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,119
Are you actually hurt?

686
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,387
Keep it down.

687
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:11,622
Let me see.

688
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,957
What are you doing? Let me go.

689
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,961
Are you crazy?
Have you been like this the whole time?

690
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,696
Are you insane? Are you stupid?

691
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,966
You really are dumb.

692
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,404
And you have a fever, too!

693
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,672
Get your hands off of me!

694
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,152
We're heading to the ER,
so, take a look at her injury.

695
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,692
-Where are you going?
-Let go. I told you I'm fine.

696
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,827
Then, why are you shaking?

697
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,864
Are you nervous because you've never seen
a guy as handsome as me?

698
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,566
I'm saying this in case you misunderstand.

699
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,502
But I'm not doing this for you.

700
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,972
It's my moral obligation to society.
I'm just doing a good deed.

701
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,442
This is how I was raised. So,
try to endure it even if you're nervous.

702
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,444
Or I'm going to throw you.

703
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,374
CHOI U-YEONG

704
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,378
I'll talk to you at home.
I'm at the hospital.

705
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,141
That's much better.

706
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,777
It looks the same to me.

707
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,245
You startled me!

708
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,714
Who's this? Are you dating?

709
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,784
It's not like that. I just met her today.

710
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,287
So, you called me out
on my precious weekend

711
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,757
for a girl that you just met?

712
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,625
Me? A psychiatrist?

713
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,894
Let's not go into the details.

714
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,330
I was at an awesome party. You owe me.

715
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,232
Someone's calling.

716
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,804
MY BOSS

717
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:46,977
Hello?

718
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,679
Isn't this Gil Ra-im's cell phone?

719
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:53,850
Hello?

720
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,855
Is her name Gil Ra-im?

721
00:50:58,922 --> 00:50:59,990
Who is this?

722
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,759
Her name is Gil Ra-im, and how old is she?

723
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,128
She doesn't look that young.

724
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,363
Who the heck are you?

725
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,166
Stop asking dumb questions and answer.

726
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,767
Would you know if I told you?

727
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,804
Isn't it the guardian?

728
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,006
Hello?

729
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,709
I'm Dr. Park Ji-hyeon of Seoul Hospital.

730
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,646
The patient...
I mean, the owner of this cell phone...

731
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,874
I'm sorry.

732
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,277
I'm sorry.

733
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,914
-She's sleep talking...
-I'm sorry.

734
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,215
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

735
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,284
It's just a dream.
You don't have to apologize.

736
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,053
See? I told you it was a dream.

737
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,526
Why are you getting up?
You're sedated, so, rest for a few...

738
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,027
Director...

739
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,665
What the hell is wrong with you?

740
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,302
If it was this bad, you should have told
me that you need to go to the hospital!

741
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,904
I was fine before...

742
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,906
"I was fine before."
"I was fine yesterday."

743
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,042
That's how they all ended up
in a wheelchair.

744
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,878
Why don't you just quit
if you're going to do this?

745
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,080
Why did you go back there?

746
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,916
Where's your pride?

747
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,018
I'm sorry.

748
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,986
All this girl does is apologize.

749
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:13,290
Let's keep our voices down, okay?
This is a hospital.

750
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,625
-Was it you on the phone?
-Was it you who called?

751
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,460
-Who is this punk?
-"Punk"?

752
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,296
How dare you call me that.

753
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,131
Do you want to meet my lawyer?

754
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,933
I'll explain everything later...

755
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,945
He's just Oska's errand boy.

756
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,179
-"Errand boy"?
-Oska?

757
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,914
You don't have to pay attention to him.

758
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:39,783
-This won't happen again--
-Excuse me,

759
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,484
ambiguously-aged Gil Ra-im.

760
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,254
You can't dismiss me like that.

761
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,555
I told you.

762
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,258
"Oh my god.
I almost rode the elevator with--"

763
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,360
I'm done with treatment. I can go now.

764
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,600
You can't even put your shoes on.
Go where?

765
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:01,705
Goodness.

766
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,746
I guess she often gets
whisked away like that.

767
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,253
Stop being stubborn.

768
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,355
The medication is wearing off.

769
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,791
I'm really fine.
This isn't even the first time.

770
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,027
Can't I even give you a ride?

771
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,663
I'm sorry.

772
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,602
Take the cab, okay?

773
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,871
Okay. See you tomorrow.

774
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,507
I thought you said you'd take a cab.

775
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,878
If you sent him off because you were
expecting me to catch up

776
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,915
and offer you a ride
by any chance, then...

777
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,384
You have horrible manners.

778
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,420
I'm not done talking.
Why aren't you taking the cab?

779
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,989
Why do you care?

780
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,858
Do you work for a cab company?

781
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:04,027
Stop giving me these occupations.

782
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,529
First, an errand boy from the countryside,

783
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,431
and now a cab driver?

784
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,466
Then, what are you?

785
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,134
I asked why you didn't take a cab.

786
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,304
I've never asked a woman this before,

787
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,673
but do you not have any money?

788
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,809
If so, I'll take you home.
Where do you live?

789
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,478
You psycho!

790
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:25,382
Since today is not my lucky day,
I'm going to let this slide.

791
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,984
What if I close the roof?

792
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,819
I'll close it, okay?

793
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,187
Why would I ride in your car?

794
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,622
Because I want to take you home.

795
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,291
-What?
-I want to take you home.

796
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,827
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

797
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:42,098
You don't need a reason
for wanting to fly or to be happy.

798
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,201
It's the same thing.
I simply want to take you home.

799
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,837
So, why won't you let me?

800
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,540
I'll pull down the roof too.

801
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,787
You're dead meat. Why didn't you pick up?

802
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,388
I said, we'll talk at home.

803
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,624
Imagine how frustrated I must be
to come all the way here.

804
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,493
I called Ji-hyeon, and she said
you were with some strange woman--

805
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,501
What's wrong with Ji-hyeon?
That's not nice of her.

806
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,537
Nice to meet you.

807
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,472
Do you know who I am?

808
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,041
Hey, do your promoting elsewhere.

809
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,645
He has a horrible temper, doesn't he?

810
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,084
I recognize

811
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:36,986
those eyes.

812
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,288
Here he goes again.

813
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,191
I also remember the sweat
that ran down your forehead.

814
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,194
You were nervous in front of me all day.

815
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,496
-I did?
-Don't you remember?

816
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,365
You were really nervous back then.

817
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:53,803
We had a pretty bold first meeting.

818
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,172
Are you two really like that?

819
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,308
Are you crazy?

820
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,779
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

821
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,781
I'm not.

822
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,684
Oh right! That movie!

823
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,486
Welcome to Dongjak-gu!

824
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:12,589
A public servant
becomes the district head.

825
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,558
You were Kim Seon-a's stunt double, right?

826
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,529
You're still as cool as ever,

827
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:21,865
Gil Ra-im.

828
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,514
