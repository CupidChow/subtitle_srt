1
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:31,164
When the rain falls like memories

2
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:38,171
On the streets

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,009
I become sad

4
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,945
And hang my head

5
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,750
I can hear your voice

6
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,856
A love so painful

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,328
Isn't true love

8
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,998
A love...

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,201
So painful

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,940
Isn't true love

11
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,517
Why are your dreams

12
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,820
always

13
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,421
so rough?

14
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,559
Because you

15
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,894
are in my dreams

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,498
Are you

17
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,700
still unhappy when with me

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,103
even in your dreams?

19
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,072
Still

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,174
come into my dreams,

21
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,043
tomorrow

22
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,644
and the day after...

23
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,206
Hey.

24
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,544
There's an empty room next door.

25
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,758
Are you guys still up?

26
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,160
We'll go to sleep now.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,694
We will clean this up.

28
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,594
The air is refreshing.

29
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:22,996
Why are you already awake?

30
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,097
Aren't you tired?

31
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,531
I'm fine.

32
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,700
I'll make sure I won't be a burden to you.

33
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,703
And I brought your water.

34
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,908
It'll be slippery since it's winter.
Take your crampons just in case.

35
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,477
Let's go.

36
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,213
Wait!

37
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,150
Where are you two going?

38
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,453
-Are you going up to the top?
-If possible.

39
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,955
Where are you two going?

40
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,725
How many times do I have to tell you
not to ignore me?

41
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,636
Let me know if I'm going too fast.

42
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,872
This is nothing.

43
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,642
Hey, there!

44
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,847
Slow down.

45
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,382
Let's go together.

46
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,320
Let's speed up.

47
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,621
Shall we?

48
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,358
Geez. Hey!

49
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,894
Take me with you!

50
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,163
What are you going to do up there
by yourselves?

51
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,574
Wow, this is great!

52
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,311
I like

53
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,413
mountains in winter the best,

54
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,582
among the four seasons.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,351
Why?

56
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,120
The face gets cold,

57
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,888
and the body is hot.

58
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,226
If you stop walking because you get tired,
then you'll freeze to death.

59
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:05,164
So you have to keep moving even though
your heart feels like it'll burst.

60
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,302
If you continue walking,
eventually you'll get to the top.

61
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,875
Yahoo!

62
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,446
Yahoo!

63
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,843
What took you guys so long?

64
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,512
I almost froze to death.

65
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,985
Don't leave me here. Hey!

66
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,720
I can't walk.

67
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,223
Why can't you walk? Why?

68
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,925
I sprained my ankle.

69
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,528
So why did you walk so fast?

70
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,829
I got hurt while I was chasing you.

71
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,064
Can't you see it's swollen?

72
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,699
Right here.

73
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,841
-Here?
-It hurts!

74
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,209
Or here?

75
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,277
It hurts!

76
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,516
It hurts.

77
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,843
My ankle.

78
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,178
Help me.

79
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,785
Do you want to die?

80
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,786
What did I do?

81
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,821
Don't treat an injured person like that.

82
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,423
Hold my bag.

83
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,657
I'll just carry him.

84
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,592
Wait.

85
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,995
That's strange.

86
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,498
It hurt so much just a second ago,

87
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,299
but now it's fine.

88
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,835
Were you faking it?

89
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,504
I really hurt just a second ago.

90
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,176
When are you going to drop this habit?

91
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,978
You always hit me in the same spot!

92
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,180
That's because it hurts more
if you get hit in the same spot.

93
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,187
It really hurts!

94
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,430
Hold up.

95
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,565
Why?

96
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,138
I can't do this because you make me laugh.

97
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,140
What is this?

98
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,775
Did you get Botox on your hips?

99
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,210
Should I call Taec-yeon?
Want him to teach you?

100
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,178
I also want

101
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,846
to dance with Sandara, not you.

102
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,915
Do you even know how many fans she has?

103
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,984
Do you want to have your farewell concert?

104
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,719
Hey!

105
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,589
Are you looking down on me
just because your OSTs are big hits?

106
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,391
You looked down on others
even when you weren't famous.

107
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,061
That's why I'm the better person.
I'm always consistent.

108
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,796
I don't fake modesty
just because I'm famous.

109
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,498
I must have a lot of bad karma
from a past life.

110
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,100
Why else would I be stuck here with you?

111
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,969
Let's just get back to practice.

112
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,470
Fine, I will.

113
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,206
After this call.

114
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,845
Yes, it's me.

115
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,881
I messaged you to see if we can meet up.

116
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,950
When are you free?

117
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,853
Are you serious?

118
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,421
So

119
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,457
you don't even know why you broke up?

120
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,726
She's the one
who refused my marriage proposal.

121
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,427
And

122
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,296
she left with Jun-hyeok

123
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,697
to the States.

124
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,632
No,

125
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,468
she didn't leave with Jun-hyeok.

126
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,938
They just left on the same day.

127
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,072
What?

128
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,243
She stayed in Florida for two months.
Then Toronto, then London.

129
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,945
She wandered around like that

130
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,947
until she settled in Switzerland.

131
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,482
For about a year.

132
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,251
That's why I went to ski there.

133
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,986
Is that true?

134
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,489
She really didn't stay with Jun-hyeok?

135
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,391
She didn't.

136
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,193
Truthfully speaking, you were a bit harsh.

137
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,561
Me?

138
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,763
What did I do?

139
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,097
You really don't know?

140
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,299
This is the problem with men.

141
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:13,139
If the man I loved did that
in front of others, I would want to die.

142
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,476
Seul wanted to die too...

143
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:19,945
What

144
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,747
do you mean?

145
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,948
She was even

146
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,217
on medication.

147
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,896
What is it?

148
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,731
What did I do that was so harsh?

149
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,666
Tell me, even just the summary.

150
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,802
How could I tell you that myself?

151
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,638
You need to hear it from Seul.

152
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,841
I'm not even that close with Seul,

153
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,409
so it would be wrong for me to tell you.

154
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,044
Weren't you

155
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,979
the closest with Seul?

156
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,282
I have a lot of friends.

157
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,751
But Seul doesn't have any friends.
That's why I'm her closest friend.

158
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,488
And you're responsible for that too.

159
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,156
To her,

160
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,125
you were everything,

161
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,495
but she was only a small part of you.

162
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,319
There was never a time
when you wanted to see her, but couldn't.

163
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,724
But Seul was always alone
when she needed you the most.

164
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,162
She had to be in hiding to be your woman,

165
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,566
during the prettiest years of her life.

166
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,475
What?

167
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,043
Is that true?

168
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,446
I found out later.

169
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,549
And I didn't know it was a shared folder.

170
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,919
So it was actually me

171
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,954
who leaked the song?

172
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,957
-It was me.
-I'm really sorry.

173
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,561
It really was me.

174
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,563
What do we do?

175
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,334
Hand me your resignation!

176
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,106
Take a long break.

177
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,207
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,776
Thank you for everything.

179
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:31,844
What?

180
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:36,148
You're trying to run away
after you created this mess?

181
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,283
Excuse me?

182
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,751
Take the rest of the week off.

183
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,119
And come back on Monday.

184
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,488
Be prepared to work off your mistake.

185
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,325
-Got that?
-Are you giving me another chance?

186
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,493
It was a mistake.

187
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,095
I've made worse mistakes in my life.

188
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,600
There you are.

189
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,936
We need to close the contract this week...

190
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,992
What are you doing?

191
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,495
Tell me what you're doing.

192
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,334
Change of plans?

193
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,069
Now it's appeasement?

194
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,580
The one who leaked your song

195
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,583
turned out to be me.

196
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,555
I'll compensate you for the damages.

197
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:51,891
I told you

198
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,125
that it was you.

199
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,932
Just have one.

200
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,033
You told me once

201
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,935
that you like roasted chestnuts.

202
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,237
That wasn't me.

203
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,641
There are no chestnuts in our memories.

204
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,645
Which tramp's words are you trying
to pass it off as mine?

205
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,593
It really wasn't you?

206
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,162
I thought about it for a long time.

207
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,564
So this is wrong too.

208
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,172
Why did you go out
with a terrible guy like me?

209
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,907
Why did you like me so much?

210
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,946
I'll think some more.

211
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,949
I'll think about it all

212
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,017
one by one.

213
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,819
So I can figure out

214
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,221
what I did

215
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,491
to hurt you so much.

216
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,328
I'm off.

217
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,471
That was the best!

218
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,144
Joo-won can't make it
because he has a meeting tomorrow.

219
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,080
So I left Ra-im with him.

220
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,282
She did cause his injury, after all.

221
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,684
And I felt bad leaving him alone.

222
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,588
-Let's go if everyone's ready.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,666
Are you actually hurt?

224
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,472
Is that something to tell someone
who came back from the brink of death?

225
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,640
-Why did you kick me anyway?
-Just go to the hospital.

226
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,275
I want to.

227
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,178
But I can't get treated
unless it's my personal physician.

228
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,147
If I show up at the hospital,

229
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,950
word will get out immediately
and our stock prices will fall.

230
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,252
Hurry and make the pain go away.

231
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,387
Am I a doctor?

232
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,856
With the scars on your body,
you would be better than most doctors.

233
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,159
It might not be enough to get a license,
but you could reduce the swelling.

234
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,861
Where are you swollen? Where?

235
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,601
You're dead meat!

236
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,903
Why are you acting naive?

237
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,439
You saw everything
when we switched bodies.

238
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,574
I'm not that kind of person.

239
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,376
Hurry up and pull up your pants.

240
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,413
Fine.

241
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,249
In exchange,

242
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,217
you should tell me the truth.

243
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,921
That time you met U-yeong at night.

244
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,823
What did you two do?

245
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,625
We ate grilled pork rinds. Why?

246
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,293
Do you work
for the Korean Pork Association?

247
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,962
Why do you keep feeding pork rinds
to refined people?

248
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,098
-Did U-yeong eat it?
-Yes.

249
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,068
He didn't let it melt in his mouth,
unlike someone, and chewed it

250
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,436
like a man.

251
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,707
Hey!

252
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,642
What?

253
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,944
I was really manly just now.

254
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,848
You're faking your injury, aren't you?

255
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,352
It hurts so much. It must be broken.

256
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,987
Don't make me laugh.

257
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,392
Where are you going?

258
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,962
I'm going to go take a walk, so stay here.

259
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,730
-I'll go with you.
-You said you're in pain.

260
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,199
I'm going because I'm in pain.

261
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,900
Haven't you heard of physical therapy?

262
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,856
Gil Ra-im.

263
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,657
What?

264
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,394
Your action

265
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,097
has the scent of lavender.

266
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,699
What?

267
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,534
Your existence itself

268
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,236
is a miracle to me.

269
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,738
You're crazy.

270
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,245
I'm going to kill Jeong-hwan.

271
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,092
I've walked like this with you before.

272
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,197
You kept appearing

273
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,599
before my eyes.

274
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,437
So the two of us

275
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,073
walked like this.

276
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,330
"There are things

277
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,332
that seem like an illusion

278
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,135
because they're so far away.

279
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,338
That's the way of stars."

280
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,409
Just as it is with people
who are beyond beautiful,

281
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,146
they disappear easily.

282
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,617
I read a book because I was curious
about his true intentions.

283
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,852
That was a line in the book

284
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,056
that really captivated me.

285
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,678
I realized that now.

286
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,513
Just how beautiful

287
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,183
of a person he is.

288
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,086
And thus,

289
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,723
how distant he is from me.

290
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,528
He will disappear one day.

291
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,199
Just as it is with people

292
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,668
who are beyond beautiful.

293
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,125
Don't you know how to knock?

294
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,526
No, I don't know.

295
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,029
There aren't many doors in the world
that I have to knock before entering.

296
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,366
Wash my feet for me.
I can't because my back hurts.

297
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,002
Are you asking me to wash your feet?

298
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,539
Get me a cup of water. I'm thirsty.

299
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,709
Your room is closer
to the kitchen than mine.

300
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,747
Change the channel for me. It's boring.

301
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,315
Hey!

302
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,851
What now?

303
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,721
I'm going to sleep in this room.

304
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,090
-What?
-Why? Can't I?

305
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,727
People grow close
when they share scandalous experiences.

306
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,096
Are you really out of your mind?
Get out of my room.

307
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,098
You're always so cool-headed
about everything else.

308
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,833
Why do you act so naive
with things like this?

309
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,136
When a man and a woman
are alone together in the last hotel room

310
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,306
it's only natural for these things
to happen--

311
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,409
-Hey!
-Fine. You sleep here.

312
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,244
I'll go somewhere else.

313
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,723
Open the door.

314
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,891
I'm warning you.

315
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,961
You better open it or else.

316
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,229
I'll break it down.

317
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,998
Go ahead. It's your door, not mine.

318
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,421
Fine.

319
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,056
You won't open the door?

320
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,825
Okay, then.

321
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,027
You better lock the door
when you go to sleep.

322
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,029
You never know when I might break in.

323
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,477
Director Lim!

324
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,279
You're still here?

325
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,748
Did you leave something behind?

326
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,716
Director?

327
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,620
You really are too dumb
for anything else but physical labor.

328
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,423
Get out right now!

329
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,392
Let's go to bed. I'm sleepy.

330
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,401
Let's go to bed already.

331
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,437
Are you really crazy?

332
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,872
Let go of me.

333
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,808
Let go of me when I'm being nice.

334
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,080
Hey, let go.

335
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,653
Fine.

336
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,121
I'll give you a chance.

337
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,024
Get off me on the count of three.

338
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,660
Then I can't promise I won't injure you,

339
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,796
but I won't send you
to the threshold of death.

340
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,039
Okay then.

341
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,308
If you stop now,

342
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,910
I won't hurt you.

343
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,211
I swear.

344
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,779
I really won't hit you.

345
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,450
If you keep this up,
I'll take it to the next base.

346
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,511
One little, two little
Three little Indians

347
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,380
Four little, five little
Six little Indians

348
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,315
Seven little, eight little
Nine little Indians

349
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,096
One little, two little
Three little Indians

350
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,931
Four little, five little
Six little Indians

351
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,433
Seven little, eight little
Nine little Indians

352
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,568
Ten little Indian boys

353
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,741
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

354
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,576
Four little, five little
Six little Indians

355
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,244
Seven little, eight little
Nine little Indians

356
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,711
Make sure you exercise special care in...

357
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,585
You've done well thus far.

358
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,920
Thank you.

359
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,722
-Have a safe trip.
-Take care.

360
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,694
Are you all packed?
Can we leave right away?

361
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:57,796
Yes.

362
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,298
You drive.

363
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,200
Me?

364
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,401
Why?

365
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,069
I'm injured. My back hurts.

366
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,972
-Stop lying.
-I'm not lying.

367
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,008
I need to hurry to Seoul
and get to a hospital.

368
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,210
Don't try to deceive me.
I'm not falling for it.

369
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,812
I'm not kidding.

370
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,748
I said I was in so much pain last night

371
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,983
but you slept so well.

372
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,720
Anyway, it really hurts. Let's hurry.

373
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,893
Does it really hurt?

374
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,234
In this state,

375
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,436
he must have been in considerable pain.

376
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,939
It must have been difficult to walk.

377
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,808
You weren't faking it?

378
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,910
Didn't you just hear?

379
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,814
You could say it's a miracle
that I'm still alive, right?

380
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,550
Yes,

381
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,053
but fortunately, I'm a miracle doctor,

382
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,090
and you'll get better with acupuncture
and regular treatment.

383
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:04,963
Wait!

384
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,532
Are you going to put that in my body?

385
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,401
Yes.

386
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,637
Like so.

387
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,875
Count to three before you do that!

388
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,810
What kind of man is such a wimp?

389
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,944
Wimp?

390
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,347
Please write me a medical certificate.

391
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,016
I got injured because she kicked me
and I rolled down the hill.

392
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:30,355
Be prepared to meet my attorney tomorrow
and hear about your dark future.

393
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,090
Do you even have an attorney?

394
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,831
I have my suspicions but no evidence.

395
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,466
So answer me honestly.

396
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,700
Go ahead.

397
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,536
The pills that Joo-won takes
aren't sleeping pills, are they?

398
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,472
Are they antidepressants?

399
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,708
When did he start taking them?

400
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,577
Is it a serious condition?

401
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,413
I thought I told you earlier.

402
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,448
I can't disclose personal information--

403
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,816
Shut your mouth!

404
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,020
Since his birth, Joo-won's information
has never been personal.

405
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,523
Whatever happens to Joo-won happens
to the 30,000 employees of Loel Group.

406
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,858
You know that!

407
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,661
It's not to the point
where you should be worried.

408
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,396
-That's for me to decide.
-I'm his doctor.

409
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,631
Is that why you let everyone find out?

410
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:14,999
What are you going to do now?

411
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,637
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

412
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,172
but the CEO has been hurt.

413
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,440
What?

414
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,675
My baby Joo-won is hurt?

415
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,044
Where? How? How badly?

416
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,180
It seems he went to Jecheon
to check on the progress of the resort.

417
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,382
Then while he was hiking with Gil Ra-im...

418
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,585
What? She went there with him?

419
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,224
That wench!

420
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,565
From now on,
you really need to be careful.

421
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,901
Since you're somewhat familiar
with the course,

422
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,502
the time is ripe for mistakes.

423
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,071
You know, right?

424
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,105
It's the stage

425
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,008
where you trust your amateur skills
and get into an accident.

426
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,677
"Amateur skills"?

427
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,579
It's totally relatable, right?

428
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,483
Today's lesson is
"Always doubt your skills."

429
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,552
I'm really good at that.

430
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,821
There isn't an artist
who has released seven albums

431
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,623
and still doubts their skill
as much as me.

432
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,525
The problem is
that you only doubt yourself.

433
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,595
Isn't it time to acknowledge yourself now?

434
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,764
Geez, you've been talking
like a hater recently.

435
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,800
-Are you an intelligent hater?
-Enough of that.

436
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,803
We'll finish up with stretches,
100 PT exercises,

437
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,506
50 squats and sit-ups...

438
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,577
Never mind.

439
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,545
No sit-ups.

440
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:35,580
Why?

441
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,148
I like sit-ups the best.

442
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,717
Come hold my legs.

443
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,767
Thank you for dropping me off.

444
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,169
It's my pleasure to give my mentor a ride.

445
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,679
What is it?

446
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,381
Do you know him?

447
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,417
Ra-im, don't come inside the house.

448
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,585
Go somewhere and wait until I call you.

449
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,821
Make sure you don't come in. Got it?

450
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,828
What's the matter?

451
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:33,971
Right.

452
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,208
I knew these things would be here.

453
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,310
Why are you here...

454
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:54,959
Aren't you Oska?

455
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,094
Why are you here?

456
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,361
Please come out.

457
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,796
And just why are you here?

458
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,566
Are you seeing this thing?

459
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,835
Please come out. Why are you here?

460
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,073
How

461
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,109
did you get here?

462
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,010
What on earth is going on here?

463
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,680
You two were together?

464
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,349
What are you up to with her?

465
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,084
Aunt, you're making up stories again.

466
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,586
It's not what it looks like. Let's leave!

467
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,021
You be quiet.

468
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,289
You!

469
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,825
I heard you went to Jecheon with Joo-won.

470
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,127
Did you?

471
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,597
What exactly are you plotting?

472
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,367
You said it with your own mouth
that Joo-won is nothing to you.

473
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,503
You asked me to never allow him near you.

474
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,372
After keeping your pride,

475
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,808
how dare you make me a nosy mother.

476
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,277
If you live in poverty,
you should at least be credible.

477
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,579
How can you stab me in the back each time?

478
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,782
Aunt! Stop it! It's not her fault.

479
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,886
This isn't the place to do this.
Instead, let's go home and scold Joo-won.

480
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,128
Do you think this will work out
by scolding Joo-won?

481
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,233
How dare you let him
into this beggar's dump!

482
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,735
Are you really out of your mind?

483
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,472
You think you can do whatever you want
because Joo-won is protecting you?

484
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,673
You've got the wrong idea.

485
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,242
None of what you think happened
actually happened.

486
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,844
Then what are these doing here?

487
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,612
Do you wear them?

488
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,982
This is how you can tell
who grew up without parents.

489
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,251
Is this what your parents taught you?

490
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,221
To leech off a rich guy
if things get too tough?

491
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,789
How can you say such a thing?

492
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,925
What did

493
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,626
you just say?

494
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,695
I didn't say anything wrong.

495
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,564
You are the one
who made me curse your parents.

496
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,965
Please take it back.

497
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,134
Take it back right now!

498
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,702
How dare you raise your voice at me!

499
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,804
Kim Joo-won

500
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,940
likes me.

501
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,842
And

502
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,711
I came to like him too.

503
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,680
But I won't see him

504
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,748
ever again.

505
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,319
I don't like him so much
that I would trade

506
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,554
tarnishing my parents' memories

507
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,790
just so I can meet him.

508
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,027
He's not worth that much.

509
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,797
My dad

510
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,499
sacrificed his life

511
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,468
to save countless others.

512
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,170
He was a great man.

513
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,341
He doesn't deserve to be treated like this

514
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,142
by you people.

515
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,045
So please take back

516
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,814
what you just said.

517
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,749
Take it back!

518
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:32,883
Why should I?

519
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:36,420
I can say and do things
much worse than that!

520
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,722
Aunt, stop!

521
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,692
Let's leave. That's enough!

522
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,561
What's wrong with you? Let go of me.

523
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,463
-Let go of me!
-Stop it!

524
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,564
Let go of me!

525
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,051
"Beggar's dump"?

526
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,555
Why come to a beggar's dump?

527
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,432
Ra-im, don't cry.

528
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,471
Don't cry, Ra-im.

529
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,044
Beggar's...

530
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,100
The year-end party
for the VVIPs will be held

531
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,236
at the restaurant on your property
just like last year.

532
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,438
Fine.

533
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,548
It must be hurting a lot.

534
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,919
And you look happy because I'm hurt.

535
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,120
No way.

536
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,422
How could you say that?

537
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,960
I was going to explain,
but I have a phone call to answer.

538
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,462
Just a moment, please.

539
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,529
Stop.

540
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,433
That's A-yeong. You can talk to her here.
If you move even a step...

541
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,669
It's my mom.

542
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,972
Hello? Mom?

543
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:36,941
What?

544
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,309
Really?

545
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,179
I'll call you later, A-yeong.
I'm hanging up for us.

546
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,283
-Sir.
-So your mom's name is A-yeong?

547
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,052
That's not important right now.

548
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,989
Your mother went to Ra-im's house.
It's a complete mess.

549
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,923
What?

550
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,525
My mom went where?

551
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,231
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

552
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,332
Darn it.

553
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,034
Message me A-yeong's number.

554
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,035
Okay.

555
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,107
Gil Ra-im!

556
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,843
Gil Ra-im!

557
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:15,980
Gil Ra-im!

558
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,150
Gil Ra-im!

559
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,069
Gil Ra-im!

560
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,704
Gil Ra-im!

561
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,841
Gil Ra-im!

562
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,351
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

563
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,290
Why did you do that? Why?

564
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,927
And what did you say to her?
What did you say to her this time?

565
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,096
-Did you make her cry?
-What if I did?

566
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,133
-And what if I did?
-How could you go there?

567
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,001
You should've talked to me instead.

568
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,304
I thought it wasn't worth talking to you.

569
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,340
At least she's in her right state of mind.

570
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,576
What are you talking about?

571
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,010
You're on psychiatric medication.

572
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,879
And that's why Ji-hyeon drops in and out,

573
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,147
isn't it?

574
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,382
How could you hide that from me?

575
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,951
Do you want to see me die?

576
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,286
You should have let me know at least.

577
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,489
It's not serious enough to let you know.

578
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,790
That's what you think.

579
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,325
Do you think this is America?

580
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,928
Will people think you're normal
when you're seeing a psychiatrist?

581
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,699
If a rumor spreads about this,
how are you going to handle the situation?

582
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,801
What will you do
about your grandfather's brothers

583
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:44,935
who are after your position?

584
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,403
And what about Director Park?

585
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,739
I'll take care of it. I will.

586
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,107
So don't ever go after her

587
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,142
or call her out again.

588
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,944
That's what I want too!

589
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,813
Do you like that brat so much?

590
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,283
She says she doesn't want to see you,
that you're not worth it.

591
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,285
And you love her to death?

592
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,087
Is that what she said?

593
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,722
She said that with her own mouth?

594
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,091
-She won't see me?
-What?

595
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:10,628
Fine.

596
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,796
Do whatever you want,

597
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,965
if that's what you want.

598
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,201
Do everything you want with her.

599
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,204
What are you saying?

600
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,740
You think you're fighting with me?

601
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,875
You're fighting
against yourself right now.

602
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,844
I'm saying the choice is yours.

603
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,880
If you really love her, then go.

604
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,883
Leave your money, position, power,

605
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,619
and every other luxury
you've lived with behind!

606
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,123
If you can leave everything
and go to her, just go.

607
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,859
You think I'll approve
once she bears your child?

608
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,127
That it's a matter of time?

609
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,295
Never!

610
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,197
If you and the child return,
then I might take you two back in.

611
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,165
But

612
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,734
that tramp will never enter this house.

613
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,403
Not even after I die!

614
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,538
I'll write that it in my will.

615
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,873
So

616
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,608
if you can live off her love alone,

617
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,310
go enjoy your life.

618
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,466
Are you okay?

619
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,501
Aren't you hungry?

620
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,737
Should I make you food?

621
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,505
I'm okay.

622
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,576
Gil Ra-im, are you there?

623
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,245
-Open the door.
-The CEO must be back.

624
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,548
Don't open the door.

625
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,516
Why not?

626
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,653
You idiot.

627
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:44,989
Gil Ra-im!

628
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:48,425
Gil Ra-im!

629
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,176
Gil Ra-im. You're inside, aren't you?

630
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,946
I can hear your phone.

631
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,015
Open the door.

632
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,684
So I can apologize or beg for forgiveness.

633
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,221
Will you really be like this?

634
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,491
Let's talk, okay?

635
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,361
Gil Ra-im.

636
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:25,863
Open the door.

637
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,298
Can't you hear me?

638
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,070
Gil Ra-im.

639
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,374
Ra-im. Please come out. Let's talk.

640
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,313
I told you

641
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,682
that I would do everything and anything.

642
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,586
Waiting in front of your house
for eight hours...

643
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,055
That's nothing to me now.

644
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,760
It was really cold last night.

645
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,495
Did you know that?

646
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,101
Look at me. Please?

647
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,873
I thought about it all last night.

648
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,042
But I don't know

649
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,245
how I should apologize.

650
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,218
You don't know how?

651
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,256
Why? Because you've never apologized

652
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,358
to a beggar tramp like me?

653
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,028
Everyone in the world knows how to,

654
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,497
yet why don't you?

655
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,101
Everyone apologizes to others.

656
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,170
But why can't you?

657
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,640
I'm always sorry wherever I go.

658
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,910
But why don't you even know how?

659
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,880
You have an incredible mother.

660
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,985
After making me relive the trauma
she gave me in that grand house of hers,

661
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,988
she has now made me feel the same way
in my own home

662
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,723
at all times.

663
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,862
Now I have to relive
what happened yesterday

664
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,497
in my home

665
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,099
every waking moment I'm there.

666
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,335
I have to breathe in there,

667
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:19,970
eat in there,

668
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,539
and joke around as I relive that moment.

669
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,774
Do you understand?

670
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,178
So don't whine about being up all night.

671
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,447
Please

672
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,350
leave

673
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,119
my squalid reality.

674
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:38,922
And go back

675
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,625
to your beautiful fairy-tale

676
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:44,695
fantasy.

677
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,003
Where have you been?

678
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,605
Did you just come home?

679
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,873
Did you get the invitation?

680
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,777
Today is our VVIP party,
so come and show your face.

681
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,512
How can you talk about work?

682
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,381
If you show up,
I'll buy your concert tickets.

683
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,617
As many as there are female employees
at our department store.

684
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,521
Is Ra-im coming to the party?

685
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,890
Yoon Seul will come,

686
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,125
since she's our VVIP.

687
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,697
You and I are privileged people,

688
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,699
but why are our lives

689
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,067
so defective?

690
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:31,902
My thoughts exactly.

691
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,479
I hear the Loel Department Store
VVIP party is tonight.

692
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,348
Did you receive an invitation?

693
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,450
I did.

694
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,151
Are you going?

695
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:52,723
I should.

696
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,129
But U-yeong might be there.

697
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,531
That's why I'm going.

698
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,066
Do you

699
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,402
still like him?

700
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,439
Do you?

701
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,710
Wouldn't that

702
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,614
make me too pathetic?

703
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,149
What?

704
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,229
2010 VVIP CUSTOMER YEAR-END PARTY

705
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:39,336
"Han Gi-ju, Yoon Jae-hui, Oh Seung-a,
Jo Guk, Seo Hyeong-eun..."

706
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,672
Darn it! I'll need to work overtime again!

707
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,375
They overwork me
without even giving me a promotion!

708
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,411
You know that President Kim
is a cheapskate.

709
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,413
Don't even talk about him.

710
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,681
Just thinking about
what happened yesterday makes me...

711
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,820
Is Ra-im okay?

712
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,323
As if she would be okay.
It looked like she was up all night.

713
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,259
I wonder if she ate...

714
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,667
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

715
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,485
-Good job.
-Looks like you'll make it.

716
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,455
Thank you for everything.

717
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,247
It's me.

718
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,683
Kim Joo-won is here.
He'll be looking for me.

719
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,652
Please tell him that I'm not here.

720
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,888
Please don't ask why.
Please just do it for me.

721
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,659
Is she really not here?

722
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,661
You said you were going to help me.

723
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,730
Tell me the truth.
Did she tell you to say she's not here?

724
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,699
It's not because she told me to say that,

725
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,034
she's not here--

726
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,235
Gil Ra-im!

727
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,638
Listen to me!

728
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,640
I know you can hear me.

729
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,009
You are being a coward

730
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,544
right now.

731
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,448
If you think I'm going to stop here,

732
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,450
then you are wrong.

733
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,821
I haven't even started yet.

734
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,890
And I haven't heard your answer.

735
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,795
You know that hiding

736
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,630
won't resolve this.

737
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,267
Just throw me around

738
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,702
like you used to.

739
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,171
Just hurt me!

740
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,908
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

741
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,243
I don't know what's going on,

742
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,878
but isn't hiding like this

743
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,147
the worst solution?

744
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,817
I need to see you to do anything!

745
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,187
If you don't want to see me,
at least answer my calls!

746
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,256
He's not wrong.

747
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,959
And it won't be good
if he keeps coming here either.

748
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,695
I'm sorry.

749
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,382
Yoon Seul will come,

750
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,318
since she's our VVIP.

751
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,865
How are you?

752
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,400
Nice to see you.

753
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,507
WHERE ARE YOU?

754
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,518
Where are you?

755
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,186
Where are you?

756
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,355
Just let me know where you are.

757
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,895
Answer my calls. Please!

758
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,665
Are you really not going
to see me anymore?

759
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,134
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

760
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,776
I'm worried about you. Please call.

761
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,812
Please.

762
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,531
VVIP PARTY

763
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,285
If you had the slightest concern for me,

764
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,921
you would've checked the mirror
at least once before you came here.

765
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:01,938
Ra-im!

766
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:06,342
When did you get here?

767
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,044
Did Joo-won invite you?

768
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,412
No,

769
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,281
I came on the wrong day.

770
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,385
I'll get going.

771
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,419
Wait.

772
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:17,987
Aren't you here to see Joo-won?

773
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,722
You came all the way here, so let's go in.

774
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,291
No, next time...

775
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,128
Why are your hands so cold?

776
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,266
How long have you been standing here?
You're totally frozen!

777
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:34,237
Let's go get some hot tea at my house.
Okay? Let's go.

778
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,607
No. Not today. Wait...

779
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:39,776
Wait!

780
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,119
Are you feeling better now?

781
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,421
Yes.

782
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,591
Just ignore what my aunt said.

783
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,359
She always speaks with venom in her words.

784
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,562
Were you waiting outside the whole time?

785
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,465
Did Joo-won tell you to stay out
so he won't be ashamed?

786
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,399
No.

787
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,169
He doesn't even know I'm here.

788
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,737
Then you should've let him know.

789
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,772
-Go with me.
-No!

790
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,809
I'm not dressed for the occasion today.

791
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,210
I can fix that.

792
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,880
Go and tell him confidently,

793
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,616
"I came to see you."

794
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,217
-Wait!
-It's me.

795
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,486
Prepare the hairdresser, makeup artist,
and stylist right away.

796
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,822
She's about 166 to 167cm tall,

797
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,256
her size is about 44 and a half.

798
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,792
She has a boyish style
with long arms and legs.

799
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,127
And her waist...

800
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,864
Just straight.

801
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,134
Look forward to it.

802
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:41,037
Today, I'll be your fairy godmother.

803
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,349
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

804
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,301
This year's party is better
than last year's.

805
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,337
How would you know that?

806
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,839
I don't think you were invited last year.

807
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,441
That's right.

808
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,643
But I'm here this year.

809
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,716
He's not here yet.
He might not come at all.

810
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,353
I'm not looking for U-yeong.

811
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,623
I'm seeing how many women
are as attractive as I am.

812
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:38,127
I like to be the queen wherever I am.

813
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,115
