1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,366
I will no longer live as your son.

2
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,102
-Kim Joo-won!
-I apologize,

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,373
but since I've lived 34 years as your son,

4
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,710
I will live the rest of my life
as her husband.

5
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,247
I know you won't accept it.
I'm just letting you know.

6
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,615
With whose permission?

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,216
With whose permission?

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,485
Was this that wench's idea?

9
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,388
To elope and get married?

10
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,658
This is what happens
when you grow up without parents.

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,759
Ra-im isn't like that.

12
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,161
You weren't like this either!

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,195
No, I wasn't.

14
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,266
I know that this is difficult
for you to take in.

15
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:11,438
But I would like you to know
just how happy I am as of now.

16
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,207
All parents want their children
to be happy.

17
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,410
But what you're feeling
isn't true happiness.

18
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,711
It's infatuation.

19
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,448
A temporary obsession
with new and strange things.

20
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,350
Everyone experiences it once
in their lifetime.

21
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,421
Just as I did with your father.

22
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,725
But in the end, we are not the ones
to grow tired and leave.

23
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,262
They are. How could you not know this?

24
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:40,300
That may happen.

25
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,536
But I won't

26
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,039
let her go.

27
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,611
So I would really like for you
to be at the wedding.

28
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,847
I don't know when that will be,

29
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,016
but I will make sure

30
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,419
you are part of my wedding.

31
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,787
That will never happen.

32
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,656
You will never walk down
that aisle with her.

33
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,226
Over my dead body.

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,261
Don't even dream about it.

35
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,730
I will be going now.

36
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,017
Drink this.

37
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,454
It's difficult because of me, isn't it?

38
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,356
Especially when it's so cold out.

39
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,791
I'm sure it'll all be over soon.

40
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,661
I'm secretly rooting for you.

41
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,663
-Really?
-Since a long time ago.

42
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,965
Are you going somewhere?

43
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,367
Should I give you a ride

44
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,303
since I need to follow you anyway?

45
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,039
It is better to go in one car, right?

46
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,210
Thank you very much.

47
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,817
No matter how much I looked at the chart,
it didn't make any sense.

48
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,588
Of course these things can happen
to coma patients,

49
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,958
but what happened to you
is medically impossible.

50
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,159
I know.

51
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,731
I don't think it can ever
be medically explained.

52
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,002
I know because I've come back
from the dead.

53
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,339
And this was a miracle.

54
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,975
Miracles don't exist.

55
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,878
It's just a territory that medicine
has not uncovered yet.

56
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:10,416
You said I've visited you before, right?

57
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,753
That actually wasn't me.

58
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,625
The person you met was Joo-won.

59
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,129
-What?
-You see, Joo-won and I have been

60
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:28,101
to that unexplored territory.

61
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,879
Can you summon people like this
when you're not even the director anymore?

62
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,115
Did someone pay off your loan again?

63
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,850
This time, it wasn't me.

64
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,585
Your memory is certainly back.

65
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,390
I sent the money back
to your account ages ago.

66
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,025
Check it.

67
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,460
Today,

68
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,929
I called you to talk to you about Ra-im.

69
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,831
I don't want to talk
about my girl with you.

70
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,999
I have a favor.

71
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,236
It will be my first and last.

72
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,206
Whatever it is, just say it.

73
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,909
When it comes to Ra-im,

74
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,045
you have that right.

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,183
Normally I would say this kind of thing
over drinks,

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,852
but I've seen how you get
when you're drunk.

77
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,455
You're starting off strong.

78
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,391
We may end up
really humiliating each other.

79
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,331
I always wanted to be

80
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,835
a father, a brother,

81
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,304
and a man to Ra-im.

82
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,707
Now,

83
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,975
you must take up that role for her.

84
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,081
Be her father, brother, and man.

85
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,016
That's your job.

86
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,050
What if I don't want to?

87
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,287
I'm only going to be her man.

88
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,056
I'm good at that.

89
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,326
So you be the dad and brother.

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,295
Don't make her an orphan.

91
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,198
And that's a favor from me.

92
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,475
It's me. Are you there?

93
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,010
Yoon Seul, too?

94
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,748
Okay, I'll be right there.

95
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,419
Is it some special day?

96
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,655
Are we all going out to eat?

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,360
If you get to eat,
will you follow me wherever I go?

98
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,596
Do you think I'm a pig or something?

99
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,065
Where are we going?

100
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,800
You'll see.

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,715
Why are we here?

102
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,620
If you want to run, do it now.

103
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,989
This is your last chance.

104
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,057
What do you mean?

105
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,325
Let's go inside.

106
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,561
You're not...

107
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,631
Yes.

108
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,933
I decided I'm going to be your husband.

109
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,405
Says who?

110
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,073
I did, just now.

111
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,577
These are your final ten minutes
as an unmarried woman.

112
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,479
Any last wishes?

113
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,781
Jerk.

114
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,486
Marrying me without even telling me
that you love me.

115
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,921
Why would I say empty words like that?

116
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,291
I'm not marrying you because I love you.

117
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,525
Then what?

118
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,661
Is it something
the upper class does as charity--

119
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,296
You really aren't that bright.

120
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,567
It's not because I love you.
It's because I only love you.

121
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,972
If it isn't you, I have no other choice,
you amazing woman.

122
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,516
There won't be any flowers, candles, wine,

123
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,586
or even a ring.

124
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,961
But will you still be my wife?

125
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,407
Of course.

126
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,895
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

127
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,934
Congratulations, you two.

128
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,069
What kind of star does this
as fan service?

129
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,671
Just know that

130
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,507
you are the first fan
I've ever stood witness for,

131
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,111
and it makes me very happy.

132
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,289
MARRIAGE REGISTRY FORM

133
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,594
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

134
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,501
As for the wedding,

135
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,104
let's wait until my mom approves.

136
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,908
I really want her to be a part of it.

137
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,577
Why are you worrying about that?

138
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,080
I want your mother
to be at the wedding too.

139
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,149
Thanks.

140
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,286
But why are you writing it so slowly?

141
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,355
I did it so quickly.

142
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,157
I just need to sign it, okay?

143
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,497
HUSBAND: KIM JOO-WON
WIFE: GIL RA-IM

144
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,232
KIM JOO-WON

145
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,801
GIL RA-IM

146
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,474
You two need to sign it now.

147
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,791
OSKA, BE HAPPY!
YOON SEUL

148
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,839
Now that you have exclusive holding
over a man like me,

149
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,075
you may squeal out loud really cutely.

150
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,218
I'll go tell the world
that we are now husband and wife.

151
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,157
Let's practice.

152
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,366
How did you think of doing this?

153
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,905
I thought we should give them blessings
in the place of all those who can't.

154
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,345
I'm glad Joo-won finally got
his memory back.

155
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,682
I've learned something from them.

156
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,284
With time,

157
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,821
even bad memories
can eventually lead to happiness.

158
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,892
That's why I'm going to try and remember

159
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,228
how we fell in love, how we separated,

160
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,297
and how we met again.

161
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,067
Why don't you just forget it all
then edit it in your mind again?

162
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,202
I didn't forget it on purpose, okay?

163
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,904
It's because I'm old now.

164
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,939
Talk about rubbing salt on the wound.

165
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,710
So you have to do my music video, okay?
Before I get any older.

166
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,846
I'm going to ask for a lot of money.

167
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,016
Of course. I'll pay you a whole lot.

168
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,986
That means yes, right?

169
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,955
But why do you hug me
at every opportunity?

170
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,391
Did you date him without knowing why?

171
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,161
What are you doing at our newlywed home?

172
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,396
We were doing this.

173
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,764
You were just doing something else.

174
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,332
For an instant.
It was only for an instant.

175
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,501
Ra-im.

176
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,337
This is a wedding gift
from your fairy godmother.

177
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,773
Thank you.

178
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,342
It's so pretty.

179
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,478
Thank you, Director Yoon.

180
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,646
You're welcome. Have a spectacular night.

181
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,647
Thank you.

182
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,084
It would've been better
if we had met at 21.

183
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,586
Right?

184
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,554
Hey!

185
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,024
Want this to be your final night alive
instead of your honeymoon night?

186
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,127
I'm just saying she's too good for you.

187
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,897
Leave already. We have business to...

188
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,632
What?

189
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,067
We're going.

190
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,668
Let's go.

191
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,505
Can you go home this late at night?

192
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,273
Seriously!

193
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,143
That was embarrassing.

194
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,411
Why? We're married now.

195
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,314
-Come here.
-Don't.

196
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,151
Why?

197
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,252
Don't you remember?

198
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,555
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

199
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,723
That.

200
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:12,992
Come here.

201
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,128
Look at you.

202
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,530
Don't move.

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,135
Seriously, you...

204
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,503
Freeze.

205
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,875
Stay very still.

206
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,651
Geez.
I didn't know you had a side like this.

207
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,263
ALICE IN WONDERLAND

208
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,832
-Did you read it?
-I did,

209
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,070
but the ending to The Little Mermaid
seemed a bit different.

210
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,806
What do you mean?

211
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,252
AND THE TWO SIMPLY LIVED EVER AFTER

212
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,691
Secretary Kim,

213
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,027
this ending totally sucks.

214
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,696
That was my best.

215
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,465
Give me that.

216
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,267
What do you know about love anyway?

217
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,803
What do you know, then?

218
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,138
What was it you said

219
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,042
about The Little Mermaid being
the first fairy tale about a mistress?

220
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:57,943
It is.

221
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,245
But what about Snow White?

222
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,014
It's about an upper-class woman

223
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,616
who friend zoned seven dwarves
from the alienated class

224
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,720
until an upper-class man kisses her
and she abandons them completely.

225
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,323
And what about

226
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,559
Sleeping Beauty?

227
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,595
An upper-class woman does nothing
but sleep until it becomes a social issue

228
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,230
and she then meets an upper-class man.

229
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,502
The moral of the story being that
you'll succeed if you keep at one thing.

230
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,805
Come to think of it,

231
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,110
they were pretty princesses,
and that's why the princes fell for them.

232
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,580
How did you win me over
with a face like that?

233
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,649
Come here.
I thought you said I was pretty.

234
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,255
You said,
"Since when were you this pretty?"

235
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,492
I was flirting. I could've said anything.

236
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,660
What I really meant was when I said,

237
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,265
"Do you know how much uglier it looks
when an ugly woman cries?"

238
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,867
Stop right there.

239
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,201
Would you stop if you were me?

240
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,237
You're too short to chase me anyway.

241
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,706
You're so dead!

242
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,144
What?

243
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,912
You did what?

244
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,116
I submitted our marriage registration.
We registered our marriage.

245
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,818
I'm asking you why!

246
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,754
And your mother? What did she say?

247
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,191
Please lower your voice.
You'll frighten her.

248
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,061
Mom didn't approve.

249
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,731
So I just went ahead and did it.

250
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,499
Please say yes, Grandpa.

251
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,268
You wretched child.

252
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,671
You're badly mistaken.

253
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,406
I'm on your mother's side!

254
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,974
My daughter's side!

255
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:36,975
Grandpa!

256
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,745
Don't be like that.
They're already a married couple.

257
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,013
It's disrespectful!

258
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:45,751
I went through three arranged marriages
before I met her, you punk.

259
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,953
What makes you so special?

260
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,190
Kids these days only think
about themselves.

261
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,558
They're so selfish.

262
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,526
President Kim,

263
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,230
your mother is a poor soul.

264
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,367
With a half-sister and stepmother,

265
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,704
who else does she have but you?

266
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,675
I think you should be good to her.

267
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,911
Even if it's difficult or unfair,
bear with it.

268
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,681
It isn't like that.

269
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,917
I'm really sorry.

270
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,519
Then why did you do it?

271
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,057
Anyway, if you want my blessing,
then get your mother's first.

272
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,625
Until then, I won't approve.

273
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,310
What are you thinking about?

274
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,745
Is it because of what Grandpa said?

275
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,284
No, I was just thinking
we should've met with your mother first.

276
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,621
I feel like we were a bit too rash.

277
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,023
We'll see her soon, anyway.

278
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,058
Did you agree to meet her?

279
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,794
So she knows?

280
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,297
Hey! Why didn't you pick up your phone?

281
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,867
Hurry over to the hospital.
Your mother fainted.

282
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,236
I think she found out about your marriage.

283
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,738
Oh, no!

284
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,440
I told you we would see her soon.

285
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,477
I sent her a copy of the family register.

286
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,878
I did it.

287
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,447
What?

288
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,083
Are you all right?

289
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,587
Would I be in the hospital if I were?

290
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,889
What have you done?

291
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,393
You had to give up on me completely
in order to even negotiate.

292
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:40,098
As you saw, Kim Joo-won and Gil Ra-im
are now husband and wife.

293
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,134
Fine.

294
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,071
I lose.

295
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,708
You two have won.

296
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,677
From this point forth,

297
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,548
you are no longer my son.

298
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,386
You'll be happy for a few years.

299
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,888
Perhaps

300
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,157
for even a bit longer than that.

301
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,126
But in the end,

302
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,329
I guarantee you'll regret it.

303
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,265
Be aware of that.

304
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:48,900
I am

305
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,802
aware.

306
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,406
I'm sure

307
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,909
I'll regret it at least once.

308
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,146
But if I do, I'll just live with regret.

309
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,584
I'll share that regret with her
for the rest of our lives.

310
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,589
Fine. You do that.

311
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:15,660
You abandoned your mother,
so there is no path back for you.

312
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,031
Okay then.

313
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,401
Shall we begin

314
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,171
the negotiations?

315
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,874
My position at the department store.

316
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,410
If you tell me to leave, I will.

317
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,780
But you won't find anyone
you can trust more than me.

318
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,484
Wouldn't it be better to leave that to me
rather than give it to others?

319
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,819
Yes, it would.

320
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,054
I know that too.

321
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,023
You can stay on as president.

322
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,227
However, any shares you own

323
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,730
and anything that you didn't earn yourself

324
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,866
and received solely based on the fact
that you're my son

325
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,135
you will cough up.

326
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,206
The same goes for the resort, golf course,
and hotel.

327
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,474
All right.

328
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,342
And your house...

329
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,912
You may have built it,

330
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,415
but it's on my land. Pay me for the land.

331
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,550
Okay.

332
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,552
Go.

333
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,754
I don't wish for a stranger

334
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,256
to see me in this state.

335
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,725
Mr. Kang,

336
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,093
bring a mirror!

337
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,868
RESUME

338
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,939
SEARCH JOBS

339
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,376
HIGH-QUALIFICATION JOBS

340
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,414
Director...

341
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,551
There was once a time

342
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,788
when I was called that.

343
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,190
How does this look?

344
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,595
I went for a smiling face.
Does it impart trustworthiness?

345
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,729
In my opinion,

346
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,866
you look like a bachelor farmer
looking for a bride.

347
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,471
PRESIDENT KIM

348
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,140
It's President Kim.

349
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,509
Why is he calling me?

350
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,344
What could he want with me?

351
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,946
Why?

352
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,120
Director Park.

353
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:28,660
I know you began working with us
straight out of high school

354
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,298
and that you did whatever it took
to rise to the director position.

355
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,537
However, my position is not for you.

356
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,507
This is not because I am
the chairman's grandson.

357
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,210
It is because I am more capable than you.

358
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,145
I know.

359
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,048
But I've already

360
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,085
been axed. So why...

361
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,888
As long as you don't fight against me,

362
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,791
you are a highly capable director

363
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,961
whom I would like to depend on.

364
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,931
Believe in your own capabilities

365
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,701
and rise to the highest position,
excluding mine.

366
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,070
Also,

367
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,575
would you be willing to help me?

368
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,739
Mr. Park!

369
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,944
I heard you were reinstated.

370
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,246
Congratulations.

371
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,388
Back when I was unemployed,

372
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,323
I called you many times.

373
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,559
I was terribly busy.

374
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,494
That's why I'm here now.

375
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,097
Our deal is still in effect, right?

376
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,832
Delusion is self-served.

377
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,203
I'm the type to stay mad once I get mad.

378
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,938
Let's go.

379
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,475
Mr. Park!

380
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,177
Mr. Park!

381
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,850
Are my eyes deceiving me?

382
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,485
Did you forge an official document?

383
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,919
What is this?

384
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,490
Ra-im. Are you sure
you didn't hit your head back then?

385
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,225
It isn't like that.

386
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,259
FAMILY REGISTRY

387
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,128
I'm sure you're all disappointed,

388
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:48,166
but as you can see,
I am now a married woman.

389
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,837
I'm the adult here now,
so I won't be doing any more chores.

390
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:53,905
What the...

391
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,179
Are you saying this document is real?

392
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,383
You really went and did this
with Mr. Money-maker?

393
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,919
Did you beat him up to make him sign it
or something?

394
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,823
That's what I did regularly,
and eventually he became mine.

395
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,594
But where are all the festivities
and celebrations?

396
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,164
Is it register first, wedding later?

397
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,366
Or, are you...

398
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,102
Ra-im?

399
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,437
Jeong-hwan.

400
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,408
Director, Ra-im is totally brilliant.

401
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,976
She made it official on paper first.

402
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,611
I know.

403
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,780
Congratulations.

404
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,615
Thank you.

405
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,121
Read this. The meeting is next week.

406
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,291
Am I doing this?

407
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,128
-What's my character?
-You're the lead's stunt double.

408
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,297
Don't get hurt this time.

409
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,499
Yes, sir! I will do my best.

410
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,302
I'm going to go study the script. Bye.

411
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,011
You three, change into big bulky clothing.

412
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,982
Hey, Mr. Money-maker Joo-won.

413
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,717
What is your location?

414
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,258
I'm getting an odd vibe.

415
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:25,230
Hey, first rich guy to make it
official on paper before the wedding.

416
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:27,932
Shall we sit?

417
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,069
It must be a tradition of yours
to make a confrontation

418
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,937
out of every little thing.

419
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:36,307
You're saying it's too late now, are you?

420
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,042
You've already sealed the deal?

421
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,677
Guys.

422
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,820
Seriously, you guys...

423
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,991
Sit where? There?

424
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,437
So you registered your marriage
with Ra-im.

425
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,974
I've already spoken to Director Lim
about this.

426
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,110
But I'm the director now.
Why did you meet with him?

427
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,245
You should've met with us.

428
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,614
It looks like you didn't know,

429
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,684
but Ra-im has a lot of brothers.

430
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,388
Hey!

431
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,724
That floor isn't what you think it is.

432
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,795
Hey, first rich guy to make it
official on paper before the wedding.

433
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,498
Joo-won, who still worries
about the floor in a situation like this.

434
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,233
Listen carefully.

435
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,403
Don't ever make Ra-im cry.

436
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,773
If you do, you will die by our hands.

437
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,878
Geez.

438
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,247
Fine.

439
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,517
I'll let it go this once. But next time,

440
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,953
I'm telling on you to Ra-im.

441
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,025
TO JI-HYE,
I INVITE YOU TO MY SEVENTH ALBUM CONCERT

442
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,530
The concert is in a few days.
What are you doing?

443
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,265
I should at least hand-write
the invitations

444
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,868
for my fans who waited
without getting a refund.

445
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,637
Even though I can't sing,
they stand up for me.

446
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,505
If you have time for this,
practice singing instead.

447
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,375
Singers speak through songs,
not through letters.

448
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,777
Aren't you worried about the concert
with your skills?

449
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,979
Get in there.

450
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,315
Geez.

451
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,065
-Again.
-Again.

452
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,672
You have to draw out that note.

453
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,507
Draw it out? Okay.

454
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,379
You're not enunciating!

455
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,613
I thought I spoke clearly.

456
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,519
Are you crying? Too much emotion.

457
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,487
Hey...

458
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,589
Forget it.

459
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,895
That ad-lib was terrible. Again.

460
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,530
That was R&B style...

461
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,712
This is exhausting.

462
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,580
Let's take five minutes.

463
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,516
I'm going to lose my voice.

464
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,351
That's because you're singing
with your throat.

465
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,953
Use strength from your stomach.

466
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,688
How are you going to get back to the top?

467
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,756
Is that what you were worried about?

468
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,627
Thanks for worrying about me.

469
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,930
But I don't care
if I never reach the top again.

470
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,701
I used to love getting number one,
and singing an encore for the closing,

471
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,838
but now I'm enjoying every single moment.

472
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,508
I'm moving to a new recording studio.
You can use this one.

473
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,844
Do the music that you want to do here.

474
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,878
In return,

475
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,549
let me use you once in a while. Okay?

476
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,655
We're going to go one last time.
Get ready.

477
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,890
Punk. You don't need to get all bashful.

478
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,059
Let's do this!

479
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,905
So you enter through here...

480
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,882
-This...
-Why are you so late?

481
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,352
Say hello.
This is Kim Sin-a, our female lead.

482
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,589
It's nice to meet you.

483
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,126
Our cameras are truly versatile.

484
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,763
They must have adjusted the brightness

485
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,399
in case we go blind
from your dazzling beauty.

486
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,637
Thank you. You look much more handsome
in real life as well.

487
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,639
Yes, I know.

488
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,545
The scene here where you grab her wrist...

489
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,215
-We're going to take it out.
-Why would you take that part out?

490
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,786
A director can't edit the script
for personal reasons.

491
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,755
Hey, this is...

492
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,959
All right, let's go into rehearsal.

493
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,532
What do you think you're doing?

494
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,067
Well...

495
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,237
Pardon me, but...

496
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,840
Could I give you an autograph?

497
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,441
-What?
-You see,

498
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,610
I'm a musician.

499
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,616
If I sing an unreleased song for you,

500
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,485
can I get your phone number?

501
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,552
Look,

502
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,189
I understand,
but I'm a bit busy right now.

503
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,725
I've never used singing as an excuse
to get a phone number.

504
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,595
Until now.

505
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,432
Would it be too hard to get your number?

506
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,291
I have a shoot today.

507
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,325
Is it dangerous?

508
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,593
Of course it is.

509
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,963
So let me sleep at night,

510
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,531
will you?

511
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,337
If it's going to be like this, just quit.

512
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,743
Hey.

513
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,722
South Jeolla, Haenam, Yeongam,
South Chungcheong, Taean.

514
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,058
These are the southwest coast cities
that are being developed for tourism.

515
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:46,330
A theme park, marina, F1 race course,
golf course and more will be developed.

516
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:50,034
We believe these are the ideal conditions
for Loel to enter into this district.

517
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,103
Are there any other facilities?

518
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,539
They will also build casino hotels
and residential buildings.

519
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,210
All right.
Then let's first purchase our site.

520
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,547
Just make sure it is the closest one
to the casino hotel.

521
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:08,819
What comes after enjoying the activities,
using the hotels and casino is shopping.

522
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,656
Loel will be

523
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,358
the best luxury department store
in the southwest region.

524
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,227
Yes, sir.

525
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,330
And how many female employees
do we have in all?

526
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,633
Get me a list of everyone,
including the contract workers.

527
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,437
-Why?
-Korean wave star Oska has a concert.

528
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,817
That's after "Staring."

529
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,851
I like it right now.

530
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,186
When are the dancers arriving?

531
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,659
Please check your tickets.

532
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,681
You have to get changed now.

533
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:11,882
Okay.

534
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,777
Wait!

535
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,149
What are you doing?

536
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,485
You're not running away, are you?

537
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,622
You really are quick, old lady.

538
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,158
Why? What's the reason?

539
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,462
I don't like you.

540
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,032
I don't like you either.

541
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,101
I know. That's why I'm leaving.

542
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,603
That doesn't make any sense.

543
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,538
The dislike is mutual, so it's fair.

544
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,673
It is fair,
but we have something in common.

545
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,842
We both like Oska.

546
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,445
Did you

547
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,348
actually mean that?

548
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,617
Yes, so let me go.

549
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,853
Can't you just stay as a friend?

550
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,123
That's possible
between guys and girls too.

551
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,560
You be his lover, and I be his friend?

552
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,695
No thanks.

553
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,731
You have him.

554
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,066
And don't lose him to another woman.

555
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,906
"Constellation of Tears"
is my gift to you.

556
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,574
For me?

557
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,442
Bye, old lady.

558
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,012
Hey, Tae-seon.

559
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,649
If you ever need connections

560
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,018
anywhere and anytime in your life,
call me.

561
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,922
You're young, so you may not know,
but that moment will come.

562
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,759
I have the best academic, regional,
and familial connections.

563
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,794
You know that, right?

564
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,678
It's so cold today,

565
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,513
and tonight is
the much-talked-about finale

566
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,415
of the drama Secret Garden,

567
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,551
but all of you came here to my concert
instead of watching,

568
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,086
so I want to genuinely thank you.

569
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,922
This last song, "Constellation of Tears,"

570
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,858
was written by the new up-and-coming Sun,

571
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,762
and it is also the title track
of my seventh album.

572
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,565
SUN SAID THIS SONG IS ABOUT ME,
BUT DO I REALLY DESERVE IT?

573
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,342
I CAUSED YOU SO MUCH PAIN
BECAUSE I WAS HURT. I'M SORRY.

574
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,819
I CAUSED YOU SO MUCH PAIN
BECAUSE I WAS HURT. I'M SORRY.

575
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,465
THE ROASTED CHESTNUTS WAS ME,
BUT THE CHEESECAKE WAS SOME OTHER BITCH

576
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,034
STILL, I LOVE YOU, CHOI U-YEONG

577
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,207
After the concert,

578
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:54,511
I became the true star in Ra-im's life.

579
00:46:55,112 --> 00:47:00,250
Our lives showed just how childish
two people in love could be.

580
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,820
It was hard to believe,

581
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,789
but I was extremely talented
at acting childish.

582
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:18,902
Stop right there.

583
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,803
Don't come near me!

584
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,573
I'll get you.

585
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,223
I can ride it now.

586
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,112
Eventually, our family grew.

587
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,216
It grew by a lot.

588
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,553
I see it as the upper echelons of society

589
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,489
being a model family promoting childbirth.

590
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,934
Buy us the metal tops.

591
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,002
-Buy it for us.
-Buy it for us!

592
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,404
I said no.

593
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,772
How many do you already have?

594
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,974
Earn money and buy it yourself
if you want it so badly.

595
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:08,278
But I can't earn money right now,
so lend me some, Mom!

596
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,514
Are you trying to ask
for loans already, you runt?

597
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,950
Do you have credit? Or a co-signer?

598
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,418
How could we trust you?

599
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,121
I'm going to tell Grandma.

600
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,560
I've already been there and done that
with my parents and grandparents.

601
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,362
You'll end up shooting yourself
in the foot.

602
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,533
All of you, stop crying.

603
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,437
When we're home,
you're doing 100 PT sets, 100 sit-ups...

604
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,641
So this is what it was.

605
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,043
-What do you mean?
-A-yeong's dream.

606
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,812
It was totally dramatized.

607
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,153
Grandma!

608
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,289
My puppies, there you are.

609
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,992
-Mom.
-We're here, Mother.

610
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,228
It's cold. Let's go inside.

611
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,898
Make sure the gate is locked.

612
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:02,866
Mommy.

613
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,782
Well, I'm glad to see
that she looks healthy.

614
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,386
Mom truly stuck by her rules.

615
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,388
I thought time would solve it,

616
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,523
that she would accept us
when we had children.

617
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,758
But she never did.

618
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,594
Give me a ride.
The set location is nearby.

619
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,196
Let's go.

620
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,433
You better not come home
with your face scratched like last time.

621
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,609
Hey. Are you okay?

622
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,712
Are you okay, Nam-gil?

623
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,947
Where? Here?

624
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,419
Director Gil,
can't you see my actor is injured?

625
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:56,486
And

626
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,422
he isn't?

627
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,057
I'm fine. I can still shoot.

628
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,626
Don't argue with me. You're an actor too.

629
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,995
You're bruised all over.
Do you want this to be your last film?

630
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,465
What did you say, Director Gil?

631
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,634
You want me to fire your entire team?

632
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,169
We were just about to leave anyway.

633
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,439
I can't have my team
working on a set like this.

634
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,741
You think stuntmen are made of iron?

635
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,310
They've been working all day
but you haven't even given them lunch yet!

636
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,913
Why are you standing around?
Pack our equipment.

637
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,985
So you're a big, bad director now?

638
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,787
Hey, Director Gil!

639
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,758
No one else will take care of
your body for you.

640
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,295
That's why you have to take care of
your own body.

641
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,931
If you hide your injuries

642
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,867
you will only get worse and end up
spending more money at the hospital.

643
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,938
My husband will pay for the medical
expenses so don't worry about the bill

644
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,006
and receive all the treatment you need.

645
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,875
-That is all.
-Okay!

646
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,910
My arm...

647
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,650
Director Gil. Did you bring your team?

648
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,686
I did. Oh, Doctor,

649
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,988
my back has been hurting these days.

650
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,557
Your husband's back should be hurting,
not your back.

651
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,727
Right? But out of the two of us,
it's always my back...

652
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,432
What are you all laughing at?

653
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,108
Seul, you need to go to Deoksan right now!

654
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,434
-Hey!
-What's your problem?

655
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,504
I've been at this for 15 years, all right?

656
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,908
That man who was just whispering
in your ear

657
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,811
is my man, okay? Got that?

658
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,681
Then are you Yoon Seul?

659
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,883
So you've heard the rumors about me.

660
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,719
Oskie! Yoon Seul is here.

661
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:15,659
You're already here?

662
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:19,062
Sorry, did I come too early?

663
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,432
You wretched soul. How could you...

664
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,668
You haven't changed at all for five years!

665
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,236
Why did you come so soon?

666
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:30,807
Why? Did you want me
to catch you with that bitch in bed?

667
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,275
What on earth?

668
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:36,279
Can't you see that I'm buying time
since you came so early?

669
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,248
What?

670
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,511
What is this?

671
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,847
This is the appetizer.

672
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,843
We were together for six years,

673
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,545
separated for four,

674
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,714
then together again for five.

675
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,851
Exactly 15 years have passed.

676
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,288
During those 15 years,

677
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,857
I've sometimes been a pretty bad guy

678
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,725
and sometimes a pretty awful guy.

679
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,095
And I've always caused you a lot of pain.

680
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:01,998
But

681
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,334
I'm always going to be like that.

682
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,136
I'm not going to change.

683
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,871
I'll always be immature.

684
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,774
Therefore,

685
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:12,776
like today,

686
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,613
I'll surprise you and move you.

687
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,716
I'll make sure you have fun.

688
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:26,890
You have been the best number one hit song

689
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,493
on the Billboard chart of my life
for 15 years, Yoon Seul.

690
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,295
It's about time

691
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,497
we live together.

692
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,535
Let's live together.

693
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,041
There comes a magical moment for everyone.

694
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,614
That moment can be
when a love is fulfilled...

695
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,090
What's that?

696
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,793
Did you see something shining there?

697
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:05,762
Really?

698
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,697
I wonder what it is.

699
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,532
Hold on.

700
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,980
How did this get all the way here?

701
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,849
Why? What is it?

702
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,486
This is a letter I wrote to you
when I was on Jeju Island.

703
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,354
Don't lie!

704
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,556
Look!

705
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,293
It really is!

706
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,529
How did this happen?

707
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,131
This is so amazing.

708
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,434
I bet I'm the only girl
who has ever received a letter like this.

709
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,169
Thank you!

710
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,644
It can also be when a love
is strengthened...

711
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,490
Isn't that Son Ye-jin?

712
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,130
Sorry. No photos, please.

713
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:22,772
I thought I was meeting
the casting director.

714
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,841
You're right.

715
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,678
Today, I'm the casting director.

716
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,848
What do you mean?

717
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,956
I saw your script.

718
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:41,958
Ironically,

719
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,527
it was after a meeting
in the office of a company

720
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,162
that we almost decided to shoot with.

721
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,267
I heard it's about to be abandoned

722
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,403
because of casting and funding issues.

723
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:58,475
Yes, it's been that way
for half a year now.

724
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:00,977
So?

725
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,480
So...

726
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,049
What do you think of me?

727
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,384
What?

728
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,222
Why? Do you not like me?

729
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,960
Did you want to film with Angelina Jolie
or something?

730
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,429
Wait.

731
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,664
So what you mean is...

732
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,503
You seem surprised.
I must've been too direct.

733
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,938
All right, then you can go step-by-step.

734
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,409
Manager first, then the department head,
then the CEO, and then me.

735
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,880
Give us a call.
I'll be memorizing the lines while I wait.

736
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,286
I'm sitting face-to-face with a miracle.

737
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:47,123
I've been sitting here for a while.

738
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:55,865
Or perhaps when a long-time dream
is about to come true.

739
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:33,570
Mommy!

740
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,342
We're not asleep yet.

741
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,177
Wake up.

742
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,879
Hey! Why are you waking him up?

743
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,014
Want your fifth vertebrae
to be your sixth?

744
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,083
I'm going to sleep with Mommy today.

745
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,319
Says who? I'm going to.

746
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,555
Mommy, I don't like Daddy.

747
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:53,923
I don't like you.

748
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,459
-Go to sleep already.
-Mommy!

749
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:57,694
Go to sleep!

750
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:03,967
Hurry and go to bed.

751
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,402
Mommy!

752
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,204
Sleep already.

753
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:10,907
Lie down.

754
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,242
Mommy!

755
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,182
Aren't I heavy?

756
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,184
You are.

757
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,353
Then I want to get down.

758
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,790
Not for free. One kiss will do the trick.

759
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,203
I wish it would snow.

760
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,741
Snow on a night when the moon
is so bright and clear?

761
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,577
I guess so.

762
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,652
We still don't have any wedding photos.

763
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:35,058
But every day is full of loving
and being loved,

764
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,860
and every day is magical.

765
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,064
In a way,

766
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,401
to love is like tending a garden.

767
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:50,139
I pray that in your gardens,
beautiful flowers bloom,

768
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,276
cool breezes pass through,

769
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,612
brilliant sunlight shines down,

770
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:02,218
and at times, magical rain comes down.

771
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,826
It's snowing.

772
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,462
It really is.

773
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,317
But are you really not going to tell me?

774
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,719
What?

775
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,489
The thing you said to my dad.

776
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:43,493
You said you came to tell me,
but you couldn't.

777
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:47,463
That?

778
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,956
Dad...

779
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,134
Dad...

780
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,738
Dad...

781
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,275
Dad...

782
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:34,877
Dad...

783
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,979
Dad...

784
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,321
Dad...

785
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,975
I'm sorry...

786
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:43,946
I'm sorry.

787
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,985
I'm sorry.

788
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,357
I'm sorry.

789
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,177
