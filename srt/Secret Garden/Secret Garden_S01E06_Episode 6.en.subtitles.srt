1
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,163
What? What happened?

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,672
What is it? What happened?

3
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:40,907
-Hey!
-No!

4
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,143
Don't come near me!

5
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,779
-Don't come near!
-What's wrong?

6
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,781
Why are you acting so crazy?

7
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,250
Did you have a bad dream?
Did your stocks plummet?

8
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,585
What's wrong with me?

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,521
What's going on here?

10
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,491
Why? Did you lose something?

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,726
Where did I go?

12
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,494
I was definitely here until yesterday.

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,163
Where am I right now?

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,600
This isn't right. I didn't have these.

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,102
Poor young lady.

16
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,970
Let's go.

17
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,506
-I think she's crazy.
-Maybe she's still drunk.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,042
This is insane.

19
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,877
What is going on?

20
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,885
Gil Ra-im?

21
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,496
Did I turn into Ra-im?

22
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,901
Geez.

23
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,840
Excuse me, you have to pay...

24
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,078
Why are you taking our shoes?

25
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,991
What is going on?

26
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,636
What happened? Open the door.

27
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,271
Open up!

28
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,806
No!

29
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,977
What do I do?

30
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,980
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong? Are you sick?

31
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,588
Did I do something to you... In my sleep?

32
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,226
MY HUSBAND
MY HONEY

33
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,428
-It isn't him?
-Who are you?

34
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,763
SEXY OSKA

35
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,142
-Where's Oska?
-Go away!

36
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,410
Tell us!

37
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,419
Gil Ra-im!

38
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,556
Open the door!

39
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,291
Gil Ra-im!

40
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,228
Gil Ra-im!

41
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,217
No way.

42
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,753
How could this happen?

43
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,455
When did this happen?

44
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,792
I woke up like this.

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,928
What did you do to me?

46
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,464
You're saying I caused this?

47
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,932
How could I?

48
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,968
You blame everything on me.

49
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,837
-You think this makes sense?
-I know it doesn't,

50
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,107
-but how did this happen?
-How should I know?

51
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,408
Lower your voice.

52
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,878
Let's go in first. Open the door.

53
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,715
I don't have the key.

54
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,049
I returned it last night.

55
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,185
You returned it? Why?

56
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,987
Didn't you sleep here?

57
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,289
That's why I'm dressed like that.

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,725
This is crazy.

59
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,463
We need to go somewhere private.

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,598
I'll meet you in the lobby.

61
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,600
We're not going together?

62
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,902
Are you crazy? This is my hotel.

63
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,006
I can't let anyone see us like this.

64
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,141
You think everything's yours.

65
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,310
Yeah, because it is.

66
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,780
Give this to me and walk
as if you're meditating.

67
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,715
Tuck in your chin and look down.

68
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,152
Act natural, like you're
on a morning walk, okay?

69
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,954
I wonder how she became a director
at that age?

70
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,428
She's not going to cast me anyway.
I should've beaten her half to death.

71
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,532
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,901
You look even stranger if you do that.

73
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,370
And what are you doing here?

74
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,473
Why are you dressed like that?

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,208
What did you just say?

76
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,381
You can't talk like that to the director.

77
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,551
I'm sorry, sir.

78
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,854
I scolded her a bit, and I think...

79
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,590
it upset her.

80
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,992
Apologize.

81
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,328
He just came out of nowhere.

82
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:10,002
Ra-im! Did you forget who you are?

83
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,605
All right. Let's just go.

84
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,440
Sort this out.

85
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,009
This won't do. Come with me.

86
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,680
Director Lim, please.

87
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,852
What I mean is,

88
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,154
-why don't we--
-You stay out of this!

89
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,323
It's none of your business.

90
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,961
What are you waiting for?
Aren't you going to stop him?

91
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,329
Are you letting me go with him?

92
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,603
Let go of that hand!

93
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,307
What did you just say?

94
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,778
I told you to let go.

95
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,313
I told you she's under our care
for the time--

96
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,548
And I told you

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,351
-that she's my family.
-I know.

98
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,686
And I'm always grateful for that.

99
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,355
-What?
-But

100
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,223
please let her go for now.

101
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,893
I'll make sure she makes it
to the shooting.

102
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,031
Now, be polite.

103
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,267
Let's go.

104
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,851
How dare you make me bow?

105
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,687
I don't even bow like that
to the chairman.

106
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,824
-It's my head, not yours.
-True,

107
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,926
but while my soul is inside of you,

108
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,929
your head is my head
and my head is also my head. You got that?

109
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,833
Where are you going?
Just talk here. There's no one here.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,568
Where are you going?

111
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,904
-Did you drink a lot of water last night?
-What?

112
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,241
I can't hold it in.

113
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,548
You're not...

114
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,622
Geez.

115
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,444
Are you okay?

116
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,949
Just think of it as...

117
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,998
Stop putting your head down like that.
Everyone is staring at us.

118
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,402
Don't!

119
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,740
Don't eat anything
or drink anything, okay?

120
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,212
Seriously.

121
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,286
Stop that.
You better not cry with my face.

122
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,521
How can I not?

123
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,392
What have I done to deserve this?
Why is this happening to me?

124
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,328
Why didn't you switch with Kim Tae-hee
or Jeon Do-yeon?

125
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,130
Think of something!

126
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,633
I'm trying, but I can't think of anything
with this head.

127
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,604
What's your IQ? Is it even three digits?

128
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,272
My punching speed is.

129
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,874
You want to find out?

130
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,342
Look, woman!

131
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,983
We need to think if this is a scientific
or medical matter.

132
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,384
Let's not fight.

133
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,055
Why does this keep coming down?

134
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,692
Tighten the buckle on the strap.

135
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,394
Where?

136
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,998
-I'm just going to take it off.
-Are you crazy? Come here.

137
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,336
-What is he doing?
-What is he doing?

138
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,139
-What are they doing in public?
-He's weird.

139
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,779
Not here. Let's go outside.

140
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,507
I really don't think this is a scientific
or medical matter.

141
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,975
Did you just figure that out?

142
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,746
Stop being sarcastic.
This concerns the both of us, okay?

143
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,548
I haven't done any wrongdoings.
I don't deserve this.

144
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,650
Neither do I.

145
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,852
You wish.

146
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,587
-Hey!
-Whatever.

147
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,455
Doesn't anything come to your mind?

148
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,592
In the movies,
you're usually struck by lightning,

149
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,460
or you incant some weird spell together.

150
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,696
Or you come across some rare gem.

151
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,764
Right?

152
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,566
The sky was clear, there were no spells,

153
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,502
and I already have lots of rare gems.

154
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,703
I'm sure.

155
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,107
Let's try the medical approach,

156
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,909
and go to the hospital.

157
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,811
Hospital? Which hospital?

158
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,615
If you go in saying,
"Our souls have been switched,"

159
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,117
do you think they'll say

160
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,753
"Oh, it must be the season.
Please check in and wait?"

161
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,790
Should we try a fortune teller,

162
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,125
and get exorcized? That might work.

163
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,262
Are you crazy? If rumor gets out
that I had an exorcism,

164
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,565
-my stocks would plummet.
-Then how about a church or a temple?

165
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,967
They'd both just ask for offerings.

166
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,803
Then let's jump off from somewhere.

167
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,540
-Maybe the trauma--
-That suggestion gives me trauma.

168
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,341
-Then what about a kiss?
-What?

169
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,510
It always happens in fairy tales.

170
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,247
You may only know
of The Little Mermaid, but...

171
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,017
Beauty and the Beast,
Princess and the Frog,

172
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,019
They all return to human beings
after a kiss.

173
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,856
None of this makes sense anyway,
so let's try a nonsensical method.

174
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,559
Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?

175
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,161
-Do you have any other ideas?
-No.

176
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,964
Fine, let's make this clear.

177
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,800
A quick peck or a deep one?

178
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,471
We'll find out. Close your eyes.

179
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,137
What do we do?

180
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,372
It has no effect.

181
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,474
It was too quick.

182
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,910
Don't move.

183
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,197
SECRET GARDEN

184
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,264
I'm really sorry, Joo-won.

185
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,402
But I had to save my daughter
even if this was the only way.

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,271
I hope...

187
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,976
you can forgive this unworthy father.

188
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,361
Tell me the truth.

189
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,797
You just wanted to kiss me, didn't you?

190
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,200
You're out of your mind.

191
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,336
You rejected every other idea.
We had to try something.

192
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,572
-We can't stay like this.
-If we do,

193
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,309
I would want to die,
but it's not so bad for you, isn't it?

194
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,747
-Do you really think that way?
-Yes.

195
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,649
Me, too.

196
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,786
Now that things have come to this pass,
I'll enjoy my life as a rich man.

197
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,690
But you have to be the poor,
alienated neighbor.

198
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,594
How could you laugh right now?

199
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,763
Because it really isn't so bad for me.

200
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
When's your birthday?

201
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,568
-Why?
-I need your pin number.

202
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,038
-You must have lots of money in the bank.
-Hey!

203
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,441
I'll buy a car for everyone
at the action school,

204
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,510
and produce an action movie.

205
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,912
I should buy A-yeong an apartment.

206
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,651
And get you married
to a woman you would hate.

207
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,920
-What? Married?
-Yes.

208
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,258
Wait, stay still.

209
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,160
What are you doing?

210
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,730
Seriously, what are you doing?

211
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,567
I'm just fascinated.

212
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,171
So, this is how I look...

213
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,306
What the heck?

214
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,843
I'm barely managing to hold back
saying that I'm so handsome.

215
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,245
I'm straightforward with things like this.

216
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,916
I look like a model just sitting there.

217
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,918
But you don't see me going on about it.

218
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,988
My personality is as straight as a razor.

219
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,723
I'm sure it is.

220
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,492
You got a text message!

221
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,597
Hey, where's my cell phone?

222
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,601
It tickles.

223
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,506
Stop it.

224
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,711
Don't feel me up.

225
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,947
What's wrong with me touching my own body?

226
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,953
My team's already out on location.

227
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,490
-Let's go to the shoot first.
-What shoot?

228
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,760
-Why would I go there?
-Because you're me now!

229
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,862
I'll get fired if I don't.

230
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,398
-Then get fired.
-Are you serious?

231
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,266
Fine.

232
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,604
I'm going to meet Yoon Seul,
or whoever she is, and tell her this.

233
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,239
Tell her what?

234
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,612
"Did you know?
I was just playing hard to get."

235
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,281
-What?
-"I think I must be

236
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,183
under your spell,

237
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,154
ever since our first magical meeting."

238
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,123
Sounds awesome, right?

239
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,226
Hey, are you insane? Stop right there.

240
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,664
Why are your legs so short? Fine, I'll go.

241
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,001
-Lead the way.
-What?

242
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,037
Aren't you going to change?
I can't go dressed like that.

243
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,807
Right.

244
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,710
My clothes. Where are my clothes?

245
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,379
-And my bag?
-How should I know that?

246
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,214
Do you think

247
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:08,921
I had the mind to think to pack your stuff
while I turned into a woman?

248
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,556
I can't believe this.

249
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,258
Go bring it, now!

250
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,696
If you keep acting like this,
you'll be in the news again.

251
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,965
Aren't you tired of reading
about how you refused to film?

252
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,467
It's been a while, so it's okay.

253
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,634
You little...

254
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,104
You shouldn't be like this.

255
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,372
How much longer do you think
you'll be Oska, the star of Asia?

256
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,176
Your status is falling already.
You'll be forgotten if this album fails.

257
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,712
You're not a star
who has control over shoots anymore.

258
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,415
You are a washed-up star now!

259
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,919
Are you the one who writes hate comments
on my articles?

260
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,188
-Hey!
-Leave, then. I'm sleepy.

261
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,194
I wasn't going to say this, but...

262
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,730
Hey.

263
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,673
I know you missed Seul.

264
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,911
You think I don't know you? Or her?

265
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,646
Why are you two pretending?

266
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,484
Either get back together,
or be professional and get this over with.

267
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,621
You're being too cowardly as a man.

268
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,361
There you go! Get dressed.
Let's get going.

269
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,465
You do know us.

270
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,868
But there's one thing
you don't know about me.

271
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,676
I don't have the courage.

272
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,612
The courage to ask her to start again,

273
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:45,184
or to pretend like I'm fine
in front of her.

274
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,454
And now you call me a real coward?

275
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,158
Don't forget you're past your prime.

276
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,229
So get up already! Damn!

277
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,246
I'm really sorry.

278
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,481
It was her first time in the sauna.

279
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,318
Hey, stop bowing with my head.

280
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,487
I told you, your head is my head,
my head is--

281
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,125
What's the total?
She ate a lot last night, didn't she?

282
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,195
-Give me the key so I can ring you up.
-Yes.

283
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,232
-Give me your foot.
-What?

284
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,171
What is that? I've been walking
around like that this whole time?

285
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,011
Seaweed soup, sweet rice drink,
fried fish stick and five eggs.

286
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,513
You ate all of this?

287
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,549
Did you throw a party?

288
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,086
-How much is the total?
-16,500 won.

289
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,722
-And return the clothes.
-Yes. One moment, please.

290
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,859
Good morning.

291
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,262
Where's my wallet?

292
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,645
Aren't you going to change?
We need to wash them soon!

293
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,116
Was the change room this way?

294
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,452
-Wait.
-You can't. No way.

295
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,655
I have to return the clothes.

296
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,891
How much for the clothes?
Sell them to me, please.

297
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,192
This man...

298
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,964
I mean, this lady can't change right now.

299
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,233
I'll pay double the price.

300
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,436
Why won't you let me change?
She has to wash them.

301
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,271
You'll see my body. There's no way.

302
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,073
Then I'll look at someone else's body.

303
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,342
Wait!

304
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,577
Sell them to me.

305
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,250
I would be more embarrassed
to walk around like this.

306
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,053
But it's not my face, so...

307
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,291
-Where are you touching?
-Who's touching?

308
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,561
I'm itchy all over.

309
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,665
When did you last wash?
Did you go to the sauna to eat?

310
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,200
Sir!

311
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,603
-What?
-Excuse me?

312
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,409
I'm here, Mr. Kim.

313
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,212
-Are you alright?
-Excuse me?

314
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,517
What? Why?

315
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,419
Wow.

316
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,291
I just came to tell you

317
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,361
that the film crew shooting
Romantic Trip with Oska

318
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,995
has changed their schedule.

319
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,330
-What?
-What?

320
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,266
They love that the winner is a stuntwoman.

321
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:54,573
They want to change the concept
into the behind-the-scenes footage.

322
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,310
That's not up to them.
Cancel those plans right now.

323
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,949
That's what you're thinking,
right, Joo-won?

324
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,018
Right.

325
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,154
Cancel it right now.

326
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,690
But they're already here.

327
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,492
Over there.

328
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,597
Romantic Trip with Oska.
It's all thanks to my popularity.

329
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,869
What kind of stupid schedule is this?

330
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,305
Are you alright, Ra-im? Are you hurt?

331
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,041
We ran into some trouble in the mountains.

332
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,178
I'm so glad you're alright.

333
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,950
Are you kidding? Get off me.

334
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,455
-Ra-im...
-Are you on drugs?

335
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,856
Who are you calling Ra-im...

336
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,460
That would be me.

337
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,829
Where was your arm?

338
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,231
Here, right?

339
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,934
Hug, on three?

340
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,304
-Did something happen?
-Yes.

341
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,575
But it's a long story.
Anyway, I apologize.

342
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,279
-What's with you now? Still drunk?
-Sorry?

343
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,451
Yes, a bit. Sorry.

344
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,292
Okay, sure.

345
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,360
You're okay, right?

346
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,498
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to change?

347
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,238
This is bad.
Oska thinks I'm a weird woman now.

348
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,940
He always thought that way.

349
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,443
Wear this.

350
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,046
Don't roll up your sleeves
because it'll stretch,

351
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,348
and don't put anything in the pockets
or it'll ruin the style.

352
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,616
Don't just sit anywhere

353
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,819
and don't get anything on it
or I'll get revenge.

354
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,421
Geez.

355
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,989
Forget it.

356
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,593
I won't go either, then.

357
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,295
-I'm going to shower.
-You're going to do what?

358
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,766
-Are you not going to shower?
-Wait!

359
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,837
I'll wash you. It's my body.

360
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:10,275
So you want us to look
at your body together?

361
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,710
Pervert.

362
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,614
Let's just wash our faces.
We might be ourselves by tomorrow.

363
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,484
Let's just shave and wash our faces.

364
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,328
After applying the shaving cream,

365
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,901
you take the razor...

366
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,839
I'm fine. I shave every other day too.

367
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,874
Every other day?

368
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,477
Where?

369
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,549
Here.

370
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,219
You'd better close your eyes!
Close them tight.

371
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,821
Don't even think of peeking
or you're dead meat.

372
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,557
I'm closing them, aren't I?

373
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:06,064
Darn it. Why is this so hard?

374
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,834
Forget it. I'm not wearing this.

375
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,772
I bet you've taken off plenty
in your life. Don't play coy.

376
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:15,974
Did I say anything?

377
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,210
Why is it so much harder to put on
than take off?

378
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,211
Are you proud of yourself?

379
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,381
Watch.

380
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,586
You clasp it from the front.
Then, turn it.

381
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,022
Then put your arms through.

382
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,892
Like this. Got it?

383
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,199
Try it.

384
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,604
But what is this?

385
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,039
How do you not even have decent lingerie?

386
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,942
As long as it's clean, who cares?

387
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,677
Just put it on already.

388
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,921
I'm a bit disappointed.

389
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:09,227
Don't you think it's a bit too monotonous?

390
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,598
The way you won the bid was so thrilling
that made me expect something new.

391
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,734
But there's nothing new.

392
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,238
I feel the same way.
Directors always want something new,

393
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,642
but it's always bats, pipes
and wooden planks

394
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,779
in the same old locations like
a nightclub, car yard or warehouse.

395
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,749
Detectives always fight 17 on 1
against thugs.

396
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,184
The same old group of high school kids
fighting each other.

397
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,454
And the police always turn up
after the fight.

398
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,424
Maybe we should rewrite the script first.

399
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,961
Where's the assistant director?
What about the main character?

400
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,163
Sorry, there he is.

401
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,538
We're running late, so let's begin.

402
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,207
Say hello. This is the stunt director.

403
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,542
I met him yesterday.

404
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,246
I saw the script.
Do I really have to be here?

405
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,748
Use a double and shoot my close-up later.

406
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,919
-Call me when it's my close-up.
-Hey.

407
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,854
Choi U-yeong!

408
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,893
Leave him.
I was planning to do it that way, anyway.

409
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,163
That puts more weight on you,
Director Lim.

410
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,398
Get the costumes ready.

411
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,138
What's wrong with U-yeong?

412
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,278
-He's trying not to be a coward.
-What?

413
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,082
If U-yeong had one true love,

414
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,653
that would only be for one person.

415
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,694
Hey.

416
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,430
Who is it?

417
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,998
-Oh my goodness!
-Oska!

418
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,102
It's been so long! How have you been?

419
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,172
-What are you doing here?
-Don't be shy.

420
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,675
I heard you recommended me.

421
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:41,246
I heard that you said I had to be
the female lead.

422
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,082
-I said that?
-Oh no!

423
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,986
You were trying to surprise me,
but I found out about it too early.

424
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,156
It's okay! I know how you feel.

425
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,126
But the thing is...

426
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,929
I got sick on the plane.

427
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,205
Is she the director?

428
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,807
She's really young.

429
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,075
I don't like female directors.

430
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,880
-A director?
-That's what I heard.

431
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,250
I saw her picture, and she's pretty.

432
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,085
Joo-won likes her, too.

433
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,622
-You came all the way to--
-You think I have that much free time?

434
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,126
Let me ask you something.
Just answer what you know.

435
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,930
You're the only one I could ask
without rumors spreading.

436
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,166
-Are you ill--
-I'll ask the questions.

437
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,803
I know it's a common symptom
among Korean women,

438
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,606
but everyone's different.

439
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,010
Until what age can a woman bear a child?

440
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,779
-Pardon?
-You don't know?

441
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,116
Your family has many uses
for a psychiatrist, don't you?

442
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,854
I've heard it was possible
even into your 60s in other countries.

443
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,123
And as for Korea,
I've heard up to the early 50s.

444
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,394
Is that so?
Then what do you think, as a doctor?

445
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,064
Is it possible to have a son at 56?

446
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,399
She looks a bit older than she is.

447
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,937
My opinion as a doctor is,
won't that be up to fate?

448
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,505
What?

449
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,774
-If you're done speaking--
-Stay.

450
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,311
I hear you've been visiting
Joo-won frequently. Is that true?

451
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,013
What's the reason?

452
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,850
He's been having trouble sleeping lately.

453
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,652
Why does he call you for that?

454
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,821
Does he want you to sleep with him?

455
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,491
I visited as his psychiatrist.

456
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,926
That is all.

457
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,562
Is he on drugs? Like sleeping pills?

458
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:42,066
I'm sorry, but I can't disclose
a patient's personal information.

459
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,536
I always hated that about you.

460
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,951
How is my pulse, Doctor?

461
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,321
-Pretty.
-Pretty?

462
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,657
That's weird.

463
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,794
I have no appetite lately, I can't sleep,

464
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,330
I break into cold sweats, and I get dizzy.

465
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,332
Is there anything wrong?

466
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,266
There is.

467
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,535
There is?

468
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,171
What is it?

469
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,941
-Your stomach.
-What?

470
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,344
Seeing your father with his new wife
makes your stomach hurt, right?

471
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,781
You really are a great doctor.

472
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,185
I heard my father stopped by.

473
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,621
You didn't prescribe him anything
for bearing a son,

474
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,358
-did you?
-I did. Why?

475
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,127
Goodness. Doctor!

476
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,799
Did you find out anything?

477
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,368
Father got medication to have a son.

478
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,105
But he's not meant to have a son.

479
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,908
Look. We're all daughters.

480
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,411
You know Father.
We have to take all kinds of measures.

481
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,046
Then, Doctor.

482
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,318
Do you have something
that will make the skin milk-colored?

483
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,054
Like chocolate milk or banana milk.

484
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,292
Making your skin dark and yellow.
And making you gain weight.

485
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,727
Anyway,

486
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:19,630
Do you have any medicine
that will wither even a spring flower

487
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,832
in bloom?

488
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,902
Your stepmother's beauty won't wither
that easily. Go now, I'm busy.

489
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,271
You really prescribed him something?

490
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,708
For who? Father or Ms. Park?

491
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,582
What's the speed?

492
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,318
Forty. I think forty will do.

493
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,552
Good.

494
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,423
Even if the car gets overturned,
wait for the cut signal.

495
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,391
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

496
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,325
Let's get ready.

497
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,731
-Are you looking for Ra-im?
-No.

498
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,833
You were too harsh on her.

499
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,069
She came all the way to Jeju Island
to do a car stunt.

500
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,072
I wondered if she gave up
and just jumped in the water.

501
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,874
Here she comes.

502
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,919
She really wanted to come and watch.

503
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:20,691
Yeah, I'll watch. Is that okay?

504
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,894
Why are you showing up now
when you said you wanted to assist?

505
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:27,065
What're you going to do with that mindset?
Is this how you're asking me for a chance?

506
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,534
I'm sorry.

507
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,370
-Something came up--
-Why are you sorry?

508
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,573
What is the reason that is
making you apologize on her behalf?

509
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,779
I get what you're saying.
Let's talk about it over a cigarette.

510
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,483
Do you smoke now?

511
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,286
Oh, right. I don't smoke.

512
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,689
Then have a coffee instead. Let's go.

513
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,933
That's not good. What should I do?

514
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,070
-Let me borrow that!
-Hey!

515
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,506
I need that for the shoot!

516
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,553
-So--
-Me first.

517
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,657
I know you were upset.

518
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,629
So believe it or not,
I was going to give you a chance.

519
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,132
I was going to let you do the car stunt.

520
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,734
I know how badly you wanted it,

521
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:41,606
and at least, it's within my power.

522
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,077
But you just ruined that chance.

523
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:50,915
You came for the getaway, right?
Just enjoy that.

524
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,553
Director Lim.

525
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,225
You've just been caught.

526
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,860
Caught?

527
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,830
You have feelings for me.

528
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,905
But you haven't confessed yet.

529
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,434
It's time to film. I have to go.

530
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,169
Don't come to the set.

531
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,414
What were you two talking about?

532
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,984
Why did he look like that?
What did you say to him?

533
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,888
Who told you to do that to my face?

534
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,525
I'm going to the hotel to get some rest,
so hurry back.

535
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,093
We still have to come up with a solution.

536
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,865
What did you two talk about?

537
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,736
-Is the car ready?
-Yes. It's ready to go.

538
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,304
Let's let her roll.

539
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,607
The angle...

540
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,942
Here, have some coffee.

541
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,111
Thank you.

542
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,680
-You, too.
-You didn't have to...

543
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,649
I know you don't like coffee,

544
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,952
-so I got you a healthy juice.
-Why thank you.

545
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,822
Why are you being like this?
Just act normal...

546
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,758
I am a rookie, remember?

547
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,560
What are you doing here?

548
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:45,896
Hello.

549
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,266
You really are sick, aren't you?

550
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,735
You are. You're very sick.
Let me check if you have a fever.

551
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,038
I'm fine.

552
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,285
What the?

553
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,461
All right, quiet! Cameras are rolling.

554
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,430
Cameras are rolling! Quiet!

555
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,678
Stop!

556
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,848
Stop the car!

557
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,285
Stop!

558
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,368
-Don't go.
-Don't do this.

559
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,370
Don't go. I said don't go!

560
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,571
Cut.

561
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,375
We'll do those lines again.

562
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,745
How many times is this? I was so focused.

563
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,080
How annoying.

564
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,020
Ready. Action!

565
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,761
Don't go.

566
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,430
-Don't do this.
-Don't go! I said don't go!

567
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:27,665
Cut.

568
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:38,609
The script says to look indifferent
but hurt, not teary-eyed.

569
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,112
Have you never been hurt?

570
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,481
Is it because you usually hurt others?

571
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,450
What's her problem?

572
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,354
Your character just got dumped.

573
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,790
Haven't you ever wanted
to die because of love?

574
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,393
I haven't.

575
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,296
-You haven't?
-I said I haven't.

576
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,800
Then I'll fill you in.

577
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,303
You are not being able to eat or sleep.

578
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,239
It feels like hell to fall asleep
and wake up.

579
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,143
You can't understand how you go
from being in love to being strangers.

580
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,113
You can't tell anyone,
in case they speak ill of your love.

581
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,082
So you cry alone.

582
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,791
You know that it's all over
and you've broken up.

583
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,127
But all you have are memories
of being in love.

584
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:35,433
You don't realize that it just adds up
more days for you to erase.

585
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:41,672
So when you get dumped,
you just can't escape from the breakup.

586
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,409
But what hurts the most is that

587
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,613
the other person doesn't even care
about you.

588
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,383
It's only me that's hurt.

589
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,920
That person has forgotten all about me
and looks so happy.

590
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,791
I just want to die, but I can't.

591
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,932
Because I won't ever be able
to see him again.

592
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,812
That's how it feels

593
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,082
when you break up.

594
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,788
Do you get why you are stopping her now?

595
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,957
How you should feel

596
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,925
and how desperate you should be?

597
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,228
Do you get it?

598
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,302
Hey!

599
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,004
-What are you doing?
-I quit!

600
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,006
-Hey!
-Isn't this what you wanted?

601
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,207
Start the car.

602
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,077
If news gets out on this...

603
00:41:54,445 --> 00:42:00,651
Oska!

604
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,530
This isn't right, you punk.

605
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,665
You're the one who ran away to Jeju
in the first place.

606
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,102
Without Seul,
you would have no music video to promote.

607
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,471
Let's turn around and go back.

608
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,281
You do, and I'll kill you.

609
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,716
I don't believe this!

610
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,132
Just wondering if you're okay.

611
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,571
This happens all the time on set.

612
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,608
There's nothing personal going on
between us,

613
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,611
so please don't misunderstand.

614
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,081
I was just worried about you.

615
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,984
I could tell.

616
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,954
You were telling your story.

617
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,193
I'm sorry about not telling you

618
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,496
that I know Choi U-yeong
during our blind date.

619
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,334
If that upset you...

620
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,237
You two had a blind date?

621
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:30,040
-Excuse me?
-Wait, Choi U-yeong?

622
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,944
So, the man in your story...

623
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,580
Didn't you already know?

624
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:41,518
No, I just thought everyone had
that kind of experience, so...

625
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,089
But it really was Oska?

626
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,291
-The name's Gil Ra-im, right?
-What?

627
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,993
The girl who gave me trouble.

628
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,796
The one who dates U-yeong
and eats with you.

629
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,867
I didn't ask about her at all, did I?

630
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,305
Then let's end this now.

631
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:06,010
As you've heard, I'm done practicing love,
and it's all over now.

632
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,580
So you should wrap it up soon,

633
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,448
and come to me.

634
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,660
They really do think differently from us.

635
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,435
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
What took you so long?

636
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,003
What were you doing?

637
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,906
I was on set,
and I met the girl you were set up with.

638
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,975
You were set up with Yoon Seul?

639
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,946
So? What about it?

640
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,316
She has a one-sided crush on me.

641
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,985
Did she say that she likes you?

642
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,888
What woman doesn't like me?

643
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,059
It's a talent to be so unlikeable.

644
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,127
But she doesn't like you.

645
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,463
I can tell because I'm a woman, too.

646
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,200
Really? Then how about this?

647
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,704
Your director likes you.

648
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,172
Don't jump to conclusions.

649
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,775
Our director cares a lot about our team.

650
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,079
Where are you going?

651
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,815
I see that you're fine, so I'm leaving

652
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,584
-to my room where Oska awaits.
-Are you crazy?

653
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,820
Do you like sharing rooms with men?

654
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,023
-Is Oska your family too?
-Then should I sleep here?

655
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,158
That would be even weirder.

656
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,430
You don't even have abs.

657
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,499
What? Hey!

658
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,835
You saw everything, didn't you?

659
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,870
Why do you look at a body
that doesn't belong to you?

660
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,462
Oh my!

661
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,165
You're being really weird.

662
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,033
What's going on?

663
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,438
I know I shouldn't,
but it's the first day...

664
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:17,908
You look cold.

665
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,144
Here.

666
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,283
Hey, do you think you can fool me?

667
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:28,552
What?

668
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,354
Who was it?

669
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,926
-What do you mean?
-Who was it?

670
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,301
Who's the one that changed
Ra-im's and my vacation concept?

671
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,404
Oh, that.

672
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,840
I swear it wasn't me.

673
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,311
You're being really weird today.

674
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,483
You seem to be back to a little brother.
Ever since the accident.

675
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,951
Ever since what?

676
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,619
I mispronounced my words!

677
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,788
Not accident. I meant high school.

678
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,291
It's the first time
since you were in high school.

679
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,160
What's wrong? What is it?

680
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,497
What is wrong with you? What?

681
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,566
What's going on in there?

682
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,537
Have a seat.

683
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,482
Were you eavesdropping?

684
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,419
I'm not that type of pathetic guy.

685
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,856
-I was just passing by...
-Guy?

686
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,025
Common term in the stunt industry.

687
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,295
But why did you yell?

688
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,364
Did Oska do something to you?

689
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,201
What have you been telling Ra-im?

690
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,937
Look here, Ra-im.

691
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,241
Look at me. I'm a strong man.

692
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,709
I even served in the military...

693
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,813
-Right?
-Yes, you did. As a full-time soldier.

694
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,482
Right?

695
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,284
That's very odd.

696
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,186
Most people think he was an exemption.

697
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,555
But what brings you here?

698
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,224
I want to hang out with you guys.

699
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,361
Hey! Leave, now.

700
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,363
Can't you see this room is for men only?

701
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,665
Stop making her feel uncomfortable.

702
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,833
Oskie,

703
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,337
can't I stay here? Please?

704
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:33,210
Yeah, sure. Our little Ra-im
wants to be with Oska, right?

705
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,681
Yes, and if it's alright with you,

706
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,549
I would like to sleep over too.

707
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:44,288
Ra-im! You're not that kind of a woman.

708
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,489
You're not!

709
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,958
But I am.

710
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,329
You don't want me to sleep over?

711
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,299
Not at all. Should I kick him out?

712
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,533
Really?

713
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,671
It's so convenient to be a woman.

714
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:04,174
You may have not known this,

715
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:09,846
but my humble wish is to make
all the women in the world happy.

716
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:12,950
For goodness sake.

717
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,352
I'll just go.

718
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,188
Close the door on your way out.

719
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,727
You're more provocative than I thought.

720
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,664
You like that? Huh?

721
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,600
-You're a pervert, aren't you?
-What did you say?

722
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,904
You're the first girl
to ever say that to me.

723
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:38,342
Do you know what this means?

724
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,645
You, poor soul...

725
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:47,384
Where are you going? Ra-im! Ra-im?

726
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,915
Director, I know I was acting weird today,

727
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,052
and you must be disappointed.

728
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,791
I might continue to be strange
for a while,

729
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,227
or even a long time.

730
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,364
I'll explain everything later.

731
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,634
I'm really sorry, Director Lim.

732
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,361
Let's just take one peek.

733
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:12,996
Just once.

734
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,710
Oh no...

735
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,681
Oh no!

736
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,303
What now? Nothing's changed.

737
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,273
If this was like a fairy tale,
one day of suffering would suffice.

738
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,008
Shouldn't it end with
"happily ever after" now?

739
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,077
Maybe it's a tragedy.

740
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,713
Let's eat first, before we think.

741
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,082
Whatever. Where's U-yeong?

742
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,216
He was gone when I woke up.

743
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,353
His bag's gone too.

744
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:19,789
What's this?

745
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,327
"I'm taking the first flight home.
I'll see you in Seoul."

746
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,999
I guess he went back.
Looks like he really quit.

747
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,533
Then, what about our event?

748
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,936
A whole film crew came. What's he doing?

749
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,839
Can't believe this guy...

750
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,608
Wash up first,
and meet me at the restaurant.

751
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,144
Wash what? Why?

752
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,515
How long are you not going to wash?

753
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,550
There was nothing to see, anyway.

754
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,821
Look. Does this look like a woman's body?
It's covered in scars.

755
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,390
-What are you doing?
-You call this a body?

756
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,292
What are you doing? Are you insane?
Pull that down!

757
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,726
How much did you see?

758
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,128
Lower your shirt.

759
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,645
