1
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,427
Wash up first,
and meet me at the restaurant.

2
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,596
Wash what? Why?

3
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,134
How long are you not going to wash?

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,302
There was nothing to see, anyway.

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,938
Look. Does this look like a woman's body?

6
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,741
It's covered in scars.
Do you call this a woman's body?

7
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,576
What are you doing? Are you insane?
Pull that down!

8
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,613
How much did you see? Lower your shirt.

9
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,188
I guess you two are pretty close.

10
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,490
But still, this room isn't even yours.

11
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,893
-This doesn't seem right.
-Look.

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,861
I know what you're thinking, but...

13
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,231
Director Yoon, it's a misunderstanding.

14
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,634
-Oh, really?
-Yuck, it's salty...

15
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,269
What was that for?

16
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,737
-Did you just hug me right now?
-What?

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,641
It's not like that.

18
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,744
-It just happened.
-I had you all wrong, Joo-won.

19
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,846
I didn't take you for someone
who disregards pedigree,

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,315
education, and competence
to be with someone of a different class

21
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,751
that you can't communicate with
in exchange for a mere kiss.

22
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,252
Hey, he said it was a misunderstanding.

23
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,121
Where did you get the key to this room?

24
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,591
You call this "a misunderstanding"?
Then, you must be an idiot.

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,526
Or you're just thoughtless.

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,061
-What was that?
-Forget it.

27
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,164
It's my fault to expect a woman
like you to show some class.

28
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,568
You seem very flustered,
but you need to be.

29
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,804
It's just a hormonal issue.

30
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,906
-Pardon?
-Joo-won...

31
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,310
You still have a chance with me,
so, don't get too scared.

32
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,811
I said, where did you get the key?

33
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,280
This is my second time asking you.

34
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,683
A director can go through anything
when her shoot is canceled.

35
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,719
-Where's Choi U-yeong?
-He left for Seoul.

36
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,460
DOMESTIC ARRIVALS

37
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,195
I knew this would happen.

38
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,465
All searches related to Oska are about
singing mistakes and the canceled shoot.

39
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,802
I've never seen a mess like this before.

40
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,938
What's wrong? Are you okay?

41
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,142
You're such a hick.
Do you get motion sickness?

42
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,344
She seems more like a girl now.

43
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:29,716
I get like this when I fly.
And that was my first time flying economy.

44
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,619
How is it your first time in economy?

45
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,687
Attention.

46
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,025
We're heading to school first to check
the schedule and move the gear.

47
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,026
Yes, sir!

48
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,599
I'm a rookie after all.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,036
What are you talking about?
We have something to discuss.

50
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,439
You guys can go ahead first. Gil Ra-im...

51
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,511
Oh, I mean, me...
I can't make it for a while.

52
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,681
Hey, are you nuts? Why can't you go?

53
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,720
Don't worry. I'll take care of Ra-im
and make sure she's on time tomorrow.

54
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,689
What's wrong with you?

55
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,058
-Do you have to talk with him right now?
-Yes.

56
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,294
It's about my life.

57
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,364
You just made it sound really weird!

58
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,135
Things aren't really normal between us.
Let's go.

59
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,779
Ra-im sure is amazing.
She's with that rich guy now.

60
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,647
Maybe I should be her driver.

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,518
Why are we here?

62
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,322
It's the safest place to lay low. Get out.

63
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,592
We have to talk about
what we're going to do.

64
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,964
The simplest plan would be
for you to come here.

65
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,000
-Do you want to live together?
-Am I crazy?

66
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,935
I'm saying you should work here
as an employee.

67
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,304
Do you want to die?
What about the action school, then?

68
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,741
Of course, you have to quit. It's not like
I can quit the department store.

69
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,775
Why not?

70
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,044
Is only your job important?
What about my job?

71
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,880
It's incomparable.

72
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,750
If I quit, the Korean economy...

73
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,920
When did you get here, Mother?

74
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,992
"Mother"?

75
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,895
Who are you calling, "Mother"?
Is that what you call everyone?

76
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,465
Mother, please calm down.

77
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,233
Why are you butting in?

78
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,136
Why is that hussy getting out from
your driver's seat?

79
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,839
So, do you get cars from him, not money?

80
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,476
I heard that you went to Jeju Island.
You didn't go with her, did you?

81
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,312
Excuse me... Madam Moon.

82
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,582
-Calling me a hussy is a bit--
-What?

83
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,819
What? Are you telling me what to do?

84
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,155
I'll send her away. Please calm down.

85
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,323
Get in.

86
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,359
You should come sit here and drive.

87
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,161
This is your car.

88
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,331
You definitely did not give me this car.

89
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,667
I can't believe you.

90
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,070
That day you met me...
That wasn't the first time, was it?

91
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,707
How many times was it?
How long have you been coming here for?

92
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,343
That's not how it is. It's really not.

93
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,612
-She hasn't been coming here.
-Shut your mouth.

94
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,648
I'm madder at you than I am to that hussy.

95
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,718
If she hasn't been coming,
why is there a closet full of her clothes?

96
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,164
What are you doing? Go on up.

97
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,066
It's not like I can go up there.

98
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,902
Go up and say what?

99
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,706
Mom, those are...

100
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,179
You still say you haven't been coming?

101
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,716
Is this a misunderstanding?
Did I make this up?

102
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,284
This is driving me insane.

103
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,700
This is...

104
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,773
Put them on.

105
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,510
Why is this here?

106
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,079
None of your business!

107
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,583
She put them there without you knowing?
You really didn't buy them for her?

108
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,019
No, she must've bought them herself.

109
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,457
This is why you shouldn't even
show sympathy to the poor.

110
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,827
Especially to girls like her
whose only asset is their body.

111
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,598
-That's going a bit too--
-It could be worse. Just listen.

112
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,566
Would we ever see each other again?

113
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,571
Do I have to offer you money, and throw
water at your face some other time?

114
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,145
You should have worn them
when I told you to.

115
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,883
I'm sorry about my mom.

116
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,455
She can be a bit harsh at times.
Even I get my feelings hurt sometimes.

117
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,559
That's messed up.

118
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,995
Hey, that's a bit harsh.

119
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,398
I meant you.

120
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,768
What your mother said is nothing

121
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,472
compared to how much you hurt me.

122
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,675
You should try to be nicer.

123
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,282
It's a relief
that you didn't have to deal with it.

124
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,988
For the first time, I was happy that
we had our bodies switched.

125
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,528
You don't have to be so touched.

126
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,498
This is how the upper-class
is socially conscious.

127
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,901
You're an asshole.

128
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,636
What?

129
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,474
I bet that was new for you.
This is how the lower-class rebels.

130
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,378
I didn't realize how large
the language disparity was.

131
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,514
Think of it as an exchange of cultures.

132
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,402
We each have our own lives.

133
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,805
There's no choice but to live as we are
now, without getting caught.

134
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,542
Let's exchange some basic information.

135
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,113
You go first.

136
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,125
Just remember these faces for today.

137
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,193
At the very top...

138
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,031
Does your family come up on the internet?

139
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,500
I only learned recently that this is rare.

140
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,734
Now, focus.

141
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,438
MOON CHANG-SU
LOEL GROUP CHAIRMAN

142
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,339
LATE JEONG SUN-JU

143
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,074
PARK BONG-HUI, SPOUSE

144
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,876
This is my mother's father.

145
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,314
He's Loel Group's chairman who not only
owns my department store, but also resorts

146
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,650
and stores in Deoksan and Jaecheon,
and hotels across the country.

147
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,094
-He recently married his fourth wife,
-Oh, honey.

148
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,630
but everyone's wondering
how long it'll last.

149
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,299
You look so pretty.

150
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,940
How do I look?

151
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,314
You met my mom. This is my aunt.

152
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,616
U-yeong's mom.

153
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,018
-She's beautiful.
-Oh, please.

154
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,254
It's all plastic surgery.
My mom's the natural beauty.

155
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,626
Anyway, thanks to my grandfather's
extravagant lifestyle,

156
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,229
my aunt is the second wife's daughter and
my mom is the third wife's daughter.

157
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,698
So, they really hate each other.

158
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,951
Keep our things separate.
The cheap stuff might ruin my jewelry.

159
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,954
Don't you know?

160
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,890
On mine, an Italian artisan
placed each jewel one by one--

161
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,025
Oh, really?

162
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,794
Do you want to bet on whose jewelry
is more expensive?

163
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,896
Oh, give me a break.

164
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,031
HEALTH TONIC

165
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,499
This is for you.

166
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,935
Now, this is the climax.

167
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,272
This is the person you really
need to watch out for.

168
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,675
Our company's employee,
Director Park Bong-ho.

169
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,046
He's my employee and grand-uncle,
making this a crappy situation.

170
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,150
Grand what?

171
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,584
Grand-uncle.

172
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,019
LOEL FAMILY TREE

173
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,356
My grandfather's fourth wife
is Director Park's sister.

174
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,693
So, here's a special favor for you.

175
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,364
It's okay to be mean to him.

176
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,667
Other than that, don't call
or answer any calls.

177
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,437
Don't meet anyone.
Especially not Choi U-yeong.

178
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,772
-Don't associate with him at all.
-Why not?

179
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,774
Why are you doing that to Oskie?

180
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,911
Hey! Don't make that face with my face!

181
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,648
Be honest. You have an inferiority complex
about Oska, right?

182
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,486
I swear that if I have ever felt that way,
you can send me straight to hell.

183
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,756
So, that's why this happened to us.

184
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,927
Although, I don't know why
I have to go through hell with you.

185
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,161
Just keep that up.

186
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:14,233
I might go to your director and ask,
"Do you want to run away with me?"

187
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,635
-I'll do it.
-I'll kill you.

188
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,204
So, focus.

189
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,340
This is it for now. Now, you go.

190
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,380
You know A-yeong.

191
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,549
And Director Lim.

192
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,952
You know the action school members.

193
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,190
That's it.

194
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,661
How can that be it?
Don't you have a family?

195
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,830
No, I don't.

196
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,601
You don't have a family?

197
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,736
I said, I don't.

198
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,805
You've never met someone without a family?

199
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,775
What are we going to do
about our cell phones?

200
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,149
We'll keep our own.

201
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,384
If we only call each other

202
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,187
and text everyone else, we should be fine.

203
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,855
You better stay focused.

204
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,690
You must be forgetting.

205
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,493
I'm a good actress. I'm a stuntwoman.

206
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,328
You must be forgetting.

207
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,299
You're not a stuntwoman.
You're the owner of a department store.

208
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,374
DOMESTIC ARRIVALS

209
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,708
-Jumping to conclusions again!
-Yes?

210
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,644
-You heard something, didn't you?
-Yes, it went well.

211
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,846
-Yes, we finished shooting in Jeju.
-What?

212
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,882
The shoot was canceled? Says who?

213
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,151
Reporter Kim, we're still in Jeju!

214
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,787
Do you hear the waves?
You heard that, right?

215
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,956
Look at those rapeseed flowers...

216
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,159
They bloom in spring?

217
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,895
"Conflicts with the director"?

218
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,268
Not even a love scandal?
This is very upsetting!

219
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,872
There are only passion
and pure artistry on my sets,

220
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,307
never a conflict.

221
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,542
Just a moment.

222
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,746
This is driving me nuts!

223
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,682
The shoot is going fine!

224
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,485
I guess you didn't hear. Oska has changed.

225
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,889
I'm sorry, hold on.

226
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,125
Reporter Park! It's been so--

227
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,728
What are you doing? I was talking!

228
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,030
Call Choi U-yeong.

229
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,999
Tell him if he doesn't come back,

230
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,034
the next place he'd see me
would be the bridal room!

231
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,505
If he doesn't want to meet as family,
this has to be handled!

232
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,947
My goodness!

233
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,007
What's wrong?

234
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,277
I asked what's wrong.
What are you looking for?

235
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,787
Why do you need my passport? Give it back!

236
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,756
I'm holding onto this for now.

237
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,958
-Where are your car keys?
-Why do you want them?

238
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,697
What is this about?

239
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,734
Apparently, you booked a flight
for tomorrow afternoon to Cebu.

240
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,802
I did not!

241
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,238
Jong-heon booked the flight.

242
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,042
I don't even have the strength, will,
or love to curse at you anymore.

243
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,610
Come back tomorrow to the set.

244
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,513
Or I'm going to sell off my stocks
and wash my hands of it all!

245
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,348
You'll lose money if you sell it now.

246
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,217
Better than waiting and getting nothing!
Just look at you!

247
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,255
They're printing that article about you.
I can't stop it. No, I won't stop it!

248
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,424
Give me the van key.

249
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,359
You can't take the van, too!

250
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,794
You better not give it to him.

251
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,065
-Give it to me now!
-It's in the van.

252
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,870
I'll kill you.

253
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,372
Go and get it. Now!

254
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,553
Don't you have plans to move?

255
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:29,922
No, I don't.

256
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,425
You better not try anything with A-yeong--

257
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,094
What kind of person do you think I am?

258
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,963
You better not act like this...

259
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,135
-around Choi U-yeong.
-It depends on how you act.

260
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,304
Give me the key.

261
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,577
Don't ever forget how much
that car is worth.

262
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,612
But my memory isn't so good.

263
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,084
That's my favorite car!

264
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,954
I like it, too. Later.

265
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
Hey! Be careful!

266
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,772
You're back! I missed you!

267
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,678
Yes. Me too.

268
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,015
What's with all these clothes?

269
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,953
This brand is only sold
at my department store!

270
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,323
Hey! My boss must've bought this
for you, right?

271
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,791
Did you just hit me?

272
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't change the subject.

273
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,797
I heard that there was a huge commotion
at the luxury brand section.

274
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,533
So, these clothes ended up here.

275
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,136
My gosh! It's so pretty!

276
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,705
There were rumors about that?

277
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,075
Of course. There are eyes everywhere
at the department store.

278
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,711
What?

279
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,248
Are you going to get undressed?

280
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,349
Yes, I need to shower.

281
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,018
Why? Do you need to shower too?
Then, can you scrub my back?

282
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,987
Your back?

283
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,294
If that's what you really want.

284
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,462
Bring your laundry.

285
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,299
Oh, right.
Did anything happen in Jeju Island?

286
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,469
"Anything"? Why?

287
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,204
I had a dream last night.

288
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,607
You know my dreams tend to come true.

289
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,845
You and my boss were driving somewhere
in a car in that dream.

290
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,316
The sky was pitch black.
My boss was crying, and you were asleep.

291
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,287
And Mr. Gil was watching over everything

292
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,588
while holding a red rose.

293
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,891
"Mr. Gil"?

294
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,028
-Should I know who that is?
-Stop joking around.

295
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,663
I mean your dad.

296
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,601
I think it means that you're going to
make my boss cry a lot.

297
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,004
You'll toy with him until you dump him.

298
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,339
That's how you make a man yours.

299
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,507
Just go take your shower.

300
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,611
Are we expecting someone?

301
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,722
Dang it! I'm so worried!

302
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,198
What? You're not dating?

303
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,734
I was going to pick aloe
from the aloe farms at Jeju Island

304
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,904
and grind it up myself.

305
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,239
But...

306
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,909
I got something better!

307
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,714
This is what President Kim drinks too.
He never shares the good stuff.

308
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,615
That son of a...

309
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,156
They say this is great for your skin.

310
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,490
This is just for you.

311
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,528
What if I get even prettier than I am now?

312
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,065
Don't say that again. That was so lovable.

313
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,933
Hold these.

314
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,939
You're dating Lim A-yeong
who works at the lounge, right?

315
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,243
How did he know?

316
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,611
What? Who is it?

317
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,246
It's President Kim!

318
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,982
He could've told me tomorrow,
if he's off work.

319
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,351
He's always such a bother!

320
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,789
Don't say such things.
I would never date a coworker!

321
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,491
I've seen her around, though.

322
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,329
What is it? What did he say?

323
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:08,233
Oh, it's actually confidential.

324
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,436
He wants to discuss next year's promotions
and transfers.

325
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,941
You know, I'm getting a bit tired of him
relying on me all the time.

326
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,018
-Are you expecting someone?
-No.

327
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,486
Who is it?

328
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,455
President Kim!

329
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,897
I was in the neighborhood
and noticed Mr. Kim's car.

330
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,368
That's a lie. You came to see Ra-im.

331
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,604
Come on in.

332
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,239
You better not.

333
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,510
Do you always invite men
into an apartment full of women?

334
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,813
You're making him feel awkward.
I think he's here to see you.

335
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,016
He's not. I think he's here for me.

336
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,688
Sir, it's a misunderstanding.

337
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,126
I understand that this situation
doesn't reflect what I texted you...

338
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,062
I'm sorry to cut you off,
but I'm in a hurry.

339
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,597
Lim A-yeong.
I'd like to see you in private.

340
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,399
What? Me?

341
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,903
Sir! A-yeong didn't do anything wrong!

342
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,870
Right?

343
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,673
Someone else messed up.

344
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,317
Do you have something to tell me?

345
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,320
Is it another complaint?

346
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,923
I've missed you, girl!

347
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,694
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:47,299
I have so much I want to tell you
and it's driving me nuts that I can't.

349
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,801
Tell me?

350
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,370
I'm sure this is confusing,

351
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,206
but listen to what I have to say.

352
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,941
I really care about you, A-yeong.

353
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,112
Me? You care about me?

354
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,348
Since when?

355
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,883
Since a long time ago.

356
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,886
So, you have to believe
everything I tell you.

357
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,356
Your friend Gil Ra-im
will act strange for a while.

358
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,460
So, just keep your distance from her.
Don't touch or hug her.

359
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,596
Don't sleep under the same blanket!

360
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,700
And you can't walk around
in your underwear like you usually do!

361
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,638
Did Ra-im even talk to you about
things like that?

362
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,975
I swear she didn't tell me.
We're the only ones that know.

363
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,845
You and me?

364
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,083
I'm sure it would sound strange,

365
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,453
but that's not important now,
so, promise me

366
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,022
that you'll listen to me.

367
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,911
Why are you looking at me like that?

368
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,080
Do you not like me?

369
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,816
Do you like me?

370
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,820
-Pardon?
-They say you can't trust anyone.

371
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,890
Right?

372
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,527
President Kim is so petty!

373
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,330
He came all the way here
to call out A-yeong. Right?

374
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,470
Do you think that's really President Kim
who's out there with A-yeong?

375
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,537
Pardon?

376
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,610
This has been on my mind.

377
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,214
That gaze looks familiar.

378
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,352
Of course! You are so dead now.

379
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,092
You're back by yourself?
Did President Kim leave?

380
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,399
What did he say? Did he ask you about us?

381
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,636
Right? He should have.

382
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,140
-But President Kim...
-What? What did he say?

383
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:10,809
He must be crazy.

384
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,145
He told me to be careful around you.

385
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,348
He said not to sleep
under the same blanket as you.

386
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,151
What is he doing to you?
Did something happen in Jeju Island?

387
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,856
He must be jealous
that you might seduce me.

388
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,593
I'm going to take a walk around the block.

389
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,866
What did Ra-im just say?

390
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,769
Why would you seduce her?

391
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,605
Good question.
If anyone, I'd seduce President Kim.

392
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,007
Oh, my.

393
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,924
-What is it?
-What's the passcode to your house?

394
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,062
Oh, I forgot about that.

395
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,133
By the way, you made me sound like
a pervert to your friend.

396
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:12,337
You better behave. Or I might act like
a pervert with your friends.

397
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,806
What's the passcode?
Come on. It's getting cold.

398
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,443
Oh, the passcode. It's...

399
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,748
The call got disconnected.
And it's cold out too.

400
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,125
Hello?

401
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,995
How dare he.

402
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,637
The number is incorrect.

403
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,374
This is nuts.

404
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,110
Is it not a number?

405
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,515
Is it a fingerprint?

406
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,018
Nope.

407
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,389
Is it a retina scan?

408
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,564
I'm on my way out.

409
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,434
Looks like it's locked just fine.

410
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,639
Excuse me!

411
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,610
Oska... My cousin.

412
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,580
Where could he be right now?

413
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,446
When did you get back?

414
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,181
Around lunch.

415
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,185
I bet things were crazy in Jeju Island.

416
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,425
Dong-gyu said he would sell his shares
of Oska Entertainment

417
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,727
and stop working with me.

418
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,396
I'm in big trouble, aren't I?

419
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,941
Track 34.

420
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,711
I love that song.

421
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,247
You do?

422
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,717
And? So, you want an autograph?

423
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,452
Really?

424
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,853
What?

425
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,557
I mean...

426
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,528
I'm really hungry. Did you eat yet?

427
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,478
What are you doing?

428
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,083
We want to eat, so, go fix us some dinner.

429
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,685
Yes, sir.

430
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,687
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

431
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,191
Could I make dinner?

432
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,438
All done.

433
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,274
Have a seat.

434
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,585
I hope everything's seasoned right.

435
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,824
-Why aren't you eating?
-You try it first.

436
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,426
You poisoned the food, right?

437
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,029
Did Dong-gyu ask you to kill me?

438
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,602
-He wouldn't leave me with that task...
-Is this The Last Supper then?

439
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,238
Are you going to sue me after I eat this?

440
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,606
Sue you?

441
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,376
You could be an actor.

442
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,680
Of course, I'm sorry I couldn't do
the romantic vacation or whatever.

443
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,517
I wanted to do it. Ra-im was the winner.
It sounded great! But--

444
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,818
Really?

445
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,922
-What?
-You said it's great that Ra-im won.

446
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,391
Sure, why not?

447
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,493
She's smart, pretty with a nice body,

448
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,028
and she likes me.

449
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:11,930
That's true.

450
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,100
What's wrong with you?
Are you sick of her already?

451
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,236
Well, I didn't think you would last long

452
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,204
with a girl
that pays 300,000 won a month for rent.

453
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,441
Anyway, regardless of your relationship,
a bet's a bet.

454
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,077
No matter what I do with Ra-im,
stay out of it.

455
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,546
-What "bet"?
-Hey!

456
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,282
You're not fooling me!
Don't try to fake me out and try the food!

457
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,988
Not that!

458
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,726
Eat this.

459
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,706
Come here.

460
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,085
Sit here.

461
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,323
Listen to this.

462
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,226
I can do it.

463
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,875
What do you think?

464
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,114
I like it. It's like I'm in a dream.

465
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,348
What?

466
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,786
The song. It's a great song.

467
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,589
Right? It's good, right?

468
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,593
But it sounds a lot like the title track
from my seventh album.

469
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,661
And this song is three years old.

470
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,734
I can't contact the songwriter.

471
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,636
He's traveling in the U.S.

472
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,906
Then, what about your music video shoot?

473
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,676
Is that really the problem now?
My entire album is about to be ruined.

474
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,247
Just leave! I don't even want to drink
because I have too much on my mind.

475
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,550
All right.

476
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,235
Gimpo, departing at 8:40 a.m., row 7.

477
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,619
Why are you here?
And how did you know I was here?

478
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,422
I heard you messed up the shoot
and the hotel said you left.

479
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,525
I figured you would be here
since you left with your bags packed.

480
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,795
This is yours, right?

481
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,365
Why was this in your pocket?

482
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,967
I picked it up under a table
while cleaning.

483
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,638
You must've dropped it when you almost
died from trying to hit on a girl.

484
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,008
-Why you...
-I listened to some of your songs.

485
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,544
A few of them were songs
from your seventh album.

486
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,614
Hey! I never said you could listen
to my stuff!

487
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,182
Didn't they teach you in kindergarten?

488
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,885
If you illegally listen to music files,
you can be jailed for three years

489
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,287
-or catch a beating...
-It's Oska!

490
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,022
-My gosh!
-Oska!

491
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,596
Yes, it's me, Oska.

492
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,364
You're so handsome!

493
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,366
Yes, I know.

494
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,101
We love you so much!

495
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,204
Yes. I also really love myself.

496
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,108
I wondered why you were popular
when you suck at singing.

497
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,210
You have a silly side.

498
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,647
What? "Silly"?

499
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,049
I added a song that you have to listen to.

500
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,619
-Make sure you listen to it.
-Oh, please.

501
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,988
It's a recording
of some weird moaning, right?

502
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,391
You have such an active imagination
and a handsome face.

503
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,026
Do you have to be a singer?

504
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,662
Just stick to acting.
What did music ever do to you?

505
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,867
Hey!

506
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,069
My goodness...

507
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,207
Do you think I'm good at acting?

508
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,277
Not even my fans will admit that.

509
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,117
So embarrassing! That was so embarrassing!

510
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,852
I shouldn't have said that last thing!

511
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,689
I shouldn't hate my haters.
I'm my own hater! Geez!

512
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,432
Director Yoon is coming tomorrow.
I'll be there at ten. Have coffee ready.

513
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,614
The passcode is incorrect.

514
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,816
The passcode is incorrect.

515
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,524
That jerk...

516
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:08,993
What the heck?

517
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,795
What are you doing there?

518
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,799
-How did you come out from there?
-What's wrong with you?

519
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,934
I crossed the bridge
and used the other door.

520
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,502
No!

521
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,241
What's wrong? What is it?

522
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:31,315
You know... I think it's because
I'm so stressed out these days.

523
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,085
I can't remember the passcode.

524
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,788
Do you know it?

525
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,691
Since when? Does this happen often?

526
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,628
-Did you talk to Ji-hyeon?
-"Ji-hyeon"?

527
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,397
Do you forget other stuff...

528
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,268
Or remember random stuff?

529
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,802
No.

530
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,405
You should still contact Ji-hyeon.

531
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,012
-Where are your car keys?
-My car keys?

532
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,180
Come on! I don't have time!

533
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,317
-Here they are.
-My goodness.

534
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,898
I'm going to borrow this for a few days.
The passcode is 362434.

535
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,967
What? 362 what?

536
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,004
It's 36-24-34!
You said that's the body of your dreams!

537
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,541
Oh, 36-24...

538
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,245
It's 36... Wait, 36?

539
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,516
Oh, no! A-yeong! The car...

540
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,653
He's going to be mad.

541
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:15,886
Wow. This is great.

542
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,943
Where does the water go?

543
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,964
I bet the bills are expensive
for a house like this.

544
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,049
He only drinks the good stuff.

545
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
Should I sell all these and run away?

546
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,066
He must be really rich.

547
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,802
It's no wonder
his life is like a fairy tale.

548
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,146
DIRECTOR, I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT.

549
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,404
Are you asleep?

550
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,048
What do I do?

551
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,019
It must have been me.

552
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,390
He must've approached you to get to me.

553
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,198
You should've worn makeup too.

554
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,277
One little, two little,
Three little Indians

555
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:11,148
Four little, five little,
Six little Indians

556
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,250
Seven little, eight little,
Nine little Indians

557
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,357
Well, I didn't think you would last long

558
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,292
with a girl that pays 300,000 won a month
for rent.

559
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,016
Hey, this is...

560
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,186
No way, he took this out.

561
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,961
I'll give you a hint.
The passcode is four digits.

562
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,831
That jerk.

563
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,214
Why did you come with a bike,
and not my car?

564
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,884
How did you get this key back?

565
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,153
Did you get it out yourself?

566
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,023
Do you think I would do that?

567
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,524
Then, how did you get it out?

568
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:32,262
I asked you first.
What happened to my car?

569
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,099
It ran out of gas.

570
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,333
All three of them?

571
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,871
All three of those cars were yours?
Not the employees'?

572
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,674
They wouldn't park in front of my house
unless they were crazy.

573
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,544
And what's with that outfit?
Your tie and shirt don't match.

574
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:49,480
Why aren't you wearing a watch?

575
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,816
-A man needs a watch.
-All right, just get on. We're late.

576
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,020
Here. It's the training schedule
for the rookies.

577
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,258
Are you insane?
Do you want me to go to the action school?

578
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,196
If you don't, how about I don't go
to the department store?

579
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,900
You're the one with a lot to lose.
Try to cooperate.

580
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,141
Wait. Let me go change.

581
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,714
So, how did you find out the passcode
and get in last night?

582
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:28,152
A radiant star suddenly showed up. Why?

583
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,387
What? "Four digits"?

584
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,223
That was total nonsense.

585
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,858
A 36-inch bust...

586
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,327
You pervert.

587
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,534
It's no wonder you're so sensitive.
Should I get you a boob job?

588
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:44,968
Hey!

589
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,674
I'll kill you. You better take that off!

590
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,943
No. I like this style.

591
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,881
Fine. I'm through with just using words.

592
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,118
Help me!

593
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,855
This tall and handsome man
is trying to hit me, a girl!

594
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,291
-Please help me!
-I wouldn't hit her!

595
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:15,132
She's just so pretty!
How is she so pretty from head to toe?

596
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,604
Let's not get involved. Come on.

597
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,544
Right hand if you're going to action
school and left hand if you want to die.

598
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,621
-Get on.
-I'm going to get you back for this.

599
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,791
I sure have a broad chest though.

600
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,235
Director, I'm sorry about what happened
at the airport.

601
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,570
I know this is confusing,

602
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,941
but I'm not really who you saw that day.

603
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,744
Please, believe me.

604
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,621
It's the script you've been waiting for.

605
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,790
Don't get distracted,
and just focus on the audition.

606
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,525
Just be yourself.

607
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,231
Holy cow.

608
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,532
Who is this?

609
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,035
Wow, do you have a blind date today?

610
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,803
I thought I would change things up a bit.

611
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,872
What's going on here?

612
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,876
Are you going to the audition like that?

613
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,145
"Audition"?

614
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,414
They're finally auditioning
for Dark Blood.

615
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,316
If you include people
from Japan, China, and Korea...

616
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,585
The odds are about a thousand to one

617
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,788
More than that.
People are dying to get that script.

618
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,390
Not even Director Jeong Du-hong
got one yet.

619
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,525
So, what if he didn't get one?

620
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,865
Director, look! She's got an attitude
now that she's seeing Mr. Money-maker!

621
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:59,569
Oh my gosh.

622
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,306
She's insane.

623
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,209
Come to my office.

624
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,715
Why do you keep asking
to see me in private?

625
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,118
Keep that up
and you'll be talking to my lawyer!

626
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:50,053
I thought you would be happier.
You've been waiting for this script.

627
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,127
Fine, let's say that's true.

628
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,129
So, what?

629
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,269
There aren't many Hollywood scripts
that are looking for Asian females.

630
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,271
This is a good chance, so, do your best.

631
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,709
They'll look at your resume,
watch your demo and do a script reading.

632
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,845
The Korean agency will--

633
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,455
Are you telling me to do this?

634
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,924
How could you ask a girl to do this?

635
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,260
This isn't an opportunity.
You're asking me to die.

636
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,296
You should stop me if I ever say
I want to do this kind of stuff.

637
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,432
It's not that hard.

638
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,469
I think we're done here.

639
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,005
Just what is your true self?

640
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,941
When will you stop acting so strange?

641
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,714
Fine. You're right.

642
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,949
You caught me.

643
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,087
So, if you're doing this on purpose,
you can stop.

644
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,925
Don't bring personal matters into work.
Because I won't either.

645
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,600
He doesn't just like Ra-im, he loves her.

646
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,639
Then, let me ask for a favor.

647
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:20,677
I'll pretend that I didn't find out.

648
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:25,382
So, don't ever tell me that you like me.

649
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,333
What?

650
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,368
U-yeong disappeared again.

651
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,138
I took his passport and his car key,
but he still got away.

652
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,040
-Didn't you tell him what I said?
-And if I did?

653
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,641
It's just asking for a fight.

654
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,377
Let's just give up on U-yeong.

655
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,113
I was wrong for thinking that

656
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,681
he would be okay since time has passed.

657
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,083
I don't want to see you again about this.

658
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,286
I know where U-yeong is.

659
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,989
You do?

660
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,259
But I'm not going to tell you.

661
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,329
I tend to hold grudges.

662
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,432
If he keeps running away,
I should raise the stakes.

663
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,869
As you know, I'm shameless and shrewd,

664
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,338
so, marrying U-yeong's cousin
is no big deal for me.

665
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,441
But that'll be hard on U-yeong.

666
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,811
Because I'm going to torment him
whenever I see him.

667
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,980
Are you really going to do this?

668
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,915
You should've told him
what I told you to say!

669
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,683
You should've just let us fight!

670
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,919
Then, we could reconcile!

671
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,555
Probably...

672
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,703
Welcome.

673
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,193
Sir.

674
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,861
This way.

675
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,433
-Oh, do we have to walk?
-Pardon?

676
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,179
Hey! Big news! Big news!

677
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,881
The boss took the elevator today.

678
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,150
He greeted everybody
and even opened his office door himself!

679
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,919
But the important thing is that
his outfit looked a bit drab.

680
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,822
I bet it's so hard on him.

681
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,825
Oh, dear. All this for me?

682
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,897
What? President Kim took the elevator?

683
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,599
That's impossible.

684
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,703
He hides it, but he's claustrophobic.

685
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,741
That was the ace up my sleeve.
How could he take the elevator?

686
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,676
There were numerous witnesses!

687
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,613
Maybe he was faking his condition.

688
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,616
So, was he just testing me?

689
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,220
So, if he took the elevator,

690
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,624
does that mean he's officially
ready for management?

691
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,927
Man! I was just getting good at
signing his name.

692
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,161
KIM JOO-WON

693
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,832
We have no choice. He had approvals
waiting for him while he was gone, right?

694
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,434
-Bring all of them.
-Yes, sir.

695
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,842
Kim Joo-won.

696
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,378
It's perfect.

697
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,131
When did you start eating sundae?

698
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,301
Good question. Since I was a kid?

699
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,406
You know Lim A-yeong at the VIP lounge?

700
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,042
Please, sir!

701
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,046
That's all a misunderstanding.
There's nothing going on between us.

702
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,080
I didn't say anything.

703
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,117
I just wanted to know what her salary was.

704
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,525
Including bonuses, she makes
a bit over 20 million won a year.

705
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,630
What about me?

706
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,865
-Pardon?
-You have a new message.

707
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,334
-Hold on.
-You have a new message.

708
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,437
"You have a new message."

709
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:46,409
Did you get a new cell phone?

710
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,380
Oh, yes.

711
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,485
Dong-gyu? Who's that?

712
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,089
I can't do this anymore.

713
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,959
U-yeong has disappeared again.

714
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,962
He's probably somewhere
in the Philippines.

715
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,565
He always does that
when he goes off the grid.

716
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,267
That's why I confiscated his passport
as soon as I got to Seoul.

717
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,371
Then, he must be in Deoksan.
There's a spa resort there.

718
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,339
He isn't there. I checked everywhere.

719
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,711
Hey, but how do you know
so much about him?

720
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:22,679
Well...

721
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,014
Because I'm a fan.

722
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,918
I even wear Oska socks
so that he can make a living.

723
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,888
Thank you.

724
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,957
Those socks sold well.

725
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,428
Anyway, Mr. Kim...
I can't do this anymore.

726
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,231
Just sue us for the department store gig.

727
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,833
I'll sue him for breach of contract
and wash my hands off of him.

728
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,136
How could you do that?

729
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,639
I'll look for him.
Don't sue him. I'm not going to either.

730
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,409
Says who? I'm going to.

731
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,113
The Oska that I know is
the most passionate person in the world.

732
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,816
I'll take responsibility
and bring him back.

733
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,919
All right, then.

734
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,956
Just one thing, Mr. Kim.
Have you been drinking?

735
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,430
You really don't know where he is?

736
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,698
How would I know?
Not even his manager knows.

737
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,034
Stay out of this.

738
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,702
Aren't you even worried?

739
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,837
No.

740
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,407
I can't even get back in my own body.
Do we really need to look for him?

741
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,842
You better find him.

742
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,314
Actually, your car didn't run out of gas.
Oska took it.

743
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,016
What?

744
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,924
Is this the police? My car was stolen.

745
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,959
Hey!

746
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,984
Really?

747
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,687
You reserved this entire course?

748
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:15,425
Only stupid people have secret dates
in basement parking lots.

749
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,494
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

750
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,930
The air is sweet, my eyes feel refreshed,

751
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,300
and nobody's here.
It's like a deserted island.

752
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,069
Let's come often.

753
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,273
I'm not that good at golfing.

754
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,675
I didn't take lessons
so I could learn from you.

755
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:37,080
Don't worry! If I wasn't so good
at singing, I would've been a pro golfer.

756
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,348
Watch me.

757
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:45,555
Golf is all about lower body strength.

758
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:50,560
If you want to hit the ball far,
use your hips and thighs.

759
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,362
Try hitting it.

760
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,434
Nice!

761
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,171
You said you couldn't play.

762
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,241
I never said that!
I said I'm not that good.

763
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,679
Come here. Golf is all about...

764
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,182
-What is it?
-You're adorable.

765
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,753
Can I be naughty for just a second?

766
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,056
Choi U-yeong?

767
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:58,861
Do you want an autograph?

768
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,071
Welcome, madam.

769
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,205
Oska is here, right?

770
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:13,009
Yes, he came, but was taken away.

771
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,510
What?

772
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:19,916
Do you have to do this?
Cousins are family too.

773
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:24,454
Don't underestimate our bond.
I get royally screwed over too.

774
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:29,225
This isn't just to find my car.
I have something else to find too.

775
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,127
And what might that be?

776
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,696
Oh, come on! Don't you know me?
Haven't you seen me on TV?

777
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,366
Why would I steal a car?
I just borrowed my cousin's...

778
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,536
-Hey! You!
-Now what?

779
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,373
Do you even use the cops to find me now?

780
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,941
Is this why you cooked for me?

781
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,976
You cooked for him?

782
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,512
You made food for that idiot
with my hands?

783
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:50,913
Be quiet!

784
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,958
How did she show up here?

785
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,293
What happened?

786
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,796
Tell me what happened!

787
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,000
Are you just going to stand there?

788
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,136
Bring him over.

789
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,080
I see that you two are cousins.

790
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,849
Family shouldn't fight like this.
Just settle.

791
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,750
-Yes!
-No!

792
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,685
Put him behind bars.

793
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,423
Are you crazy?

794
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,771
-I told Joo-won to come.
-He said to talk to me.

795
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:58,581
I heard from Kim Joo-won
about the bet in Jeju Island.

796
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,724
That if you gave me up, he would settle.

797
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,296
Did Joo-won tell you something like that?

798
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:19,202
He also told me it's been a rule
that what's won in a bet isn't returned.

799
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,039
So, he's going to be like this?

800
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,211
Joo-won has always been a jerk,
but he was never this petty.

801
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,613
If he's doing all this,

802
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,550
you must have become
an important person to him.

803
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,694
I guess that must be why he's doing this.

804
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,828
But what should we do?

805
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,568
I can't give you up, either.

806
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:03,446
Tell Joo-won
that I'm not going to lose you to him.

807
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,250
Tell him that it doesn't matter
if he settles or not.

808
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,860
