1
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,664
All right. I'll ask it this way.

2
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,101
Have we ever kissed?

3
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,304
Like this...

4
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,252
Why aren't you answering?

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,721
Did we kiss?

6
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,358
What do you think?

7
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,093
I asked first.

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,567
One little, two little
Three little Indians

9
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,137
Four little, five little
Six little Indians

10
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:13,773
What are you doing?

11
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,376
-I'm protecting you.
-What?

12
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,613
I'm protecting you
just like you protected me.

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,549
At least until you remember.

14
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,852
Why are you laughing?

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,687
I protected you?

16
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,357
Me, a healthy 34-year-old?

17
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
-Yes.
-There's no way.

18
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,830
Maybe it was because
you weren't attractive enough.

19
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,264
You're dead meat.

20
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,201
Do you have brain damage
after coming back from the dead?

21
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,104
Is this how you normally treated me?

22
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,072
You're the type
who just asks for a beating.

23
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,376
Don't distort the 13 years that I lost.

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,580
I'll get going.

25
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,581
Also,

26
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,916
don't you summon me like this ever again.

27
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,553
If you miss me, then you come to see me.
Okay?

28
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,055
Wait.

29
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,494
To reiterate, get your things.
Stay with me.

30
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,598
But if I can't figure out why I liked you,

31
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,134
you have to leave when I tell you to.

32
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,371
No?

33
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,040
Instead of that,

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,177
should I just stay quietly beside you
as if I'm not even there,

35
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,347
and then disappear like foam?

36
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,782
Like the little mermaid.

37
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,752
Just say the word.

38
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,053
Like I said before,

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,388
I'll do anything for you.

40
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,357
Anything you want.

41
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,758
Do you know

42
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,294
what you just said?

43
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,629
I know.

44
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,297
I know it all too well.

45
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,233
Think about it and let me know.

46
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,042
What's up with her?

47
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,911
Why is her smile so pretty?

48
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,834
Wait.

49
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,137
Where are you going? I'll take you.

50
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,475
What took you so long?

51
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,979
-What?
-Didn't you see how slowly I walked?

52
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,014
And how good I looked from behind?

53
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,883
You should have hurried out
and stopped me.

54
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,518
Why did you hesitate so long?

55
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,588
I have an important meeting today.

56
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,925
I stopped filming because of my accident.

57
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,027
But I think I can film again.

58
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,631
I don't have a lot of time,
so give me the keys. I'll drive.

59
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,768
Don't get shocked and just listen to me.

60
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,771
We got the news

61
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,274
that they cast another actress
from Hong Kong for Dark Blood.

62
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,012
What happened to you is a blessing to us,

63
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,348
but they're uncertain
about your physical status.

64
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,184
I understand.

65
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,221
Please tell them

66
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,057
that I will work hard
until I see them again.

67
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,225
Yes.

68
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:56,896
It's better that you rest for a while
and fully recover.

69
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,865
Yes.

70
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,933
I've already fulfilled my dream

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,435
just by passing the audition.

72
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,273
It's almost as good as having
taken over Hollywood, isn't it?

73
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,578
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

74
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,297
I heard you lost your memory.

75
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,733
Were we so close
that you would know about such things?

76
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,071
Or is she really cheating on me?

77
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,372
You want to get punched again?

78
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,973
"Again"?

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,875
You mean you've hit me before?

80
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,945
You must have been out of your mind.

81
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,114
I have a lawyer now.

82
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,184
Don't ever forget Ra-im.

83
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,252
You even risked your life

84
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
for her.

85
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,225
I risked my life for her?

86
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,630
I risked my life for a girl
with short legs like her?

87
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,277
It must have been an important movie.

88
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,814
It was a miracle

89
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,316
that you created for me.

90
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,551
I did it?

91
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,522
I wanted to do well.

92
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,958
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,261
Okay.

94
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,562
I don't know what you mean.

95
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,464
But if you're sorry,
you can make up for it later.

96
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,266
I'm very exacting

97
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,801
in keeping track of these things.

98
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,170
Anyway,

99
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,006
why do you put your soap inside stockings?

100
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,177
It's to save all the little pieces and...

101
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,050
-What?
-Inside your locker...

102
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,755
Wait, how do I know this?

103
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,258
Have I looked inside your locker?

104
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,326
Yes.

105
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,894
When we switched bodies.

106
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,362
When we switched what?

107
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,964
I'll tell you later.

108
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,866
I think

109
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,768
your memories are coming back.

110
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,271
Do you remember anything else?

111
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,107
Let's see.

112
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,111
I remember you

113
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,783
wearing sexy lingerie and seducing me--

114
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,120
Hey!

115
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,933
It looks like you didn't leave.

116
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,102
I thought you were leaving the country.

117
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,806
You said it wasn't easy to find someone
who knows what you're worth.

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,208
So you decided to stay?

119
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,309
Oska stopped me.

120
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,911
And it worked?

121
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,146
He looked at me

122
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,781
with such desperate eyes.

123
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,151
How romantic.

124
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,055
By the way, how old are you?

125
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,261
Are you showing off

126
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,129
that you're younger than I am?

127
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,968
What going on? Are you fighting?

128
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,905
Why? We should all get along.

129
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,909
He's not actually living here, is he?

130
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,644
I have extra rooms, so why not?

131
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,147
He might run away otherwise.

132
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,949
What if I run away?

133
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,884
I'm leaving.

134
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,186
Where are you going?

135
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,621
I have to tell you something.

136
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,256
We're recording in ten minutes.

137
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,759
If you're late, I'm packing my bags.

138
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,195
Not you too.

139
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,565
Are you guys teaming up against me?

140
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,103
Let's keep this under ten minutes.

141
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,707
I need to ask you something.

142
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,076
Does Tae-seon like men?

143
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,011
Hey, how did you know that?

144
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,047
You knew and you still let him move in?

145
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,050
Now I have to compete with men too?

146
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,886
It's not like that. He hates me.

147
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,288
This is why you hurt others.
Because you're so dense.

148
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,124
Wow. Your grudges last as long
as the Great Wall of China.

149
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,726
I bet it's visible from space.

150
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,894
How can you joke about this?

151
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,162
Cut me some slack.

152
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,464
It's already hard enough for me
with Joo-won's situation.

153
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,299
Joo-won is still 21.

154
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,735
Still?

155
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,372
What were you going to tell me? Be quick.

156
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,740
Right.

157
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,175
I want to do my music video again,

158
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,579
redo my concert, release my seventh album
and do an Asia Tour.

159
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,314
-So?
-So...

160
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,951
I feel like with your help,
I can succeed in everything.

161
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,455
What are you doing? Are you busy?

162
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,859
What do you want?

163
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,095
I only have five minutes,
so make it quick.

164
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,262
Who is she?

165
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:35,001
How could you allow such a beautiful lady
to be in a rundown place like this?

166
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,571
Pleased to meet you. I'm Kim Joo-won.

167
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,674
You must not remember me.

168
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,276
Do we know each other?

169
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,913
-Why are you so happy?
-She's pretty.

170
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,651
Pardon me for asking,
but how close were we?

171
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,153
Hey! It wasn't like that!

172
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,922
She's with me, you punk.

173
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,891
Really? Is he serious?

174
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,663
Your mother is here.

175
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,064
She is?

176
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,699
I'll be right back.

177
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,902
You better not come back!

178
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,640
We should've met when he was 21.

179
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,776
What?

180
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,244
Hey!

181
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,850
Mom.

182
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,522
I just wanted to check up on you.

183
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,524
Are you hurting anywhere?

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,425
No.

185
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,327
You already called me earlier.

186
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,730
Get down from there. It's dangerous.

187
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,735
Mom, did you know

188
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,438
that I had a girlfriend?

189
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,539
She's a stuntwoman.

190
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,711
Of course I know.

191
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:52,712
Really?

192
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,716
But she doesn't act superficial
like all the other girls.

193
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,552
Her body's not that great though.

194
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,589
Right? I don't think she's that great.

195
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,724
What's this?

196
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,526
You don't like her, do you?

197
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,963
If I don't, will you stop seeing her?

198
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,699
No! I like her.

199
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,805
I'll get going.

200
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,674
Wait, Mom.

201
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,477
I was wondering...

202
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,678
A few days ago...

203
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,714
I mean, 13 years ago.

204
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:34,120
Anyway, what happened to the firefighter
who rescued me from the elevator?

205
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,821
Was he hurt?

206
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,926
Would it be weird
if I went to thank him now?

207
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,796
Of course.

208
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,267
It may feel like yesterday to you,
but it was 13 years ago for us.

209
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,871
I already took care of that,
so don't worry about that.

210
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,105
Still.

211
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,674
Do you know his contact information?
Or even his name.

212
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,778
If you insist, I'll find out for you.

213
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,946
I'll find out and let you know.

214
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,684
I'm going to Deoksan later.
I'll call you tomorrow.

215
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,760
Really?

216
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,162
Is that true?

217
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:21,467
Yes.
Everything about your dream came true.

218
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:27,006
The storm, the white snow,
the fancy table...

219
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,709
You should make a career out of this.

220
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,413
Oh, no.

221
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,282
What is it?

222
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,419
I had another dream last night.

223
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,522
What kind of dream?

224
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,359
No, I don't want to say.
You said all my dreams came true. No.

225
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,562
What was it?

226
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,996
Was it bad?

227
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,565
What happened in it?

228
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,770
These three children,
all dressed in white,

229
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,573
were in front of this big black door.

230
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,007
They were crying so hard.

231
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,179
And Joo-won was on the side bawling too,

232
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,481
and you were yelling.

233
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,986
Then I woke up. But it didn't feel good.

234
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,525
It's me. Can you open the door?

235
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,926
It's Mr. Kim!

236
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,733
Hold on.

237
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,769
The CEO asked me to bring you again.

238
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,440
Why can't he come
instead of ordering me around?

239
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,674
Little punk.

240
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,644
Where is it this time?

241
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,317
You're dead meat.
Why did you call me to a place like this?

242
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,621
Why else? So that I can see your body.

243
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,157
Your outfit is very defiant, however.

244
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,627
You're such a kid.

245
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,731
Life is all flowers and sunshine now that
I haven't beaten you in a while, huh?

246
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,033
I don't know how I was when I was 34,

247
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,102
but this is how I have fun at age 21.

248
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,436
Come in.

249
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,843
I'm seriously going to kill you!

250
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,913
-Is this how you had fun at 21?
-Yes.

251
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,181
With who? With girls?

252
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,150
Yes, with pretty girls.

253
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,421
What? You don't know me very well.

254
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,457
Are you sure we were dating?

255
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,060
Then just how well do you know me?

256
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,231
What?
Do you have a lot of men in your life?

257
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,399
You didn't know?

258
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,068
I spend most of my time with men.

259
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,305
-What?
-Generally in bamboo forests,

260
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,508
cars, outdoors, and the like.

261
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,044
Because men like that stuff.

262
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,413
What? Bamboo forests?

263
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,048
Wow!

264
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,883
Is that how you thought I would react?

265
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,352
You can't fool me twice.

266
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,554
-What?
-What?

267
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,790
You just remembered again.

268
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,757
What?

269
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,161
Did I?

270
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,333
I knew you would remember.
I knew you would.

271
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,774
Now that we're like this...

272
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,113
I think I'm starting
to remember something else...

273
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,782
Hands off.

274
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,418
I said I was starting to remember.

275
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,755
I'll just remind you.

276
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,227
We used to do this every other day.
Remember?

277
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,197
Let me go.

278
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,165
Raise your right hand to go back to Seoul.

279
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,767
Raise your left hand to stay.

280
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,235
I can't raise my left hand!

281
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,170
Can I raise my left foot instead?

282
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,328
That's my home.

283
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,699
Over there?

284
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,200
Yes.

285
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,370
Where?

286
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,374
The second-floor one
with the tape on the door.

287
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,517
I don't know if this is good or not,

288
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,419
but you're very consistent.

289
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,456
That was the exact expression you had
when you first saw where I lived.

290
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,690
I'm sure it was.

291
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,195
By any chance,
do you have my phone number too?

292
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,230
Of course. Why?

293
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,231
Delete it!

294
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,989
The lyrics are good.

295
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,159
No wonder you're arrogant.

296
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,130
Don't do things like that.
I'm your producer.

297
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,298
What, kiddo?

298
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,067
I'm only doing it because you're so cute.

299
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,735
Stop!

300
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,343
I'm not giving you the song.
Give it. I'm not doing this.

301
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,812
Put that down right now.

302
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,249
Look at this boy,
thinking lightly of contracts.

303
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,920
You signed a contract.
Those tactics don't work anymore.

304
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,623
Let's decide on how you should address me.

305
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,059
One, Mr. Oska.

306
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,760
Two, Mr. U-yeong.

307
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,562
Three, Oskod,

308
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,431
which combines Oska and god.

309
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,565
Fourth--

310
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,534
-Oskar.
-Right, Oskar...

311
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,870
What? You punk!

312
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,971
What's the matter?

313
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,773
Who is this?

314
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,642
My cousin.

315
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,445
Are you going to wear that again?

316
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,482
The subconscious is a terrifying thing.

317
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,684
Hey, you.

318
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,954
What do you think of this?

319
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,656
You aren't the only person in the world.

320
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,958
-Why make other people's eyes suffer?
-What?

321
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,161
Who is this punk?

322
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,730
He's the producer for my 7.1 album.

323
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,865
What happened to our music industry?

324
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,534
You're releasing a seventh album?

325
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,203
It's your cousin
who made the industry like this.

326
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,972
You can't side with me.
You're his producer.

327
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,041
It's our job to make accurate judgments.

328
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,778
If my jacket causes your eyes to suffer,
you have really pathetic vision.

329
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,848
You shouldn't be judging anything
with eyes like that.

330
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,684
Are you trying to argue about fashion
with me, a former model?

331
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,320
Do I look like someone who would argue
with someone like you?

332
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,255
I own a department store.

333
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,424
Wow, Kim Joo-won.

334
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,960
I don't know if it's because you're 21,
but you've got game.

335
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,296
You guys should become friends.

336
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,363
Geez.

337
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,901
I have something to ask you,
so answer me honestly.

338
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,903
It keeps bothering me.

339
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,106
What kind of person is Gil Ra-im?

340
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,208
Ra-im?

341
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,411
-Well, for starters, she's my fan.
-What?

342
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:14,846
Never mind.

343
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,582
I can see what she likes.

344
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,251
I can't be with her
even if my memory returns.

345
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,955
Hey! What do you mean by that?

346
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,701
Please have some tea.

347
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,603
I have plenty of tea at home.

348
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,871
I'll get straight to the point.

349
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,008
I don't want to hear any excuses

350
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,644
like you didn't know
U-yeong and Joo-won were cousins!

351
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,946
Something like this
is intolerable in our family.

352
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,784
So you'll marry U-yeong
while you were set up with Joo-won?

353
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,790
Mom, what are you doing?

354
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,826
It's what I always do.
What's the big surprise?

355
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,695
Mom, you're scaring her.

356
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,530
She gets hurt easily.

357
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,168
I'm working really hard to impress her.
What if she starts hating me?

358
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,005
What? What did you say?

359
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,908
You fool!

360
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,311
What did you hit me for?

361
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,513
I've liked this woman
for a really long time.

362
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,716
Then why did you pretend you didn't know
each other at the family gathering?

363
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,151
And you, miss!

364
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,188
Why did you try to get with Joo-won
when you're in a relationship with my son?

365
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,191
It's all because of me. It's my fault.

366
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,660
Why are you yelling at Seul?

367
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,896
Goodness! You foolish idiot.

368
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,769
Mother.

369
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,873
Instead of doing this here,
why don't we go grab a drink?

370
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,008
What?

371
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,159
To be frank,

372
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,762
isn't my son better than Jang Dong-gun?

373
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,440
Not Jang Dong-gun, Mother.

374
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,909
Why not? In what way?

375
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,778
Do you know how many girls
are head over heels in love with U-yeong?

376
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,681
More are in love with Jang Dong-gun.

377
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,659
You're really something, aren't you?

378
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,433
How could I be U-yeong's girlfriend
if I wasn't?

379
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,634
Anyway,

380
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:54,873
how can I take you as my daughter-in-law
when you were almost wed to my nephew?

381
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,443
I went through so much raising my son.

382
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:03,448
At least he is your son.
He's a complete stranger to me,

383
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,053
yet I've been like this since I was 21.
Imagine what I went through.

384
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,095
That's just how amazing he is.

385
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,066
I stopped drinking,
because it made my skin dry.

386
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,868
What do I do now?

387
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,275
We're quite alike.

388
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,612
I always have to battle dry skin as well.

389
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,219
Goodness.

390
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,256
Your aesthetic standards are similar
to mine.

391
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,358
This is driving me crazy.

392
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,295
Are you going to keep at this?

393
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,230
You're still here?

394
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,366
Sing something if you're bored.

395
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,536
Call the band!

396
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,708
Really?

397
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,677
Are they done?

398
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:07,813
Are they very drunk?

399
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,114
Who's more drunk?

400
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,749
Hold on.

401
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,887
What? 1,300,000 won?

402
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,257
Hey! Who told you to pay
with the company card?

403
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,193
Am I schmoozing them?
Is this part of my job?

404
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,160
Tell my mom to pay!

405
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,396
What's going on?
Is your mother schmoozing someone?

406
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,865
What? "Round two"?

407
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,967
I can't believe this.

408
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,970
First, get them in the same car,
and bring them here!

409
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,507
What do you mean, "Who first?"
Whoever's closer to you!

410
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,242
Why? What's going on?

411
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,543
Where's Jong-heon?

412
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,215
He's a civilian casualty
in a full-scale war.

413
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,084
Why did you call me here?

414
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,054
You're the new face
of the Quit Smoking campaign.

415
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,557
Face of what?

416
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,561
You want me to become
a role model for the youth?

417
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,497
Shouldn't you do that at least once
in your lifetime?

418
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,631
Why you...

419
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,070
Wait. If I'm the face...

420
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,173
So does this mean that my image
is being restored?

421
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,676
If I tell people not to smoke,
then they'll listen?

422
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,013
Wow!

423
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,649
How can people forgive so quickly?

424
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,620
What should I wear tomorrow?

425
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:29,094
SINGER OSKA'S QUIT SMOKING CAMPAIGN

426
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,502
Please face the front.

427
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,007
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

428
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,013
You're not ready for this yet.

429
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,149
You can't be out in the cold like this.

430
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,885
If you're not careful now,
the pain will last a lifetime.

431
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,253
Do you want some seaweed soup?

432
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,790
Did I give birth or something?

433
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,725
Stand still.

434
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,094
Ra-im.

435
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,996
Your recovery rate is incredible.

436
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,664
Still, seaweed soup wouldn't hurt.

437
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,133
If I catch you, you're dead.

438
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,336
Hello!

439
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,105
I'm not falling for that!

440
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,107
I'm not!

441
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,575
I won't!

442
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,217
Hi!

443
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,087
Hello, everyone.

444
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,254
Hello.

445
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,623
I'm Oska.

446
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,528
How are things with 21-year-old Joo-won?
Do you see him often?

447
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,100
He's hot-blooded and perverted.

448
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,836
It's so cute.

449
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,004
Cute?

450
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,207
I didn't know you were like that.

451
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,541
Do you like perverted men?

452
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,682
I've dated so many women,
yet I still know nothing about them.

453
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,618
Be careful,
or else Joo-won may humiliate you.

454
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,723
He's continuing to remember things.

455
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,393
Really? Is that true?

456
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,997
That's great...

457
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,968
But does that mean he'll ask for
his watches and shoes back?

458
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,505
Should I sell them
before he takes them back?

459
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,616
It's been a while since I drove you home.

460
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,419
Does this mean our fan meetings
are back on?

461
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,088
What kind of singer
desires his fan this much?

462
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,358
I knew it. You just have to wait
until their popularity drops.

463
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,094
Wait... Don't you know?

464
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,930
I'm quickly returning to the peak
of my popularity.

465
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,533
I'm not just a Korean Wave star anymore.

466
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:26,304
Have you heard of a Korean wave star
who can influence his country's health?

467
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,676
What a sight.

468
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:32,877
You scared me.

469
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,185
See?

470
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,353
His subconscious remembers.

471
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,022
You're not really his fan, are you?

472
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,992
What kind of star takes
an individual fan home?

473
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,894
You said you love me.

474
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,163
You said we love each other.

475
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,833
How many others are there?

476
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:02,474
Oskie, you came all the way here,
so come inside for tea like always.

477
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,876
Of course. Let's go.

478
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,480
Watch the stairs.

479
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,082
That's good. You walk so well, Ra-im.

480
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,485
Those two!

481
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,453
Stop right there, you two!

482
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,922
Stop locking arms! Hey!

483
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,258
How many times must I tell you
not to ignore me?

484
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,029
I beg you, please don't get caught by me!

485
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,165
Why am I a secretary?

486
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,574
He just went inside her house.

487
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,575
All right.

488
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,944
I got it.

489
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,085
FIREFIGHTER DIES WHILE PUTTING OUT FIRE

490
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,922
Seeing as how you're making me
hit rock bottom,

491
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,359
you really are a special type
of wretched brat.

492
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,830
Cafe-style coffee is indubitably the best.

493
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,333
Two, two, two. And three sugars for me.

494
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,268
Sure.

495
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:06,971
What's that?

496
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,708
You were dating me,
so why do you have a picture of U-yeong?

497
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,112
Were you two seriously in a relationship?

498
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,648
What if we were?

499
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,649
You were?

500
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,051
Then I call dibs on Yoon Seul.

501
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:24,422
The perfect figure. 36-24-34.

502
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,557
-Hey!
-What?

503
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,825
You little punk.

504
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,795
Go, Oskie!

505
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,631
"Oskie"?

506
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,234
So you two really were dating!
Why are you doing this to me?

507
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,236
Someone's calling me.

508
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,572
It better not be Seul.

509
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,143
-Yes?
-It's Mom.

510
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,447
Remember the firefighter you asked about?

511
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,716
Yes. Did you find out?

512
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,919
I thought it might be hard on you,
so I couldn't say it before,

513
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,691
but that firefighter died on the job.

514
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,994
How?

515
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,430
Was it because of me?

516
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,898
Wait until I finish.

517
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,236
His name was Gil Ik-seon.

518
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,905
He has a daughter.

519
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,576
And her name is Gil Ra-im.

520
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,448
She's probably sitting right
in front of you.

521
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,652
What's wrong? Who is it?

522
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,320
Go on.

523
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,522
You'll know when your memory comes back,

524
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,460
but she came onto you
to avenge her father's death.

525
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,864
She is trying to tie you down
by exploiting her own deceased father

526
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,400
to make you feel guilty.

527
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:48,273
I hope you can make the right decision,
even if it's now.

528
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,679
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

529
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,884
U-yeong, I'm sorry,
but could you give us some privacy?

530
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,552
Why? Who was that?

531
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,321
I need to talk to her.

532
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:04,923
All right.

533
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,357
I'll talk to you later.

534
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,360
Okay, bye.

535
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,198
What is it?

536
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,667
Was your father

537
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,602
a firefighter?

538
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,007
You remember?

539
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,175
And he passed away?

540
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,444
-Yes.
-Was his death

541
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,281
related to my elevator accident?

542
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,885
How did you know?

543
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,754
Was that call

544
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,590
from your mother?

545
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,865
I should go now.

546
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,635
Wait. Listen to what I have to say first.

547
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:51,669
By the way,

548
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,339
why do you live in a place like this?

549
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,240
Did you really go out with me?

550
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,944
I would never date someone
who lives like this, but if I had,

551
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,981
I wouldn't have left her
in a place like this.

552
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,652
A lot of things happened.

553
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,822
I'll explain everything--

554
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,190
No. Don't.

555
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,093
I need to remember this on my own.

556
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,895
You downright deceived me,

557
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,865
and if you try to again this time...

558
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,370
I just might want to be deceived.

559
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,197
Wait.

560
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,334
What is the cash lying next to my bed?

561
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,702
How come no one has taken care of it?

562
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,170
The 45,000 won?

563
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,673
That's money that you cherish very much.

564
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,808
What?

565
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,478
I cherish spending 45,000 won? Me?

566
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,415
No, you genuinely cherish it.

567
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,684
There are several other items
that you cherish as well.

568
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,583
PRESIDENT KIM

569
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,784
Not again!

570
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,420
Hello?

571
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,222
What's with the attitude?

572
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,691
Is this
how last-minute secretary hires are?

573
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,461
You didn't hire me last-minute.

574
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,062
If you keep doing this, I'm going to--

575
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,230
Going to what?

576
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,532
Going to do better, just so you know...

577
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,968
Why did you call?

578
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,075
I have some unidentified things with me.

579
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,744
Can you tell me
why I have a vacuum cleaner?

580
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,980
And there's a fruit basket.

581
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,716
Why are these petty things special to me?

582
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,857
Sir! How would I know that?

583
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,391
I knew it.

584
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,594
You got this job through connections.

585
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,129
I'm hanging up.

586
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,539
You little punk!

587
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,109
Even when he's younger he depends on me.

588
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,211
Has his memory come back yet?

589
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,513
No.

590
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,083
This is a secret at work.

591
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,418
Then who's doing the actual work?

592
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,222
You can say

593
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,059
that I do most of it.

594
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,731
You know how he always depends on me.

595
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,467
I see.

596
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,436
It would be easier on Ra-im
if he recovered soon.

597
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,444
Do you do that in front of other guys too?

598
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,546
Do what?

599
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,182
I'll wipe it off.

600
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,185
No, I'm going to.

601
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:38,963
Hey!

602
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,234
I never gave you permission!

603
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,970
I never saw anyone

604
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,473
ask for permission in TV shows.

605
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,448
Come out for a second.
I'm outside your office.

606
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,623
What's taking her so long?

607
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,079
Why didn't you just come in?

608
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,414
Because the weather's so nice.

609
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,749
Here.

610
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,387
And here.

611
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,757
-What are you doing?
-Let's take a walk.

612
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:40,791
Just like New Yorkers.

613
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,195
What are you doing? People will see us.

614
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,830
I want them to see.

615
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,736
If we walk like this, we look like models.

616
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,139
That's because I'm even prettier
than Miss Korea.

617
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,278
-You're so hot!
-Oskie!

618
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,512
He must be dating.

619
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,647
Let's take a photo.

620
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,817
You're so handsome.

621
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,854
Don't you have any sunglasses?

622
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,722
Put them on.

623
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,725
-Isn't that Oska?
-Who's that with him?

624
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,494
Yes, I'm Oska.

625
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,262
Yes, I'm dating someone.

626
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,332
Isn't she the one
who had a scandal with him?

627
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,401
Yes, it's Yoon Seul.

628
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,770
We'll build a wonderful relationship.

629
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,306
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

630
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,644
Did you know this is the first time
we've held hands and walked like this?

631
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,947
Let's enjoy what everyone else does now.

632
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,220
We'll go on strolls like this,
I'll drive you home,

633
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,556
and when my song gets number one,

634
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,260
I'll shout out, "Seul, I love you!" on TV.

635
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,162
Even if you try to stop me.

636
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,331
Oskie!

637
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,535
Hi. Want an autograph?

638
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,136
This isn't why I bought

639
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,740
every single one of your albums
and even your socks.

640
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,275
This is betrayal.

641
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,811
I'm not an idol star.

642
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,946
I'm 36 years old.

643
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,716
Let me be in love now.

644
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,919
And when have I ever not dated?

645
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,722
Doing it secretly is different
from doing it publicly.

646
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,056
How could you do this?

647
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,958
What's his manager doing? Is he crazy?

648
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,260
Just move onto 2PM.

649
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,364
Or what about BEAST? They're pretty cool.

650
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,733
Drink this.

651
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,434
Let's go.

652
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,721
She tried to tie you down
by exploiting her own deceased father

653
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,757
to make you feel guilty.

654
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,723
AND THE LITTLE MERMAID TURNED TO FOAM
AND DISAPPEARED

655
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:34,665
"And the little mermaid turned to foam,
and was about to disappear

656
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,369
when the prince discovered the truth,
and asked the princess,

657
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,504
"Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?"

658
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:45,342
Then he broke off the engagement
and ran back to the little mermaid.

659
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,778
However, the little mermaid had become

660
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:51,816
rich from her invention
of the air bubble washing machine.

661
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,053
The prince lost all his fortune
to a bad investment,

662
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,923
and became the mermaid's secretary.

663
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:03,294
And the two simply lived ever after."

664
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,197
What is this?

665
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,900
What nutcase wrote this ridiculous thing?

666
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,376
But this is my handwriting.

667
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,547
I'm sure it is.

668
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,749
But what is this?

669
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,556
Rather than that,

670
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,992
should I just stay quietly beside you,

671
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,262
then disappear like foam?

672
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,498
Just like the little mermaid.

673
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,235
The little mermaid?

674
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm telling you
to just stick around quietly,

675
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,809
then disappear like foam.

676
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,353
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE
FIRE SAFETY ASSOCIATION

677
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,576
Dad...

678
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,316
Dad...

679
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,627
It was Ra-im.

680
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,866
That girl

681
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,303
was Ra-im.

682
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,559
Where are you?

683
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,029
Ra-im, where are you right now?

684
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,738
What is it? What's going on?

685
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,412
Did something happen?

686
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,881
What is it? What's going on?

687
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,984
If you have a misunderstanding
about my dad,

688
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,887
I'll explain everything.

689
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,225
The truth is

690
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,761
my dad...

691
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,103
Is it not

692
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,205
about him?

693
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,542
Then why are you here?

694
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,213
To do this.

695
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,716
Did you

696
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,985
get your memory back?

697
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,921
Do you remember everything?

698
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,923
No.

699
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,029
No?

700
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,099
But just now--

701
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,367
I'm going on a blind date.

702
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,136
What?

703
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,204
Why? Why would you do that?

704
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,941
You really did like me!

705
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:19,977
I don't know.

706
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,714
It has less credibility
the more you insist on it.

707
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:29,019
If you could force love this way,
every love in the world would be fake.

708
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,858
No matter how I look at it,
you're not my type.

709
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,495
It makes no sense
that I liked someone like you.

710
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,498
Kim Joo-won.

711
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,036
What exactly did you do to me?

712
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,938
Whether it's background, education,
or looks,

713
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,840
you have no qualifications whatsoever,

714
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,643
and yet you dare make me
openly cling onto you?

715
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,484
Since when were you so unintelligent?

716
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,152
Since last year?

717
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,955
You should have gotten it by now.

718
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,197
Woman, why would I be here
this late at night?

719
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,766
It's because I remember everything.

720
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,386
Sorry.

721
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,390
I was just joking
so you would be happier about it.

722
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,129
You're so dead.

723
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,198
I'm going to kill you.

724
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,036
That hurts. Hold on.

725
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,505
I still have something important
to tell you.

726
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,506
What?

727
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,009
What is it, you jerk?

728
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,289
I love you.

729
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,192
This one's from me.

730
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,195
I don't need it, you jerk.

731
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,242
"l love you with all my heart."

732
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,845
This one

733
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,080
is from your father.

734
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,348
I don't need...

735
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:43,620
What?

736
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,626
Help!

737
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,797
Is anyone out there?

738
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,032
I...

739
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,101
I was trapped inside an elevator.

740
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,611
I had hurt my ankle,
so I couldn't even stand up.

741
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,515
-Because of the smoke, I couldn't breathe.
-Someone help!

742
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,287
Overcome with the fear of death,

743
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,656
all that I could do

744
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,059
was scream for help.

745
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,831
I prayed that someone would hear me
and come rescue me.

746
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,133
Chief!

747
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,639
It looks like there's no one else,
so start evacuating.

748
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,108
But I'll check one more time, so go!

749
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,142
Yes, sir!

750
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,081
Dear God.

751
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,683
When I receive your calling,

752
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,553
please give me the power to save one soul

753
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,424
no matter how strong the fire may be.

754
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,843
The moment I thought was my last,

755
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,147
the elevator door miraculously opened.

756
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,518
And a firefighter

757
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,524
reached his hand out towards me.

758
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:45,842
Hey.

759
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,079
Here.

760
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,954
Are you injured?

761
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,536
Take a deep breath.

762
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,137
Keep breathing.

763
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,942
Get up.

764
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,612
It's too hot in here, isn't it?

765
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,559
Are you okay?

766
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,428
The door closed.

767
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:39,930
What do we do?

768
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,331
Don't worry.

769
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,534
I need to get out of here too.

770
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,937
I have a daughter waiting at home.

771
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,118
What... It's not opening.

772
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:06,957
Requesting help.

773
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,626
There is an injured male
trapped inside the elevator.

774
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,094
Requesting help.

775
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,295
Which one?

776
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,998
-Chief!
-Here.

777
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,733
Hey!

778
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,503
Hello?

779
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,208
The one to the right of the annex
for odd floors.

780
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,279
Hello?

781
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,049
-It's not working.
-Keep trying.

782
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,885
I used it too sparingly.

783
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,059
Even as I advance into the hellish flames,
dear God,

784
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:49,065
I am still afraid,
and I pray for the rain to come.

785
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,002
-And...
-Hello?

786
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,706
If your will is for my life to end...

787
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:02,212
Hello?

788
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,153
You saw how good I am, right?

789
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,655
Come here.

790
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,828
I'll boost you, so go up first.

791
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:30,240
When we get out of here,
I'll introduce you to my Ra-im.

792
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,809
She's so pretty that you'll faint.

793
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,152
Hurry. Put this on.

794
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:43,787
Quick.

795
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,796
Grab my hand.

796
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:12,782
Grab my hand.

797
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,484
Hurry.

798
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,372
No.

799
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,011
Don't do this.

800
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:16,946
No.

801
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,048
Let go.

802
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,550
My weight could drag you down.

803
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,753
Stay low, and run to your right.
That's the exit.

804
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,255
No, I'm not going to leave.

805
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,025
Grab on. Hurry. Grab my hand.

806
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,560
Get out of here.

807
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,096
Get out of here and tell my daughter...

808
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,967
I'm sorry that I was late.

809
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,971
Tell her I love her.

810
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,874
That her dad

811
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,813
loves her with all his heart.

812
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,616
Tell her.

813
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,851
Please.

814
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,587
Please, grab on.

815
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,357
Grab my hand!

816
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,770
Tell her for me.

817
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,006
Don't do this.

818
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,409
Please!

819
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,144
Watch out!

820
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,212
No!

821
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,180
No!

822
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,817
No!

823
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,657
No...

824
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:38,128
No!

825
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,733
No...

826
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,609
Those

827
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:55,912
were

828
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,715
his last words.

829
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:11,661
I'm sorry.

830
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,833
I'm sorry it took me so long

831
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,438
to tell you what he said.

832
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,822
I'm sorry.

833
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:43,993
No.

834
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,831
Thank you.

835
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,837
Thank you so much for letting me know

836
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,874
just how much I was loved.

837
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,377
Thank you.

838
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,545
GIL IK-SEON
1958-1997

839
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,257
I'm so sorry I was so late

840
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,793
in delivering your final words

841
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:55,999
and your final will.

842
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,669
I apologize for

843
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,905
taking so long.

844
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,308
I tried to tell her,

845
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,179
but I just couldn't.

846
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,385
Please forgive me.

847
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,288
And

848
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,425
thank you so much

849
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,695
for saving my life.

850
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,036
Your daughter

851
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,505
has grown up wonderfully.

852
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,044
I know I don't deserve her,

853
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,013
but if you entrust her to me,

854
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,116
I promise to live

855
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,319
as Gil Ra-im's man

856
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,388
happily ever after.

857
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,678
GIL IK-SEON

858
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,099
Would your father have liked me?

859
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:37,600
Definitely not.

860
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,704
What kind of father would like a guy
who always looks down on his daughter

861
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,306
and makes her cry?

862
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,475
Hey. Then what am I supposed to do now?

863
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,876
What do you mean?

864
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,145
There's only one thing to do.

865
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,649
You love me to death,

866
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,986
and I'll love you like crazy.

867
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,624
But what did you mean back there?

868
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,028
When you said you had tried to tell me
my father's last words but couldn't.

869
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,130
That was between me and him.

870
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,464
Why do you want to know?

871
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:10,733
For obvious reasons. What did he say?

872
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,302
If you're that curious, ask your dad.

873
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,538
We have somewhere to go tomorrow.

874
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,941
Wear your prettiest outfit
and wait for me to pick you up. Bye.

875
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,177
Tomorrow? Where are we going?

876
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,883
Ji-hyeon dropped by.

877
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:30,119
I'm so happy to hear

878
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,122
that your memory is back.

879
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:34,957
Are you

880
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:36,859
really?

881
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:39,896
Aren't you afraid?

882
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,165
I...

883
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:44,934
I trust my son.

884
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,369
I trusted you too,

885
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,805
but you were wicked to the very end.

886
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,675
You were wicked to Ra-im and to me,

887
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,078
but you were the most wicked to yourself.

888
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,014
How could you lie
about something like that?

889
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,949
What's wrong with such a tiny lie?

890
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,285
I was about to lose my son!
So what if I lied a bit?

891
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,286
No.

892
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,788
You weren't always right,

893
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:10,359
but even when you weren't,
you kept your pride and were dignified.

894
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,795
And I loved that about you.

895
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,768
But through this, you lost your pride,
and you have lost me.

896
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,437
-Kim Joo-won...
-So from now on,

897
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:23,606
I will no longer live as your son.

898
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,242
-Kim Joo-won!
-I apologize,

899
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,779
but since I've lived 34 years as your son,

900
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,948
I shall now live the rest of my life

901
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,050
as her husband.

902
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,159
