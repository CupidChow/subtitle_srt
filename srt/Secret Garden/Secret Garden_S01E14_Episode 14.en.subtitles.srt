1
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,881
Your fairy godmother's magic stops here.

2
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,927
Did you wait for me a long time?

3
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,931
Why would I wait for you?

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,833
Come with me. I remembered something.

5
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,301
U-yeong.

6
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,470
How are you?

7
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,838
Don't say hi to me.

8
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,540
I don't like you.

9
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,175
Go play with Joo-won.

10
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,127
Where have you been?

11
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,662
I'm right here.

12
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,030
Why didn't you answer the phone?

13
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,232
That's why I'm here.

14
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,801
I'm still mad at you. Don't move.

15
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,143
You're wearing a pretty dress.

16
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,778
Did your fairy godmother help you?

17
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,014
Are you going to disappear

18
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,218
when the clock strikes twelve?

19
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,387
That's

20
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,057
up to you.

21
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,136
Here, a cheesecake.

22
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,941
This isn't you either?

23
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,745
Didn't you say you like it,
but you don't eat it since you'll get fat?

24
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,749
Who said that?

25
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,185
So is she skinny?

26
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,822
So it wasn't you.

27
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,826
Chocolate is definitely not you, right?

28
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,564
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,100
What do you want from me?

30
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,369
I'm trying to remember everything.

31
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,237
And I will find everything one day.

32
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,741
I will make everything like it used to be.

33
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,476
I'm hungry.

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,278
Do you want to share?

35
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,851
Answer me.

36
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,786
What does this mean?

37
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,823
Don't make me nervous.

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,128
I wanted to come in,

39
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,798
but I couldn't, so I just stood outside.

40
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,601
And then

41
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,770
my fairy godmother

42
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,505
told me to go and say it.

43
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,908
That I'm here to see you.

44
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,844
I promised your mother

45
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,080
in the name of my late father.

46
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,618
That I'd never see you again.

47
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,020
My body

48
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,189
has turned away

49
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,692
but my heart can't leave you.

50
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,428
I know if I see you again,

51
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,197
my life will be very difficult.

52
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,700
But rather than

53
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,236
suffering the pain
of not being able to see you,

54
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,404
I think it'll be easier to deal

55
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,441
with the pain of being with you.

56
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,980
So I came to see you.

57
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,983
This is my answer.

58
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,985
But

59
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,221
I won't be a little mermaid.

60
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,825
So

61
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,561
you answer me too.

62
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,264
Is a little mermaid

63
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,001
the only thing I can be?

64
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,675
How are you?

65
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,021
I didn't know
that you were a customer of ours.

66
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,555
I 'm not, but my mother is.

67
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,792
She has an engagement today.
So I came for her.

68
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,496
-Did I surprise you?
-I didn't expect to see you again.

69
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,733
This is Yoo Gyeong-ran,
from the last blind date I had.

70
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,776
I'm touched.

71
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,412
You remembered my name.

72
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,750
I have an excellent memory.

73
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,456
I'm sorry for interrupting you
in the middle of your conversation.

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,992
-You're not interrupting.
-Really?

75
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,495
Then, may I talk with him for a second?

76
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,297
-That is...
-Oh,

77
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,967
let me take care of her.
You two go back to your conversation.

78
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,203
Ms. Yoo Gyeong-ran?

79
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,407
Someone wants to talk to you over there.

80
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,843
Okay.

81
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,512
Please excuse me.

82
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,148
Who wants to talk to me?

83
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,090
I saw her just once on the blind date.

84
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,359
The one that you found out about.

85
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,995
So you've already punished me over this--

86
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,197
It doesn't matter.

87
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,198
Because

88
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,533
you haven't answered my question yet.

89
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,569
So

90
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,437
I want you to answer

91
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,172
my question now.

92
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,309
Here you are.
Why don't we have a drink together?

93
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,812
Who is she?

94
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,581
I haven't seen her before.

95
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,151
-Why don't you introduce her?
-You won't see her again.

96
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,486
Go play with someone else.

97
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,321
Why not?

98
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,790
It's a small world.

99
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,692
Right?

100
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,361
The likes of you will never meet her.

101
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,831
Because she's an amazing woman.

102
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,601
This woman

103
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,070
drives like a car racer.

104
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,939
When she sees a theft
or sexual harassment,

105
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,144
she'll throw a punch for the victim,
even if they're a total stranger.

106
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,947
She's poor
and her body is covered in scars,

107
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,718
but she doesn't want to spend
a second with the likes of us.

108
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,254
That's what she's like.

109
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,191
I've never seen anyone so amazing.

110
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,928
This is

111
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,997
my answer.

112
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,927
I'll get going.

113
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,762
I'll see you later.

114
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,338
You know how to speak English?

115
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,007
They're lines from Dark Blood.

116
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm preparing for the audition.

117
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,147
If Oskie hadn't dressed me in this,

118
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,850
his fifth vertebrae
would've become his sixth.

119
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,818
He dressed you like this?

120
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,953
Himself?

121
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,893
Why are we out here?

122
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,028
Who wants to see me?

123
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,434
-I do.
-Excuse me?

124
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,839
What's the meaning of this?

125
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,242
Do you like watching dramas?

126
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,678
One of my favorites is Gossip Girl.

127
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,248
This is a classic line from the drama.

128
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,818
"I'm the crazy bitch around here."

129
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,421
What you were trying to pull with
Kim Joo-won just now,

130
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,725
I already did all that a few months ago.

131
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,263
One woman who flirts with Kim Joo-won
merely because of her background

132
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,533
is enough.

133
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,568
Don't interfere

134
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,304
when they've just opened up to each other.

135
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,407
Just

136
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,043
quietly enjoy the party and leave. Okay?

137
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,926
I got this song right, didn't I?

138
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,968
Everyone is looking at us.

139
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,069
Of course they are.

140
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,373
I just kissed a poor stuntwoman.

141
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,942
If you know anyone that has shares

142
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,345
in my department store,

143
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,813
tell them to sell right away.

144
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,050
The CEO has fallen for a woman

145
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,118
and is ruining

146
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,988
the greatest business merger
in the company's history.

147
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,581
About that recent incident
with your title track...

148
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,884
Don't even talk about that.
My skin looked like fine china before.

149
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,185
But since then,

150
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,789
it's more like earthenware,
or something like that.

151
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,961
Then when will you officially release
your seventh album?

152
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,162
Are you curious?

153
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,066
If you give me your phone number,
I'll message you.

154
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,937
This is why you're close to
Lee Jun-hyeok, right?

155
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,075
I just interviewed him
for his return to Korea.

156
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,611
Jun-hyeok is back in Korea?

157
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,845
You didn't know?

158
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,381
He said he arrived a week ago.

159
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,826
LEE JUN-HYEOK IS BACK

160
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,896
SHOCKING LOVE TRIANGLE CONFESSION

161
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,666
A love triangle? You wish.

162
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,673
Is she going to be your wife?

163
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,110
She could have been my wife instead.

164
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,779
You're not serious with her,

165
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,015
right?

166
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,051
What's wrong?

167
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,487
-Are you okay?
-She heard it.

168
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,555
Seul heard it all.

169
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,523
Excuse me?

170
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,691
Heard what?

171
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,663
Where are you going?
Aren't you going to check your photos?

172
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,418
What is this about? Director!

173
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,127
JONG-HEON

174
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,698
I just need an hour. Don't call me.

175
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,832
That's not it.

176
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,901
You're the top search
on the search engines.

177
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,569
It's because of Lee Jun-hyeok.

178
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,238
If reporters call to ask
about the love triangle...

179
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,175
What?

180
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,710
What do you mean?

181
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,779
What is it now?

182
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,147
What else did the composer do?

183
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,750
That's why I told you not to hire
a rookie composer.

184
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:29,555
She did an interview and said
you knew the song was plagiarized.

185
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,223
She said you showed her the original

186
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,326
and asked her to make it similar!

187
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,294
What?

188
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,395
When did I do that?

189
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,798
It came up on Star Daily an hour ago
and the other sites are picking it up.

190
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,400
There's a crazy amount
of comments as well.

191
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,334
What do you mean?

192
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,570
Do people actually believe
something so ridiculous?

193
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,808
-They do?
-They said they knew it.

194
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,211
They think you incriminated her.

195
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,081
Sue them all for defamation,
and whatever else you can.

196
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,950
I'm going to destroy that composer.

197
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,519
Where is she now?

198
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,121
Where is she?

199
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,462
OSKA KNEW THE SONG WAS PLAGIARISED

200
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,634
THE COMPOSER REFUSED LARGE PAYOUT

201
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,342
Where are you?

202
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,924
So you do care
and you're worried about it after all.

203
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,659
Do I look like someone

204
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,829
who worries about anything?

205
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,400
LOEL DEPARTMENT STORE STOCK PRICE

206
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:59,478
The "Miserable Christmas" event
that you proposed

207
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:05,184
increased this year's Christmas sales
by 30 percent.

208
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,352
It's had an immense effect
on the industry.

209
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,422
Not only the distributors
but also the marketing firms

210
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,026
are all saying that it was one of the best
marketing schemes they've seen.

211
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,161
That was my intention.

212
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:21,867
Mr. Park.

213
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,870
Yes, sir.

214
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,438
What are you doing?

215
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,842
Nothing special.

216
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,947
I heard you were the one
who had the most fun at the VVIP party.

217
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,014
So what?

218
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,317
Excuse me?

219
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,520
By any chance, do you admire me?

220
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,523
Excuse me?

221
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,426
Let's end today's meeting here.

222
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,828
I have a date.

223
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,699
I edited your demo tape.

224
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,501
You can send it as it is.

225
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,237
You didn't have to do...

226
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,771
I'm better at editing than you are.

227
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,442
If you pass the audition,
tell everyone that I helped you.

228
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,744
-Yes.
-You may leave now.

229
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,279
Thank you!

230
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,556
Goodness. You scared me.

231
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,159
Why didn't you answer the phone?

232
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,295
-Where have you been?
-I was talking with the director.

233
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,429
In his office?

234
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,965
Why does he always ask you
to come to his office?

235
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,936
He can come out here and talk.
Why is he calling you to his office?

236
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,872
-He's not even the leader anymore.
-Be quiet.

237
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,441
Hey, Director Hwang!

238
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,411
Why don't you demand an office?
It's your privilege as the leader.

239
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,146
My term doesn't start till January 1st.

240
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,347
Fine,

241
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,349
future leader Director Hwang.

242
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,952
Does my Ra-im have things left to do?

243
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,888
Don't do that.

244
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,192
I want to take her with me now.
Will you allow it?

245
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,359
You need to get

246
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,094
permission from Director Lim.

247
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,496
No thanks.

248
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,698
I always support the newly risen to power.

249
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,767
I'll just take her with me.

250
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,102
Don't lay any responsibility on her.

251
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,071
I told you, don't!

252
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,236
Did you decorate

253
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,670
all this for me?

254
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,407
Don't be too impressed.

255
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,612
This is the attention to detail of
the upper class to sweeten the Christmas

256
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,780
of the poor and alienated neighbor.

257
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,222
From this moment forth,

258
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,158
don't ever relive what happened
at my mother's house.

259
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,228
And remove all the bad memories
of what happened here.

260
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,764
Just remember this moment

261
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,733
as you sleep, eat

262
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,434
and joke around in here.

263
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,938
Thank you.

264
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,740
It's so pretty.

265
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,908
But it seems kind of

266
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,610
thrifty.

267
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,645
What?

268
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,848
That tree isn't the type of tree
that you think it is.

269
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:23,982
I know.

270
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:29,021
It's some organic tree that was raised
leaf by leaf in Norway, right?

271
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,526
When will A-yeong come back home?

272
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,495
Why do you care?

273
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,363
Forget it.

274
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,601
Mr. Kim, it's me.

275
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,671
Have A-yeong take the night shift.
Keep her busy until the morning.

276
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,208
No problem. Have fun then.

277
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,243
Are you out of your mind?

278
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,312
This is so embarrassing!

279
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,783
Why do you think I am doing this?

280
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,619
Hey.

281
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,953
Stay away from me.

282
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,456
This place is so small,
there's nowhere to run.

283
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,291
I mean it.

284
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,559
Stay away.

285
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,428
What? We're two adults.

286
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,364
I'm warning you to stay away from me.

287
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,499
What do you think I'm trying to do?

288
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,235
You're so perverted.

289
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,746
I just wanted to do this.

290
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,848
Just to hold your hands.

291
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,454
Why was this so hard for us,

292
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,823
that I only get to do it now?

293
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:15,994
What is the matter with you?

294
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,663
If I let you off without suing you,
you should've let it go.

295
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,731
How could you do this!

296
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,767
I didn't really mean to.

297
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,168
But

298
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,337
I was right to do it.

299
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,707
See how you're in front of me?

300
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,343
Are you

301
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,811
still gay?

302
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,515
I wondered if sexual preference

303
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:37,783
can change.

304
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,017
Shut your mouth.

305
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,886
Oska didn't do anything wrong.

306
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,088
Why blame others for your lack of talent?

307
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,689
I told you to find another job.

308
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,391
That's exactly what I'm doing.

309
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,394
Including forgetting the likes of you.

310
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,638
That's right. I knew you knew each other.

311
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,875
Why are you acting like this?
What did I do wrong?

312
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,010
You did plenty wrong.

313
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,245
You're a talentless fool

314
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,849
who became a singer because he has
a rich family and nothing better to do.

315
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,654
You don't even know what a good song is
and always go on about it.

316
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,022
Still,

317
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,424
how can you lie to everyone?

318
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,426
Do you have any evidence that I lied?

319
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,228
-What?
-Of course

320
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,297
it's true that I lied.

321
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,399
But people believe me.

322
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,569
You should have taken better care
of your image.

323
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:34,272
No one's in disbelief about this.
They expected it of you.

324
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,374
Is that my fault?

325
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,045
Even though I am a rookie composer,

326
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:44,416
throwing the demo CD in my face saying
the song sucks is a bit mean, isn't it?

327
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,185
When did I ever?

328
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,921
See? You don't even remember it.

329
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,157
I'll give you the fastest solution.

330
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,226
Use your money.

331
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,027
I know you have plenty.

332
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:57,729
So,

333
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,998
you did all this for the money?

334
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,802
I have no future here anyway.
I should at least collect my money.

335
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,539
You can earn a living without your music,
but my circumstances are quite desperate.

336
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,107
Pay me off.

337
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,944
Clearing a Korean Wave star's reputation
is worth quite a bit, right?

338
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,613
If you pay me,

339
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,618
"I did it to survive. I'm sorry.
Oska is a victim."

340
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,620
I'll say that for you.

341
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,599
What's going on?
Why did she do that to you?

342
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,767
I don't know.

343
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,037
Apparently I complained about her song
and threw her CD.

344
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,071
What?

345
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,007
She did all this because of that?

346
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,075
Is she out of her mind?

347
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,212
That means I should've killed myself
long ago because of you.

348
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,448
Irresponsible, selfish, wasteful person

349
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,517
who doesn't even appreciate people...

350
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,557
What does she want then?

351
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,626
-Money.
-I knew it.

352
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,397
How much? Wait, it doesn't matter.
Let's just pay her off and resolve this.

353
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:06,665
No.

354
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,100
Why not?

355
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,137
The thing that Koreans hate the most
is lying.

356
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,839
The worst thing is
lying about the same thing twice.

357
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:20,145
People think that you tried to bribe her
and she's an innocent victim.

358
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,948
If you leave her like this,
you will collapse once and for all.

359
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,316
Then I will collapse.

360
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,018
Cancel the concert
and refund all the tickets.

361
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,854
What are you talking about?
You have to do the concert.

362
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,156
-I can't.
-Why not?

363
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,025
Because I'm irresponsible, selfish
and doesn't appreciate people.

364
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,393
-Is that enough?
-You...

365
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,529
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,997
This is all my fault.

367
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,034
I wish it was all your fault.

368
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,803
But I don't think it is. So leave.

369
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,006
I'm just getting punished
for living like a jerk.

370
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,609
Leave. I want to be alone.

371
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,819
What?

372
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,887
What did he do

373
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,522
in the VVIP party?

374
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,324
Kiss?

375
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,927
All the guests held their breaths.

376
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,731
That crazy fool!

377
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,700
Why did she go there?

378
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,370
I made sure she understood

379
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,605
yet she still did something so vile?

380
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,341
She is asking for it, isn't she?

381
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,311
Call the HR manager right now!

382
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,612
What?

383
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,348
A-yeong is packing her belongings.

384
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,351
-Why did you fire her?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

385
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,121
She just got a call from HR.
Why are you acting like you don't know?

386
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,089
What do you mean?
I didn't do anything like that.

387
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,491
You liar!

388
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,394
I won't be able to work for you anymore.

389
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,296
You asked me last time, didn't you?
What kind of a CEO you were?

390
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,765
I'm answering that question now.

391
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:52,404
You're a rude, cruel, and horrible CEO!

392
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,239
Geez.

393
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,540
I said it wasn't me!

394
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,243
Hurry up and call the HR manager.

395
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,185
Are you sure

396
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,954
you didn't fire her?

397
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,208
How are you?

398
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,876
Do you really want to challenge me?

399
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,914
It hasn't even been a month since
you promised not to see my son anymore!

400
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,950
-About that--
-Don't you dare interrupt me!

401
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,019
This is my warning.

402
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,022
What do you mean?

403
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,824
Your friend will tell you the details.

404
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,925
Can you still be happy

405
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,729
while your friend's life has been ruined?

406
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,866
Don't consider this to be
one of the obstacles of your love.

407
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm telling you
so you won't misunderstand.

408
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,307
This is only the beginning.

409
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,943
Hello?

410
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,077
Wait a minute!

411
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,423
Were you cleaning?

412
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,892
What is that?

413
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,196
What happened to you?

414
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,397
This?

415
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:31,636
I had a showdown with my co-worker
that I didn't like and I quit.

416
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,107
I should have done this earlier.
I feel so relieved.

417
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:41,980
I'll take some time off for a while
and watch my favorite dramas.

418
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,254
I'll be right back.

419
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,222
Where are you going?

420
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,804
I heard what happened.
Let me take care of it.

421
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,072
-I must take care of this.
-And what will you do?

422
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,240
Just go home.

423
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,642
How can I?

424
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,743
A-yeong didn't even tell me

425
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,511
what happened to her.

426
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,313
She said she just quit her job.

427
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,748
So what's your plan?

428
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,216
To tell her you'll break up again?

429
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,452
Why didn't you think of calling me
before coming here?

430
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,754
She's not the CEO.

431
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,522
She's not going to stop here.

432
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,426
She started with A-yeong,
but she could target the action school.

433
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,528
That's why I have to take care of this.

434
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:36,367
Since you've met me,
you must have lost your common sense.

435
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,436
Let me take care of everything.

436
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,606
I'm much more competent than you think.

437
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,674
What are you going to do?

438
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,975
Do you have a plan?

439
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:44,876
Yes.

440
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,912
I'm going to tell my grandfather.

441
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,113
What?

442
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,294
Geez. My car!

443
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,931
Cover the top and wait for me.
The seats can't get wet.

444
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,933
A Spanish artisan sewed it
stitch-by-stitch--

445
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,069
Hey! That's not the issue here.

446
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,749
What?

447
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,718
Why is my face over there again?

448
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,287
Did we exchange bodies? Again?

449
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,124
Why now of all times?

450
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,593
This is driving me crazy.

451
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,618
Now you decide to show up together?

452
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:01,753
Come in!

453
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,187
Speak to me.

454
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,259
What are you going to do with my face?
Let me handle this.

455
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,761
Do it at once.

456
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,830
Don't waste time and come in quickly!

457
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,615
Her friend has nothing to do with it.
This is unfair.

458
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,417
Do you think we're in the Olympics?

459
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,718
Did you think

460
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,286
that I'd play fair in this situation?

461
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,355
Even still, you're so predictable.

462
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,358
You start with friends, then jobs,

463
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,262
then you'll buy off the landlord
and kick me out of this country.

464
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,364
Am I right?

465
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,267
How did you know?

466
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,502
Has this happened before?

467
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,470
No,

468
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,705
this is the first time.

469
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,772
You stay quiet!

470
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,608
Since you

471
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,444
have seen through everything,

472
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,212
are you going to keep seeing each other?

473
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,181
No, I won't see him anymore.

474
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,017
That's right.

475
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,353
I'm going to live with him from now on.

476
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,188
-What?
-Hey?

477
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,090
I can't break up with your son.

478
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,293
This is all for his own good.

479
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,797
If I break up with him,
he may die of sorrow.

480
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:20,965
What?

481
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,900
Die of sorrow?

482
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,002
Ms. Lim A-yeong

483
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,270
has been a hard worker
for the past five years.

484
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,941
Even the family of the CEO
cannot fire someone like her.

485
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,746
If you do anything like this again,
you'll have to deal with the union.

486
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,948
So

487
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,017
just leave us alone.

488
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,220
If you really don't want
to see us together,

489
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,522
we will go live abroad.

490
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,992
Won't you miss your son then?

491
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,362
Is that what you want?

492
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,968
Kim Joo-won,

493
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,736
why are you so quiet?

494
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,439
What do you think of what she said?

495
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,008
I think she's right.

496
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,144
From now on,

497
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:07,945
I will trust her.

498
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:08,880
Wh..

499
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,415
What?

500
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,119
We'll get going.

501
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,754
Let's go.

502
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,824
Goodbye.

503
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,567
What am I going to do with my son?

504
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,504
She's not your average minx.

505
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,074
How could my Joo-won be so...

506
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,876
My Joo-won...

507
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,311
Oh no.

508
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,613
What do I do?

509
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,687
I knew you would do this to her.

510
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:54,358
How could you say that to her?
She hates me enough already.

511
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,526
But it's true.

512
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,463
Why is it true?

513
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,131
Who chased after who?

514
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,367
Why did we have to switch
at a time like this?

515
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,236
So let's move first

516
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,271
and come up with a solution.

517
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,940
Move?

518
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,408
Move to where?

519
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,055
Pack your basic belongings.

520
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,657
We should show her something.

521
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,658
What do you mean?

522
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,060
Didn't you hear what I told her?

523
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,561
We'll be living together.

524
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,296
Is that urgent right now?

525
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,331
It is for me.

526
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,800
Gosh.

527
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,336
Just thinking of it makes me happy.

528
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,638
I must be out of my mind.

529
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,173
You didn't know that?

530
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,274
Then

531
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,443
what will happen to A-yeong?

532
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,311
Don't worry.

533
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,114
My mom can mess with me,
but she can't mess with the union.

534
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,449
That's a relief.

535
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,719
Then let's think about
why this happened again...

536
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,320
Let's move first.

537
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,589
Do you really want to do this
with yourself?

538
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,858
Listen to me.

539
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,562
It doesn't look like we're switching
at a set time.

540
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,331
Just what are the rules?

541
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,536
Is there anything in common
with each time we switched?

542
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,839
The first time was Jeju Island.
Then it was the police station. And today.

543
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,377
-It's rain.
-Rain?

544
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,181
The night before the switch in Jeju Island
and the police station, and today...

545
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,949
It rained on all three days.

546
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,219
Then we'll switch back to normal
when it next rains?

547
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,620
If it is the rain...

548
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,356
The weather forecast!

549
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,727
Darn it.

550
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,963
It'll be sunny and clear for a week.

551
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,097
What?

552
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,700
Then we can't kiss for an entire week?

553
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,268
Are you serious?

554
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,469
Give it to me.

555
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,910
It says it'll rain in New York. Let's go!

556
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,380
You want go to New York just for a kiss?

557
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,816
Then how have you been holding back
all this time?

558
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,154
One little, two little
Three little Indians

559
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,356
-Do you know this?
-Please!

560
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,292
Let's wait until the next rain

561
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,727
to be sure.

562
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,029
It'll be easier this time

563
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,598
since we've been through it once.

564
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,168
I guess so.

565
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,555
You start first.

566
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,993
I have an important audition to pass.

567
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,730
Since I already sent a demo tape,
you'll hear from them soon.

568
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:55,273
If I don't make it,
I'll be disappointed, but I'll survive.

569
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,378
But if I do make it,
you may have to do the audition for me.

570
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,146
Are you out of your mind?

571
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,882
We don't have any other choice.

572
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,119
So you should practice starting today.

573
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,098
You're driving me crazy.

574
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,335
I'm most confident in demonstrating action
and reading scenarios.

575
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,772
I'm sure you'll be better at reading,
since it's in English.

576
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,609
In exchange, I'll work on your signature.

577
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,447
The New Year's sale will start
the first week of January.

578
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,549
The next is the New Year plan.

579
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,884
KIM JOO-WON

580
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,621
First, always say, "Is this your best?
Are you sure about that?"

581
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,356
Then copy the documents
and bring them to me.

582
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,893
Only sign things that I say you should.

583
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,861
-Do it again.
-It's right.

584
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,865
And don't greet my employees.

585
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,569
Why not?

586
00:38:58,636 --> 00:38:59,570
What do you mean?

587
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,072
Because that's my style.

588
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,907
You should change your style then.

589
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,509
That's nothing to be proud of.

590
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,913
If an employee or anyone else greets me,
I will greet them back.

591
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,382
Don't try to dominate them.
Gain their respect.

592
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,451
Genuine charisma

593
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,586
is fear based on respect.

594
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,655
Who are you trying to lecture?

595
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,024
If you don't like it, date another girl.

596
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,025
Fine.

597
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,760
But I have one condition.

598
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,061
Get up.

599
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:26,997
Why?

600
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,736
Close your eyes.

601
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,171
-What?
-Close your eyes.

602
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,521
Our bodies may be switched

603
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,456
but let's promise

604
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,191
to hug each other once a day.

605
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,894
Okay.

606
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,803
KIM JOO-WON

607
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,583
A-yeong got a promotion.

608
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,986
Because I just approved it.

609
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,736
What's wrong with her?

610
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,938
Did she get dumped by Mr. Money-maker?

611
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,774
Let's call him over and beat him up.

612
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,043
Excuse me?

613
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,884
When the day is over,
we'll meet here and go over the day.

614
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,553
We'll discuss matters for the next day.

615
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,620
Okay.

616
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,758
I brought the documents to sign.
Tell me what to do with them.

617
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:01,892
Also,

618
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,695
you have civil defense training this week.

619
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,632
-I'd better postpone it, right?
-Why don't you just go for me?

620
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,035
-Do you want me to beat you up?
-You have a new message.

621
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,369
Give me a minute.

622
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,973
"You have a new message."

623
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,641
Don't do that.

624
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,645
I told them that I didn't want a refund.

625
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,347
What is it?

626
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,249
The Oska fan club leader.

627
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,918
He canceled his Christmas concert.

628
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,522
I haven't seen him lately because
the body switching and everything...

629
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,491
He must be so sad these days.

630
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,293
What about me?

631
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,964
I'm upset that we're going through this.

632
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,333
Wait.

633
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,670
If the concert was on, you were going
to ditch me on Christmas?

634
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,939
I would've gone to the action school
after the concert.

635
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,275
We have a party every year.

636
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:52,977
Party?

637
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,479
Do they know what a party means?

638
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,881
Don't underestimate us.

639
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,483
We're each other's Santa Claus.

640
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,918
Are you really going?

641
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,621
You won't get anything from Santa

642
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,922
because you're a crybaby.

643
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,558
What kind of party do you have?

644
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,396
Are you going to order pizza,
exchange gifts and have a talent show?

645
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,032
How did you know that?

646
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,801
What? Are you serious?

647
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,141
U-yeong.

648
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,645
Your fans didn't want refunds.
They said they'll wait.

649
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,621
I told you to refund them.

650
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,924
They don't care when it is.
They just want you to do it.

651
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,225
They said they'll wait for you.

652
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,861
Only 132 out of the 2,000 want a refund.

653
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,296
Refund them.

654
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:47,965
Tell them

655
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,401
that I'm not someone

656
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,070
who deserves their trust.

657
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,506
Tell them not to wait.

658
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,840
Also

659
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,710
wear the Santa outfit

660
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,845
and take this to the orphanage.

661
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,014
U-yeong.

662
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,650
-Where is Dong-gyu?
-At the concert hall.

663
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,453
We still have to make the payment
even if it's canceled.

664
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,660
I will see you next time.

665
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,296
Why did you come here?

666
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,265
I'm sorry.

667
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,102
Don't worry about it.

668
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,373
Life has its ups and downs.

669
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,908
Since things have turned out this way,

670
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,345
I'll take just three days off.

671
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,748
I'm sorry.

672
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,916
I am really sorry, Dong-gyu.

673
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,184
Don't be.

674
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:16,887
Let's cheer up.

675
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,523
It's Christmas time.

676
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,988
I was worried about you, so I came.

677
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:55,893
I thought it might be better
than being alone.

678
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,431
It's Christmas, after all.

679
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,921
Do you want

680
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,258
some cookies?

681
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,195
I have rice cakes

682
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,597
and drinks too.

683
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,384
Do you want

684
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,787
some cake?

685
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,723
Yes.

686
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:42,533
Thank you for coming to my concert.

687
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,771
I wish you all
a Christmas full of blessings.

688
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:49,973
And lastly,

689
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,911
thank you for sharing this moment

690
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,246
with me.

691
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:08,525
Here I am, right here, here I am

692
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:14,832
Here I am, I'm right here

693
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:19,770
I'm standing right here

694
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:37,154
Here I am, right now, here I am

695
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:43,827
Here I am, I'm right there

696
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:49,600
I'm right there before you

697
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:59,776
My everything is not enough

698
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:06,116
Giving up my all is not enough

699
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:13,056
I love you

700
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:17,361
Oh, so much

701
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:24,568
But you won't know that though

702
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,239
Here I am

703
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:37,581
But you won't know that though

704
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,687
Here I am

705
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,609
Where did all those come from?

706
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,380
Why are you pretending not to know?

707
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,217
Ra-im told me everything.
Thanks for your sponsorship.

708
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,421
Ra-im is here?

709
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,436
Why are you here?

710
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,037
It's Christmas Eve.

711
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,140
I'm here to spend time with Gil Ra-im.

712
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,210
Rookies,

713
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,680
escort Director Lim,
our future former director, here.

714
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,449
Tell him that the new director
wants to see him.

715
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,151
Let me pour you one.

716
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,353
Great work this year.

717
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,321
-Drink this.
-Yes, I'll drink it.

718
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,724
It's a really merry Christmas.

719
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,092
Merry Christmas.

720
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,059
Let me pour you one.

721
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:01,598
Hey.

722
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,037
I'm here to say something to Gil Ra-im.

723
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,776
Because it's Christmas.

724
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,179
I have so much I want to say,

725
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,514
but I'll just recite

726
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,716
a short acrostic poem for today.

727
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,822
If it isn't funny or moving,
you're in trouble.

728
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,558
-Gil!
-Gil.

729
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,927
Gil Ra-im.

730
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,196
-Ra!
-Ra.

731
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,565
Ra-im!

732
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,934
-What is he doing?
-He is asking for trouble.

733
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,236
Im.

734
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,773
I'm asking you to please accept my love!

735
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,743
Oh my god!

736
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,245
Why you...

737
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,580
Get over here.

738
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,416
How dare you.

739
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,551
You're so dead.

740
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,587
Please calm down.
Let me take care of this.

741
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,624
Gil Ra-im, don't forget this.

742
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,293
I am not as rich as him,
but I am younger than him.

743
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,162
Why I ought to...

744
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,598
What are you looking at? Stop staring.

745
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,669
A painful love triangle.

746
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:18,642
-Let's change the mood!
-Let's change the mood!

747
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,945
We'll begin the talent show!

748
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,820
The action school Christmas party!

749
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,621
Congratulations!

750
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,251
It's the scent of his lips.

751
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,387
If I close my eyes,

752
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,523
I feel

753
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,658
like I am with him.

754
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,173
What is this?

755
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,507
Are these sleeping pills?

756
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,777
You're so weird today.

757
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:13,016
It's the first time you've been like this
since the accident.

758
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,484
What? Accident?

759
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,019
Not accident!

760
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,221
I meant to say since high school!

761
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,957
When did this start? Does it happen often?

762
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,561
Anything else you can't remember
besides the passcode?

763
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:28,298
Or do you remember something
you didn't know before?

764
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,700
No.

765
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,303
But you should still call Ji-hyeon.

766
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,185
I'm sorry.

767
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,054
I didn't know that you had a visitor.

768
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:52,756
I'll come back later.

769
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,359
I asked her for some sleeping pills.
Because I can't sleep these days.

770
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:57,927
Why are you here?

771
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,696
It's not urgent. Later.

772
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,232
Then, I'll leave you guys alone.

773
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,601
It's not funny.

774
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,371
I just came before I go to work
because I'm busy tonight.

775
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,974
I must know her too.

776
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:12,876
Who is she?

777
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,878
What do I do?

778
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,255
I know it just sounds like
I'm trying to impress you,

779
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,224
but I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

780
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,627
You feel familiar,

781
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,796
sir.

782
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,473
Isn't it around this time of year?

783
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,811
You give me vending machine coffee

784
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,113
while you drink premium coffee.

785
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,719
Isn't it December 5th
on the lunar calendar?

786
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:57,987
What is?

787
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,589
What day is it?

788
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,664
Is it your birthday?

789
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,703
What's wrong with you?

790
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,472
I was joking.

791
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,007
Long time no see.

792
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,143
What are you on about?

793
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,945
I saw you the other day.

794
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,783
I will be going.

795
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:31,488
Don't depend on the drugs too much
and exercise for at least an hour.

796
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,093
-I'm off.
-Bye.

797
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,530
Be brief. I want to sleep.

798
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,066
I just wanted to ask...

799
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,369
You told me to call Ji-hyeon last time.

800
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,673
-So?
-I was thinking of calling her.

801
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:54,477
But I accidentally erased all my contacts.

802
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,448
Do you have her number?

803
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:04,320
Ji-hyeon's phone number?

804
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,255
Yes.

805
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,357
I need to ask her something.

806
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:08,992
Do you know it?

807
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:13,897
What?

808
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,133
I think

809
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,870
I made a mistake.

810
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,172
What mistake?

811
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,607
Are you acting like this

812
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,676
because you don't want

813
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,478
to buy me a present?

814
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,481
No way.

815
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:33,950
What do you want as your gift?

816
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,021
I got a call from Kim Ji-eun.

817
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,824
She wants to know how you're doing.

818
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,527
Really?

819
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,063
Do I have her phone number?

820
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,400
I'll give her a call then.

821
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,178
What is it?

822
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,481
What?

823
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,050
Who are you?

824
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,353
You're not Gil Ra-im.

825
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,896
Tell me who you are.

826
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,232
You're not Kim Joo-won.

827
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,370
Kim Ji-eun passed away three years ago.

828
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,706
December 5th is not my birthday,

829
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,708
but Ra-im's father's death anniversary.

830
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,646
The girl that just left

831
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,081
is Ji-hyeon.

832
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,984
She's your physician,

833
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,019
Park Ji-hyeon.

834
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,423
Who are you?

835
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,559
Where is my brother,

836
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,427
Kim Joo-won?

837
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:35,738
