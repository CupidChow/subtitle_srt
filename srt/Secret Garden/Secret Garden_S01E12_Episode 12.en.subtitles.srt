1
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,094
I'll be your little mermaid.

2
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,032
I'll stay quietly beside you,
then disappear like foam.

3
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,566
So that's why

4
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,435
starting now

5
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,504
I'm going to swallow my pride
and cling onto you.

6
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,708
Say something.
I thought long and hard about this.

7
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,044
If you want me to answer
you're going have to start making sense.

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,178
What doesn't make sense?

9
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,481
You said you couldn't do it
since you don't love me.

10
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,450
So I'm going to do it.

11
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,186
I had the hardest time of my life

12
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,989
until I accepted the truth.

13
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,225
But for now I'm crazy about you.

14
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,263
What do you think? Aren't I cool?

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,765
Most guys don't admit things like this.

16
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,400
-Thanks.
-Right?

17
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,470
Compared to you, who doesn't even
think about me for even five minutes,

18
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,273
I'm always thinking about you.

19
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,642
That's why I'll be the little mermaid.

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,245
I'll stay quietly,
and then disappear like foam.

21
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,081
How ridiculous.

22
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,349
You're not the type to just "stay quiet."

23
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,719
In the end you're saying, either you or me

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,789
one of us has to disappear.

25
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,491
-Right?
-You're right.

26
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,595
I like you. And this is the only way
I can continue to see you.

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,199
You like me that much?

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,936
-Yes.
-So you like me that much,

29
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,473
yet you can't imagine a future with me.

30
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,511
In other words,

31
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,049
no matter how deep we're in love
with each other,

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,252
in the end, our relationship
will disappear without a trace.

33
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:00,954
Right?

34
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,723
That is the reality for us.

35
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,894
Of course, we can try to fight back.

36
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,530
But we'll be fighting against
my grandfather's siblings

37
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,099
who opposed me from
inheriting the department store.

38
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,034
the investors who expected to pursue

39
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,669
mergers and acquisitions
through my marriage,

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,171
the countless shareholders,

41
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,475
and my mom, who could hurt you
saying that it was for my own good.

42
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,647
My marriage is a part of a business,
where many things are at stake.

43
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,217
In the end, I will have to choose.

44
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,255
Do I let down all those people
in order to be with you,

45
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,492
or lose you to gain
a reliable business partner as a wife?

46
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,996
Would you prefer the former?

47
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,933
All right. Let's say that
I gave everything up and chose you.

48
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,604
We find a home, buy a bed,
sleep and wake up together.

49
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,974
But how long do you think
that happiness will last?

50
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,511
After making me lose everything,

51
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,749
do you really think
we'll live happily ever after?

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,953
I can't say with confidence that
I won't hate or resent you.

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,389
Can you?

54
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,598
Once again,

55
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,868
you're right about everything.

56
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,070
You're right about everything.

57
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,873
But you see, you fool,

58
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,643
what girl would fall in love

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,613
if it's going to disappear like foam?

60
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,016
No girl begins love

61
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,886
when she knows it will end.

62
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,490
This is why we can't be.

63
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,559
We just

64
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,628
won't work.

65
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,897
Why not?

66
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,700
That's why I said
I'll be the little mermaid.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,568
What's so hard for you?

68
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,204
Does every relationship end in marriage?

69
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,207
What if I promise to marry you
and then I don't?

70
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,877
Isn't this worth a try?
Even if we might not take it all the way?

71
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,081
I know you want this too.

72
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,983
You like me too.

73
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,785
Please stop getting the wrong idea.

74
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:13,920
I don't

75
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,922
like you.

76
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,291
Move.

77
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,631
Move.

78
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,582
Stop lying to my face.

79
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,818
Get back to me after you
take your time to think about it.

80
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,122
Because I thought about this for a
long time before coming to this decision.

81
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,291
I'll be going then.

82
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,810
Where should I start?

83
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,614
How does the CEO know so much about you?

84
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,084
How am I supposed to understand
this situation?

85
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,453
You think I understand?

86
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,356
This is driving me even crazier!

87
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,024
Don't lie!

88
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,429
Look how pretty you dressed
because he asked you to dinner.

89
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,865
I can tell you got your hair done too.

90
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,435
I only wanted to feel him out.

91
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,438
He keeps confusing me.

92
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,274
But now I'm even more confused.

93
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,210
How does he know me
better than I know myself?

94
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,448
Only Ra-im could say those things
about me,

95
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,750
but she would never tell anyone.

96
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,387
That's not what's important.

97
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,389
So did the CEO

98
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,193
get intimate with you or not?

99
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,627
Mr. Kim!

100
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,872
START SPEAKING

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,775
Have you thought about it?

102
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,345
You never think for more than
five minutes. What's taking so long?

103
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,847
Hurry up, and let me know.

104
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,882
VOICE RECOGNITION IN PROGRESS

105
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,218
SENDING MESSAGE TO GIL RA-IM

106
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,841
You have a new message.

107
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,345
Have you thought about it?

108
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,248
You never think for more than
five minutes. What's taking so long?

109
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,416
Hurry up and let me know.

110
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,188
Take this back with you!

111
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,357
Are you trying to show the world
how poor you are?

112
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,292
Why did you bring
such an outrageous basket?

113
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,161
This is what you like, huh?

114
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,363
Do you think I sent you to art classes
since you were 12

115
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,832
to have to this kind of taste?

116
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,309
Hey. You're late.

117
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,816
What are you doing?

118
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,288
What are you doing?

119
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,760
What do we do?

120
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,963
-What?
-I think the CEO might be a creep.

121
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,498
A creep?

122
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,635
I think there are cameras in the gifts
he sent us, like hidden cameras.

123
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,604
-"Hidden cameras"?
-I'm sure

124
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,639
it's the chandelier.

125
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,980
Only a crazy person would buy
a chandelier as a gift.

126
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,182
I'm positive there was another motive.

127
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,817
What in the world are you talking about?

128
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:09,088
I had dinner with Mr. Kim
and the CEO tonight.

129
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,791
And the CEO knew everything about me.

130
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:16,128
Things you could only know
if you lived together!

131
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,465
He even knew that I leave
the bathroom door open.

132
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,168
You were your usual self?

133
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,972
Geez. I told you to be careful!

134
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:26,873
When?

135
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,209
You didn't walk around
without a bra on, did you?

136
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,144
I never wear my bra at home.

137
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,013
I don't believe this.

138
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,485
Speak.

139
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,488
THE BEST SPOT TO SEE OSKIE
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT

140
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,525
This is a copy of the drawing he drew

141
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,560
that we found in his pocket.

142
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,129
"Oskie"?

143
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,765
Joo-won calls U-yeong...

144
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,134
"Oskie"?

145
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,870
They must be really close.

146
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,273
He even wears Oska's socks.

147
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,109
What did you say he wears?

148
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,076
Not only that.

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,013
He murmurs to himself
while looking at the tree.

150
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,582
He murmurs to himself
while looking at his phone.

151
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,583
To himself?

152
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,754
He murmurs to himself?

153
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,790
I only visited him as his psychiatrist.

154
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,625
There's nothing else going on.

155
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,395
Does he take any meds? Like sleeping pills
or something like that?

156
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,799
I cannot disclose personal information
about my patients. I'm sorry.

157
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,871
Has Ji-hyeon dropped by recently?

158
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,242
-That doctor friend.
-Yes, a few days ago.

159
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,180
All right. You may go.

160
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,383
Wait.

161
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,621
What is this? Why is this here?

162
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,823
The CEO...

163
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,793
That fool. Get rid of it, immediately.

164
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,794
Yes, madam.

165
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,463
I'm sure I told you to leave it.

166
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,566
Get rid of it right now.

167
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,337
Just leave it. This is my house.
I'll take care of my own belongings.

168
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,711
How is this your house?

169
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,413
You haven't inherited it yet.

170
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,515
If you keep acting like this,

171
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,284
I can throw you out

172
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,952
as I please.

173
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,821
-I know.
-You do?

174
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,888
You do?

175
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,959
Poor people aren't the only ones
who invest in their children.

176
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,230
You should give something in return
for the opportunities I've provided you

177
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,000
that others could never dream of.

178
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,468
Just like that girl said,

179
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,205
you were born randomly into a rich family
and had an easy life.

180
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,775
That means it's your duty to expand
and protect our fortune.

181
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,212
I will forget your past failures

182
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,280
if you go on a blind date.

183
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,183
-No?
-If I say no,

184
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,353
are you going to call Ra-im
and do what you did before?

185
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,655
I would love to.

186
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,225
But do you think
she would still be in Korea by then?

187
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,066
All right.

188
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,367
I'll go on the blind date.

189
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,837
-Do you really?
-Of course.

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,675
I will make it obvious that I was raised
very well, so don't worry.

191
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,476
Who is it this time?

192
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,313
She's a third-generation Korean-Japanese.

193
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,683
And she's a graduate student
at Tokyo University.

194
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,652
Her father's side has
a major shipbuilding company,

195
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,888
and her mother's side has
unlimited political connections.

196
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,424
There's hardly anything
they can't do in Japan.

197
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,326
Yoo Gyeong-ran?

198
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,130
I'm Kim Joo-won.

199
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,283
Yes, this is Gil Ra-im.

200
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,888
Director Yoon? Why are you calling?

201
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,832
Why did you call me here?

202
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,135
We don't have to waste time here.

203
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,603
Excuse me?

204
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,073
Your stride reveals temperament.

205
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,043
Your aesthetic taste shows
how cultured you are.

206
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,546
Whether you belong in an art gallery
or a nightclub...

207
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,816
Whether your perfume preference
is straightforward or indirect...

208
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,052
The answers come out quickly.

209
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,262
This is what Joo-won said
on our blind date.

210
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,065
Rude and arrogant, right?

211
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,572
Just an hour ago, Joo-won was
on another blind date, right here.

212
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,942
It was with a woman
wearing an indirect fragrance.

213
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,448
You're not surprised?

214
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,386
Just why are you telling me this?

215
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,290
Much like this gallery, Joo-won and I live

216
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,527
like a big part of our life is
on an exhibit.

217
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:21,267
Whoever it is, Joo-won will end up
marrying someone like me.

218
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,437
If that's the case,
then I'll just marry him.

219
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,741
I know

220
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,944
that you two are quite serious.

221
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,749
That is why I called you here
to apologize in advance.

222
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,351
I don't understand.

223
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,557
Aren't you in love with U-yeong?

224
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,859
I was once...

225
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,028
Long ago.

226
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,897
At first,

227
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,433
I started all of this to go back to him,

228
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,804
but I realized
I was further away from him.

229
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,375
But still, how could you stake your life
on someone you don't even love?

230
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,846
I can.

231
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,315
Because either way,

232
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,752
no man will remember me.

233
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,993
Do you know what
the worst kind of hatred is?

234
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,029
When a fan becomes a hater,

235
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,932
and when love turns to hate.

236
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,704
I have both kinds in me.

237
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:37,476
So I'm going to do my best
to hurt U-yeong.

238
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,314
Of course, it may not all go
according to plan.

239
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,586
Seeing that Joo-won is going
on blind dates again,

240
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,923
it appears that he wants neither of us.

241
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,364
We've chosen a difficult man,

242
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,001
haven't we?

243
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,683
This is temporary for me.

244
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,385
Can't you wait that long?

245
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,621
Didn't you know the amount of endurance
you would need to date a guy like me?

246
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,490
You should know better at your age.

247
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,730
KIM MORON

248
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,142
All right,
get ready to take over the camera.

249
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,743
Ready, cue.

250
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,883
One, two, three.

251
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,625
KIM MORON

252
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,602
Why haven't you been picking up?

253
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,007
Do you know how many times I've called?

254
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,178
Why didn't you pick up? You can't hear me?

255
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,049
You're ugly and you never listen.

256
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,252
I was busy. Why did you call?

257
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,421
Why didn't you answer me
when you could hear me?

258
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,822
Because I didn't want to be bothered.

259
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,559
You think I call because I have time?

260
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,895
If you don't like being bothered,
you can just pick up.

261
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,496
Why ignore my messages?

262
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,498
I thought I made it clear

263
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,902
that I'm always thinking about you.

264
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,639
Put yourself in my shoes.
Do you think I'd be able to focus on work?

265
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,241
Did you see my message?

266
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,845
If you saw it, then why didn't you answer?

267
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,246
I'm still thinking about it.

268
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,816
-When will you be done?
-Why do you care?

269
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,785
Did you ever respect my opinion
before doing anything?

270
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,023
If you were thinking about me so much
that you couldn't even work properly,

271
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,625
how were you even able to go
on that blind date?

272
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,662
How did you know I went on a blind date?

273
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,230
How was the woman this time?

274
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,933
Was she pretty?
Was she rich? Well-educated?

275
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,535
Did you like her taste in perfume?

276
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,437
How about her stride? Was it refined?

277
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,607
How do you know all this?

278
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,978
I have no preference for perfume,
but I like shampoo that's straightforward.

279
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,446
And my toothpaste, even more so.

280
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,449
Now that you know, get lost.

281
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,687
Are you actually jealous?

282
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,992
You are.

283
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,727
Why?

284
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,064
Does it make you mad that I went
on a blind date? Super angry?

285
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,466
Should I stop going on them?

286
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,302
You can't do that.

287
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,005
Your life and career depend on it.

288
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,542
Forget about a woman who buys tangerines
to visit your mom,

289
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,711
and keep looking for your arranged wife.

290
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,882
Do you have to say it like that?

291
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,386
Why do you think I came here
in the middle of the night?

292
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,289
I came here because I missed you.

293
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,793
So stop showing me your back,
and let me see your face.

294
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,870
I want to see you. Like this.

295
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,576
So why did you delete your photo
from my phone?

296
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,948
Stay still for a second.

297
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,018
Don't you dare take that photo.

298
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,490
You really are pretty when you're mad.

299
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,495
Decide by tomorrow.
Or else I'll come back.

300
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,186
Stop wasting your time,
and look after your brother.

301
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,889
His matters affect our entire family.

302
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,993
I'm not wasting my time.
I'm studying stocks.

303
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,263
I have no plans of living off your money,

304
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,265
so don't try to control me like Joo-won.

305
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,336
You always speak so spitefully,
just like your father.

306
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,171
And don't speak of Dad that way either.

307
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,907
What about Joo-won? What's the matter?

308
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,680
Who are you talking about?
Did Joo-won go on another blind date?

309
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,682
-Hello.
-Hi.

310
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,486
I wish I had a pretty daughter like you.

311
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,190
Goodness, how many calories is that?

312
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,059
I'll just have a salad.

313
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,929
-Could we get a salad, please?
-Yes, madam.

314
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,800
But why does your mother
look so horrifically upset?

315
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,771
You've gotten rid of plenty
of U-yeong's women, right?

316
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,440
-You're an expert, aren't you?
-Of course I am.

317
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,343
If it were a sport,
I would be on the national team.

318
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,379
And I'd be a gold medalist.

319
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,381
Why do you ask?

320
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,915
I think Joo-won is seeing someone.

321
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,550
Just leave him alone.

322
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,586
Really?

323
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,755
He has a girl?

324
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,556
Is she pregnant?

325
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:32,858
Aunt!

326
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,027
I don't think so.

327
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,862
But he stays out with her.

328
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,897
Really? Joo-won?

329
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,066
Then it's still too early.

330
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,069
There's too much resistance at this point.

331
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,405
If you hand them a money envelope,

332
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,008
then they act as if they're the heroine
of some tragedy

333
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,178
and refuse the money, acting all defiant.

334
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,881
They think it's some test of love
they have to overcome.

335
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,718
What about a girl who takes it
and spends it all in one day?

336
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,386
There is such a girl?

337
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,655
There is! She even asked

338
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,158
if it was a monthly thing.

339
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,628
Oh my, she's something else.

340
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,496
She'll get far in life.

341
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,132
-Hey!
-You shouldn't be dealing with her.

342
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,403
You forget a woman by seeing
another woman, not your mother.

343
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,041
Set him up with someone vicious.
He's seen plenty of girls before.

344
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,945
Weren't there any with guts
as well as a good family background?

345
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,782
Guts?

346
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:37,189
MOON CHANG-SU AND PARK BONG-HUI'S
300TH DAY ANNIVERSARY

347
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,374
Father, this is Secretary Yoon's daughter.

348
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,743
She has had a blind date with Joo-won.

349
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,611
Isn't she pretty?

350
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,282
Say hello.

351
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,685
This is Joo-won's grandfather.

352
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,124
Hello. My name is Yoon Seul.

353
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,992
I wish you good health.

354
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,528
It's nice to meet you.

355
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,431
Seeing that you've had a blind date,
and you've come here,

356
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,169
-am I to understand that you'll marry her?
-Yes. I'm thinking in the spring.

357
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,805
Joo-won will be 34 next year.

358
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,541
I wasn't asking you.
I want to hear from Joo-won.

359
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,678
Spring sounds great.
It's when the flowers are in bloom.

360
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,551
Let's sit.
You can get acquainted over dinner.

361
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,957
You know him, right?
He's Joo-won's cousin.

362
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,427
He's a singer, apparently.

363
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,597
It's nice to meet you for the first time.

364
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,300
I'm a longtime fan of yours.

365
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,370
First time, my foot.

366
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,006
You know each other very well.

367
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,111
You know my U-yeong?

368
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,749
I'm his mother.

369
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,154
Well, as I've said, I am a fan of his.

370
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,891
I've seen him at concerts a few times.

371
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,968
Please excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

372
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,875
Let's eat.

373
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,611
Over here. Serve our food.

374
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,534
How far will you take this?

375
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,569
This isn't over, is it?

376
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,737
Probably not.

377
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,105
Still, this is wrong.

378
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,773
You shouldn't be here.

379
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,709
Joo-won's mother invited me.

380
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,677
Even if she dragged you, it's still wrong.

381
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,813
How could you go this far?

382
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:16,982
Why?

383
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,551
I think it's nice. I get to see you.

384
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,853
It's also nice having a hot guy like you

385
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,690
paying a gossip like me so much attention.

386
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,726
And it's nice

387
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,729
that your eyes quiver because of me.

388
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,564
What is the matter with you?

389
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,799
Tell me. What should I do?

390
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,168
What do I have to do to make you stop?

391
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,270
Rather than that,

392
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,207
shouldn't the first step be figuring out
why I'm doing this?

393
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,946
I know I've changed a lot.

394
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,715
I wasn't like this before,

395
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,519
but thanks to you,
I'm quite capable of anything.

396
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,225
What have you been doing all this time
while I've been changing?

397
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,229
You see, when it comes to women

398
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,800
even the most ordinary one
can become a queen.

399
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,104
And even the most precious woman
can become a common peasant.

400
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:19,244
It all depends on
how her lover treats her.

401
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,314
How far will I go, you ask?

402
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,649
Well,

403
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,354
I guess you'll find out
when we meet again.

404
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,990
I'll head in first.

405
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,326
The others must be waiting.

406
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,946
Why didn't you tell me?
You should've told me beforehand.

407
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,948
Why?

408
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,417
-So that you can run away?
-Yes.

409
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,655
I'll go on the blind dates as we agreed.

410
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,026
It can't be her. She likes someone else.

411
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,962
-And so do you.
-Mom!

412
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,965
With her looks and wealth,
why wouldn't she have another man?

413
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,767
So you're okay with that?

414
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,436
You're okay with her
as your daughter-in-law?

415
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,006
It's difficult enough to match
family background, education, and wealth.

416
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,741
Must your love interests match as well?

417
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,075
You really are something.

418
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,244
You really are...

419
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,347
I'm leaving.

420
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,221
Mr. Kwon!

421
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,189
Bring me some aspirin.

422
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,466
We need to talk.

423
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,037
Don't get the wrong idea. It wasn't me.

424
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,139
It's just my mom's doing.

425
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,744
I know you're thinking about the time
I expressed interest in her at Haenam.

426
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,747
But that really wasn't the truth.
That was...

427
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,352
Anyway, it wasn't the truth.

428
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,690
-U-yeong!
-I got it, so leave.

429
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,459
How can I? You still have the wrong idea.

430
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,830
You think I'm like this

431
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,166
because I misunderstood you?

432
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,501
-What is it then?
-It's not a misunderstanding.

433
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,071
I'm very mad at you right now.

434
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,972
I told you, I didn't invite her.

435
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,774
I'm not mad because you invited her.

436
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,044
She's not the type to come
just because you invited her.

437
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,713
I couldn't care less about that.

438
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,015
What really makes me mad is that

439
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,517
you humiliated her

440
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,454
in front of everyone.

441
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,257
-What?
-It was her first meeting with everyone.

442
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:50,395
Did you have to make it
even more uncomfortable for her?

443
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,631
"First time, my foot.
You know each other very well."

444
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,500
Did you see her face?

445
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,169
Couldn't you just let this one go?

446
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,904
All you care about

447
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,373
is your loss.

448
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,276
You don't care in the slightest
whether someone else gets hurt.

449
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,378
That's how you have lived.

450
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,080
It is simply how you are.

451
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:10,882
Are you really

452
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,051
in love with her?

453
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:23,595
Hello?

454
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,464
This is Ra-im.

455
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,801
I'm sorry,
but because of schedule conflicts,

456
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:34,672
would it be all right if we moved
tomorrow's session to the morning?

457
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,775
Let's do that,

458
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,145
but can I see you now, Ra-im?

459
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,816
Thank you. I'll call you when I'm near.

460
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,886
Why are you meeting Ra-im?

461
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,891
She is the only one
I can find comfort in right now.

462
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,676
This is Joo-won. Let's meet.

463
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,489
Do you have anything to say to me?

464
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,560
It was nice seeing you earlier.

465
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,764
Exactly what kind of relationship
do you have with U-yeong?

466
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,600
A past relationship?

467
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,634
Are you sure?

468
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,770
The way I see it,

469
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,105
you two are still in love.

470
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,875
You were mistaken then.

471
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,677
Fine.

472
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,480
Let's say it isn't true for you,
but it is for U-yeong.

473
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,183
He still loves you.

474
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,251
Is that so?

475
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,855
It looks like U-yeong
only shares the truth

476
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,157
with a third party,
just as he did in the past.

477
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,095
What is it that you want?

478
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,498
Don't you think
you're crossing the line here?

479
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,335
Are you really going to marry me?

480
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,971
Spring in full bloom.
I like the sound of that.

481
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,339
Seriously.

482
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,976
Why must I be a blank shell
in Yoon Seul and U-yeong's war?

483
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,111
I let it be
because I thought you were both in pain.

484
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,847
But is this what I get
for not putting you in your place?

485
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,750
I have my own problems right now.

486
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,885
I know.

487
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,287
That's why I'm perfect for you.

488
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,624
You and Gil Ra-im
cannot live happily ever after.

489
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,326
I don't intend on prying
into my husband's private life.

490
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,796
So this is why my mom likes you.

491
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,131
She likes me?

492
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,399
That is why this is an issue.

493
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,869
But I'm telling you,
U-yeong still genuinely loves you.

494
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,070
Are you trying to appeal to me

495
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,707
with the value of love?

496
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,512
Gil Ra-im really is amazing.
She has really changed you.

497
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,713
I know.

498
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,383
That's what she does.

499
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,952
You really like her, don't you?

500
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,322
But you can't persuade me.

501
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:09,560
I was cured
of that hormonal disorder long ago.

502
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,945
You are the first woman
to call me out to a pork rind restaurant.

503
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,549
I've met many men
at pork rind restaurants.

504
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,285
But I bet I'm the first Korean Wave star.

505
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,655
There was a cousin of a Korean Wave star.

506
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:38,990
Damn...

507
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,626
Don't even talk about that punk.

508
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,862
This may make you angry,

509
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,131
but I asked you to meet

510
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,200
because I wanted him to feel angry.

511
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,837
He was next to me when you called.

512
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,240
Did you two fight?

513
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,043
He did something

514
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,380
very mean today

515
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,115
to me.

516
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,386
He does that to me

517
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,388
every day.

518
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,724
That's how that punk is.

519
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:21,766
I've met

520
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,802
a lot of women.

521
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,137
But still

522
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:27,939
I don't understand them.

523
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,974
The first and last woman

524
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,110
I'll ever love

525
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,814
has turned into the greatest villain
of my life.

526
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,418
And I have no clue

527
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,587
what to do.

528
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,495
All the villains of the world
have been hurt in the past.

529
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,364
Sometimes a woman

530
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,367
will express her love

531
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,936
by hating you to no end.

532
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,973
I think you two have

533
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,243
some kind of misunderstanding.

534
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,244
I know.

535
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:07,812
That's why

536
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,814
I haven't tried to find out.

537
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,018
I'm scared that the reason
Seul is acting that way

538
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,488
is really because of me.

539
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,793
I'm terrified

540
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,862
of the truth.

541
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,002
What? What are you talking about?

542
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,304
I just met with the person in charge,

543
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,573
and he said you already paid back
half the loan.

544
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,876
That's nonsense.
I'm two months behind on the interest.

545
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,345
So I asked him if he was sure,

546
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,549
and he said the interest was paid
as well as half of the principal.

547
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,085
Now that I think of it,
it's been way past the due date,

548
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,854
yet no one has called.

549
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,258
Call the bank.
Get me that person on the phone.

550
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,804
Watch out!

551
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:08,192
Excuse me, but you can't smoke here.

552
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,463
What? How is that any of your business?

553
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,634
This is a public space,
and a non-smoking zone, as you can see.

554
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,271
More importantly, there are children here,
and you should think of your health.

555
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,673
I don't believe this.

556
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,874
Get lost!

557
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,043
What's your problem?

558
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,147
How could you be so proud
when you're harming others?

559
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,416
What? Why, you little...

560
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,253
Let go.

561
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,722
Let go of me. Let go!

562
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,424
It's him.

563
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,959
You know what you did was wrong.

564
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,762
Are you going to apologize?
I will let you go if you do.

565
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,898
Okay! I will!

566
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,800
But he isn't the one

567
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,903
who pushed me by my head

568
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,306
to protect me.

569
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,578
I'm sorry. I apologize.

570
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,048
The man before me now

571
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,517
is much more...

572
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,585
Are you fine?

573
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,453
Fine!

574
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,156
Goodbye, then.

575
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:13,958
Excuse me.

576
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,495
Don't you recognize me?

577
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,066
We met at the action school.
You mistook me for an actress.

578
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,200
I remember.

579
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,336
But I'm a bit busy right now.

580
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,409
What was that? Wasn't he glad to see me?

581
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,014
Are you the one who paid the money back?

582
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,418
People in the stunt industry
sure are quick to act.

583
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,253
They can just make a call.

584
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,123
Instead, every time something happens,
it's a face-to-face confrontation.

585
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,958
I'm asking if you paid the money back.

586
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,960
Why are you paying back our school's loan?

587
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,996
Where did you hear about the loan?

588
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,333
Did Ra-im tell you that we have debt?

589
00:38:56,367 --> 00:39:00,037
Not necessarily, but something like that.

590
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,372
What do you mean by that?

591
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,541
Explain it to me clearly.

592
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,083
ACTION SCHOOL APPLICANT RESUME

593
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,930
GIL RA-IM RESUME

594
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,507
WORK EXPERIENCE: RESTAURANT 6 MONTHS,
INTERNET CAFE 3 MONTHS

595
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,814
Quit ringing!

596
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,352
Hello?

597
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,590
An overdue loan?

598
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:58,763
I was in your office
and happened to pick up the phone.

599
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,664
You should have told me.

600
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,000
It isn't your place to pay off that debt.

601
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,535
Think of it as an investment, okay?

602
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,404
A cultural investment, if you will.

603
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,572
Other action schools receive investments,
apparently.

604
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,875
I don't have the slightest interest
in your investment.

605
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,545
It took us five years
to erect our current building.

606
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,847
Our sweat and hard work

607
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,616
made that possible.

608
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,587
But with this single action,
you've made fools out of all of us.

609
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,755
What was I supposed to do then?

610
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,558
I can't have Ra-im getting calls
from debt collectors.

611
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,228
Even I was able to pick up that phone.
Obviously she has already.

612
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,465
Knowing her, she probably
would've apologized profusely again.

613
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,734
I couldn't stand it. So I paid it off.

614
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,137
And I knew you'd come out like this,
so I only paid half.

615
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,107
Don't worry. I'm exact with these matters.

616
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,378
This isn't charity,
so be prepared to pay me back.

617
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,013
Not to you.

618
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,882
Take back your money, immediately.

619
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,717
I'll tell the bank.

620
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,225
What?

621
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,895
CEO Kim paid off a loan? Whose?

622
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,666
An action school in which
a stuntwoman named Gil Ra-im is a part of.

623
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,567
Really?

624
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,270
When a man repays a woman's debt,

625
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,208
the woman has either threatened him
with pregnancy,

626
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,178
is threatening him with pregnancy,
or will threaten him with pregnancy.

627
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:26,550
Let's use the claustrophobia
and this pregnancy to kick him out.

628
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,886
"Is this your best?"

629
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,555
That's going

630
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,224
to be mine now.

631
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,795
I knew that would happen,

632
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,830
so I've already made an appointment
with his physician.

633
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,365
You did? What time?

634
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,201
Do I look a bit like a crazy person?

635
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,803
Of course! Yes!

636
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,338
Really?

637
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,709
What did you say?

638
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,778
Why, you...

639
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,292
What kind of people usually come
to a place like this?

640
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,862
Mostly people who feel
that they are unhappy.

641
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,831
PSYCHIATRIST PARK JI-HYEON

642
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,333
How about you, Mr. Park?

643
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,103
I think

644
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,140
I may be claustrophobic.

645
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,511
I will make the diagnosis
since I'm the doctor.

646
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,147
Could you tell me about your symptoms?

647
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,149
Well,

648
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,652
I can't take the elevators.

649
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,688
But sometimes I can take them fine.

650
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:42,626
Then again, I can't go into karaoke rooms,
so I must be claustrophobic.

651
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,131
But I can ride planes
with ease for business trips.

652
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:52,169
Not everyone with claustrophobia
has the same symptoms.

653
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:58,175
The response of each individual to small,
enclosed spaces is very distinct.

654
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,944
Really?

655
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,214
Still, these symptoms point
to claustrophobia, right?

656
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,184
We have to conduct several tests
to be sure.

657
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,088
When did these symptoms start?

658
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,122
Pardon?

659
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,293
So...

660
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,764
Ever since I began to hate another man.

661
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,833
What kind of man?

662
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,036
He's young, wealthy, tall, and handsome.

663
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,138
If he lacks anything,

664
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,140
it's manners.

665
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,876
He always asks if it is our best,

666
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,578
and I can feel myself

667
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,314
grow smaller every time.

668
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,750
Is hatred all of it?

669
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,019
Excuse me?

670
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,722
Could it not be a strong sense
of admiration?

671
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,660
What are you talking about?

672
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:51,996
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

673
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,465
It was a tough decision to make.

674
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,301
You too?

675
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,202
Yes.

676
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:02,272
It feels like I'm back in the army.
I can't take it anymore.

677
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,374
I'm really sorry.

678
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,411
Won't you regret the work
you've put in so far?

679
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,347
Are you confident you won't regret it?

680
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,615
We'll regret it.

681
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,652
But it's terrifying to think of

682
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,820
what lies ahead.

683
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,192
All right. Hold your heads up.

684
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,161
You did nothing wrong.

685
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,864
Not everyone has the same dream.

686
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,766
Whatever you do,

687
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,634
make sure it makes your heart race.

688
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,302
That means it's your dream.

689
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,737
I'm sorry

690
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,241
I couldn't

691
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,843
take better care of you.

692
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,945
-Not at all!
-We're sorry.

693
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,514
Don't be.

694
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,949
Thanks for all your hard work.

695
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,018
Take care.

696
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:05,002
We need to hold the workshop earlier.
Set the date and venue.

697
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,203
Okay.

698
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,850
It's me.
Do you still want to attend the workshop?

699
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,157
I'm only doing this
because you did well last time.

700
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,860
We leave on Wednesday. Dress warmly.

701
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,029
-Where is it?
-We're going to decide soon.

702
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,264
Can I pick the place then?

703
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,233
I know you guys are tight on budget.

704
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,636
Free room and meals, untarnished nature,

705
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,438
open and spacious

706
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,108
in an optimum geographical setting.
Sound good?

707
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,343
Free room and meals? Absolutely.

708
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,880
Ra-im is very upset right now,
so this workshop is important.

709
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,016
Why is she upset?

710
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:57,488
Two of our rookies quit.
She was in charge of their training.

711
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:03,260
While we're at it,
when Ra-im is feeling down,

712
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,962
the things that she loves to hear are,

713
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,466
"Gil Ra-im, your existence itself
is a miracle for us."

714
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,669
Or, "Your action carries
the scent of lavender."

715
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,305
Lavender stands for acting cool.
You know that, right?

716
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,809
Should I tell you more?

717
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,410
It's fine.

718
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,248
But tell me two things. First.

719
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,251
Last time at the shoot
and this time with the workshop.

720
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,053
Why are you helping me with Ra-im?

721
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,588
You're rich.

722
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,690
You make money well and spend it well.

723
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,227
I hope that you hold onto Ra-im
and never let go.

724
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,062
Let her play hard to get.

725
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,032
Then on to question two.

726
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,135
Why do you keep speaking informally to me?

727
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,205
I'm 31 this coming year.

728
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:49,540
I'm 34.

729
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,109
Is that so...

730
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,511
Sir?

731
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,080
-You look so young.
-I know.

732
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,552
Go now. And watch yourself from now on.

733
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:02,886
Yes, sir.

734
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,489
Then text me the location, please.

735
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,001
I'm going to visit Bisong Resort.
Schedule it for this Wednesday.

736
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,976
What about this?

737
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,211
I'll take this.

738
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,369
It's for Oska's Christmas concert.

739
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,606
The theme is a White Christmas
with snow falling...

740
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,841
That's the kind of theme we're going for.

741
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,167
How is she so self-assured in front of me?
After all she's done.

742
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,469
Who?

743
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,704
Nothing.

744
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,706
What is this?

745
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,409
Goods to sell at the concert.

746
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,711
Blanket.

747
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:36,847
Cushion.

748
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,416
T-shirt.

749
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:42,753
Is this it?

750
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,255
What about the sponsorships?
I didn't get any?

751
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:46,990
Who would sponsor you

752
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,393
when all these idols are having
their concerts on the same day?

753
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,962
What? That will discourage my fans.

754
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,931
You said the venue fits 2,000, right?

755
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,067
Prepare 2,000 packages
with rice cakes, cookies, and drinks.

756
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,469
Is this some kind of charity concert?
We'll have nothing left.

757
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,839
I don't care. This will be at my expense,
so don't worry.

758
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,341
I'll be back in a bit.

759
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,044
Where are you going?
Aren't you going to practice?

760
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,247
I'm going to get us a guest.

761
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,229
Seeing as you're here,
you must've signed that contract.

762
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,497
Is that what you're here for?

763
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,168
You didn't seem to be on good terms
with the old lady here.

764
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,970
That's none of your business.

765
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,371
Did you sign it?

766
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,307
Not yet.
But I'm being optimistic about it.

767
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,143
You're a real punk.

768
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,313
But why

769
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,682
aren't you suing the guy
who plagiarized your song

770
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,817
and sold it to me?

771
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,786
The person with utterly no respect
for creativity

772
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,656
is him, not me.

773
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,158
So why aren't you doing anything about it?

774
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,894
He said he's reflecting on it.

775
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,397
I knew it. I knew you would do that.

776
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,833
You know him, don't you?

777
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,404
Since you're always so full of meaning,

778
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,073
I made a few deductions myself.

779
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,209
Remember what you said to me?

780
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,744
"Apology from the composer?

781
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,780
Did you get that through your own effort?"

782
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,482
For someone so forgetful,
it must've been hard.

783
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,917
Tell me. You know each other, right?

784
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,354
Are you the one who told him to confess?

785
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,756
-What if I did?
-Why?

786
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,791
Because I was worried about you.

787
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,761
Don't make me laugh.

788
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,430
If you were that worried,
you should've signed with me

789
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,698
instead of being here!

790
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,603
Where's your boss?

791
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,906
I don't have a boss.
I haven't even signed yet.

792
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,341
Stop fooling around.

793
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,144
You need to experience the oppression
of a major record label

794
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,779
to get off your high horse.

795
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,182
Where is she?

796
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:53,683
Did she not come in today?

797
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,421
Have you been here often?
Was she gone every time you came?

798
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:59,556
She must come out at least once a day.

799
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,895
Did you come here to see her and not me?

800
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,930
You always ask so many questions.

801
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,467
Free your schedule next week

802
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,869
for rehearsal.

803
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:14,571
Rehearsal?

804
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,807
I'm doing a Christmas concert.

805
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,475
You're my guest.

806
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,445
Says who?

807
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,046
I told you to stop fooling around.

808
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,917
Practice hard. Don't mess up. I'm leaving.

809
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,248
Leave it in its natural state.

810
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,252
I've already announced that
we left every tree and stone untouched.

811
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:40,056
As you instructed, we preserved
the forest as best as we could

812
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,492
from the initial stages of construction.

813
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,630
No one could have done better.

814
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,632
You are right.

815
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:51,902
This is the hike trail, correct?

816
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,438
It's grand!

817
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,280
The focus of the villa
is its interior and view.

818
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,682
Make sure you promote that a lot,

819
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,552
-as well as the inner healing aspects.
-Yes, sir.

820
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,820
Construction is almost over.

821
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,256
We should be able to open
by the end of the month.

822
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,692
That sounds good. You've all worked hard.

823
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,363
It's so cold.

824
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,565
Good work.

825
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,235
-This is nice.
-So nice.

826
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,245
Hey. Isn't that Money-maker?

827
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,481
What are you doing here?
We came here for our workshop.

828
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,417
I'm here for work.

829
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,419
What a coincidence.

830
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,720
I know.

831
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,123
I'm your senior colleague,
so we can act casual, right?

832
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,092
I'm here with Ra-im.

833
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,163
Sure...

834
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,864
What's going on with you two?

835
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,300
Is this really a coincidence?

836
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,203
-Yes.
-Yes.

837
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,073
I need to speak with you.

838
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:04,941
Yes, I'll be right there.

839
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,745
Don't worry. The beating will be quick.

840
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:10,947
Go in and unpack, everyone.

841
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,115
Yes, sir!

842
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,519
You stay.

843
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:18,955
Catch!

844
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,461
What? You and I have things to talk about.

845
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,798
I've been a little busy and couldn't ask.
But you still haven't decided?

846
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:31,735
I don't have time to think
about useless things like that.

847
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,270
Stop resisting already.

848
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,040
Fine, we can talk about that later.

849
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,109
You met U-yeong a few days ago, right?

850
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,644
What did you guys do?

851
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,948
Did you act all cute and shy again?

852
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,050
It's none of your business.

853
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,219
Of course it is. You and I have kissed--

854
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,224
Are you tired of breathing?

855
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,826
-Should I send you to a better place?
-Ra-im!

856
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,695
I'll be right there.

857
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,603
Do you know what kind of balcony that is?

858
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,704
Get off it!

859
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,776
We're here to elect the new leader
of the action school for next year.

860
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,111
At the end of this year,

861
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,248
I will step down from my position.

862
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,761
If one person remains the leader forever,

863
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,798
the team is likely to disband

864
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,735
when he is injured or passes away.

865
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,306
We elect a new leader every year,

866
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,476
so that if the current leader gets
into a sudden accident,

867
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:50,513
anyone can fill that position
and protect the team.

868
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,850
This is the tradition
your seniors started long ago.

869
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,954
Your director for the year 2011

870
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,757
will be Hwang Jeong-hwan.

871
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,663
I will do my best.

872
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,306
Cheers!

873
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,942
Drink up.

874
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,264
I'm impressed.

875
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:47,137
As a person also in a position of power,
I know it isn't easy to give that up.

876
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,072
That is because I am a better person
than you.

877
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,575
The Arabs I know were usually humble.

878
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,815
I'm curious about something.

879
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,650
Will Ra-im

880
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,286
be the director someday as well?

881
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,254
I told you

882
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,156
she is talented.

883
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,258
Even if she could be

884
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,627
the victim of an unexpected accident?

885
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,795
This is how it's always been.

886
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,430
Can't you just fire her?

887
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,265
For demoralization or something like that?

888
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,766
It's not like I haven't tried.

889
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:18,935
But

890
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,137
this is everything to Ra-im.

891
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,340
I have no right

892
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,043
to take that away from her.

893
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,814
I'll just have to do it then.

894
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,685
I've recently acquired that right.

895
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,599
There's still a long way to go.

896
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:52,869
Let's have a drink.

897
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,171
Congratulations on becoming the leader.

898
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,573
That's enough.

899
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,675
I congratulate you with all my heart,

900
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,844
but something feels empty though.

901
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,893
Next year, let's become
the best action school!

902
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,394
Yes. Let's do that.

903
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,696
The best.

904
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,722
Just like saying goodbye
To the autumn birds

905
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:26,763
After sending you off

906
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,902
I return and sit down to have a drink

907
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,641
I start to cry

908
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:46,049
When the rain falls like memories

909
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:54,223
On the streets

910
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:59,128
I become sad

911
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,031
And hang my head

912
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:08,371
I can hear your voice

913
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,911
A love so painful

914
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:21,184
Isn't true love

915
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:29,092
A love so painful

916
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:36,532
Isn't true love

917
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,706
Why are your dreams

918
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,643
always so rough?

919
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,346
Because you

920
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,815
are in my dreams.

921
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,021
Are you

922
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,390
still unhappy when with me

923
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,793
even in your dreams?

924
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,498
Still,

925
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:10,767
come into my dreams,

926
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,269
tomorrow

927
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,304
and the day after.

928
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,722
