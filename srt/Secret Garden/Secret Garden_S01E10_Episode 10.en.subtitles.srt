1
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,994
Twenty-five years ago,

2
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,863
I was ten years old.

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,600
Fifteen years ago, twenty.

4
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,602
Five years ago, thirty.

5
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,370
And then,

6
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,671
five more years passed.

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,143
But I still feel like a ten-year-old.

8
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,746
Why am I still such a child?

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,252
You're not a child.

10
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,990
A real child would say that he's an adult.

11
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,330
You really seem to be

12
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,635
a lot cooler than what I thought at first.

13
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,723
What a sight.

14
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,300
You two look great together.

15
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,606
Did you just figure that out?

16
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,309
Ra-im, were you supposed to meet him?

17
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,478
No.

18
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,749
He should've gotten the clue by now.
He must be either really dumb...

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,387
or love me to death.
It must be one of those two.

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,189
What? "Dumb"?

21
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,261
Why are you wearing
a women's undergarment?

22
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,796
What? "Undergarment"?

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,165
You never learn, do you?

24
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,635
This outfit doesn't deserve
that kind of treatment from you.

25
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:21,541
A French environmentalist designer sewed
this flower pattern stitch-by-stitch--

26
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,477
I'll be heading in.

27
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,414
Drive home safely, Oskie.

28
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,051
I'll see you in my dreams, Ra-im.

29
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,556
Be careful on the stairs.

30
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:38,858
What about me?

31
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,528
Where's my goodbye? I drove here too.

32
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,832
You should watch yourself at night.

33
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,736
Do I look like I need
to watch myself at night?

34
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,471
The night should watch out for me!

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,273
Hey! Ra-im!

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,509
What the heck is he thinking?

37
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,077
Who are you calling, "Oskie"?

38
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,647
You've never called me by a nickname!

39
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,918
We're four years apart,
the perfect age gap for dating.

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,358
Hey! How could you slam the door
in my face like that?

41
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,863
Why can't you be considerate
of my prominent nose!

42
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,700
Hey! Gil Taeng-ja!

43
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,339
I wish I could take that down.

44
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,814
Is someone outside?

45
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,951
Just a barking dog. I told it to be quiet.

46
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,388
What kind of dog barks, "Gil Taeng-ja?"

47
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,858
-Did you hear that?
-Was it President Kim?

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,928
Why was he here?

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,631
I don't know.

50
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,334
Why didn't he come in

51
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,102
if he came all the way here?

52
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,572
By the way, you got a package.

53
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,408
They deliver so quickly nowadays.

54
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,513
What is it? A book?

55
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,849
Yes.

56
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,655
I went to someone's house

57
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,892
and he had a huge library full of books.

58
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,929
It made me wonder

59
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,266
if that person had read
every book on there,

60
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,401
and which ones he liked.

61
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,606
I wondered about what he had thought
and felt as he read those books.

62
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,843
I got so curious.

63
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,479
Is that why you bought
the same book that he's reading?

64
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,514
Yes.

65
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,217
I wanted to know what he's thinking.

66
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,457
What part of his heart did I miss?

67
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,427
Who knows? I might be able to find it.

68
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,695
You're right.

69
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,133
There comes that moment when you want
to know what someone truly thinks.

70
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,455
Why did you follow me in?

71
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,092
-Would you rather follow me outside?
-You're being awfully hostile.

72
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,561
It seems like
you did something to deserve it.

73
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,796
Not yet.

74
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,665
But seeing the way you act,
I can't guarantee that I won't.

75
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,538
I don't intend to meddle
in your love affairs,

76
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,039
but answer me this honestly.

77
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,008
Did you mean

78
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,643
what you said to Ra-im?

79
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,379
I said it, so, obviously I meant it.
What else would it mean?

80
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,015
-You shouldn't mean it.
-Why not?

81
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,284
Do you really like Ra-im?

82
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,586
Can you be responsible for those feelings?

83
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,956
"Be responsible"?
You're not fit to ask that.

84
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,292
Have you been responsible
for every girl you've met?

85
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,993
No, but I've taken the heat for it.

86
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,996
And the girls I see
would never carry around

87
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,699
a tattered bag in front of guys like us

88
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,536
and not understand how we would react.
They'd never be that innocent.

89
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,372
Why are you bringing that up?

90
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,042
See? If you can't even handle that,
how will you manage?

91
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,244
Could you give up everything?

92
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,279
-Do I have to?
-You don't.

93
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,282
You can just lose the girl instead.

94
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,051
It's simple.

95
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,788
Do you know what makes our mothers
different from other rich women?

96
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:33,426
They'd never hand the inheritance
over to us in their lifetime. Why?

97
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,496
Because that's the only way
we'd listen to them.

98
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,831
Can you defeat your mom?

99
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,867
I have no right to defeat her,
so, how could I?

100
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,302
You have no right,
but you don't have a reason either.

101
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,673
To you, marriage is just business
like mergers and acquisitions.

102
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,275
Isn't it?

103
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,179
That's why
you should just meet someone like you.

104
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,481
Don't make Ra-im suffer.

105
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,350
You don't deserve her.

106
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,989
Also, what was holding Seul's
hand in Haenam all about?

107
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,457
I'm telling you, that wasn't me.

108
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,093
Then, who was it? Was it a ghost?

109
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,162
Just what is your intention?

110
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,531
You want to marry someone like Seul,

111
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,234
but you want to enjoy puppy love
with Ra-im and then dump her?

112
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,703
You're a jerk.

113
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,705
Lay off on both of them.

114
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,174
They're both

115
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,376
too good for you.

116
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,888
You have no right,
but you don't have a reason either.

117
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:40,426
To you, marriage is just business
like mergers and acquisitions.

118
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,562
Just meet someone like you.

119
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,064
Don't make Ra-im suffer.

120
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,699
You don't deserve her.

121
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,986
MR. NO-GOOD JOO-WON'S HOUSE!

122
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,725
COWARD

123
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,333
COWARD
MR. NO-GOOD JOO-WON'S HOUSE!

124
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,216
THIS MINOR MELANCHOLY

125
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:43,055
HE WALKS AT THE SPEED OF REMINISCENCE

126
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,828
ALICE IN WONDERLAND

127
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,996
LIKE A FAIRYTALE

128
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,132
A NIGHT WHERE
ONE GALAXY CROSSES ANOTHER

129
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,202
A BAD BOY STANDS

130
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,539
THIS MINOR MELANCHOLY

131
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:04,310
HE WALKS AT THE SPEED OF REMINISCENCE

132
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,522
Hold it! Hand me the script.

133
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,489
Yes, sir!

134
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,760
-Here, sir.
-Okay.

135
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,335
Here in this scene,
you're not fighting your lover to death.

136
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,437
There has to be a sense of sadness.

137
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,138
You're all brute strength.

138
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,375
You're going to slaughter your lover.

139
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,279
I must've gotten too excited
over the thought of working again.

140
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,349
Hello. Have you eaten?

141
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,250
-Hello, Director.
-I'll eat soon.

142
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,420
Here.

143
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,222
What is it?

144
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,490
You'll see when you listen to it.

145
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,093
-Can I listen to it now?
-You're lacking discipline.

146
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,096
Listen to it after training.

147
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,230
All right.

148
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,604
Director! She's listening to it
without permission!

149
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,272
She's just undisciplined. Discipline her.

150
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:46,479
When did you record all this?
Thank you so much!

151
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,681
How should we discipline her?

152
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,249
Should we have a muster call?

153
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,151
Let's make her do some PT exercises.

154
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,419
Just make her mop.

155
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,619
-Five, six, seven, eight!
-Five, six, seven, eight!

156
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:32,458
-One, two, three, four!
-One, two, three, four!

157
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,374
Hurry or we'll be late.

158
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,044
Hurry up and get dressed.
I've told you before.

159
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,580
An entertainer is a miserable job,
existing to only entertain others.

160
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,082
I can understand being on TV,

161
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,718
but how does a fan signing event
make sense in this situation?

162
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:36,288
I could talk to each fan and apologize,
but how can I sign autographs?

163
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,824
I don't have the courage
to face them right now.

164
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,460
Would you rather announce
that your agency is in a crisis?

165
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,596
Get dressed already!

166
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,707
Are you really all right?

167
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,014
Is U-yeong insane or what?

168
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,316
-How could he suspect you?
-Lower your voice.

169
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,719
But,

170
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,988
did you really not do it?

171
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,492
Do you wish that it was me?

172
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,762
I just want to be sure.

173
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,833
You're good at keeping it together though.

174
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,904
You're even getting your hair done
at a time like this.

175
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,010
Other than when the nation has fallen
or when your parents have passed away,

176
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,446
a woman should always have her hair done.

177
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:39,518
There is only one thing a woman should
protect, especially in a crisis.

178
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,421
Her beauty.

179
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,591
I'll wash your hair now.

180
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,700
Yes, it's me.

181
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,336
Did you find him?

182
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,171
Is he Korean?

183
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,375
What?

184
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,277
Are you sure that's his name?

185
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,914
No, it's just...

186
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,419
This is interesting.

187
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,355
Excuse me.

188
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,091
What shampoo is she using?

189
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,829
That? It's an imported shampoo.
It's popular because of its fragrance.

190
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,465
Director Yoon only uses that one.

191
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,134
Wash my hair with that too, please.

192
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,236
OSKA FAN SIGNING

193
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,871
-What's your name?
-Jin-ju.

194
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,908
TO JIN-JU, OSKA

195
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,545
Here you go.

196
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,281
-What's your name?
-Min-ju.

197
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,553
Thank you.

198
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,824
-What's your name?
-Lee Jin.

199
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,992
Lee Jin.

200
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,148
-It's okay!
-It's okay!

201
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,952
-Be strong, Oska!
-Be strong, Oska!

202
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,054
Oskie, it's okay!

203
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,522
We believe in you!

204
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,826
Don't pay attention to them.
Be strong! I love you!

205
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,664
You have us! We'll protect you!

206
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,933
Oskie!

207
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,970
Who's protecting who?

208
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,772
I'm going to protect you!

209
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,542
Trust me! I'm not someone who plagiarizes.

210
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,746
I might go off-key sometimes,
but my conscience is as clear as daylight!

211
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,782
-Got that?
-Yes!

212
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:54,853
-It's okay! Be strong, Oska!
-It's okay! Be strong, Oska!

213
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,791
All right. I got it, so, get in line.

214
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,797
You, over there!

215
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,799
The adorable one.

216
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,168
Yes, you. Don't cut in line.

217
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,372
I will sign today's autographs
not as the singer Oska,

218
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,474
but as the human being, Choi U-yeong.

219
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,679
TO BO-RI, CHOI U-YEONG

220
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,948
Thank you.

221
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,319
-Hello!
-Hello.

222
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,587
What's your name?

223
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,292
Okay.

224
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,060
-What's your name?
-Seon-ju.

225
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,163
TO SEON-JU, CHOI U-YEONG

226
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,932
-What's your name?
-Hye-su.

227
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,369
Listen to your mother.
Watch the road and your weight.

228
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,305
And look me up on the Internet. Got it?

229
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,273
-Okay! Stay strong!
-Stay strong!

230
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,011
What's your name?

231
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,651
I don't believe in you.

232
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,554
You don't believe in me either, right?

233
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,595
But I'm still your fan.

234
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:15,067
Please write,
"To Yoon Seul, with my eternal love."

235
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,978
To Yoon Seul.

236
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,883
Thank you for loving me so much.

237
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,188
December 2010, Oska.

238
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,045
Excuse me, but do you know
how much these seats cost?

239
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,948
I paid 250,000 won. Why?

240
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:36,915
Then,

241
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,586
did she pay 250,000 won too?

242
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,221
-Excuse me?
-Because I did.

243
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,156
Please take her.

244
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,026
Then, these seats are all...

245
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,962
Yes. All three of these seats...

246
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,731
are mine.

247
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,735
I like having both armrests to myself.

248
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,220
How was the opera?

249
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,554
I couldn't focus.

250
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,090
Book it again.
Get the entire row this time.

251
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,027
-The entire row?
-Some woman placed her bag on my seat.

252
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,029
After talking to her, I realized

253
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,301
I wouldn't have had to speak to her
if I had booked the entire row.

254
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,073
For most, that would be
a difficult realization.

255
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,708
But I'm special.

256
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,143
What is it that you had to tell me?

257
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,515
This is the data for tomorrow's
Bisong Resort VIP presentation.

258
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,917
That's tomorrow?

259
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,419
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

260
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,955
Your brain must be on a break
because I've been lenient lately.

261
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,926
Oh, my goodness.
You even confirmed the schedule...

262
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,061
Why are you upsetting me?

263
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,896
I'm upset too.

264
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,832
Hearts in my signature?

265
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,469
I shouldn't have said it.

266
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,537
Now, she actually
thinks she's Kim Tae-hee.

267
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,646
Up until now, resorts have been centered
on a leisure concept like skiing, golfing.

268
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,383
People go to rest,
but end up being more tired.

269
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,652
That is why I thought,

270
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,989
"Isn't there a resort
for true relaxation?"

271
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,592
One that provides rest
just at the thought of going.

272
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,227
And for this reason,

273
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,263
Bisong Resort, which will renew history,

274
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,767
has been built on a hill,
surrounded by forests and valleys.

275
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:47,539
That doesn't mean we tampered with nature.

276
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,841
We left it as is.

277
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:54,279
We made sure that not a single tree
or rock was touched.

278
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,348
More specifically,

279
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,050
I made sure.

280
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,720
I will show you the rooms.

281
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,961
He's all bark and no bite.

282
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,798
He's always had a way with words.

283
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,202
They say the chairman has arrived.

284
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,504
What? Out of the blue?

285
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,609
As you can see, the interior
has been built with the finest materials.

286
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:29,881
You can trust me.
Every doorknob and spoon was handpicked.

287
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,917
By who? By me.

288
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,192
I'm sure you are all tired from walking,
so, I will keep this short.

289
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,162
We always keep it short.

290
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:50,068
Your soon-to-be villas
and my soon-to-be villa.

291
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:54,506
The stargazing, moonlight walks,
and the breeze await us.

292
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,977
A truly eco-friendly rest
will await you every day.

293
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,817
To wrap up,

294
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,689
we trust that you will love and support
our new healing resort.

295
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,758
We want to thank you all

296
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,826
for attending today.

297
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,728
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

298
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,231
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

299
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,806
Okay. Bye.

300
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,144
Where is the chairman? Did he leave?

301
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,645
Yes. He just left.

302
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,047
He looked very satisfied.

303
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,182
Did he?

304
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,522
I've always been quick on my feet.

305
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,324
And

306
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,628
I found out who the CEO's physician is.

307
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,829
Did you?

308
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,768
President Kim is taking a walk.

309
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,470
I know. I've spoken to him.

310
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,706
If you need anything else...

311
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,609
I'm fine. Thank you.

312
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,689
Have some tea while I wash up.
I'm sweaty from the walk--

313
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,058
No, me first.
It'll only take five minutes.

314
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,627
What? Stay for dinner.

315
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,995
I have plans.

316
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,232
I just came to check up on you.
Don't you need a medicine refill?

317
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,266
My medicine?

318
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,004
I haven't been taking medication lately.

319
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,774
-You haven't?
-How did I do that?

320
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,611
How did I survive sleeping
in that tiny room without any medication?

321
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,913
-Did you go somewhere?
-What I mean is...

322
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,783
Never mind.

323
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,819
You might think I've really gone crazy
and institutionalize me.

324
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,488
Anyway,

325
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,957
I guess I don't need
the medication anymore.

326
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,561
But I have a question.

327
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:01,566
Usually, do people give up things in order
to get something that they really want?

328
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,804
Yes, because it's usually
something they don't deserve.

329
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:10,442
No way. Then, are you saying
that she's too good for me?

330
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,610
"She"?

331
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,920
This woman...

332
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,191
Does she always have to act
so tacky and cliché?

333
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,160
Do you even know how difficult it is

334
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:33,498
for a woman who has nothing
to be tacky and cliché like this?

335
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,134
Most women would've taken it and left.

336
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,106
I told you. She's too good for you.

337
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,611
-Is it true?
-Yes.

338
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,548
I just got off the phone
with Reporter Park from Star Sports.

339
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:54,352
That fraud sent in a letter of apology,
confessing that it was all his fault.

340
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,254
That idiot.

341
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,589
Why did he send it to them?

342
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,091
Are they releasing a seventh album?
Are they a Korean Wave star?

343
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,827
My scandals keep that
newspaper company in business.

344
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,498
It looks like you're back to life
since you're shooting your mouth.

345
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,634
The article will be up in a few hours.
You've been through a lot.

346
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,237
Yes. They say when you're young,
suffering is worth the experience.

347
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,806
But I'm too old for all this.

348
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,143
He looked like he was never
going to come clean.

349
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,178
Why did he give in all of a sudden?

350
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,148
Did my fans dox him?

351
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,616
I'm sure he has a conscience.

352
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,553
Anyway, this is good.
Release a statement about your experience.

353
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,556
Let's find a good composer
and do this seventh album right.

354
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,758
All right. You take care of that.

355
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,928
And you, find out where Han Tae-seon is.

356
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:41,399
I should have apologized to him.

357
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:46,271
It seemed that
he was going to leave Korea.

358
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,907
If he's still in Korea,
tell him that I want to see him.

359
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,175
Where are you going?

360
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,476
Home.

361
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,144
I'm expecting a package.

362
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,215
It must have been hard
these past few days.

363
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,120
I'm Yoon Seul. Nice to meet you.

364
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,024
How did you find me?

365
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,159
You're the original composer
of Oska's title song,

366
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,696
the one with the plagiarism issue, right?

367
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,067
You wrote it for your friends from London
who fed you and gave you a place to stay,

368
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,471
and a Korean composer plagiarized it.

369
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,974
You wrote it
under the nickname, "Sun", right?

370
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,545
You researched my background thoroughly.

371
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:31,716
I have many, many connections,
so, I can obtain information quickly.

372
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:37,122
I called you to offer you a contract deal.

373
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,691
I brought the contract.
Would you like to see it?

374
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,426
It includes a house, a studio, and a car.

375
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,795
Let me know if you want more.

376
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,665
I don't have the stomach to endure
business people like you.

377
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,366
If you'll excuse me.

378
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,538
You can pay for the tea
since you called me out.

379
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:54,906
Do I look like

380
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,409
I'm in business to earn money?

381
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,612
I like your music.

382
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,847
And I have a lot of money.

383
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,384
Create the music that you want.
I will help you.

384
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,485
Why?

385
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,287
Why would you help me?

386
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,293
Maybe you're too young to know,

387
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,763
but it's not easy to find someone
who knows your true value.

388
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,598
That's why you tried to leave Korea.

389
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,500
Isn't it?

390
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,770
Up until now, no one recognized
Han Tae-seon's music.

391
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,940
No one even knew who Sun was.

392
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,376
But I have recognized you.

393
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,545
Isn't that

394
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,047
reason enough?

395
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,077
What is that?

396
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,478
This?

397
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,113
It's a game console.

398
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,616
Is this where Choi U-yeong lives?

399
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,617
What?

400
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,119
The new one came out? When?

401
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,291
Just a few days ago. Mr. Choi is
the first person to own one in Korea.

402
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,095
Should we put it over there?

403
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,330
No. Load it back up.

404
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,635
-Pardon?
-This isn't Choi U-yeong's house.

405
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,274
Hey!

406
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,776
-Hey.
-Get off right now!

407
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,245
I waited three months for this.

408
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,381
Then, wait three more for another one.

409
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,982
Why would I do that?

410
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,452
I'm going to have it moved tomorrow,
so, don't touch it and get off.

411
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,624
Fine.

412
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,127
Do as you wish.

413
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,796
Just make sure to avoid Dong-gyu.

414
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:33,698
What do you mean?

415
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,267
You know how exact I am about being fair.

416
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,169
As soon as you take this,

417
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,972
I'll send your photos with Park Chae-rin
to Dong-gyu.

418
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,174
You evil jerk.

419
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,542
If you leave this here,

420
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,144
I'll give you the originals
in three months.

421
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,613
Do you mean it?

422
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,082
-Do you promise?
-Of course.

423
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,420
I saw that you cleared up
the plagiarism issue.

424
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,821
Of course.

425
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,656
I've been a good man all my life.

426
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,528
God may test me,
but he won't let me suffer for long.

427
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:08,366
And the truth always prevails.
So, you should watch out.

428
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,236
-What about me?
-Don't pretend like you don't know.

429
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,006
Your current infatuation with Gil Ra-im.

430
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,243
If you have any true feelings for her,

431
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:22,113
stop with the act,
and come back to your normal self.

432
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,083
That fits you, not this.

433
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,517
I've already decided.

434
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,953
I'm going to break up with her.

435
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,990
-Really?
-Except that

436
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,458
I'll do it later.

437
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,627
Not right now. I can't now.

438
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,395
Why not now?

439
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,499
I've thought about it from all angles
for the past few days.

440
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,968
I like her.

441
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,304
So, I'm going to see her
as if I have no pride.

442
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,772
What?

443
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,708
I may find her novel and interesting now

444
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:54,078
but if I keep seeing her,
I'll certainly grow tired of her.

445
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,581
She'll be like any other woman.

446
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,784
She'll be neither hot nor cold.

447
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,121
I give it three months.

448
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:08,626
Nothing will happen to my fortune
just because I see her for three months.

449
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,461
Jerk.

450
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,798
-I'm going to tell Ra-im.
-She already knows.

451
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,868
That all she can be is the Little Mermaid.

452
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,672
With her personality,
I don't think she'll get clingy.

453
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,876
You're being very clingy right now
in my eyes.

454
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,045
I am?

455
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,415
What do you want?

456
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,986
-Pay up.
-What?

457
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,721
-I gained weight.
-What?

458
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,325
I had very clear-cut abs
before we had our bodies switched,

459
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,360
but where are they now?

460
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,729
My clothes don't look good on me anymore
without my abs.

461
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,731
So, give them back.

462
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,232
Psycho.

463
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,073
These are the ones you washed.

464
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,240
Just keep them.

465
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,575
Why would I?

466
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,078
I think they'll fit perfectly.

467
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,880
Get rid of them.

468
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,718
And I never wore this one.

469
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,755
I'm sorry. That got mixed in there.

470
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,157
Anyway, keep them,

471
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,494
since they're better
than the ones you have already.

472
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,598
Psycho.

473
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,900
Take responsibility.

474
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,469
-What now?
-Me.

475
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,338
I'm constipated.

476
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,008
What did you feed me?

477
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,676
Why can't I push them off?

478
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,012
It's completely blocked up.

479
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,314
What are you going to do about it?

480
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,782
Do you have proof that it was me?

481
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,684
Evidence? Should I bag it up and bring it?

482
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,520
Pervert!

483
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,735
What now? What do you want?

484
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,871
My department store stocks went down.

485
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,141
Maybe they found out
that the CEO is crazy.

486
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,377
Are you going to say that's my fault?

487
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,712
You think it wasn't?

488
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,281
I told you not to sign anything.

489
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,784
What were you thinking?

490
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,887
You never dreamed
that with each signature,

491
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,555
you're affecting the stock market,
did you?

492
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,757
That is my status,

493
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,960
and that is what
your juvenile heart signatures are worth.

494
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,998
Do you understand what you've done now?

495
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,167
What was I supposed to do?

496
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,570
Mr. Kim said that I had to do it.

497
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,107
-So, I'm going to fire him.
-What? That's not fair.

498
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,442
Should I not?

499
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:42,580
Fine, then I'm going to come and go
as I please.

500
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,485
And every time, you must greet me
with love, joy, and gratitude, okay?

501
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,354
In your dreams.

502
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,057
I can greet you
with violence and profanity.

503
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,160
Do you want a preview?

504
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,129
Are you okay with Mr. Kim being fired?

505
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,431
Jerk.

506
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,101
I dare you.

507
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,070
Get mad at me!
What did my clothes ever do?

508
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,339
Psycho.

509
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,045
See.

510
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,447
Why are girls like that?

511
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,316
They don't do it
when they're with each other.

512
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,885
But when they're with guys,
they get foam on their lips

513
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,487
and pretend not to know about it.

514
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,724
Gross.

515
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,560
Come here.

516
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,504
What? There are no napkins.

517
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,141
I can't use my jacket.
"Stitch-by-stitch", remember?

518
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,382
I'm warning you,
don't use violence towards me from now on.

519
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:55,253
If you do so, this is how I'll react.

520
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,425
-Get in.
-Yes!

521
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,628
First day of shooting!

522
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,696
I can't wait.

523
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,765
This is great.

524
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,639
Ra-im, what are you doing?

525
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,873
Excuse me?

526
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,309
I'm sorry.

527
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,078
Let's roll.

528
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,622
-What?
-I'm going too.

529
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,724
Do you even know where we're going?
Get lost.

530
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,692
Anywhere is fine.

531
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,661
I said get lost.

532
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,262
Let's go.

533
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,798
What are you doing?

534
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,367
I told you to watch out
for my prominent nose.

535
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,070
What's the matter? I told him to come.

536
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,874
-Get in.
-He's never even received proper training.

537
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,410
I'm not the type to fail at things.

538
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,378
I'm a fast learner.

539
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,081
All we're doing today
is running and falling.

540
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,849
Or, he can just stay in the car.

541
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,954
Who are you to stop him, anyway?
Get in already. The director is waiting.

542
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,824
What the heck!

543
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,093
-What are you doing?
-It's so cramped.

544
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,761
Let's go.

545
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:16,167
Can't we go separately though?
It's so uncomfortable.

546
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,803
If you speak, you're getting left behind.

547
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,405
Even me?

548
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,242
He spoke. Leave him so we have more room.

549
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,476
Hey--

550
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,878
You heard what she said.

551
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,753
Why is he here?

552
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,524
I thought he gave up,

553
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,094
but he keeps hanging around Ra-im,
so, I brought him.

554
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,263
Ra-im is so clueless.
She keeps driving him away,

555
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,699
so, I'm playing Cupid.

556
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,403
It'd be good for Ra-im.
He can make things easier for her.

557
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,941
I'll head off first. Bring the rest.

558
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,276
Yes, sir.

559
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,146
Is everyone ready?

560
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,115
-Yes.
-One minute.

561
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,350
Where's my spear?

562
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,452
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

563
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,325
Hey.

564
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,826
Yes, Mr. Money-maker Joo-won. What is it?

565
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,029
I think something went wrong.
It's been switched, right?

566
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,331
What has?

567
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,301
Take it off. That's my costume.

568
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:58,936
What?

569
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,984
Get him!

570
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,220
-Get him!
-Get him!

571
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,595
What happened?

572
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,598
I told him that if he does well today,
I'd let him come to our workshop.

573
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,219
What are you doing?

574
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,487
The ground's all muddy!

575
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,442
Get them!

576
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,403
Hey!

577
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,673
You! What do you think you're doing?

578
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,009
He's on your side!

579
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,211
Are you a spy?

580
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,079
Come on.

581
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,449
-Sorry.
-"Sorry"?

582
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,385
I apologize. He must have been confused.

583
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,422
Were we on the same side?

584
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,858
I didn't know.

585
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,261
Weren't you an Arab spy?
Or a Middle-Eastern oil merchant?

586
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,365
Goodness. He's your leader. Pay attention.

587
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,602
We're allies?

588
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,805
-He's a piece of work.
-Oh, gosh.

589
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,576
Okay. Next scene.

590
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,778
Is everyone ready?

591
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:21,979
Wait.

592
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,514
Get ready, martial arts team.

593
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,049
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

594
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,284
-Hey.
-My goodness.

595
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,287
-Yes?
-You know the scene we just did

596
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,923
where we ran and got shot by arrows?

597
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,125
-Let's take a look at the footage.
-Excuse me?

598
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,596
I'm actually a cameo
on the same level as Jang Dong-gun.

599
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,332
I just need to quickly check
how I looked--

600
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,300
Where did this screwball come from?

601
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,869
Out of my way.

602
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,005
Is the martial arts team not ready yet?

603
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,007
I'm sorry. We're ready now.

604
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,447
You don't look too bad.

605
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,549
Director Lim will be out soon as well.

606
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,419
Okay. The martial arts team is ready.

607
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,388
We'll start shooting in five minutes.

608
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,999
There is a disorder known
as Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

609
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,570
It is a fascinating and sad disorder
in which one's perception is distorted

610
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,073
as if one is looking through
a telescope upside down,

611
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,342
causing one to live in a fairytale world.

612
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,246
I am certain that I have this disorder.

613
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:41,752
Otherwise, why would every moment
with this average girl

614
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,921
feel like a fairy tale?

615
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,930
-Good work, everyone!
-Good work!

616
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,164
-Thank you.
-Good work.

617
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,152
Why aren't you eating?

618
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,190
-Sir?
-I don't eat food

619
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,259
unless I know exactly where it came from.

620
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,663
Don't eat it. Eat something warm later.

621
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,165
I still have scenes to shoot.

622
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,471
Where is Director Lim?

623
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,075
Did he go somewhere
to eat something better?

624
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,511
He's gone to shoot
a horseback riding insert. Why?

625
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,112
That's what I mean.

626
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,715
Why are you doing this ridiculous job

627
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,884
where you have to shoot an insert
while starving?

628
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,386
Just eat your food.

629
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,992
I just don't get it.
It's not good money, there's no fame,

630
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,294
you could get seriously injured
or even lose your life.

631
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,096
So, why do you do this job?

632
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,532
"The pride of being a stunt actor"?

633
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,302
No one will recognize you.
They only remember the leads.

634
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,871
Who cares about pride?

635
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,407
Am I wrong?

636
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,376
You're right.

637
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:13,711
However...

638
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,047
this person remembers me.

639
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,351
This person remembers me.

640
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,422
This person remembers me.

641
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,959
And I remember all of them too.

642
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,594
Sure.

643
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,897
But it's only a few people.
How does that change anything?

644
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:39,069
"A few people"? What about you then?
How many friends do you have?

645
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,272
How many of your friends would
get injured in your place

646
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:46,510
and be glad that it wasn't you,
and laugh it out together?

647
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,384
This is why I told you not to come.

648
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,955
I don't understand
why you laugh at what we do,

649
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,290
but it's what we chose.

650
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,727
This is what we're most passionate about.

651
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,130
That's why we do it.

652
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,600
Who are you to judge our work?

653
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,702
What gives you that right?

654
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,046
Thank you for the food!

655
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,715
Great work today.

656
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,322
-You should eat.
-I am.

657
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,693
Ra-im was awesome today.
Director, you were great today too.

658
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,062
Good job today.

659
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,970
Great work, guys. Eat up!

660
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,906
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

661
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,240
Eat up.

662
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,447
What about me?

663
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,652
You can't eat this stuff.
You said that only perverts eat it.

664
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,821
It's up to me whether I eat or not.

665
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,824
You're holding the tongs,
so, you have a duty to not discriminate.

666
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,392
You said you want discrimination.

667
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:12,062
Being set apart and treated differently
are the principles you people live by.

668
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,363
You can't eat this?

669
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,833
How do you call yourself a man?

670
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,568
Who said I can't?

671
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,703
And this has nothing
to do with being a man--

672
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,774
You said you wanted it. Eat.

673
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,210
I am eating it.

674
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,953
It tastes so...

675
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,323
Chew it.

676
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,226
Chew it and swallow.

677
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,561
No! I'm going to melt it.

678
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,134
What?

679
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,070
Why am I here?

680
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,306
Did we switch again?

681
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,975
Are you still drunk?

682
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,479
-Wash your face.
-Why am I here if we didn't?

683
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,182
Why do you think?

684
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,817
Think hard.

685
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,056
I asked you because I don't know.
Why am I...

686
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,859
My head.

687
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,631
Great work today.

688
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,733
You all did great.

689
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,649
Gosh...

690
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,656
I'm going to eat breakfast

691
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,092
with Ra-im tomorrow.

692
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,329
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

693
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,997
Good!

694
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,401
It's game over if you do.

695
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,170
Says who?

696
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,205
You can't!

697
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,341
Over my dead body!

698
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,909
Right.

699
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,611
You shouldn't.

700
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:44,014
What are you talking about?

701
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,784
I slept at her house

702
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,486
so many times.

703
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,024
You have no idea,
and yet you keep going on and on.

704
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,659
Hey!

705
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,667
Why are you going in there?

706
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,435
Don't ever go in there.

707
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,636
Let me go.

708
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,144
This is my home.

709
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,146
I lived here.

710
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,283
I've worn her underwear...

711
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,887
I've bathed her,

712
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,423
and I've brushed her teeth
three times a day.

713
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,128
Shut your mouth.
Do you seriously want me to kill you?

714
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,331
It's been a while since I've been hit.

715
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,700
I could've dodged it.

716
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,101
Ra-im,

717
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,604
why is he being such a pain?

718
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,639
Tell him to go home!

719
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,875
Director Lim, you be quiet too.

720
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,110
-Move.
-I have to go in first.

721
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,178
Director Lim.

722
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,180
Seriously!

723
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,789
What's going on?

724
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,792
Director Lim? President Kim?

725
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,462
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them
as you can see.

726
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,899
I'm going to sleep on the bed!

727
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,069
Go ahead.
I'm going to sleep next to Ra-im.

728
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,006
Hey!

729
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,355
What's this? Why are you here?

730
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,592
Where are we?

731
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,395
Is this your home?

732
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,732
So, you've never been here, have you?

733
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:43,900
Of course, not.

734
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:47,871
My head.

735
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,574
Your head hurts, right?

736
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,576
The shame will come in five minutes.

737
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,277
That's where I'm at now.

738
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,484
That was quick.

739
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,466
Do you need any help?

740
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,437
Sit. You need to relieve your hangover.

741
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:21,838
Okay.

742
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,312
Did you get rid of my toothbrush?

743
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,716
Why would we have your toothbrush?

744
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,920
Give me the blue towel. I like that one.

745
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,026
He must still be drunk.

746
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,405
Ra-im!

747
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,884
What are you doing here?

748
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:12,122
I wanted to surprise you,
but what are they doing here?

749
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,957
Did you guys play poker all night?

750
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,026
What are you doing here?

751
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,794
I came to kidnap Ra-im.

752
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,430
You weren't picking up your phone.

753
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,367
I was a bit preoccupied this morning.

754
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,838
It's okay. Just know that you're
the first girl to not pick up my call.

755
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,476
I met you on Jeju Island, right?

756
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,111
This is perfect.

757
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:39,549
I was going to ask Ra-im to be my mentor
for a while. Is that all right?

758
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:40,650
"Mentor"?

759
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,185
Do you need action training?

760
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,655
Something like that.
I'll take that as a "yes."

761
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,727
Shall we go? What a sweet
and courteous kidnapping, right?

762
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,696
That's my charm.

763
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,470
I'm asking because I'm actually curious.

764
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,572
Do you laugh
because you actually like this,

765
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,175
or because it's pitiful?

766
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,143
It's the latter, right?

767
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,113
May I go?

768
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,450
Go ahead.

769
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,086
Hop in.

770
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,123
-Goodbye.
-See you.

771
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,332
How could you send her like that?

772
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,569
Then, why didn't you do anything?

773
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,906
You could've taken physical action
with your training,

774
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,441
and I could've gotten you an attorney.

775
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,810
Are we on the same side right now?

776
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,079
"The enemy of my enemy is a friend."
Don't you know that?

777
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,583
Why not? That's a famous Arabic saying.

778
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,886
A commercial?

779
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,421
Why are you so surprised?

780
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:55,325
Are you wondering what kind of nutjob
would give me a commercial?

781
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,994
-Is that it?
-Of course, not.

782
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:02,499
I'm just happy
because it's been a while for you.

783
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,502
The plagiarism scandal is over
and you got a commercial deal too.

784
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:09,072
I thought that
things were finally starting to look up.

785
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,473
Right?

786
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,144
You're really the best.

787
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,279
This isn't good.

788
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,848
When people understand me this well,

789
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,917
I start thinking about them at night.

790
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,352
Which night?

791
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,355
Tonight? Tomorrow night?

792
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,425
I want to know
so that I can think of you too.

793
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,697
At this rate,
we'll be dating in five seconds.

794
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:39,135
Are you being cautious of me?

795
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,446
I was joking.

796
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,882
I know.

797
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,952
But you caught me red-handed.

798
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,489
To be honest,

799
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,257
I am being cautious.

800
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,995
I'm starting

801
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,298
to grow fond of you.

802
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,640
Let's talk about work.

803
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:22,846
The commercial is for outdoor clothing,
and it's a rock-climbing concept.

804
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:28,251
But in my eight years of being a singer,
I've always been at the top.

805
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,188
So, I've forgotten how to climb up.

806
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,726
You can help me, right?

807
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:41,164
Although, your beauty might distract me.

808
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,635
It would take several months
to learn properly,

809
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:49,706
but you're pretty athletic
and you're not doing this professionally.

810
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,709
So, ten days should be enough.

811
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,877
You said, "yes", okay?

812
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,748
How should we schedule the training?
Whatever works for you is fine with me.

813
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:02,485
I'll call you once I confirm my schedule
with the team.

814
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:05,989
Excuse me.

815
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,092
Hello?

816
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,762
Yes, this is...

817
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,802
Right now?

818
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,123
Did you receive the money that I returned?

819
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,292
What money?

820
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,528
Didn't Joo-won return it?

821
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,566
Did he say that
he would return it for you?

822
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,668
Haven't you received it yet?

823
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,670
Are you kidding me?

824
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,705
Was that amount not enough?

825
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,575
Or, do you really want monthly payments?

826
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,177
You are really indecipherable.

827
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,246
Why should my son pay back what you spent?

828
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,148
Is he your wallet?

829
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,516
That isn't what I meant.

830
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:11,187
I know this is difficult to believe,
but it wasn't me who received that money.

831
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,291
Really? It wasn't you, you say?

832
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:19,829
Why? Did you leave your soul at home
when you came out to take money?

833
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,767
I assumed that you had no pride, but that
you'd keep your promise, at least.

834
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,003
Why are you still seeing Joo-won?

835
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:31,908
Do you have such a beggar's mentality
that you have no pride or shame?

836
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,880
You should've either taken the money
and left or asked for more.

837
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,082
Don't you have any business ethics?

838
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,853
You're a little out of line.

839
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,188
I am, aren't I?

840
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,323
Only in words though.

841
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,632
I'm sorry.

842
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,033
It was out of instinct.

843
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,303
I'll go again.

844
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:04,474
What in the world?

845
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,510
Oh my. What are you?

846
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,285
What are you doing?

847
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,755
Can't you see?
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

848
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,891
Why? What for?

849
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,627
You have no reason to treat her this way.

850
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,031
Kim Joo-won.

851
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,034
What are you doing to me
in front of this tramp?

852
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,503
You're wasting your energy, that's why.

853
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,139
I never said that I would marry her.

854
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:39,242
Why are you turning this
into some third-rate soap opera?

855
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,847
If my life starts to depend on her,

856
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,650
then, you can intervene. Stop me then.

857
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,353
This is temporary for me.

858
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,655
Can't you even wait that long?

859
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,969
