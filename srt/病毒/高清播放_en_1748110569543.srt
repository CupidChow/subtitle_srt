30 minutes in thekós

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,740
Press the course쇼 button to see the

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,440
leaders longed for

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,100
3C

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
Okay.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,380
Mr. Ok Taekseon.

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,880
I'm here to introduce you to my brother, Mr. Nam Su-pil.

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,320
Hello.

9
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,120
My new employee…

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,800
… ''Leaves a nosebleed immediately."

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,180
They're all busy now with their paper spray employee.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Before lunch,

13
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,280
I have to check their enzyme laparosis

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,040
and prescribe 10 doses of amino acids each.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,120
Other than Merista Corona,

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,120
macros have recently been rising in the findings.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
Uhm…

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,400
… crazy…

19
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,340
I don't remember. It's been over 10 years since I graduated.

20
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,340
I'm a civil science major.

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,940
Interpretation at the same time?

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,140
I heard you went to a graduate school.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
I was going to write a novel, but I couldn't.

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,860
I see.

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,340
So I changed it to English.

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,260
I was going to interpret, but I couldn't.

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,740
So I'm translating now.

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,460
I guess that's why I'm a genius.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
I guess you like rats.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,100
It's not that I like them.

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
It's a kind of affection.

32
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Affection?

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,100
I used to be a mouse in Japan because of a program called Masako.

34
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Masako?

35
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,100
Yes.

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,100
We named the rats we hated, but when they died,

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,100
they left me a will.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
They asked me to remember their death.

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
They asked me not to make my death a waste.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
The rats?

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
The rats?

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,100
In my dream.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
In your dream?

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Yes.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Even if it was an experiment, it hurt a lot when they died.

46
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,100
In the experimental lab, they live for humans and die for humans.

47
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,100
They die from heart heat, body temperature drop,

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
and suddenly die without any reason.

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,100
What animal do you like?

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
A cat?

51
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Wait.

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,100
Jung-won, you can take it out by turning the machine, right?

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Why can't you do that?

54
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Don't touch it.

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,100
I think we should go.

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Yes, go.

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Work is important.

58
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
This is a very important experiment.

59
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,100
I was going to eat with you, but I'm sorry.

60
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,100
I'll contact you next time.

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
It's a black line.

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
What?

63
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
No, go.

64
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
Yes.

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,100
What are you going to do if you give me a Jennifer?

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
No.

67
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Don't give me food.

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
No.

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Let's put the people who died here back.

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes, next time.

71
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,100
Do you want to eat seaweed and ginseng here?

72
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
I think the man took it earlier.

73
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
You want to sleep here?

74
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
I'll go.

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
All I remember today is you.

76
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
You?

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
He left a will to himself.

78
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
What?

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
His name is Masako.

80
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
Masako?

81
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
Do you know why he's like that?

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,100
It's a little weird, but he's diligent in his work.

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
He only knows the lab and his house.

84
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I don't think he's ever dated anyone.

85
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
He's even weirder.

86
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,100
Stop it.

87
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
He's a doctor.

88
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
He's got a lot of salary and he's not even married.

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Where did you go and do that?

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Are you on his side?

91
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Of course.

92
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm out of my mind.

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,100
I told you not to eat this.

94
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
How can I eat it when I can't sleep?

95
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Just meet him once.

96
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Where else can I meet a doctor?

97
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
He doesn't need a translator anymore.

98
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
He's got an AI translator.

99
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Don't touch me when you become unemployed.

100
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,100
No matter how much AI you have, you have to know the details.

101
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
You're so lazy to find details.

102
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Do you know how you live alone?

103
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Look at Jisun.

104
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
Even though she didn't study,

105
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
you're smiling and smiling.

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
You're doing well in getting married.

107
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
And your husband has a hair salon.

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Don't drink at home.

109
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
You drink alone because you don't want to get drunk.

110
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Go away, everyone.

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Why are you here?

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
Come and cook and clean up.

113
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
Is it my birthday today?

114
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
And you.

115
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
You put makeup on my face at night.

116
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm not relieving my stress.

117
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,500
My face is for your practice.

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,700
She's pretty.

119
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
She's here.

120
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Hello.

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh, my. You're here.

122
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,300
It must be hard to find you.

123
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,600
No, it's okay.

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,100
Are you two flirting?

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, my.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,300
You must have run here. Why are you sweating?

127
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Mom, let's go now.

128
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,000
He's a doctor. We'll trust him.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,400
We're adults.

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's be honest.

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,700
Are you really leaving?

132
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Leaving me here?

133
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,900
Go!

134
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,200
Don't talk about him.

135
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Okay.

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Go and get the pot.

137
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm not a bad person.

138
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
You should say that first.

139
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
Hey, Nam Su-pil.

140
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Yes?

141
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
Please leave now.

142
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,400
I don't think this is right.

143
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,700
We know each other so well.

144
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,900
Why are you doing this at night?

145
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,200
You're living alone.

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,100
Yes.

147
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,700
I'll go.

149
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Okay.

150
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,200
Can I ask you something?

151
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Yes, go ahead.

152
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,000
What's the difference between your name and mine?

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,600
It's a must.

154
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,900
A must-have choice?

155
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
It's not fun, is it?

156
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,500
No.

157
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,300
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.

158
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Yes.

159
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Are you crying?

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,700
Su-pil.

161
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Su-pil.

162
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,100
No.

163
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,100
How are you going to live in this world?

164
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,500
I'm more worried than I am.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,100
I thought you felt the same way.

166
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,100
This isn't a secret, is it?

167
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,100
What's a secret?

168
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,500
No, I get it.

169
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,400
You said you were studying the molecular virus, right?

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,100
You won't remember once you hear about it.

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,400
You said it for a long time.

172
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
This is a secret.

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm actually studying something very important.

174
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It's about human happiness.

175
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Happiness?

176
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Yes.

177
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,000
I was supposed to be responsible for it,

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,400
but I got hit by the wind in the US.

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
If I succeed, it'll be a mess.

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
What is this?

181
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Who is it?

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Is it a group text?

183
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
It's from elementary school.

184
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Oh, me again?

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,200
I wish today was Christmas.

186
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Why?

187
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Because my birthday is Christmas,

188
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
and I didn't have a girlfriend.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,400
You know the book, Three Days in 80 Days?

190
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
I've always wanted to do that.

191
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,400
Traveling around the world with my girlfriend.

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Deok-san.

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
You're so pretty.

194
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I have makeup on.

195
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
Let's go together.

196
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Traveling around the world.

197
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,700
My pupils are bigger.

198
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,600
Shall we celebrate today?

199
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
It's a must-have for couples.

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What? What's wrong with you?

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We...

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Are we getting married?

203
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I mean it.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
Deok-san...

205
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
You're so mean.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
You don't know me.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Deok-san, it's not that.

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Deok-san.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Deok-san.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Deok-san, I'm sorry.

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not that kind of person.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't do that when I first saw you.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,400
I was going back to the lab, and my heart was pounding.

214
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,600
I was just thinking about you.

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Ji-pil.

216
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Ji-pil, you seem like a good person.

217
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Please leave me alone.

218
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
I have no choice but to report you.

219
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
You don't know me.

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm not that kind of person.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
You said you'd be in the world for 80 days.

222
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,000
I've only been out of the house for a step over 80 days.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Can you imagine how I feel?

224
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,000
I've been going to Seokchon-ro for about 100 years.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm that kind of person.

226
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
So, don't be so emotional.

228
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Don't do this to me.

229
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Okay?

230
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
That's strange.

231
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
If you don't know that you've fallen in love

232
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
and you see her actions, you'd think she's crazy.

233
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
What do you mean, crazy?

234
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm crazy because I love her.

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Why did you leave this?

236
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Are you having a good time?

240
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
The first car test drive.

241
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
See you at the store.

242
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Your eternal class leader.

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Dealer Kim Yeon-ho.

244
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
They look good together.

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Let's meet for a second.

246
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
He's angry, but he doesn't look good.

247
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
He's a little shy.

248
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Is this her house?

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Yes.

250
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Is this your first time meeting her?

251
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Yes.

252
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
She's asleep.

253
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Let's stop seeing each other.

254
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
What are you talking about?

255
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
I'm worried about you.

256
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I just slept.

257
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
How about getting married?

258
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
We've only met for a day.

259
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
It's been two years.

260
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I guess that's what it is.

261
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I miss you so much.

262
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I got a kiss mark.

263
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I didn't sleep.

264
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You're so mean.

265
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
The seniors told me to be careful.

266
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
They said they didn't know people because they met Ju.

267
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Dealer Kim Yeon-ho.

268
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeon-ho.

269
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Oh, the bookmark.

270
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Press the start button.

271
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
The foot.

272
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
The brake.

273
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
It's too easy.

274
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
No, no.

275
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
If you press this, it'll be a little more comfortable.

276
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
The back line is long.

277
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
But this model is more like an interior space than other models.

278
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Yeon-ho.

279
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Yes?

280
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
It's awkward.

281
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
You're so nice to me.

282
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Of course.

283
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm your client.

284
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
You've changed a lot.

285
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
You're so bright and pretty.

286
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Did you touch me?

287
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Hey.

288
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm just kidding.

289
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
You rarely came to the reunion.

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I was wondering how you were doing.

291
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Were you curious about me?

292
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Of course.

293
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
What's your car now?

294
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
You have to sell it anyway.

295
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
I know that well.

296
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I don't have a car.

297
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Is it your first car?

298
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah.

299
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
But what did you say you were doing?

300
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Can I get out of this car?

301
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Oh, the test.

302
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
That's right.

303
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
That's the right order.

304
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
I really need you to drive.

305
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
You have to drive yourself to buy a car.

306
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
You have a license, right?

307
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Yeah.

308
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's go.

309
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Shall we go to the Olympic Road?

310
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Let's go to the sea.

311
00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I know how you feel, but the test section is usually half a kilometer from the point.

312
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Let's go.

313
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
How about the color?

314
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Do you want to do the same thing as you or do you have a different color?

315
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I think so.

316
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Even if a person lives for a hundred years, he will still be a person.

317
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I think so.

318
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Even if a person lives for a hundred years, he will still be a person.

319
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Even if a person lives for a hundred years, he will still be a person.

320
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
We're just going to live and die for a few contracts.

321
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Drink slowly.

322
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Do you remember that?

323
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,600
When we were in fifth grade, I cried because I couldn't do the frog test.

324
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
The class president stood up and said,

325
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Oh, we can't do this.

326
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Let's decide on a vote.

327
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
You said that for me.

328
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,600
So why did we win the vote and let the frogs go to school?

329
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
You remember everything.

330
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Do you know how cool you were then?

331
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I feel like I'm back in class after meeting you.

332
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
This is Kim Yeon-woo from Miseong Auto.

333
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Oh, yes.

334
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
This is the father of Eulwangri.

335
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
You said you wanted to go to the sea.

337
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
I know.

338
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
The salt is bad for the car.

339
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll wash the car and get the contract papers.

340
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm in the same class.

341
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Don't worry.

342
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Yes.

343
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Baek Sun.

345
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Please.

346
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Please.

347
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I need your love.

348
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Do you remember that?

349
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
We kissed in the music room.

350
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
What?

351
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
What?

352
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,600
You and I practiced together to go to the singing contest.

353
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I waited for the teacher to come.

354
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
It wasn't you.

355
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Were you in sixth grade?

356
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Kim Yeon-woo.

357
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Why didn't you get married?

358
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Did you wait for me?

359
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
You fool.

360
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Jung-hoon.

376
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
When?

377
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Last night.

378
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
But Su-pil left me a message.

379
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
What message?

380
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
It says a woman might have been infected with the virus.

381
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Did you get any symptoms from Dr. Nam Su-pil?

382
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
What?

383
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
He seemed to be in a good mood.

384
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
He was so excited for no reason.

385
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
He was in the same team with Dr. Nam.

386
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
I don't know about that.

387
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Did you get any symptoms?

388
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
No.

389
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
You're in charge of everything?

390
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes.

391
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Then it's all about the virus.

392
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I thought it was just a flu.

393
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Until the blood test results come out,

394
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
you should refrain from meeting people for the time being.

395
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Watch your mouth.

396
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Do you know Ok Taek-sun?

397
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Yes.

398
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
No, I don't know him.

399
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
He went to see Team Leader Kim.

400
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Let's go to the hospital.

401
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Ok Taek-sun.

402
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Ok Taek-sun.

403
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Ok Taek-sun.

404
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Who is it?

405
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Are you Ok Taek-sun, the driver of the car?

406
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Yes.

407
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Who are you?

408
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
You know Nam Su-pil, right?

409
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Yes.

410
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Why?

411
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Nam Su-pil died this morning.

412
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
What?

413
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
He's suspected of being infected with the virus.

414
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
He's investigating the people who contacted him.

415
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
You should go with us and get tested.

416
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Get off for now.

417
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Get your protective gear ready.

418
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Could you get out of the car for a moment?

419
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Yes, I'll be fine.

420
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Please give me some water.

421
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Hey, team leader.

422
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Yes.

423
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Shoot.

424
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
What are you doing?

425
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
You're not allowed to be in the car.

426
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Please wait a moment.

427
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
There are three new voice messages.

428
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Mr. Taek-sun, if you have any problems with your body,

429
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
please find Dr. Lee Gyun.

430
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
You know? You can't follow anyone else.

431
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Dr. Lee Gyun.

432
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
What's your relationship with Mr. Ok Taek-sun?

433
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
We're friends.

434
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
We were together until a while ago,

435
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
and we bought water together.

436
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
How many protective gear do you have?

437
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Put your knife in first and put your head on.

438
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Mr. Taek-sun, you can't trust anyone.

439
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
The only person who knows this disease well is him.

440
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
There's only one way.

441
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Dr. Lee Gyun.

442
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Please find Dr. Lee Gyun.

443
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Is that car going to break down?

444
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
We'll take the car, so don't worry and get in.

445
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Is there a Lee Gyun here?

446
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
What kind of bacteria?

447
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Dr. Lee Gyun.

448
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
There's no such person. Get in.

449
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Where did you come from?

450
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
What?

451
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Where are you from?

452
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
I told you earlier.

453
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
We came from the Seongwolyeo Foundation Research Institute.

454
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Yesterday, our researcher...

455
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Are they bad people?

456
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I don't know.

457
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
They're running away to save us.

458
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Who?

459
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
They're looking for Dr. Lee Gyun.

460
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Lee Gyun?

461
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
What's going on?

462
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
What's going on?

463
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Go quickly.

464
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare,

465
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
from 1 p.m. today,

466
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
5km of half-distance, including Osong,

467
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
all farmers, people and people are on the front lines.

468
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
These are experimental mice. 9 of them.

469
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,600
I'll give you a list of the conditions in 5 days.

470
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
I've announced that you're a deer.

471
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
A deer?

472
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Deer is a good thing.

473
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
That way, the media and people will be less interested.

474
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
How would I know? Thank you anyway.

475
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Please get him.

476
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Okay.

477
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
We found Dr. Nam's lover.

478
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
But this woman had another man.

479
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Hurry up.

480
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
They both ran away.

481
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
They're being tracked, so they'll be caught soon.

482
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Do we have to ask the police for help?

483
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Why are they so reckless?

484
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
It's a matter of their lives.

485
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
But...

486
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
If you look at the history of mankind,

487
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,600
after millions of people die from the disease,

488
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
the vaccine comes out.

489
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
When they're alive,

490
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
there's a lot to do.

491
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Shouldn't we just get tested?

492
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
They said we shouldn't follow them.

493
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Didn't we go to the beach last night?

494
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I drove here this morning.

495
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Who's that guy named Su-pil?

496
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
How do you know him?

497
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
You kept saying Su-pil all night.

498
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Did I?

499
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Yes.

500
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
He's dead.

501
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
What's going on?

502
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
I should have turned this on.

503
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
You don't know his number?

504
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
No.

505
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
This is a test car.

506
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Wouldn't it be better if I drove?

508
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Oh, no. I think I pressed the button.

509
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Oh, no.

510
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Mr. Taek-sun, I'm Lee Gyun.

511
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Lee Gyun?

512
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Dr. Lee Gyun?

513
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Are you infected?

514
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
I don't know.

515
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Where are you now?

516
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Where am I?

517
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Here?

518
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Go to a place where there are no people.

519
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Where is that place?

520
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Is there an octagon?

521
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Octagon?

522
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
The Bukak Skyway octagon.

523
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Mr. Taek-sun, you have to go and get tested.

524
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Get in the car.

525
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
The ambulance is here to catch us.

526
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Get in the car.

527
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
You can't get caught.

528
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
See you at the octagon.

529
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Mr. Taek-sun.

530
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
The octagon.

531
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Do you really have a license?

532
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Yes, I do.

533
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
I haven't been on the road before.

534
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Hold on tight.

535
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Go!

536
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Move!

537
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Look at the position.

538
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
You're alive.

539
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
How many are there?

540
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
There are four.

541
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Good job.

542
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
What?

543
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
What?

544
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Octagon, octagon, octagon.

545
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You said it was an octagon.

546
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
We don't know that.

547
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Then what are you doing?

548
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I'm catching rats.

549
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Rats?

550
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Yes.

551
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Are rats octagon?

552
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
I've never seen a rat catching an octagon.

553
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
No.

554
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
No, go.

555
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Go.

556
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I said go.

557
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
You bastard.

558
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
It hurts.

559
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Come on.

560
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Get up.

561
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Get up.

562
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
I've been working hard.

563
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Come here.

564
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Get some water.

565
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Let's go.

566
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Let's stay here.

567
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
That's safer.

568
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Sorry.

569
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
You came to the store at this time.

570
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,600
What have I been through all day?

571
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
I'm sorry.

572
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Da-kseon.

573
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Are you some kind of drug?

574
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
No.

575
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I don't take anything except when I can't sleep.

576
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Why?

577
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
You said you saved the frog in elementary school yesterday.

578
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Do you remember?

579
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Yes.

580
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
You recovered.

581
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You lost the vote.

582
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
We lost?

583
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Not us.

584
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
You.

585
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I was the one who recovered.

586
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
And you.

587
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
You remember coming to my wedding, right?

588
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
You're married?

589
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
What's wrong with you?

590
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
You even got a scholarship.

591
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Me?

592
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Taek-seon.

593
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
As a friend, I'm serious.

594
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
You should go to the hospital.

595
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I don't think you're the Ok Taek-seon I know.

596
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
You're weird.

597
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Am I weird?

598
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Do you know me?

599
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
What do you know?

600
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
How do you know?

601
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
You're always in my bed.

602
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
You text me when you're in the middle of nowhere.

603
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
You're weird.

604
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm weird, aren't I?

605
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
I don't know myself.

606
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
What's wrong with me?

607
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Isn't this air-infected?

608
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Dr. Lee?

609
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Yes.

610
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm not infected, are I?

611
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
You should check.

612
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
You said you shouldn't get air-infected, right?

613
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Yes.

614
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Then I'm not the one.

615
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Can I go?

616
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
What?

617
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I didn't see anyone.

618
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Taek-seon, I think I should go because Dr. Lee is here.

619
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
The store is in a mess.

620
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
If you're not careful, you can get infected with saliva.

621
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Especially when you cough in a closed space,

622
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
don't look at the other person, cover your mouth.

623
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Taek-seon, did you cough a lot when you were sleeping yesterday?

624
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
I don't know.

625
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,600
I think he was in the car all night.

626
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Why did you tell me to find you?

627
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
I want to talk to you face to face.

628
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I know you the best.

629
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Where are we going now?

630
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
The blood test.

631
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm going to the hospital.

632
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Where are we going now?

633
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
We should do the blood test first.

634
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Where do you do the test?

635
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
I know a hospital.

636
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Where's your car?

637
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
I don't have a car.

638
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,600
I just came from the U.S. and took a taxi.

639
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
But this is a taxi stop.

640
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Yeon-woo! Wait!

641
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Yeon-woo!

642
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeon-woo!

643
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Call him!

644
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Call him!

645
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
This is the police station.

646
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,600
There are trees around here.

647
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
I only see trees.

648
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Yeon-woo, please get the police.

649
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
He's wearing a protective suit.

650
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Is that pink?

651
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
He's not a soldier.

652
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I called a taxi, so don't walk.

653
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Wait for me.

654
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
When did you get in touch with Dr. Nam?

655
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
In touch?

656
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,600
When did you do the act of sharing your blood,

657
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,600
your blood, your blood, your blood?

658
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Why do I have to tell you about my personal privacy?

659
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Think of it as telling the doctor.

660
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
It's important.

661
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Then does that mean you're infected with it?

662
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
With what?

663
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Where?

664
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
I didn't do it.

665
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

666
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
But do you have such big pupils?

667
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Me?

668
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
If you're infected with toxin...

669
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Toxin?

670
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
It's a parasite called toxoplasma gondii.

671
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
This host lives in a cat's stomach.

672
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
But if you get infected with this,

673
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,600
you want to eat it yourself.

674
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
You're lying.

675
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
It's strange.

676
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Toxin goes to the brain and merges dopamine

677
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
to make mice depressed.

678
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm supposed to be the one who's depressed.

679
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
But I'm not.

680
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
The world is moving around as I planned.

681
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,600
So you're saying you're infected with the virus.

682
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
The virus is the opposite.

683
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
It makes mice depressed.

684
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
What's going on?

685
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Why are you so straightforward?

686
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Because of the virus, you become more courageous

687
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
and more positive.

688
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,600
In the case of humans,

689
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,600
they might be more interested in love than liking someone.

690
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Me?

691
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
You mean to you?

692
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Not everyone likes you.

693
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
You should be interested in someone.

694
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
And this is a matter of timing.

695
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
When you get infected and meet someone.

696
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
When Dr. Nam Su-pil met you,

697
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
that's probably when the virus will be the most active.

698
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
You're so funny.

699
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
You're saying whatever I don't know.

700
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,600
So you like me because of the virus?

701
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Don't lie.

702
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Lying?

703
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
This is a new science.

704
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I studied it for seven years.

705
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Liking someone? Love?

706
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
You're so funny.

707
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,600
So you think Dr. Nam Su-pil's infection

708
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,600
is a feeling of love and you're mistaken.

709
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
I said I'm not going!

710
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
It's the white one, right?

711
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Yeo-ru.

712
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
What are you doing?

713
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
I'll take it from there.

714
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Put on your mask.

715
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I said I'll take it from there.

716
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Do you have a problem?

717
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
What problem?

718
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Why do you get infected and get a problem in a day?

719
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
You can't go over 24 hours if you get a problem.

720
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
You're dying?

721
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Mouse said so, but people don't know.

722
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
It's the first time.

723
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
No, it's not.

724
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
It's not, right?

725
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I met Mr. Su-pil the other night, but it's not me.

726
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
I guess it's not a infection.

727
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Fish cake?

728
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
I ate fish cake.

729
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I ate fish cake while eating.

730
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Your blood pressure is low.

731
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Before you get a scar in your mouth or get a stomachache.

732
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Or you're so unlucky.

733
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
You bite your tongue and bleed.

734
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
I bit my tongue.

735
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Your tongue?

736
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Yes.

737
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Did you bleed?

738
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Yes.

739
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,600
The doctor will fix it.

740
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Be careful with your nose.

741
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
You said your saliva was okay.

742
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
It's dangerous. It's a nervous system.

743
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It's dangerous.

744
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Are you sick?

745
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
No.

746
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
I'm sorry.

747
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm sorry.

752
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
I'm sorry.

753
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
I'm sorry.

754
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm sorry.

756
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I'm sorry.

757
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm sorry.

758
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm sorry.

759
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Are you going to do a blood test?

763
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Yes.

764
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I think you can go inside.

765
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
It's dangerous. It's not safe.

766
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
It's not safe.

767
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Someone will come to help.

768
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Are you a doctor?

769
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
When did you get here?

770
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Not long ago.

771
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
In the US?

772
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Yes.

773
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Today.

774
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
You jerk.

775
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm going to do a blood test.

776
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Let me use your primer.

777
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Who is it?

778
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
It's Taek-sun.

779
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
It's a patient.

780
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
What patient?

781
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
A patient.

782
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
A virus?

783
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Did he get infected?

784
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I don't know yet.

785
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Take him to Professor Sung.

786
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
There's no answer.

787
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
I'm going to Professor Sung?

788
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Does that make sense?

789
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
He ran away to the US.

790
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Why do you think he ran away?

791
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
He just left.

792
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
He just left?

793
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
He cut me off and threw me in the lab.

794
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
You're more talkative than before.

795
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
You always say I'm sexy.

796
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I left for you.

797
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
How's Dr. Kim?

798
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
How should I know?

799
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
What?

800
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
As a divorcee.

801
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Really?

802
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
You two haven't been married for a long time.

803
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I thought you'd live well.

804
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
You hit me again because you're so bad.

805
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Don't mess with me.

806
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Are you sure you're a doctor?

807
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm a doctor because of him.

808
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
My life is so dirty and shitty.

809
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
We're here to help you.

810
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
You're here.

811
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
How have you been?

812
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
You're here, Mr. Kim.

813
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm not a traitor.

814
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
I'm a B cell donor.

815
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Good job.

816
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
I can't believe I'm seeing you again.

817
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
But Su-pil is dead. Are you okay?

818
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,600
You asked me to marry you.

819
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I can't believe you.

820
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
It's not normal.

821
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
If I tell you in advance, he's the victim.

822
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm sorry, but I don't know Su-pil.

823
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I even saw the picture of you two together.

824
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
At that woman's house.

825
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
House?

826
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
House?

827
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
What's this?

828
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
It's PCR.

829
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,600
PCR is a blood sample that is used to call the original body.

830
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,600
It contains a blood cell that is mixed with a primer.

831
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
It's a mixture of the two.

832
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
It's old-fashioned?

833
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
How long have you been dating Mr. Yeong-hee?

834
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
I met him at college.

835
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Why did you meet him?

836
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
There was someone who loved him more than I did.

837
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Men are so stupid.

838
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
What?

839
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Is it something?

840
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
But he's leaving it to someone he likes more.

841
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
You don't even know.

842
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Are you upset?

843
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
I'm going to work.

844
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I think I'm really lucky.

845
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
I met you.

846
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,600
I think it's a good time to meet a doctor who knows this disease the best.

847
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
And you flew from the United States because of me.

848
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
What?

849
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Why am I talking so much today?

850
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Is this a symptom of infection?

851
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I came because of my sister's wedding.

852
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,600
As soon as I got off at Incheon Airport, I got a call from Jeong-hoon.

853
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Do you know Mr. Soop-hee?

854
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
We used to be on the same team.

855
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
It was a research team of the Seoul Medical Foundation.

856
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Yeong-hee and I came out separately.

857
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Please sleep.

858
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
I can't sleep well.

859
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
The next day

860
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
What's going on?

861
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Aren't you getting drunk?

862
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I'm holding my breath.

863
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
But it's a little weird.

864
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
What?

865
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Are you drunk?

866
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
Is it a feast?

867
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I've been like that since I was a kid.

868
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
I don't even eat.

869
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Why?

870
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
The elders are like that.

871
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
They drank all of this.

872
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
The elders are not drunk.

873
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Is it our drunk?

874
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Yes, it's white.

875
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
One, two, three, four.

876
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Your heart, my heart, our heart.

877
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
One, two, three, four.

878
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Brother.

879
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Brother.

880
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Handsome.

881
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Let's have a drink.

882
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
One.

883
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Oh, yes.

884
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Brother.

885
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Baek-sun.

886
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Did you get the result?

887
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,600
If you see these two lines here, you're infected.

888
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
It's okay.

889
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Because you're here.

890
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
How many days is it today?

891
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Five days?

892
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Three days?

893
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Wait a minute.

894
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Wait a minute.

895
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
There's no surprise.

896
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
It's a big explosion.

897
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
20 people are infected in the clothes.

898
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Out of nine mice that escaped our lab,

899
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
one cat ate the mouse

900
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
and five mice were captured.

901
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Three mice are infected with the virus.

902
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,600
We're doing our best to end the situation within 24 hours.

903
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
You said it's white, right?

904
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Yes.

905
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Our lab's mice are all white.

906
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,600
Please tell us about the symptoms of infection.

907
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Yes.

908
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
According to our research,

909
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,600
once this virus is infected,

910
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,600
there will be a red spot in the body within 24 hours.

911
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,600
Also, most infected people are over-infected.

912
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,600
They feel better

913
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
without a reason,

914
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
as they depend on themselves.

915
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,600
What do you mean?

916
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
They feel better?

917
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
They're extremely excited.

918
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Please tell us about the infection.

919
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
Look.

920
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
It's perfectly attached.

921
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
It's not as big as a mouse.

922
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,600
That's why there's no red spot.

923
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
It's a very unusual spectrum.

924
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
If it continues like this...

925
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
We might find a protein that can make a vaccine

926
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
or a complex A.

927
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
Please call Dr. Kim.

928
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,600
I haven't called him in four years.

929
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,600
That's the only equipment we have in Korea.

930
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Please.

931
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Excuse me.

932
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Aren't you talking about the blood test?

933
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
No one's here.

934
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
No one's here.

935
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Hello?

936
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,600
What about the symptoms?

937
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
We haven't found anything yet.

938
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Should I give you some painkillers?

939
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,600
It's no use.

940
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
It's no use.

941
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,600
The elderly people danced for seven hours without eating.

942
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Isn't that too much?

943
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,600
It's not because of the virus.

944
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,600
They're still like that.

945
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Give me some food and some supplements.

946
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,600
Okay.

947
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Junsun.

948
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
It's me.

949
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,600
You called me, right?

950
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Yes.

951
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
The door is locked, right?

952
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
Yes.

953
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,600
There are so many symptoms.

954
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
Super-hypnotism?

955
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,600
I never thought I was such a special being.

956
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Some people die from the flu,

957
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,600
but some people don't take any medicine.

958
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
They have different immune systems.

959
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,600
You're the strongest person in the world.

960
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Hey, Juhee.

961
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
Where are you?

962
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Why aren't you coming?

963
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
I'm...

964
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Mom's asking why you're not coming.

965
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,600
I have something urgent to do.

966
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,600
Come on.

967
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,600
I need to go somewhere.

968
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
Where?

969
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
It's my sister's wedding today.

970
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,600
You look so cool.

971
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
How do I look?

972
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Where's the dress you wore earlier?

973
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,600
I was sweating so much that I threw it away.

974
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
You can't just throw it away.

975
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,600
You have to burn it.

976
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,600
Juhee.

977
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
I'll be right back. Take a rest.

978
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
There are so many people here.

979
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Okay, okay.

980
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Do you want some ice cream?

981
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Yes.

982
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Good job.

983
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
The groom has arrived at the bride's house.

984
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,600
I'm ready.

985
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600
The groom is ready to go.

986
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
The bride is ready to go.

987
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,600
The groom is ready to go.

988
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
The bride is ready to go.

989
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,600
The groom has raised the glass to the chest.

990
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,600
He hopes that he will be able to protect his wife

991
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
with his love and trust for the rest of his life.

992
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,600
He hopes that he will drink only half of the glass.

993
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
I didn't come here completely.

994
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,600
I came here because of the wedding.

995
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
I came here because of the wedding.

996
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
No!

997
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Why did you come out?

998
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
I'm in the bathroom.

999
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,600
What is it?

1000
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
What?

1001
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
Which one?

1002
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Ice cream.

1003
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,600
If it's a gram of texanol, it can infect 2 million people.

1004
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,600
What should I do then? Should I hold it in?

1005
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Can you hold it in?

1006
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
No.

1007
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Start by pouring water.

1008
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,600
And keep pouring it until it's over.

1009
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Put your hands in it about 10 times.

1010
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,600
If they come out of their bodies, they won't live long.

1011
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,600
How can a person do this?

1012
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
He's really unique.

1013
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,600
He's a person.

1014
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,600
It took me three years to make this B cell immune supplement.

1015
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
The research cost was 200 million dollars per person.

1016
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Did you get infected?

1017
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Why do you need this?

1018
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,600
The animal testing isn't over yet.

1019
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
It's okay.

1020
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
We should trust each other.

1021
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Those infected patients...

1022
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Shouldn't we do something before the golden time is over?

1023
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
This is the fate of our lab.

1024
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
It's your life that's at stake.

1025
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
I'm suddenly hearing the betrayer's voice.

1026
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,600
It's a betrayal that you don't talk about.

1027
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Where's that patient?

1028
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
It's okay.

1029
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,600
You're with the person who made this, right?

1030
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Are you my friend?

1031
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,600
What?

1032
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,600
No, no.

1033
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Oh, it's not.

1034
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
I'm sorry.

1035
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Is that your mother?

1036
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,600
Yes.

1037
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,600
Mother, I'm here with Dr. Lee Kyun.

1038
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Really?

1039
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
I'm sorry.

1040
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,600
You didn't even say hi to a guest.

1041
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
No, mom.

1042
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
This person is not a guest.

1043
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,600
We're from the same team.

1044
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,600
The virus research team.

1045
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
The team works well together.

1046
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Sit down.

1047
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
Wait a minute.

1048
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,600
What's your name?

1049
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
I'm Ok Taek-sun.

1050
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Are you a doctor?

1051
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh, you're a doctor?

1052
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Oh, Taek-sun is in a sick place.

1053
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Let's go to my house.

1054
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Go and lie down.

1055
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
You must have come from the U.S.

1056
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
You must be so tired.

1057
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
You must have not been able to adapt to the new season.

1058
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Okay, let's just celebrate today.

1059
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,600
We just have to do it again.

1060
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,600
I'm kidding.

1061
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
The person who is the bride's brother

1062
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,600
came from the U.S. to celebrate this wedding.

1063
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
Let's hear from him.

1064
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Thank you for coming to our wedding.

1065
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,600
Congratulations on your sister's second wedding.

1066
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,600
I'm studying viruses in the U.S.

1067
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,600
I realized while studying the virus

1068
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,600
that falling in love with someone

1069
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,600
is like falling in love with a virus.

1070
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,600
You get infected with someone and get feverish.

1071
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,600
And you get immune from being sick for a while.

1072
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,600
And you get infected with someone

1073
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,600
when you're about to get pregnant.

1074
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,600
I'm sure my sister will realize what I'm saying.

1075
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,600
I was sick every time I met her.

1076
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,600
And I met a good person.

1077
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,600
Taek-sun!

1078
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,600
Taek-sun, stop it.

1079
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,600
Thank you. I'm not used to the new season.

1080
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
I'm tired.

1081
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Jeong-hoon, did you analyze the 3D?

1082
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Dr. Lee Gyun, it's been a while.

1083
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Can we see the complex A that you wanted to see?

1084
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,600
You're still going forward.

1085
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,600
I've talked to the Texas Institute.

1086
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Come here. Let's do it together.

1087
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,600
Do it with Texas.

1088
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,600
Wait a minute.

1089
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,600
There were a lot of infected patients here because of you.

1090
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Why is that my fault?

1091
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,600
You're the one who claimed to be the virus for depression.

1092
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,600
You made B cell immune inhibitors.

1093
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,600
If you get another victim,

1094
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,600
the media will know your name first.

1095
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,600
Texas?

1096
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,600
You didn't get pregnant either.

1097
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Gyun didn't do anything in the U.S.

1098
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,600
That's why I came back.

1099
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,600
If I had stayed here, I would've been the head of research.

1100
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Do you regret cutting yourself off?

1101
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,600
I know when you came.

1102
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,600
We have a lot of clinical experiments.

1103
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,600
Texas says that if we succeed, we'll get a Nobel prize.

1104
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,600
The market size will be the same as Korea's GDP per year.

1105
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,600
So you need Dr. Lee Gyun.

1106
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,600
No, it's not Lee Gyun.

1107
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,600
What we need is Ok Taekseon.

1108
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,600
We can win the top prize with her.

1109
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
You're picking out the milk several times.

1110
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
I have a lot to check.

1111
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I think I can get a pack of milk every time I pick it out.

1112
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
Am I okay?

1113
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Even the elderly in the next room can handle it.

1114
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
Do you give them food?

1115
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,600
I'll wait until the results come out.

1116
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,600
Can't you give them some nutritional drugs?

1117
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Professor Kim, Choseok University

1118
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
What's all this?

1119
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Anything more than one super high-end electronicители in Korea.

1120
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
This is all a congenital disease?

1121
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Yes. The virus is too small

1122
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,600
to be seen by a normal congenital disease.

1123
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,600
It looks like a boiler.

1124
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
If you make a huge transfer here,

1125
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,600
you can see the virus several times.

1126
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Do you know why people feel depressed?

1127
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Because they have a depressed situation.

1128
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Depression is caused by dopamine and serotonin.

1129
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
We need to control this,

1130
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,600
but the existing drugs have many side effects.

1131
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,600
It's made chemically.

1132
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,600
My brother was in the wedding two weeks ago, right?

1133
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Actually, there was a younger brother

1134
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
who was in the wedding two weeks ago.

1135
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
His name was Yoon.

1136
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,600
If he was there...

1137
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
He committed suicide.

1138
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
I didn't know he was that sick.

1139
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,600
So, making a biopharmaceutical depression cure

1140
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,600
is my dream.

1141
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,600
The substance that comes out when our body

1142
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,600
fights the virus and wins is complex A.

1143
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,600
I've been experimenting with mouse for seven years,

1144
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,600
but I died before I found all the complex A.

1145
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,600
But you're alive and well, right?

1146
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,600
It's been four days, and there's no change.

1147
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,600
The moment I find complex A in your body,

1148
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,600
my dream comes true, and we're really destined.

1149
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,600
We're really destined.

1150
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Get off.

1151
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Do you know how life forms

1152
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,600
when you think about how fun virus research is?

1153
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
I don't know.

1154
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,600
You know life came from water, right?

1155
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,600
I don't know. I don't want to do it anymore.

1156
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,600
I have so many hairs today that my head hurts.

1157
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,600
The virus may be the key to knowing the source of life.

1158
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Half of them died and half of them survived,

1159
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,600
so I'm still wondering if you can see this as life.

1160
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
You talk too much right now.

1161
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
You're more talkative than I am.

1162
00:58:47,600 --> 00:59:09,320
You've never seen a virus with a

1163
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
I've been here for two days.

1164
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,320
But I've never held hands with these three men

1165
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,320
for three days.

1166
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,320
Isn't this a curse?

1167
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,320
That's the right thing to do as an infected person.

1168
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
Take a break.

1169
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,320
We'll be busy from morning to night even if we get a test result.

1170
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,320
Hug me until I fall asleep.

1171
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,320
Because your state of mind is not normal right now.

1172
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:39,320
I think I'm going to cry because I'm so miserable right now.

1173
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,320
You met me for the first time with our voices, right?

1174
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
What?

1175
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:58,320
I heard your voice on the phone at first.

1176
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,320
It's like we've known each other for a long time.

1177
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,320
I'm mistaken because of the virus.

1178
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
Sleep.

1179
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,320
Close your eyes.

1180
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,320
Why is my heart beating so fast?

1181
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,320
I told you I'd make you feel better.

1182
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,320
Me?

1183
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,320
Just make it up.

1184
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,320
I'm getting up.

1185
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,320
I'm so cold.

1186
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
The doctor said.

1187
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,320
Because of the virus, I'm full of courage.

1188
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:50,320
I'm getting a feeling of love beyond my feelings.

1189
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:58,320
I think I'm getting a feeling of love.

1190
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,320
No, no, no.

1191
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,320
I'm doing this because of the virus.

1192
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,320
What's going on?

1193
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,320
Wait a minute.

1194
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,320
Dr. Lee Kyun.

1195
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,320
What are you doing?

1196
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Mr. Ok Taek-seon?

1197
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,320
It's nice to meet a special person.

1198
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,320
Dr. Kim Chul-ho, thank you.

1199
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,320
Did you know that this is our cooperative organization?

1200
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,320
Who are you?

1201
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,320
It was the same team as before.

1202
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Oh, yeah, this is also a doctor.

1203
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,320
Dr. Kim.

1204
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,320
Dr. Kim, Professor, CEO, stock owner.

1205
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,320
Turn on the power.

1206
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,320
If you turn on the power, can you see Complex A?

1207
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,320
You have to give me time.

1208
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Our five-story lab is fast.

1209
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,320
Isn't our lab what you need?

1210
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,320
If you can't use the electronic telescope, there's nothing you can do here.

1211
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:11,320
Infected patients are waiting for Mr. Taek-seon's body.

1212
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,320
Mr. Taek-seon has to save people.

1213
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,320
There's no other way except our five-story lab.

1214
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
You know.

1215
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,320
I'm leading this experiment.

1216
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,320
I can't do anything without my consent.

1217
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Dr. Lee Kyun.

1218
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Mr. Taek-seon, how about we finish this project and return to normal?

1219
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,320
The lab is fine.

1220
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,320
Complex A. Let's really succeed this time.

1221
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,320
Mr. Taek-seon, see you at the lab.

1222
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,320
Let's go.

1223
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,320
Can I really follow you?

1224
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,320
It's okay. I'll be here.

1225
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,320
I can only say that it's a miracle.

1226
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,320
A very unique body owner promised to actively cooperate with our foundation.

1227
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,320
This will gradually improve the condition of infected patients.

1228
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,320
The first biopharmaceutical drug treatment that can be taken without side effects

1229
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:36,320
has been developed in Korea for the first time in the world.

1230
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:01,320
The first biopharmaceutical drug treatment that can be taken without side effects

1231
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,320
has been developed in Korea for the first time in the world.

1232
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:11,320
The first biopharmaceutical drug treatment that can be taken without side effects

1233
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,320
has been developed in Korea for the first time in the world.

1234
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,320
The first biopharmaceutical drug treatment that can be taken without side effects

1235
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,320
has been developed with Newieß Brackets.

1236
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,320
It is the 4th biopharmaceutical drug treatment.

1237
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,320
Non-protein monoclonal laboratories are now in operation.

1238
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,320
The Bern fake came about for the first time for the first time for a month ago.

1239
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,320
So it seems that non-protein monoclonal затas have passed over the No devastating lemma,

1240
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,720
Nov

1241
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,960
You're so mean.

1242
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,700
Who is the person who provided you with the strong body?

1243
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,200
Where is he now?

1244
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,760
We can't tell you because there are many security issues.

1245
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,460
I'll tell you that he's at the SANA Research Institute.

1246
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,660
What do you want to do when you leave this place?

1247
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:15,660
I wanted to publish a book in my name.

1248
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,700
Oh.

1249
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,660
It's not about reading or listening.

1250
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:24,660
It's really about me.

1251
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,660
I'm jealous of people like you.

1252
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,660
Everyone dreams when they're young.

1253
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,660
But there aren't many people who achieve their dreams when they're older.

1254
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,660
I didn't have this dream, either.

1255
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,660
Really?

1256
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,660
What was it?

1257
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,660
What was it? Tell me.

1258
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,660
A singer.

1259
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,660
A singer-songwriter.

1260
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,660
Really?

1261
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,660
B cell immune inhibitors developed by the Pseudo-Pregnancy Foundation

1262
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:05,660
are injected into the mouse with Oktek's antibodies.

1263
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,660
The immune inhibitors are injected into the mouse with Oktek's antibodies.

1264
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:16,660
The immune inhibitors are injected into the mouse with Oktek's antibodies.

1265
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:20,660
We're now giving P-cell immune booster shots.

1266
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,660
If this test, which makes a perfect body, succeeds,

1267
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,660
we will move on to the clinical trial stage.

1268
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,660
The results of the clinical trial are still unknown.

1269
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:47,660
The results of the clinical trial are still unknown.

1270
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:52,660
The results of the clinical trial are still unknown.

1271
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:57,660
The results of the clinical trial are still unknown.

1272
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:02,660
The results of the clinical trial are still unknown.

1273
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:08,660
The results of the clinical trial are still unknown.

1274
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,660
There's a problem with your body.

1275
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,660
I know.

1276
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,660
Dr. Lee, let's move on to the clinical trial of the B cell immune inhibitors.

1277
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,660
Wait.

1278
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,660
I've been waiting for five years.

1279
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,660
Now I have to make a decision.

1280
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,660
The animal test is not over yet.

1281
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:31,660
Wait.

1282
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,660
The old patients have a problem with their bodies.

1283
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,660
The progress is twice as fast.

1284
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:43,660
The body of the Oktek's antibodies is losing strength.

1285
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,660
Mak-soon, this can't be happening.

1286
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,660
Dr. Lee is a doctor and he's working hard for us.

1287
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,660
Do-byeong, you can't do this.

1288
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,660
You're getting married.

1289
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

1290
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
I'm not getting married.

1291
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,660
I'm not getting married.

1292
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,660
You have to get it right.

1293
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,660
You have to get it right little by little.

1294
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,660
I'm not getting it right.

1295
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,660
Mak-soon!

1296
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,660
Mak-soon!

1297
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,660
Dr. Lee, please disinfect my body.

1298
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,660
Are you okay?

1299
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,660
I'm fine.

1300
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,660
Where are you?

1301
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,660
You have to get it right with me.

1302
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,660
I'm not getting it right.

1303
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:31,660
I'm in front of the Osong Plastic Surgery Foundation.

1304
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,660
As you can see, the entrance is closed.

1305
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:39,660
The old patients' condition has deteriorated and the visit is prohibited.

1306
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,660
This place is again tense.

1307
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,660
On the other hand, Professor Sung Ki-hwan, the representative of the Plastic Surgery Foundation,

1308
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,660
Unlike the stories that have been known so far,

1309
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,660
This is one of the symptoms of the treatment process.

1310
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,660
The first drug for the first-ever side effect-free depression treatment

1311
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,660
The claim that it will continue has not been confirmed.

1312
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,660
The family of the infected agreed to the clinical trial,

1313
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,640
Honestly, the B-cell

1314
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,660
I think it's too difficult for the elderly to handle.

1315
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Did you make it?

1316
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,660
Yes.

1317
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,660
But it's still unstable.

1318
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:20,660
It's made stronger to fit your body.

1319
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,660
You're going to do it, right?

1320
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,660
Yes.

1321
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,660
The doctor said he was going to die.

1322
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,660
I'm going to die.

1323
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,660
We have a color test with the diagnosis of soplastic infection.

1324
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,660
That is, we have completed the dye test or the Barbie Pantone test.

1325
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,660
Intermittent electromagnetic waves or Lafex wave

1326
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,660
The average life expectancy

1327
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,660
The doctor said he was going to die.

1328
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,660
I'm going to die.

1329
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,660
I'm going to die.

1330
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,660
I'm going to die.

1331
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,660
I'm going to die.

1332
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,660
I'm going to die.

1333
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,660
I'm going to die.

1334
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:26,660
I'm going to die.

1335
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,660
Jisun.

1336
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,660
Yeah.

1337
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,660
I'm fine with mom.

1338
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,660
Don't worry about it.

1339
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,660
Hey, what are you two?

1340
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:51,660
I shouldn't have asked you to go on a blind date with a doctor.

1341
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,660
No, Jisun.

1342
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:03,660
I didn't do it because I didn't like you because I didn't respect you for not being able to study.

1343
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,660
I didn't do anything for you because I became your sister.

1344
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:11,660
I just wanted to see you ugly.

1345
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,660
I did it for you to be successful.

1346
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,660
I'm sorry.

1347
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,660
Actually, I love you very much.

1348
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,660
You know that, right?

1349
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,660
Tell your mom that I love you.

1350
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,660
I don't think I can call you after a while.

1351
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,660
It's not allowed to visit here.

1352
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,660
I'm doing a good job, so don't worry about me.

1353
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,660
I'll call you.

1354
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,660
I'll call you.

1355
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,660
Mr. Taekseon is now sighing.

1356
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,660
It's not because of the depression I brought here, is it?

1357
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,660
You're trying to help me, aren't you?

1358
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:09,660
I keep getting a lot of problems, so I have negative thoughts like before.

1359
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:15,660
If it gets worse, you can have symptoms such as vision loss, hallucination, and hallucination.

1360
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:20,660
Don't worry. I'll fight the virus well.

1361
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,660
Let's call the Russian Cossack team.

1362
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,660
Yes.

1363
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,660
The Russian method is not approved by half of the countries.

1364
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:44,660
Dr. Cossack says that it is not a virus, but a virus that is a host of toxic parasites.

1365
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,660
This is very dangerous and I don't know what kind of side effects it will have.

1366
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,660
What about the B cell injection? It keeps failing.

1367
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,660
Mr. Taekseon is different. Give me more time.

1368
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,660
If you don't do anything now, your special antibodies will just become normal.

1369
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:01,660
Then the complex A is over. Are you going to take responsibility for all this?

1370
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,660
The patient is still enduring it.

1371
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,660
You'll lose your eyesight and become unconscious soon.

1372
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,660
Then the plant, and then the brain. That's it.

1373
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:12,660
The reason for doing the Cossack method is not because of the patient, but because of the complex A.

1374
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,660
When the brain is alive, you can do anything to prevent it.

1375
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,660
You said you wanted to do it without the animal treatment.

1376
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,660
You were the one who started this experiment.

1377
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,660
Choose.

1378
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:28,660
Choose.

1379
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,660
Will you go with us or not?

1380
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,660
You picked out a bunch of food and just left.

1381
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,660
But how lucky are you? You're eating without any problems.

1382
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,660
I don't give bread or milk.

1383
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,660
Go to the staff restaurant and eat. It's delicious.

1384
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,660
I'm not in a good mood.

1385
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:57,660
I'm not in a good mood.

1386
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,660
Ms. Tak, get up.

1387
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,660
Sir?

1388
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:27,660
I was wrong.

1389
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,660
I shouldn't have come here. Get up.

1390
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,660
Get out.

1391
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,660
Where are you going?

1392
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,660
I have to get out of here.

1393
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,660
I have to get out of here.

1394
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,660
Tak Seon-ah.

1395
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,660
There's a problem.

1396
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,660
There's only one way to go.

1397
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,660
What should I do?

1398
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,660
I have to prepare for the experiment. I'm going right away.

1399
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,660
How's Tak Seon-ah?

1400
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,660
She's fine so far, but I have to find a way quickly.

1401
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,660
That's the ambulance.

1402
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,660
Oh, that's...

1403
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,660
The ambulance is coming.

1404
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,660
Get out.

1405
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,660
What did I do wrong?

1406
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,660
Is it wrong to let the patient get in the car?

1407
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:06,660
This lab has a problem.

1408
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,660
I have to get out of here.

1409
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,660
You have to get out of here right away.

1410
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:19,660
What's the name of the lab?

1411
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,660
Misoo, the patient's abuser.

1412
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,660
I can't believe I'm holding hands with a plastic surgeon.

1413
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,660
I must be crazy about complex A.

1414
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:29,660
What are you going to do?

1415
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,660
Don't be a fool and get in the car.

1416
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,660
I have something to show you.

1417
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,660
This way.

1418
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,660
This way.

1419
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:01,660
Is everything okay?

1420
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:06,660
If you're ready, you can sign the contract and prepare for the experiment.

1421
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,660
I'm going to sign it.

1422
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,660
Two more cubes. Slowly.

1423
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,660
Watch the encephalogram.

1424
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:31,660
Kim Yeon-ah!

1425
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,660
Mr. Suk-bae, what happened?

1426
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,660
Oh, yes.

1427
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,660
She's my bride.

1428
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,660
Hello, I'm Masako.

1429
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,660
Masako? Isn't she a rat?

1430
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,660
That's right. I'm a rat.

1431
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,660
It's a honeymoon.

1432
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,660
It's a three-day trip.

1433
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,660
Congratulations.

1434
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,660
Are you going on a trip in that outfit?

1435
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,660
There are so many viruses that we don't know in the world.

1436
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,660
You said you liked cats, right?

1437
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,660
Oh, it's so pretty.

1438
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:20,660
This is Gyun. Hi.

1439
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,660
Are you Gyun?

1440
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,660
Lee Gyun?

1441
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,660
The blood vessels are off.

1442
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,660
The pulse is being cleared.

1443
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,660
The second level of the skin.

1444
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,660
The prismic enter.

1445
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:49,660
I like you, Doctor.

1446
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,660
Really.

1447
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,660
You won't even remember it later.

1448
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,660
Doctor?

1449
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,660
Even if you don't know that, you'll forget the emotions.

1450
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,660
I'm sorry.

1451
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:03,660
Even if you don't know that, you'll forget the emotions.

1452
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:05,660
Because it's fake.

1453
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,660
Emotions are not real.

1454
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,660
When the disease is over, it disappears.

1455
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,660
What's this?

1456
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,660
It's a body of a taxon that I left behind last time.

1457
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,660
The body has recovered and is catching the virus again.

1458
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,660
How did you do it?

1459
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,660
I didn't even check. I just watched.

1460
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,660
Does that make sense?

1461
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,660
Even after the infection, you seem to have the ability to

1462
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,660
make your own body and cure it.

1463
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:43,480
I need a solution to remove the

1464
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:44,660
B-cells.

1465
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,660
Solution?

1466
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:46,660
The problem is that the B-cells have been

1467
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:47,660
hindered and forced to increase the number of antibodies.

1468
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:49,660
You're on the T-rex, right?

1469
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,660
Hurry up.

1470
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,660
Hurry up.

1471
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,660
The Russian team is coming, so the alert is getting worse.

1472
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,660
Hey, will this work?

1473
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,660
It's a perfect plan.

1474
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,660
I'm not a traitor anymore.

1475
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,660
What's going on?

1476
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,660
It's a request from the Russian team in Jehanbyong-dong.

1477
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:23,660
Is it a snack?

1478
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,660
It's a snack after the quarantine.

1479
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:29,660
What's that?

1480
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,660
What's that?

1481
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,660
What's that?

1482
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,660
What's that?

1483
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,660
What's that?

1484
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,660
What's that?

1485
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,660
It's a Russian.

1486
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,660
What?

1487
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,660
I'm going to do it.

1488
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,660
I'm going to do it again.

1489
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:55,660
What's going on in Jehanbyong-dong?

1490
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,660
It's not working.

1491
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,660
I'm going to do it again.

1492
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:00,660
I'm going to do it again.

1493
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,660
Hello.

1494
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,660
Hey, Posh, you're a coward.

1495
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:08,660
Oh, yes.

1496
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,660
What's going on?

1497
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,660
Posh, what's going on?

1498
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,660
Virus.

1499
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,660
Virus?

1500
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,660
Posh!

1501
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:29,660
What?

1502
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:31,660
What is it?

1503
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,660
What is it?

1504
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,660
Stop it, stop it.

1505
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,660
Stop it.

1506
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,000
Take out the evidence.

1507
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,760
Baekseon.

1508
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,560
What about the money?

1509
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,000
I don't need this from you.

1510
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,860
Are you really a masked man?

1511
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,700
No. I'm the one who's been raising them.

1512
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,100
They'll come back to me if I leave them.

1513
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,560
I've been doing this for 15 years.

1514
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,860
What's going on?

1515
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,960
What's going on?

1516
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,560
Are you saying I'll get back at you for cutting you off five years ago?

1517
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:38,560
Or are you jealous of my complex?

1518
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,960
The secret cell enhancement agent is different from the Russian one.

1519
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,960
What's the twist?

1520
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,860
We need a cure.

1521
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,160
A cure?

1522
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,060
We're trying to get rid of the poison we put in the patient's body.

1523
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,260
We're losing to that guy.

1524
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,160
You two are trying to get rid of the army?

1525
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,260
Are you telling me to trust you?

1526
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,460
Professor Seo.

1527
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,660
Please trust me this time.

1528
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,560
Taekseon has already gone over stage two,

1529
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,860
so let's just wait and see.

1530
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,060
The patient's condition...

1531
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,460
Do I look like a witch?

1532
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,660
Who's going to do it?

1533
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,660
I'll make the choice.

1534
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,460
I have the right to be treated by the doctor I want.

1535
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,860
I entrusted myself to Dr. Lee.

1536
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,560
Dr. Lee has been eliminated from this project,

1537
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,260
and I'm in charge of it from now on.

1538
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,260
Please move.

1539
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,260
Wait.

1540
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,660
Wait.

1541
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,260
Taekseon.

1542
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,660
Do you trust me?

1543
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,660
Yes.

1544
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,460
Then give me the virus.

1545
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,860
Oh, my.

1546
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,260
What are you doing?

1547
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,660
Take me and let go of Taekseon.

1548
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,560
You're crazy.

1549
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,260
I'll take you two.

1550
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,160
Hold him.

1551
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,660
What are you doing?

1552
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42,660
Let go of me.

1553
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,260
You guys haven't changed at all.

1554
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,260
I told you not to do it.

1555
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,660
You guys are all the same.

1556
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,260
I told you to come.

1557
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,860
What's going on?

1558
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,860
This is the Oseong Research Institute of the Seoul Medical Foundation, right?

1559
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,660
I'm the head of the institute. What's going on?

1560
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,960
I got a report.

1561
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,060
What report?

1562
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,060
A criminal offense.

1563
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,060
A violation of the Law of the Law.

1564
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,160
I reported it.

1565
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,660
Yongman.

1566
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:19,160
They locked up a normal person,

1567
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:19,960
and they said they were doing some weird experiment

1568
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,260
that didn't let them graduate.

1569
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:23,860
The old people were dancing,

1570
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,560
and the rats were walking around.

1571
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,660
This is crazy.

1572
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,360
This person is a infected patient.

1573
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,260
Infected?

1574
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,560
No.

1575
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,760
Yongman.

1576
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,260
There are Russian people up there.

1577
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,860
They're doctors from Russia.

1578
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,460
Be quiet.

1579
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,260
Come up.

1580
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,860
Wait.

1581
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,360
Do you have a warrant?

1582
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,260
Yes.

1583
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,660
I do.

1584
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,860
Are you going to stop me?

1585
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,460
I'll guide you to the hospital.

1586
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,060
Let's go in.

1587
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,160
Thank you.

1588
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,160
I'm the head of the Institute of the Seoul Medical Foundation.

1589
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,560
This is a business that's been under the name of the nation.

1590
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,560
You're making a mistake.

1591
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,560
Who's responsible for the illegal clinical experiments?

1592
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,560
If this is right,

1593
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,560
am I going back to normal?

1594
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,560
Yes.

1595
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:44,560
Then, am I going back to being alone?

1596
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,560
I think I'm being loved by you.

1597
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,060
If I wasn't for this disease, I wouldn't have known this feeling until I died.

1598
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,560
My dream is for you to be fully cured.

1599
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:13,560
What if I can't get over this feeling after I've met Dr. Park?

1600
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,060
Mr. Taekseon.

1601
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,560
You have to get better when I'm sober.

1602
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,060
I was infected with you.

1603
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,560
Why did you do that?

1604
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,560
I wanted to know.

1605
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,560
Everything I felt before I met Dr. Park.

1606
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,560
Even if I don't remember the emotions after I die,

1607
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,560
these feelings will remain in our bodies.

1608
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:45,560
Whether it's an infection or something else.

1609
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,560
I'll remember.

1610
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,560
You came to cure me.

1611
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,560
I fell in love with you.

1612
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,560
And...

1613
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,560
It hurt for a while,

1614
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,560
but I was happy.

1615
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,560
I'm sorry.

1616
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,560
I'm sorry.

1617
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,560
I'm sorry.

1618
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,560
I'm sorry.

1619
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,560
I'm sorry.

1620
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,560
I'm sorry.

1621
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,560
I'm sorry.

1622
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,560
I'm sorry.

1623
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,560
Mr. Taekseon was finally cured.

1624
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,560
And with his body, all the infected people returned to normal.

1625
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:25,560
And the Stimulation Foundation also rewarded him.

1626
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,560
He revealed his excessive clinical trials.

1627
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,560
And the Stimulation Foundation even confessed to his crimes.

1628
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,560
The biggest incident was the complex A found in Mr. Taekseon's body.

1629
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,560
It was finally possible to develop a cancer treatment.

1630
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,560
The owner is Mr. Taekseon,

1631
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,560
but she promised to support the complex A worldwide.

1632
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,560
She wanted to go back to her life without exposing this fact to the media.

1633
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,560
I'm sorry.

1634
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,560
How have you been, Sook-pil?

1635
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,560
Sook-pil, you did a great job for the happiness of mankind.

1636
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,560
Don't play with mice there. You should date a lot.

1637
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,560
The weather is nice.

1638
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,560
I'm sorry.

1639
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,560
Doctor.

1640
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,560
I was wondering if you were feeling well.

1641
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,560
You are.

1642
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,560
How are you?

1643
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,560
I'm going to school to give lectures.

1644
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,560
Is it fun?

1645
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,560
No.

1646
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,560
What about you, Mr. Taekseon?

1647
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,560
I'm writing.

1648
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,560
Oh, you're writing a autobiography?

1649
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,560
Did I say that?

1650
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,560
Yes.

1651
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,560
I remember everything that happened before I got infected.

1652
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:20,560
I'm a little hazy.

1653
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,560
I don't even remember what happened.

1654
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,560
I don't even remember how I met you.

1655
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,560
So I'm afraid to contact you.

1656
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,560
I'm a little embarrassed.

1657
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,560
You don't have to worry about that.

1658
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,560
I'm glad.

1659
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,560
Are you okay now?

1660
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,560
Of course.

1661
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,560
Are you all right?

1662
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,560
Yes.

1663
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,560
I'm fine.

1664
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,560
Then I'll wish you luck.

1665
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,560
It was nice to meet you, Doctor.

1666
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,560
I'm sorry.

1667
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,560
Don't you have any feelings left?

1668
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,560
I'm sorry.

1669
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,560
Where's your car?

1670
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,560
I don't have a car.

1671
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,560
I'm leaving for the U.S.

1672
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,560
Let's go together.

1673
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,560
Tell me everything on the way.

1674
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,560
I want to know what kind of person you are.

1675
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,560
Doctor.

1676
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,560
Yes?

1677
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,560
Do you wear glasses?

1678
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:22,560
Sometimes I wear them to protect myself.

1679
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,560
I'm sorry.

1680
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,560
I'm sorry.

1681
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,560
I'm sorry.

1682
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,560
I'm sorry.

1683
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,560
I'm sorry.

1684
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,560
I'm sorry.

1685
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,560
I'm sorry.

1686
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,560
I'm sorry.

1687
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,560
I'm sorry.

1688
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,560
I'm sorry.

1689
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,560
I'm sorry.

1690
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,560
I'm sorry.

1691
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,560
I'm sorry.

1692
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,560
I'm sorry.
