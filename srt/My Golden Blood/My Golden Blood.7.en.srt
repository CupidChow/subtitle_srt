Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,800
Then from now on,

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,080
we stay 2-arm’s length apart.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,380
Then shall we go to the beach?

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,780
Didn’t you say we have to keep some distance?

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,680
So do you like it?

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,250
I do.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,140
I wasn’t talking about the trip.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,580
So that you won’t forget that you came here with me.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,540
Meena!

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,780
Excuse me,  have you seen Meena playing around here?

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,810
Would you come with me to my room to get something?

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,010
Meena!

17
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,329
That’s beyond a bodyguard’s duty.

18
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,940
Who said

19
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,940
that I’m just your bodyguard?

20
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,130
I want to stay like this for a long time.

21
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,120
You

22
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,380
and me,

23
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
just the two of us.

24
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,420
Me too.

25
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you think that was all Nakan’s plan?

26
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,500
There’s only one person

27
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,840
who can do something like this.

28
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,470
Now he knows

29
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,840
that you are the Golden Blood.

30
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,360
What if next time

31
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,560
the one who got hypnotized was not Meena

32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,980
but my friends?

33
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,290
Do you think we should warn everyone?

34
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,620
The thing between us

35
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,480
and about your blood,

36
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,730
I think the fewer people know about it

37
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,380
the safer it is for everyone.

38
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,560
It’s like I’m putting people in trouble again.

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,960
Don’t worry, Tong.

40
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,540
Don’t you forget

41
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,110
that you have an immortal bodyguard like me with you.

42
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,700
But right now,

43
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
you’re not just my bodyguard anymore, Mark.

44
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,460
I never want to go back!

45
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,460
It’s final exams right after we get back.

46
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,790
Freshmen's life is so darn short.

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,060
Damn!

48
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,410
I forgot we have exams coming up.

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,560
But final exams also mean school break!

50
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,990
School break?

51
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,120
Oh, right.

52
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,080
A hotel staff told me people were fighting yesterday.

53
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,100
But I don’t know how things get from there.

54
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,250
Do you guys know anything?

55
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,510
Not at all?

56
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,710
Are you Mr. Tong?

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,100
Yes?

58
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,830
A guest who’s just checked out left something for you.

59
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,930
Thank you.

60
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,230
[A present for Meena’s handsome brother, Tong.]

61
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,560
[I have to leave first so I couldn’t bid you goodbye.]

62
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,390
[See you again.]

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,460
Meena’s probably safe now.

64
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,750
By the way, how come you guys just disappeared last night?

65
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,480
Well, Mark was drunk

66
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,480
so I took him back to his room.

67
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,500
I see.

68
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,040
You missed meeting Prof. Nakan.

69
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,780
We met him last night.

70
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,380
He treated us to cocktails last night.

71
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,280
You disappeared so you missed that.

72
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,830
Such a miss.

73
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,630
- Big miss.
- 	That’s right.

74
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,190
Serves you right.

75
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
I was so lucky.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
He was so kind.

77
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,520
Miss Thara!

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Miss Thara!

79
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,000
Miss Thara!

80
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,900
Miss Thara must have used her power too much.

81
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,720
She might have to rest for a while.

82
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
In the meantime, let’s give her some artificial blood.

83
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,260
I’ll prepare some herbs for blood nourishment.

84
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,200
Thanks, Mark.

85
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,740
I would have been in trouble without you.

86
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,560
Don’t mention it.

87
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,530
You came to see me because of what Nakan did, right?

88
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,060
You saw it already?

89
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,380
I’m sorry

90
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,670
for not informing you in advance.

91
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,100
Now Nakan knows

92
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,680
that Tong is the Golden Blood.

93
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,770
He won’t just stop here.

94
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,770
I will be more careful.

95
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,830
I heard you were sick
	so I came to check in on you.

96
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,200
Thanks.

97
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,090
But there’s no need for the hassle.

98
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,850
The Board of Directors sent their regards

99
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,900
and also

100
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
had the date of the meeting fixed.

101
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,280
The meeting?

102
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,460
The Chairman is ill,

103
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,050
don’t we need an acting chairman?

104
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I only need a couple of day’s rest.

105
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,659
That won’t cut it.

106
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,289
Everyone agrees that you should take some rest.

107
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Just leave it to us.

108
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,440
While Miss Thara is unwell,

109
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,890
she has assigned me to take care of all the duties

110
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,190
until she gets well again.

111
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,560
But now you’re busy being a college student.

112
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,340
Wouldn't that obstruct you from being an acting chairman?

113
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Mister Nakan,

114
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,740
but aren’t you also a professor at that university?

115
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,920
I’m there to build a connection

116
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,460
between us and the people at the university.

117
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,730
To expand the network.

118
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,000
What about you?

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,790
What are you doing there?

120
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,570
Or does that kid you’re with

121
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,090
have something special?

122
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,800
What’s there that you can’t share with us?

123
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,660
What are you trying to hide from us?

124
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,680
Then…

125
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Someone who’s transparent like me,

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
who’s got nothing to hide,

127
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,850
is probably more fit for the acting chairman role than you,

128
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,110
isn’t that right?

129
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,580
Did you hold your tongue

130
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
to protect the Golden Blood?

131
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,340
If the BoD knows that you hypnotized a human to harm Tong,

132
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,250
do you think they would let it slide?

133
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you
	threatening me?

134
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,440
It’s such a shame

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,470
that those are only words.

136
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
You don’t even have any evidence.

137
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,810
All the CCTV files at the resort have been deleted?

138
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,180
Yeah.

139
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,860
They’re a step ahead of us this time.

140
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,730
Then what do we do?

141
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,670
I don’t know either.

142
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,970
But we’re lucky

143
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,970
that it’s school break right now.

144
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,100
It’s probably harder for Nakan
	to find an excuse to approach you.

145
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,840
Do you think

146
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,480
it would be better

147
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,050
if I move back to your house?

148
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,240
Would you be okay with that?

149
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,330
Well, if right now

150
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,860
Nakan is aiming for me,

151
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,220
doing that would probably be safe for everyone.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,630
But you once told me

153
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
that moving in and living with me all the time

154
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,020
is suffocating.

155
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,420
That

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,960
it’s not the same.

157
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,820
I felt like I was kind of forced into it.

158
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,350
But now I’d gladly do it.

159
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,420
Are you sure?

160
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,400
That living in my house
	and being with me 24/7

161
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,980
would be okay for you?

162
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,020
You’re there with me

163
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,750
so why wouldn’t I be okay?

164
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,200
That’s great, then.

165
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,600
How should we tell Tonkla this time, then?

166
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,280
What?

167
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,190
A research?

168
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,010
Are you still not done?

169
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,180
And we’re having a school break right now too.

170
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
The work got a bit lengthy.

171
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,740
You went then

172
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,810
and now you’re going again.

173
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,400
You’re leaving me behind alone again.

174
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,520
You and Mark have something that I don’t know, right?

175
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,620
I’m not lying.

176
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,180
I’m really going to do my research.

177
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,520
Let’s do this.

178
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,590
I promise,

179
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,310
whenever I’m free,

180
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,670
you would be the first one I come to see, alright?

181
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,120
See you, dude.

182
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,520
Affirm it to everyone one more time.

183
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,160
No one is allowed in my room.

184
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,370
Alright, Mr. Mark.

185
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
All clear.

186
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,210
(Mr. Nakan, they must have known.)

187
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,220
(No one’s here.)

188
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,490
(Where shall we go next?)

189
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,540
Hide tight.

190
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,750
I knew it

191
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,960
that Nakan would have someone infiltrated into my team.

192
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,520
You’re a genius.

193
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,070
You’re my best bodyguard.

194
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,070
Were you a spy before?

195
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,940
Is this a time to joke around?

196
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,860
You told me yourself

197
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,400
that I shouldn’t worry since I have you.

198
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,180
Look, I made some sandwiches.

199
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,370
Want a bite?

200
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Try it!

201
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,180
Good?

202
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
So, where are we going?

203
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,010
You’ll find out.

204
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,580
Hey,

205
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Aunty Wan’s shop is this small.

206
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,780
Wouldn't she feel burdensome if I moved in?

207
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,340
I don't think so.

208
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,770
I’ve prepared a room for you
	just as you asked.

209
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,400
This is like in the movie!

210
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,240
I told you

211
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,900
it’s not small.

212
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,610
What are you on about?

213
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,030
Is this time for such a joke?

214
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,280
I meant the room.

215
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,960
You’re the one overthinking.

216
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,020
I’m taking this bed.

217
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,960
Back at home,

218
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,120
I would sleep on the right

219
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,940
and Tonkla would sleep on the left.

220
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,760
What do we do?

221
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,140
I’m not Tonkla

222
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,470
and I like sleeping on a big bed.

223
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,000
So now we don’t have to fight for the beds, right?

224
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,970
Hey.

225
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,180
Hmm?

226
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,839
That’s enough.

227
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,200
I’m going to go get washed up.

228
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,980
I like your smell more than anything in the world.

229
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,790
Mark.

230
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,070
That’s enough.

231
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,440
That’s enough.

232
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,180
I’m going to shower.

233
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,800
That’s enough.

234
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,460
You’re going to shower?

235
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,300
Hmm?

236
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,020
Yeah.

237
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,420
Hey!

238
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,700
Mark.

239
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,920
What are you doing?

240
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,770
I’m going to shower with you.

241
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,930
The bathroom is big.

242
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,560
Can’t we shower together?

243
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,440
Though the bathroom is big,

244
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,580
I prefer showering alone.

245
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,400
Still no replies from Tonkla?

246
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,900
Yeah.

247
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,120
He’s probably still mad.

248
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,100
But I think keeping a little distance like this

249
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,220
might be better.

250
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,330
What about you?

251
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,760
It’s a new environment

252
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,150
so would it be hard for you to sleep?

253
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,600
You’re right.

254
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,270
I think it would probably be hard for me to fall asleep.

255
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,780
How could it be hard to sleep

256
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,580
when I have Mark with me like this?

257
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,120
When I was young,

258
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,850
I don’t get a chance to do anything that much.

259
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,740
Until I met you

260
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,160
and since then I get to try so many more things.

261
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,520
The vampire’s world

262
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,180
and Mark’s world.

263
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,800
They’re quite peculiar, aren’t they?

264
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,390
Is there anything else

265
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,720
you want to try?

266
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,090
That’s probably something like
	working hard to graduate.

267
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,370
Get a good job

268
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,800
then save up some money
	and do a back-pack tour abroad.

269
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,710
Sounds like a good fit for you.

270
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,040
What about you?

271
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
Do you have any dreams?

272
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
A dream?

273
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,680
I probably had one

274
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,760
but I’ve forgotten all about it now.

275
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,170
Forget?

276
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I should try to recall it, shouldn’t I?

277
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,090
Actually, there’s no need.

278
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,550
Just live every day happily.

279
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
Especially in times like these

280
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,510
when you don’t know what’s going to happen.

281
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,770
Still, I am aware

282
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
that when I’m with Mark,

283
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,460
I’m happy.

284
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,210
Sleep.

285
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,820
(A dream?)

286
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Oh, hello, Professor!

287
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,030
Hello.

288
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,000
Hello.

289
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,420
It’s school break

290
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,690
but you guys still keep fit.

291
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,940
We’re always keeping ourselves fit.

292
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,440
Would you like to shoot some hoops with us?

293
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,930
Better not.

294
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,340
I’m afraid I would win.

295
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,510
Alright.

296
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,790
Oh? What about Tong and Mark?

297
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,560
Are they not with you guys?

298
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,680
Well, they’re busy with some sort of research these days.

299
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,400
So they don’t come to practice.

300
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,750
What are your plans after this?

301
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,200
We probably just go our separate ways after practice.

302
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,920
Yes.

303
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,770
Then, let’s go.

304
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,470
The meal's on me.

305
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,610
Oh, Prof.

306
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
How can we take that offer?

307
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,600
How can you turn down an adult’s offer?

308
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,170
Right.

309
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,100
Isn’t that right?

310
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,920
You have a point.

311
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,380
Oh, right.

312
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,510
What do you call that?

313
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,280
Rude.

314
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,310
Yeah!

315
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,310
Uh, Professor.

316
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,540
Then let me just pack up for a second.

317
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,580
Please wait for us for just a second.

318
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,380
Just a second, please.

319
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,740
Do you guys like it?

320
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
I don’t usually have dinner.

321
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,940
Oh, Prof.

322
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,020
It's once in a blue moon that we get to eat something nice like this.

323
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,480
I can’t tell.

324
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,080
Why don't you get some takeouts for Tong and Mark?

325
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,900
That won’t be necessary, Prof.

326
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,440
I don’t get to see them that often these days.

327
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,350
That’s right.

328
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,780
Tong used to always be with Tonkla

329
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,790
but now he’s with Mark instead.

330
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,300
Thank you.

331
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,980
Thank you.

332
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,590
The Thing is, my friend is looking for a sample group
	for the test of skincare for sensitive skin.

333
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,710
The budget is around 20,000.

334
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,830
What? 20,000?

335
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,870
Are you interested, Tonkla?

336
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,150
Come on, Prof.

337
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,080
The question is when and where I should go

338
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,770
not whether I would go.

339
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,620
But isn’t it too little?

340
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,370
No, that’s more than enough.

341
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,260
Then I’ll let you know the place and date as soon as I know it.

342
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,130
Okay.

343
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,350
Umm…

344
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,150
Are you not interested in hiring me too?

345
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,200
I do have quite a nice skin myself.

346
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,910
Yes.

347
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,110
Your names will definitely be on the list next time.

348
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,590
Really, Professor?

349
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,390
Thank you.

350
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,310
Here.

351
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,510
Apart from Miss Nuan,

352
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,010
I’ve never peeled fruits for anyone.

353
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,210
Why?

354
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,170
Salty isn’t it?

355
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,390
Are we switching roles here?

356
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,150
I should be the one taking care of you.

357
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,150
Mark has done so much looking after me.

358
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,170
I want to be the one who does it too.

359
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,450
Would you like anything to eat?

360
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,750
I’ll get it for you.

361
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,320
I want to eat Tong.

362
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,380
Hello, are you working today?

363
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,640
Yeah, I’m about to head off.

364
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,460
When are you coming back?

365
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,870
Everyone’s been asking for you.

366
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,190
I’m tired of answering on your behalf.

367
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,870
Who asked?

368
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,370
Dome and Pupae?

369
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,390
No,

370
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,990
it’s Professor Nakan.

371
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,630
He treated me to a meal today too.

372
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,760
Professor Nakan?

373
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,140
Kla, did you meet up with Professor Nakan?

374
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,450
(Yeah.)

375
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,960
(And dude,)

376
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,150
(the Professor was so kind.)

377
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,410
(He’s giving me 20,000 for just a day of work.)

378
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,390
What work?

379
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,010
Don’t get involved with Professor Nakan, dude.

380
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,270
Hold on, what’s wrong with you?

381
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,190
Do you not like Professor Nakan?

382
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,630
It’s not that I don’t like him but…

383
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,790
Don’t meet up with him.

384
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,810
Don’t be around him.

385
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,030
Why?

386
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,200
What has he done to you?

387
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,850
Just trust me, Kla.

388
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,750
Give me your word.

389
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,390
(Fine.)

390
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,430
(Okay.)

391
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,770
(I’ll head to work.)

392
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,110
Do you think if I told Tonkla the truth

393
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,590
would he be more surprised or troubled than this?

394
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,850
If you’re uncomfortable,

395
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,850
I think you can just talk it out with Tonkla.

396
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,110
But you said it’s better when less people know about this.

397
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
But you trust Tonkla, don’t you?

398
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,390
Instead of worrying,

399
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,010
I think the two of you should just talk it out.

400
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,420
That’s probably better.

401
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,540
Then can you take me to Tonkla?

402
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,870
I’m meeting Miss Thara tomorrow.

403
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,850
My healing power should make her recover faster.

404
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,880
After that, let’s go and see Tonkla.

405
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,730
Do you know how to work it out?

406
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,110
Aunty Wan taught me how.

407
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,960
The herbs smell nice.

408
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,170
Are you leaving now?

409
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,620
Yeah, I have to visit Miss Thara.

410
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,850
One second.

411
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,550
What are you drawing?

412
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,200
Hey! Don’t look just yet.

413
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,300
Wait up.

414
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,510
Here you go.

415
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,510
I asked for the recipe from Aunty Wan.

416
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,090
Cute, right?

417
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,190
Well,

418
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,820
just so-so.

419
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,490
Just so-so?

420
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,790
Then don’t drink it.

421
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,310
Taken and no return.

422
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,830
I’ll get going.

423
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,940
Hold on.

424
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,420
Did you forget something?

425
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,660
You don’t want me to leave, do you?

426
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,760
I’ll be right back.

427
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,170
Thank you.

428
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,730
Thanks for coming.

429
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,870
Hello, Prof.

430
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,630
You didn’t need to come pick me up here.

431
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,200
Thing is, there’s a little problem.

432
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,390
What problem?

433
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,250
Nothing must, it’s just…

434
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,590
One sample couldn't join us and canceled.

435
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,430
I just don’t want to make another appointment

436
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,970
do you know anyone who can fill in?

437
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,630
Yes, Professor.

438
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,900
No problem.

439
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,380
I got this.

440
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,160
I’ll leave it to you.

441
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,710
Alright, Prof.

442
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,920
Then please follow our staff in.

443
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,210
Alright, thank you.

444
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,790
This way, please.

445
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,230
Oh, just a second, please.

446
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:24,850
Just a second.

447
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,480
Yes?

448
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,030
I’m now at Tara Group Medical Center

449
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,140
we’re now looking for one tester for research.

450
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,060
If you’re interested, please come in!

451
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,770
This way, please.

452
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,500
Alright.

453
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,400
Mr. Mark is here.

454
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,580
The path is clear.

455
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,820
(Hello, everyone.)

456
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,230
(I’m now at Tara Group.)

457
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,410
(One tester for research has canceled)

458
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,989
(so if you’re interested in a gig then…)

459
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,929
Aunty Wan, can I go out to see Tonkla for a bit?

460
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,389
Where?

461
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,270
At Tara Group Medical Center.

462
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,719
Tonkla is meeting up with Nakan right now.

463
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,850
I don’t know what will happen.

464
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,989
That doesn’t sound good.

465
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,650
Let’s wait for Mr. Mark.

466
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,760
He’s about to come back.

467
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,920
He won’t take long.

468
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,440
But right now…

469
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,980
Mr. Mark gave me an order.

470
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,230
Please listen to me.

471
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,450
Kla!

472
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,040
Tong!

473
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,060
You’re here too?

474
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,940
Why didn’t you answer my call?

475
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,940
They asked me to turn off my phone.

476
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,850
Let’s go register together

477
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,930
so we can get our blood tested.

478
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,400
I’m not going anywhere.

479
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,000
I’m getting you out of here.

480
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,290
Hold on!

481
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,250
Why?

482
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,610
Kla, you don’t know anything right now

483
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,990
but Professor Nakan is deceiving you.

484
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,310
Why?

485
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,580
I want to explain but

486
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,740
come with me for now.

487
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,500
Tong!

488
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,210
Hold on!

489
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,910
Tong!

490
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,250
Miss Thara!

491
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,380
Where is Tong?

492
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,600
Tong?

493
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,460
I asked Tong to hide at Aunty Wan’s place.

494
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,800
- Why? What’s wrong?
	- No, he’s not there.

495
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,170
Tong’s in danger!

496
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,500
Hold on, dude!

497
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,290
Hey, Tong!

498
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,930
Would you tell me what this damned thing is all about?

499
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,950
I really can’t explain it to you right now.

500
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,630
Why not?

501
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,370
But I always tell you about everything.

502
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,620
Or do you not see me as a friend anymore?

503
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,110
I will explain everything to you.

504
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,180
But for now, you have to get out of here.

505
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,630
- What’s wrong with you?
- 	Get out, Tonkla.

506
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,890
What’s wrong with you, Tong?

507
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,690
I will stall for some time.

508
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,740
The person Nakan wants is me, not you.

509
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,580
Get out!

510
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,780
Where is Tong?

511
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,560
Where are you going?

512
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,830
The test is not done.

513
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
You meant to use Tonkla as bait

514
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,450
to get me here.

515
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,970
Yeah?

516
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,950
And did it work?

517
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,750
Stop.

518
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,670
Don’t come any closer.

519
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,970
If you do, I will tell Miss Thara all about it.

520
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,850
About Meena and about today.

521
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,180
You don’t really know Thara, Tong.

522
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,950
Trust me.

523
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,580
Do you really think that

524
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,360
when you turn 21,

525
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,390
you’re really going to be free?

526
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,050
Of course.

527
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,170
Indeed,

528
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,430
you really know nothing.

529
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,680
There’s only me

530
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,870
who can help you.

531
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,410
Join my side

532
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,050
and I will give you true freedom.

533
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,550
Why is it not working?

534
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,760
Is it because

535
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,650
of the Golden Blood?

536
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,170
It’s my birthday in a few days.

537
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,160
Then everything will be over.

538
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,960
You’re wrong.

539
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,390
Things are about to get started.

540
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,110
Tong!

541
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,560
Did you get hurt anywhere?

542
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,570
So vampires

543
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,310
really exist?

544
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,870
Yeah.

545
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
I didn’t believe it at first just like you.

546
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,250
Mark is also a vampire?

547
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,650
You saw it with your own eyes.

548
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,820
Are you still going to deny it?

549
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,390
What the hell is going on?

550
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,590
One day I’m friends with a guy
	whose blood is wanted by the vampires.

551
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,010
Then there’s this vampire bodyguard guy.

552
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,210
I’m sorry.

553
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,790
I should have told you long ago.

554
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,940
I was afraid that if you know about it,

555
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,790
you would get in trouble.

556
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,310
But you saw it, right?

557
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,980
That not telling me

558
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,000
was even more dangerous.

559
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,090
I just didn’t know how to tell you, Kla.

560
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
I don’t know if you can take it if I told you.

561
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,370
Why would you think I won’t be able to take it?

562
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,870
Tong.

563
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,390
I’ve been your friend for 20 years.

564
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,540
Do you think if you told me,
	I would be surprised,

565
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,720
wouldn’t be able to take it,

566
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,190
run away,

567
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,110
and leave you alone?

568
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,380
I was worried about you.

569
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,780
And don’t you think that I’m worried about you too?

570
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,340
Don’t think that you’re alone, Tong.

571
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,010
Even if it’s a Zombie Apocalypse,

572
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,790
a volcanic eruption, or a landslide,

573
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,350
I would be with you, my friend.

574
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:24,950
Kla.

575
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,820
I’d be with you until we die.

576
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,630
But from now on,

577
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,690
if there’s ever anything,
	you have to tell me straight.

578
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,930
Okay?

579
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,120
Okay.

580
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,450
I promise.

581
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,990
So…

582
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,590
What are you guys going to do next?

583
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,350
I might have to lay low like this for a while.

584
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,450
You don’t have to worry, Tonkla.

585
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,190
I will have someone I can trust
	look out for you at the apartment.

586
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,450
Hey.

587
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,470
How can I let Tong go through this alone?

588
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,950
Vampires are so damn scary.

589
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,930
Let’s do this.

590
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,550
You vampires fight each other out.

591
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,170
I’ll take care of Tong.

592
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,160
Actually,

593
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,710
it might be a good idea
	for you two to stay here together.

594
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,520
So you wouldn’t have to worry about each other.

595
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,990
We have me, you, and Mr. Mark.

596
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,140
Who could ever harm us?

597
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,790
You got it.

598
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,580
Aw!!

599
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:46,870
You forgave me already, right?

600
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,610
Fine!

601
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,030
Aunty Wan has prepared a room for you.

602
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:55,730
This way.

603
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,730
That room?

604
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,370
Look at you, Kla.

605
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,500
Are you sleeping right away?

606
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,580
Damn, this is so soft.

607
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,160
I’ve recalled it.

608
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,020
What my dream was.

609
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,860
You asked me the other day.

610
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,230
I think I’ve got the answer.

611
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,910
An answer to

612
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,430
what?

613
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,700
For what my dream was.

614
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,940
I don’t know what my dream used to be.

615
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,190
But now, I’ve found my new dream.

616
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,010
It’s to live this life with you Tong.

617
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:18,990
It might not sound like a big or ambitious dream

618
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,420
but I just want a small house,

619
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,700
a family,

620
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,810
and someone who makes me smile every day.

621
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,410
Then, shall we make this dream come true?

622
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,260
Happy one monthsary being together, Tong.

623
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,090
Happy monthsary.

624
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,390
No matter what anyone says,

625
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,890
I will trust in you, Mark.
