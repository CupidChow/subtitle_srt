Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,080
The power of the Golden Blood is too almighty.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,230
We can’t let the Golden Blood fall into Nakan’s hand.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,560
Until you turn 21.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,200
I will be taking care of you all the time.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,400
Starting now.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,850
I heard you said you have the special blood

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,180
wanted by the vampires?

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,770
Stop!

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,180
Mister!

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,210
Didn’t you say you are immortal?

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,190
Mister!

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,420
Your wounds are gone.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,340
You smell so nice.

18
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,660
Are you sure

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,060
you want to live here with me?

20
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,950
It's because of the Golden Blood, isn't it?

21
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,540
That's why people got dragged into trouble.

22
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,300
I don't want anyone to get into trouble because of me anymore.

23
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,550
I'll live with you

24
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,870
until I turn 21.

25
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,620
Hello, Kla.

26
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,780
Yeah

27
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,920
I have something to tell you.

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,400
I got a scholarship.

29
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah.

30
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,110
The thing is, my advisor gave me a scholarship

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,770
in return for me helping out with the research.

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,030
I have to move into the school's accommodation
and I have to move in tonight.

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,180
I told Miss Nuan already.

34
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,810
She gave me permission.

35
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,350
Yeah, don't worry about me.

36
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,990
Hey, Kla.

37
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,070
I have to go now.

38
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,530
I'll talk to you later.

39
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,350
Alright.

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,660
Hold on.

41
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,160
No one else is living here, right?

42
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,270
No, I live here alone.

43
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,460
Wait, wait.

44
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,470
There's nothing strange, right?

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,159
What do you mean by ”strange”?

46
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,880
A coffin in the middle of the house

47
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,030
something like that.

48
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,320
Come in and see for yourself.

49
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,590
Is it like what you imagined?

50
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,330
Well, it's not like what I had in mind.

51
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,140
The vampires' tricks worked beyond expectations.

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,320
You might have thought we still live in a dark castle

53
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,910
or sleep in a coffin.

54
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,650
Like, in the haunted houses?

55
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,170
Something along that line.

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,530
Think about it,

57
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,890
if we still live in such a dark castle,

58
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,710
you guys would have visited it as if it's a landmark.

59
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,140
Humans learn to adapt.

60
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,210
So do we.

61
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,930
But there's a room

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,659
that no matter how long the time has passed,

63
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,730
it’s still a necessity.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,670
What room?

65
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,370
The tribute room.

66
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,650
Follow me.

67
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,440
Is there really such a room?

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,830
I had someone move all your stuff in already.

69
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,020
Both a vampire and a bellboy?

70
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,440
You're stretching them thin.

71
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,840
Where are you going to sleep?

72
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,570
You're not going to watch me around the clock, are you?

73
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,020
What do you think?

74
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,580
Mister.

75
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,850
The bed is too small for two big men.

76
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,780
I won't take your bed.

77
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,140
This entire room is yours.

78
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,190
Since we're going to live together,

79
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,990
you should know this, Tong.

80
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,850
Vampires don't need sleep.

81
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,490
What do you mean?

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,140
It means that I can watch over you around the clock.

83
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,350
Are you sure you're going to just watch over me?

84
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,990
Don't you sneak in and suck my blood while I'm sleeping.

85
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,980
Why would I do that?

86
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,620
If I really want to drink your blood,

87
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,840
I can do that anytime.

88
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,540
You smell so nice.

89
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,450
Okay?

90
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Then leave already.

91
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,669
Where's my guitar?

92
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,110
Hey!

93
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,100
Why are you here again?

94
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
To give you your guitar.

95
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,320
Here.

96
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,820
Hey!

97
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,730
From now on,

98
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,550
don't come any closer than this.

99
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,810
One arm's length.

100
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,520
Your arm or my arm?

101
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,930
Our arms are not the same length.

102
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,790
It doesn't matter whose arm it is.

103
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,060
Also, don't enter at your own will from now on.

104
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,900
No sneaking up on me too.

105
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,490
Did you get that?

106
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,530
Hey!

107
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,920
Answer me!

108
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,790
Hey!

109
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,010
(Pull yourself together, Tong.)

110
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,390
(Keep your guard up all the time)

111
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,070
(because that vampire)

112
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,970
(can eat you up anytime.)

113
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,720
(Can't be trusted at all costs!)

114
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,720
Didn't he say he wouldn't come in?

115
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,330
Are you hungry yet?

116
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,430
Don't you only drink tomato juice?

117
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,070
This is all for you.

118
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,920
What?

119
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,930
For me?

120
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,350
All these?

121
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,130
I wanted you to try new thing

122
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,900
so I ordered different sorts of things.

123
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,860
You're not trying to fatten me up and eat me later, are you?

124
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,120
I don't know which place has good food.

125
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,450
So I ordered from ones with good reviews

126
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,210
or got a Michelin Star.

127
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,210
For some,

128
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,210
I even had to jump the queue for you.

129
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,500
I just wanted you to know
that I will take great care of you.

130
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Good morning, Mr. Tong.

131
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,410
Would you like some coffee or tea?

132
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,230
Uh, it's alright.

133
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,170
Or would you like some tomato juice like Mr. Mark?

134
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,540
I'll just have water.

135
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,720
Wow!

136
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,940
Mister!

137
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,570
This is so delicious.

138
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,090
Is it that good?

139
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,070
Aren't you going to eat?

140
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,950
We don't need food.

141
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,820
Mister!

142
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,830
This is bomb!

143
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,460
So good!

144
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,530
What a shame

145
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,560
that you’re a vampire.

146
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,360
You have money

147
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,690
but no chance to enjoy delicious foods like these.

148
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,890
Have you changed your mind?

149
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,020
Want some?

150
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,880
How was it?

151
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,030
Delicious, right?

152
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,420
Since you're the host of this house and this meal,

153
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,810
I'll give you this dish.

154
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,780
Alright?

155
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,940
Here.

156
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,450
Mister.

157
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,840
Have you got anything for me to do?

158
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,290
I don't want to sit here doing nothing.

159
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,000
When I was at the orphanage,

160
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,240
Miss Nuan told us that we have to have our duty

161
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,550
and be helpful.

162
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,910
Mister.

163
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,040
Is there a mall around here?

164
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,690
I want to buy some stuff.

165
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,630
Just tell me what you want.

166
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,840
I'll get them for you.

167
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,860
It's my clothes.

168
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,780
How can I have someone buy it in my stead?

169
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,080
Do you know my size?

170
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,170
Get up.

171
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,020
Hey, hey!

172
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,140
What are you doing?

173
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,930
One arm's length.

174
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,780
22.

175
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,270
Hey, what are you doing?

176
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,770
I'm measuring out your size.

177
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,910
Stay still.

178
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,650
31.5.

179
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,710
Give me your arms.

180
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,000
39.

181
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,090
19.

182
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,260
Now I know

183
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,650
that all your measurements

184
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,040
are one size smaller than mine.

185
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,830
How do you know that it applies to 'all' my measurements?

186
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,250
Isn't it obvious?

187
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,540
Tell me if you need anything,

188
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,520
got it?

189
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,290
Yeah.

190
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,760
Are you just going to stand there and watch?

191
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,990
Don't you want to take on anything?

192
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,790
Nah.

193
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,790
I'm bored so I'm just looking around.

194
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,750
Did you find anything interesting?

195
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,810
There is quite something.

196
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,200
I'll try it out.

197
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120
You've never tried weight training before, have you?

198
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:29,940
No.

199
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,090
I'll teach you.

200
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,490
If you do it alone,
You might injure yourself

201
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,170
Like this?

202
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,070
This is for your shoulder.

203
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,460
Lift them up and breathe out.

204
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,340
Hey!

205
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,070
Mister!

206
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,020
Aren't you going to save me anymore?

207
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,530
Mister.

208
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,450
Aren't you going to run anymore?

209
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,150
I'm bothering you too much, am I?

210
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,090
I'm sorry.

211
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,880
I…

212
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,450
forgot my slippers.

213
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,050
Next time, put your towel away after using it.

214
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,930
Oh, Mister!

215
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,260
You have to go to work?

216
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,650
I have to go to the medical center.

217
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,040
There's some work I have to take care of.

218
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,930
You can take care of yourself, right?

219
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,100
Yeah.

220
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,490
Actually, Aunty Wan is also not here today.

221
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,960
It's quite dangerous to leave you here alone.

222
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,500
Would you like to come with me?

223
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,450
Really?

224
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,530
Can I really come along?

225
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,860
But you might have to be closer to me than one arm's length.

226
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,780
Is that okay with you?

227
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,610
I'll let you get away with it for a day.

228
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,800
Then,

229
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,630
I'll get changed first.

230
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,320
Tong.

231
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,490
Come and walk beside me.

232
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,120
Let's go.

233
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,600
Mr. Mark, Miss Thara is waiting to see you.

234
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,730
Wait for me at the coffee shop.

235
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,900
Mr. Tong as well.

236
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,440
Miss Thara would like to meet both of you.

237
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,940
Mr. Tong too?

238
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,960
Yes, Miss Thara is already aware that Mr. Tong is here too.

239
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,880
This way, please.

240
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,490
It's nice to finally meet you, Tong.

241
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,240
Hello.

242
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,330
Hello.

243
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,700
Can I have your hands?

244
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,070
My hands?

245
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,010
If I were you,

246
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,840
if there were a staring portrait beside my bed,

247
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,840
I would have covered it up with something too.

248
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
You could see it?

249
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,380
Thank you so much, Tong.

250
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,860
It couldn't have been easy all these times, was it?

251
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Both at the orphanage and here.

252
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
It wasn't too bad.

253
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,140
Miss Nuan took great care of me.

254
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,020
Hang in there just a little more, Tong.

255
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,370
When the Golden Blood appears.

256
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,260
When the moon hangs low.

257
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,510
That's when peace

258
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,580
shall return.

259
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,510
Has Mark been taking good care of you?

260
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,840
Did he put you in a hard place?

261
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,710
Or if he ever bothers you,
just let me know,

262
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,140
I'll handle Mark for you.

263
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,650
I can do that?

264
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,780
Of course.

265
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,730
Then if Mr. Mark ever bothered me again,

266
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,140
I'll tell you right away.

267
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,900
Thank you so much, Tong.

268
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,720
You might not know how important you are to us.

269
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,500
And I'm sorry

270
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,380
for making you get involved with the vampires like this.

271
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,460
That boy has a kind heart.

272
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,320
I haven't met anyone with such a kind heart like his in a long time.

273
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,610
Yes.

274
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,270
But it's someone with a kind heart like Tong

275
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,720
who is the weakest.

276
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,250
Because a kind heart is prone to shatter.

277
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,570
Even though he has the most powerful blood?

278
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,800
You realize the power of the Golden Blood firsthand

279
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,740
because you have drunk Tong's blood, is that right?

280
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,000
My apologies.

281
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,130
I didn't mean for it to happen.

282
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,570
I've seen it in the vision already.

283
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,890
For how much you tried to hold back.

284
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,640
The reason I've called you in today
is to warn you to be extra cautious.

285
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,860
The Golden Blood holds more power than you can handle.

286
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,700
I'll be more careful.

287
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,510
It's good that you've successfully had Tong close to you.

288
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,750
But too close can be dangerous too.

289
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,070
I don't want you to make any mistakes.

290
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,000
How old is Miss Thara?

291
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,250
No one knows
and no one dared ask.

292
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,770
She looks so beautiful, cool,

293
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,560
and charismatic.

294
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,280
Her hands were soft
and she was kind too.

295
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,580
Without Miss Thara,
there wouldn't be me.

296
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,140
So,

297
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,580
probably like Miss Nuan in my case.

298
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,700
Which game shall we play tonight?

299
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,770
The thing is
tomorrow is Miss Nuan's birthday.

300
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,620
So I wanted to make a video
to wish Miss Nuan a happy birthday.

301
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,610
[DAWN OF LOVE ORPHANAGE]

302
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,490
You seem to love Miss Nuan dearly.

303
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,090
Of course, I do.

304
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,610
She brought me in ever since I was a baby.

305
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,270
She told me

306
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,270
that I was a crybaby.

307
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,770
No matter what
I wouldn't stop crying.

308
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,090
So no one wanted to take me in.

309
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,900
But once Miss Nuan picked me up,

310
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,290
I stopped crying right away.

311
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,530
I can’t recognize my mother

312
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,930
but that's not important.

313
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,760
Since Miss Nuan is my mother.

314
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,120
Happy birthday to you.

315
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,590
Happy birthday to you.

316
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,410
Happy birthday to you.

317
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,100
Happy–

318
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,750
I think

319
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,870
you had better sing for Miss Nuan yourself tomorrow.

320
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,970
You're going to take me there?

321
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
Really?

322
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,830
Over here!

323
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,260
Tong!

324
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,780
Tong!

325
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,690
Where have you been?

326
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,210
Tong!

327
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,440
Tong!

328
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,320
Tong!

329
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,510
Tong!

330
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,240
Hello!

331
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,920
We've missed you.

332
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,010
Tong!

333
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,700
Hello.

334
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,510
Hello.

335
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,650
Where have you been?

336
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,050
Where's Tonkla?

337
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,440
There he is.

338
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,930
Tong!

339
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,470
Tonkla!

340
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,610
Who did you bring along?

341
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,600
Well…

342
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,510
Who's this?

343
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,390
The friend working on research with me.

344
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,330
What about Miss Nuan?

345
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,390
Is she inside?

346
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,890
She's gone to run some errands in town.

347
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,260
She'll be back in the evening.

348
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,010
Tong.

349
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,000
Would you like to play basketball together?

350
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,930
Tee-lek!

351
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,560
Didn't Miss Nuan say Tong can't play?

352
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,060
He's unwell.

353
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,720
Tee-lek!

354
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:04,700
Yes.

355
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,010
I'm fine now.

356
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,870
Really?

357
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,040
Super fit!

358
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,960
What about Tonkla?

359
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,520
Tonkla?

360
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,889
He's probably fixing the pipe in the kitchen.

361
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,770
He'll be here soon.

362
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,150
Will your friend play too?

363
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,270
Don't invite him.

364
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,070
Sure!

365
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,330
I'll play too.

366
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,260
Really?

367
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,239
How can I let you play alone?

368
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,510
If you lose to the kids,
it'd be so embarrassing.

369
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,370
We'll see

370
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,620
who will lose to the kids.

371
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,219
Hey!

372
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,540
Here!

373
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,190
Over here!

374
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,360
Hey!

375
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,480
Hey!

376
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:47,860
Hold on to him!

377
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,640
When I was young

378
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
I wanted to play basketball with my friends so badly.

379
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,050
But everyone thought I was sick.

380
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,210
So I couldn't play.

381
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,330
Miss Nuan didn't allow me to play.

382
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,170
She didn't even allow me to run.

383
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,560
She was afraid that I would fall over and bleed.

384
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,810
What about you?

385
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,840
Is there anything you've wanted to do

386
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,400
but have never done it?

387
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,370
How was my medicine?

388
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,770
Are you still nauseous?

389
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,620
Take my medicine

390
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,250
then lay down and get some rest.

391
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,510
Our father, who art in heaven,

392
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,970
hallowed be Thy name.

393
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,300
Please chase away

394
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:45,120
the spirit of pain.

395
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,680
Are you Doctor Jensen?

396
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,360
The infirmary is closed.

397
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,890
You'd better come back tomorrow morning.

398
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,420
I'm here to see your son.

399
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,590
My son?

400
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,770
Yes.

401
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,190
Mark Jensen.

402
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,250
You've probably come to the wrong place.

403
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,610
My son has been bedridden for many years.

404
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,020
You can't have known him.

405
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,030
What if I say I have a way
to extend his time with you,

406
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,440
would you be interested?

407
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,200
If Miss Thara hadn't come and find me back then,

408
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,730
I would have lived only for a short while after that.

409
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,620
Probably a few months.

410
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,010
No–

411
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,840
perhaps just a few days.

412
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,080
So would you call Miss Thara

413
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,010
your lifesaver?

414
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,980
Actually, our pasts are quite similar.

415
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,480
You were really sick

416
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,410
while for me…

417
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,490
Do you regret it?

418
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,370
No, Miss Nuan was just
worried more about me than the others.

419
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,230
Since she thought I was sick.

420
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,000
But I do

421
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,960
kind of feel it.

422
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,810
Sometimes I feel

423
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,630
that I'm somehow more special than the others.

424
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,610
[I've never known my real parents but]
[Miss Nuan loves and takes care of me no less]
[and even love all the children equally.]
[Maybe she worries more about me because]
[I'm sick so I can't play with my friends outside.]

425
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,670
Tong, Tong.

426
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,270
Tonkla asked me to tell you to follow the plan.

427
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,010
Miss Nuan's coming.

428
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,200
What plan?

429
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,410
How can I tell you?

430
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,980
That wouldn't be a surprise, then.

431
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,990
Let's go.

432
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,860
Help me out.

433
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,770
Help me light the candles.

434
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,670
Miss Nuan is here.

435
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,320
Mister!

436
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,610
Go greet her on my behalf.

437
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,960
I'll be hiding right here.

438
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,240
Go, go, go.

439
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,400
Go out there.

440
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,930
Mister Mark, what brought you here?

441
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,870
I brought Tong to see you.

442
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,300
Well,

443
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,640
if you had called me beforehand
then I would have been here to welcome you.

444
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,710
It's alright.

445
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,890
By the way,

446
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
have you talked it out with Tong, Mr. Mark?

447
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,630
Please excuse me.

448
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,770
Mr. Mark!

449
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,310
Is Tong doing alright?

450
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,310
Let's talk about it later.

451
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,820
I…

452
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,220
I'll leave it to you.

453
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,090
Tong is living with you
so now I can be at ease.

454
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,810
All these times,

455
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,000
I've never let Tong stray from my sight

456
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,160
and for the sponsoring money,

457
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,680
we're doing fine here.

458
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,010
By the way, where's Tong right now?

459
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,420
Hello, Miss.

460
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,130
Tong!

461
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,290
You don't have to worry.

462
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,530
Mark is taking good care of me.

463
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,530
Tong.

464
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,850
Why, Miss?!

465
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,600
You knew about this vampire thing all along, right?

466
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,420
Why didn't you tell me?

467
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,690
What did you think of me?

468
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,500
Do you see me as just a kid you were hired to look after?

469
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,850
How much did he pay you?

470
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,580
Tong.

471
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,440
That's not what it is, Tong.

472
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,900
As soon as I can make my own money,

473
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,250
I will pay you back.

474
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,470
Tong!

475
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,320
Tong!

476
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,070
Tong.

477
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,420
Tong!

478
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,620
Tong!

479
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,010
Hey, stop right there.

480
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,090
Tong!

481
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,460
Let's talk.

482
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,850
You are one of them, right?

483
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,750
You knew everything, didn't you?

484
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,270
Knew what?

485
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,620
I only know that I have to take care of you.

486
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,620
Because you're the special one in this house.

487
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,540
I feel terrible.

488
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,730
Raising me to knock the money off someone?

489
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,340
No one thinks of you that way.

490
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,570
Trust me.

491
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,940
You don't have to pretend to love me anymore.

492
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,060
You,

493
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,290
Miss Nuan,

494
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,530
and this damned orphanage!

495
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,550
You should be glad

496
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,400
that you're the special one here.

497
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,080
"The special one"?

498
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,680
Is that why
you've agreed to be my friend?

499
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,610
Why?

500
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,050
Answer me.

501
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,870
Is it because I made you get a scholarship to study in Bangkok?

502
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,990
You bastard.

503
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,320
If that's all that can come out of that brain of yours

504
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,850
then screw you.

505
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,210
Ask me anything you're curious about.

506
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,980
I'll explain everything.

507
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,190
It's so nice being me.

508
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,530
There are so many people looking out for me.

509
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,190
Everything we do
is for your own safety, Tong.

510
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,620
Is it really for my safety

511
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,510
or for other reasons?

512
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,250
What else is there
that I still don't know about?

513
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,400
It's true that we've donated the money to this orphanage.

514
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,500
But isn't it for the good of everyone?

515
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,930
Miss Nuan also needs the money to take care of you

516
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,590
as well as the other kids.

517
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,960
What if it's not so?

518
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,250
Without the money,

519
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,090
would Miss Nuan have loved

520
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,330
and cared for me like that?

521
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,720
She knew what you guys are.

522
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,510
She knew what would become of me.

523
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,280
There's only me

524
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,960
who has been fooled all along.

525
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,620
Tong.

526
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:55,690
Tong.

527
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,480
But everything we did was also for your own sake.

528
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,390
Tong.

529
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,600
Mark.

530
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,290
My son.

531
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,420
Let me see your face
one last time.

532
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,430
I'm sorry.

533
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,270
Ever since I've become a non-human,

534
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,370
I have no feelings for anything.

535
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,800
I do not need rest.

536
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,610
I do not need sleep.

537
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
I'm not hungry.
I'm never satiated.

538
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,150
I have no feelings for anyone.

539
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,730
I've been living my life that way for hundreds of years.

540
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,880
But why…

541
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,520
Is it because of Tong's blood?

542
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,040
I'm sorry, Tong.

543
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,700
I'm sorry you have to go through this.

544
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,310
I understand how you feel now.

545
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,190
You?

546
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,860
Understanding me?

547
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,710
Loneliness.

548
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,520
The feeling as if you're all alone.

549
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,330
To see other people live their lives.

550
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,710
Though you can see them

551
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,610
or hear them,

552
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,800
you still feel like you're shunned away from the outside world.

553
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,310
I'm sorry.

554
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,620
I want to help you.

555
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,720
You don't have to do anything anymore.

556
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,430
I don't want to know any more things.

557
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,730
I don't want any more misery.

558
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,820
I'll let you go back to your normal life.

559
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,950
Are you sure

560
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,940
about letting me go?

561
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,450
Take good care of it.

562
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,110
This is yours too, right?

563
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,810
I've always thought

564
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,450
that it belongs to the angel

565
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,270
who protects

566
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,040
and looks out for me all this time.

567
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,370
I've never thought

568
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,970
that it'd belong to a vampire like you.

569
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,690
Sorry for disappointing you.

570
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:58,910
But you

571
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,000
have always been looking out for me, right?

572
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,120
Thanks.

573
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,250
It's yours now.

574
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,680
Keep it.

575
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,440
What is it?

576
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,320
No?

577
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,560
You're still not going to help your "VIP" friend carry his stuff?

578
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,510
I think you shouldn't be mad at Miss Nuan.

579
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,730
At least,

580
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,820
she has been raising us up until now.

581
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,390
For the scholarship,

582
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,290
I think I will decline it.

583
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,830
I feel bad for you.

584
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,350
Dude.

585
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,510
There's no need for that.

586
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,870
It's a lot of money.

587
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,640
I thought it through.

588
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,300
I'll take out a student loan

589
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,300
and work to cover myself.

590
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,570
It's actually a good thing.

591
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,470
I don't want to owe anyone anything.

592
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:59,900
Kla.

593
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,610
I'm not angry at you or anything.

594
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,660
Don't worry,

595
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,950
I'll take care of all the expenses.

596
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,940
Also, you don't have to work.

597
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:14,630
Well,

598
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,670
about work,

599
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,050
I can help you out now.

600
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,550
What people were saying about me being unwell was a lie.

601
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,110
I'm actually healthy.

602
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,560
What the truth is all about,

603
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,210
you can tell me later when you're ready.

604
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,120
Thanks, Kla.

605
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,600
You're my only friend.

606
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,370
Actually, no.

607
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,740
You're the only family I have now.

608
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,850
Sure!

609
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,210
Also,

610
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,850
you'd better show me respect.

611
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,700
At least, I'm older than you.

612
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,160
Go on.

613
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,050
Do that now.

614
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,530
No.

615
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,860
You're not that respectable.

616
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,850
You moron.

617
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,950
By the way, Tong.

618
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,550
The research friend or whatever,

619
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,830
where is he now?

620
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,040
Are you not going to do it anymore?

621
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,500
Have we got everyone here?

622
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,760
I'll have you divided into teams for a report.

623
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,230
3 people in each team.

624
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,760
You can start teaming up now.

625
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:38,600
Mark?

626
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,190
Hi there.

627
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,800
Would you like to be in my group?

628
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,910
Honestly, if ask me right now,

629
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,350
I can just give in.

630
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,270
No.

631
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,910
I will win with pride.

632
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,630
You still haven’t forgiven him?

633
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,320
Human friendship is the most pointless thing.

634
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,310
Unless you want to be miserable,

635
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:13,990
you shouldn’t trust other people.
