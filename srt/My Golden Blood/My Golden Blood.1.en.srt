Hey!

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,700
Were you sleep-talking?

13
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
You’re the oldest among us.

14
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,420
Don’t you feel ashamed in front of the kids?

15
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,770
Isn’t that how it goes?

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,990
The oldest gets to sleep the longest.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,980
Boys.

18
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,100

will get 2 eggs.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,300

Hey!

29
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,440
I forgot to shut off the gas last night.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,900
Hey!

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,850
- Shit!
- Why didn’t you shut it off?

32
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,140
Surprise!

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,760

Happy birthday to you.

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,720
Tong and Tee-lek,

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,320
make a wish and blow the candles.

39
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,760

[HAPPY BIRTHDAY TEE-LEK / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TONG]

41
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,940

42
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,780
Thank you, Miss Nuan.

43
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,030
Thank you, guys.

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,490
Let’s think of it as celebrating Tong and Tee-lek’s birthday

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,300
and also as a farewell party for the two of you.

46
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,400
Where are you guys going?

47
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,900
Have you found a family who will take you guys in?

48
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,460
No, we’re going to Bangkok to study.

49
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,680
I want to go too.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,010

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,700
Me too!

52
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,260
Alright, alright.

53
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,220
Listen to me, everyone.

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,280
If you get a 4.0 GPA in all subjects,

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,660
I promise I will take you to Bangkok to study.

56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,400
Have we got a deal?

57
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,500
Yes!

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,680
Yes!

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,260
Miss!

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,110
Isn’t this the chocolate cake from that famous bakery?

61
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,079
Who shall the first piece go to?

62
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,829
Hey, hey, hey, Tong.

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
The knife.

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,040
Put that down.

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,910
Put that down.

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,180
What if you cut yourself and start bleeding?

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,720
How many times do I have to say this?

68
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,770
I think I had better go with you to Bangkok.

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,210
Oh, Miss.

70
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,950
There’s no need for that.

71
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,540
I will take care of it.

72
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,560
You rascal.

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,830
You have to take good care of Tong.

74
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,400
Never let him bleed.

75
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,450
Can you do that?

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,200
Yes, Miss.

77
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,490
You should listen to what she says for once.

78
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,890
Who wants some cake?

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,790
I want this piece.

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,780
This one.

81
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,220
There’s no need to fight.

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,640
We’ve got plenty.

83
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Okay, okay. Here you go.

84
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,460
It’s alright, we have two cakes.

86
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,750
Miss.

87
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,380
Yes, dear?

88
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,220
Thank you for this

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,980
but I think it’s too expensive.

90
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
I think I will use my old one

91
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,710
and leave this new one here for the boys.

92
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,000
What’s that?

93
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,520
Isn’t this

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,260
from you?

95
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,340
It's been left right over there.

96
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,740
The note says it’s for me.

97
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,940
Oh, that’s nice.

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,480
There we go, Miss.

99
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,860
Didn’t you say you love us all equally?

100
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,860
Why does Tong get the biggest present?

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,020
I love all of you just as equally.

102
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,170
Where did you get the idea that I have a favorite?

103
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,240
I got this guitar through a donation.

104
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,960
I just wanted it to be a fun surprise.

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,880
Or do you have any issue with it?

106
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,460
Who’s going to say anything?

107
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,290
Tong?

108
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,680
Tonkla?

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,210
Of course not!

110
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,820
Who would dare go against you?

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,770
Tong.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,580
While you are there

113
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,580
you have to take good care of yourself.

114
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,860
Never spill a single drop of blood.

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,460
Got it?

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,550
Yes, Miss.

117
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,680
I think it’s not me you should worry about.

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,420
You should worry about Tonkla.

119
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,320
What?

120
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,800
What is there about me to worry about?

121
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,240
But seriously.

122
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,920
Anything is fine,

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,680
just don’t spill a drop of blood.

124
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,620
Do I have your word for it?

125
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,140
Yes, Miss.

126
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,500
I promise.

127
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,100
Give me a hug.

128
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,420
Come here.

129
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,670
I want a hug too.

130
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,270

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,970
Get in here.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,070
Let’s all hug.

133
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,110
You are heavy!

134

Yes, sir. How can I help you?

It’s my move-in day.

138
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,420
I see.

[COIN LAUNDRY.]

140
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,160
Hey.

141
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,960
Yeah?

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
After we’re done with the laundry,

143
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,870
shall we go downtown?

144
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,110
No.

145
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,590
I have to work today.

146
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,700
Work? What work?

147
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,350
A part-time job.

148
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,720
Hey.

149
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,160
Didn’t Miss tell us not to work?

150
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,350
That's for you, not me.

151
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,010
Hey.

152
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,000
What?

153
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,510
Let me do it too.

154
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,770
Tong, you bastard.

155
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,580
Do you really want to get me in trouble?

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,200
No way.

157
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,530
Why not?

158
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,220
Just don’t tell Miss Nuan about it.

159
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,070
Alright?

160
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,100
Why do you want to break the rules now, Tong?

161
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,870
No.

162
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,000
Come on.

163
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,800
That way I can help out

164
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,310
and you won't have to be the only one working so hard.

165
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,270
Doesn’t that sound good?

166
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,790
Hey, Tong.

167
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,020
Hang the clothes up for me.

168
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,950
I have to go now.

169
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,600
Hey.

170
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,960
Right now?

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,890
Yeah.

172
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,830
Damn it!

173
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,000
I’m screwed.

174
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,390
It overlaps with my gig with The Service.

175
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,360
What should I do?

176
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,940
What gig?

177
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,300
Being a waiter for the rich.

178
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,700
I’ll just ditch it.

179
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,580
Look.

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,380
Then…

184
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,480
Stop.

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
Don’t even think about filling in for me.

186
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,780
Stay at the apartment.

187
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,120
Hang out the clothes.

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,160
I’ll get going.

191

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,940
What is it?

193
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Nothing.

194
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,800
Take care.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,630
It’s you who should take care.

196
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,480
I’m off!

197
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,280
[THE SERVICE. EVENT PLANNER, CATERING AND RECEPTION SERVICE.]

198
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,340
I’m screwed.

199
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,340
It overlaps with my gig with The Service.

200
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,500
What gig?

201
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,990
Being a waiter for the rich.

202
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,670
Miss Nuan.

203
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,470
After I’m done hanging out the clothes,

204
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,840
can I play with Tonkla?

205
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,860
Let me play with you.

206
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,220
You can’t.

207
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,570
Miss Nuan doesn’t allow you to play.

208
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,560
I’ve asked her for permission.

209
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,480
Do you know how to play?

210
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,280
Yeah.

211
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,580
Stop it right now.

212
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,540
Tong.

213
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,700
Who let Tong play?

214
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,990
Was it you?

215
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,610
He said he has your permission already.

216
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,600
Tong is sick, you know that.

217
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,600
I’m fine.

218
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,130
Don’t push it, Tong.

219
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
You heard what the doctor said.

220
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,370
Your body is weak.

221
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,040
If you bleed, it would be hard to stop

222
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,620
and that’s dangerous.

223
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,320
Do you understand?

224
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,120
This is why I don’t want you to play around with such things.

225
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,860
Can I sit and watch the others play instead?

226
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,320
I won’t play.

227
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,320
No negotiation.

228
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,400
You have to do as I say.

229
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,130
The sun is blazing out here.

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,710
Let’s go inside.

231
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,380
If you have a nosebleed,

232
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,460
we’ll have to go to the hospital.

233
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,300
Do you see what I’m saying?

234
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,690
Argh!

235
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,840
Hey!

236
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,830
Who was that?

237
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,020
Didn’t you say you’ve understood all the rules?

238
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,280
Are you the new guy?

239
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,160
What’s your name?

240
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,160
My name is To–

241
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,860
I’m Tonkla.

242
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,600
I lost the group chat

243
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,110
so I didn’t go through it the second time.

244
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,730
Tonkla?

245
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,180
Oh.

246
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,400
That’s you?

247
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,140
Yes?

248
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,720
I’ve heard a lot about you from the event last week.

249
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,750
But I’m telling you now,

250
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,660
this is unlike the previous events.

251
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,060
You have to get it done perfectly.

252
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,890
More importantly, never get drunk during work.

253
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,480
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,780
And no asking for any girl’s contact information.

255
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,440
Yes, sir.

256
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,220
Off you go.

257
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,440
Mr. Nakan,

258
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,180
how do you feel about Amarita Stem Cell Serum

259
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,140
hitting over 10 million bottles of sales in just one night?

260
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,920
It’s actually “within just 4 hours”.

261
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,200
Wow! That’s amazing.

262
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,270
Amazing!

263
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,630
It’s a shame that our product is now sold out.

264
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,870
But don’t worry,

265
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,700
I already had the manufacturer fill up the stock to the brim.

266
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
You can now make purchases from all sales channels.

267
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,300
All Thai people will get to be beautiful now!

268
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,830
By the way, you have Meena as your plus one,

269
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,710
are you guys making it public now?

270
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,870
What’s going on here, Meena?

271
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,240
What is it?

272
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,200
What’s going on?

273
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,330
We’re making it public
that she’s the global ambassador of the Amarita Stem Cell Serum.

274
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,180
Wow.

275
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,670
You got us hanging there.

276
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,020
You got us there!

277
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,340
Oops!

278
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,920
I’m so sorry.

279
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,110
Hey!

280
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,780
His watch is expensive stuff!

281
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,730
We’ll get kicked out.

282
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,920
Such a fool!

283
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,920
It’s alright.

284
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,290
A watch is not something we would need for tonight anyway.

285
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,020
Because we’ll be having fun all night long tonight,

286
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,310
without any care about time.

287
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,480
Alright?

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,120
That’s right.

289
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,050
Thank you so much.

290
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,930
Thank you so much.

291
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
A little closer together, please.

292
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,350
Please look at the camera.

293
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,820
It’s all taken care of, Mr. Nakan.

294
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,720
For good?

295
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Were a reporter to disappear,

296
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,440
I guess no one would suspect anything.

297
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,010
Newbie.

298
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Go and serve at the pool area.

299
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,200
This is my zone.

300
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,000
Which way is the pool?

301
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,300
Downstairs.

302
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,140
Boy.

303
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,150
I’ll have 2 glasses of wine.

304
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,290
Yes.

305
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,600
Here’s your drink, Sir.

306
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,760
Be careful.

307
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
My apologies.

308
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,280
I’ll get you a new drink.

309
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,560
Get me one Bloody Mary.

310
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,680
Bring it to my room.

311
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,630
Uh, excuse me.

312
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,420
The guest ordered a “buddy” something just now.

313
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,720
Is it “Bloody Mary"?

314
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,990
Yes.

315
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,730
By the way,

316
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,730
the guest wanted me to bring it up to his room.

317
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,430
I’m not sure which room it is.

318
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,360
Mark Amarittrakul.

319
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
His room is written on the first page.

320
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,740
Amarittrakul?

321
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,680
They’ve got the same last name.

322
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,520
Are the three of them siblings?

323
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,310
They’re cousins.

324
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,700
Thara Amarittrakul.

325
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,840
CEO of the Ritzer Anti-aging Medical Center.

326
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,730
Is Miss Thara not here today?

327
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,280
She’ll probably be here soon.

328
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,100
There, your Bloody Mary is ready.

329
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,690
Yes.

330
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,600
Wow.

331
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,960
“Bloody” indeed.

332
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
That’s just tomato juice.

333
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,360
By the way, only deliver the drink.

334
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,250
Come back right away after you’re done.

335
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,970
I don’t like having my part-time staff take a side job.

336
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,470
A side job?

337
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,840
Oh! I don’t do that kind of thing.

338
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,470
Someone as good-looking as you have what it takes, though.

339
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,060
But the person calling for you is Mr. Mark.

340
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,500
So he’s probably not your style.

341
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,880
But if you want to take the job,

342
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,650
don’t flaunt around about it.

343
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,450
Got that?

344
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,680
Your drink is here.

345
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,890
Excuse me.

346
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,880
I’ll leave your drink on the table, Mr. Mark.

347
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,110
How did you get here?

348
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,040
I asked you how you got here.

349
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,910
Didn’t you tell me to bring the drink to your room, Mr. Mark?

350
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,020
No.

351
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,820
I meant, how come you’re working here?

352
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,860
Who asked you to come?

353
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,120
I’m a part-timer for The Service.

354
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,500
Take this

355
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,580
and never take up such a job again.

356
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,750
“Such a job”?

357
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,200
That’s not it.

358
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,160
I’m just a waiter.

359
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,150
I don’t take up that kind of job.

360
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,210
I know.

361
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,950
But you shouldn’t be here nonetheless.

362
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,410
Especially not at this event.

363
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,280
This event is full of…

364
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,260
Forget it.

365
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,560
Take it and never come here again.

366
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,540
I’m not taking your money.

367
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
My apologies.

368
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,080
Do you want me to call in the head of The Service

369
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,430
so that he can fire you himself?

370
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,890
Would that make you leave?

371
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,610
Did I offend you in any way, Mr. Mark?

372
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,580
This place is extremely dangerous, Tong.

373
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,100
No.

374
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,040
My name is Tonkla.

375
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,400
Excuse me.

376
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,260
My apologies.

377
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,730
Tong, don’t!

378
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,440
Ouch.

379
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,480
What’s wrong?

380
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,680
Where are you going, Nakan?

381
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,260
Would you stay out of my business

382
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,230
for once?

383
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,140
I will go wherever I want,

384
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,140
on my own.

385
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,020
Help!

386
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,700
Help!

387
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,140
Be quiet.

388
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,010
Come with me.

389
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,230
Blood!

390
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,980
Sir, I’m bleeding.

391
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,030
I have to go to the hospital right away!

392
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,820
Seat belt.

393
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,380
Sir,

394
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,380
you don’t understand.

395
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,320
I’m unwell.

396
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,520
With this small of a cut,

397
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,010
if I don’t get patched up right away,

398
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,810
I can bleed until all my blood runs dry.

399
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,490
You’re not unwell, Tong.

400
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,130
Yes, I am.

401
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,220
I have had it since I was born.

402
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,520
What do you even know?

403
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,340
How do you know my name’s Tong?

404
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,300
What you are is much worse than that.

405
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,300
Give me your hand.

406
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,220
Hey.

407
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,780
What are you doing, Sir?

408
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,290
Let go!

409
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,120
Sir!

410
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,910
Stay still

411
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,260
and stop making a fuss unless you want to die.

412
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,650
The wound is gone.

413
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,820
How did you do that?

414
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,620
What the hell is going on?

415
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,710
Seat belt!

416
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,410
Bloody Mary.

417
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,500
Are you going to get out of the car?

418
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,199
Can you tell me where you’re taking me?

419
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,360
What’s that?

420
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,640
I’m not going in there.

421
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,050
Don't you want to know the truth anymore?

422
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,300
If you still do then follow me.

423
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,720
Hey.

424
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,100
I’m sorry.

425
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,380
Are you okay?

426
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,020
Hey!

427
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,720
I told you not to go through the trash here, you punk!

428
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,240
Come here.

429
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,820
A rascal like you deserves some beating.

430
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,680
Come here!

431
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,540
Argh!

432
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,780
Argh!

433
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,000
If you don’t want to get in trouble,

434
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,220
then hurry up and beat it.

435
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
What the hell of a creature was that?

436
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,600
And you…

437
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,080
Let’s hurry up and go.

438
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,540
I’m not going.

439
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,620
You can’t be here any longer.

440
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,620
No, I want to go home.

441
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,300
Let’s hurry and get inside.

442
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,290
Why are you so late, Mr. Mark?

443
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,700
Some trouble came up that I had to take care of.

444
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,740
Come on.

445
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,740
Please come right in.

446
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
You must still be in shock.

447
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,060
You can let your guard down with me.

448
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,060
I will give you some snacks when we get in.

449
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,960
Aunty Wan,

450
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,600
you're being even more suspicious
if you lure him in with snacks.

451
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,100
Well, I don’t like forcing people like a certain someone.

452
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,780
It was necessary.

453
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,740
I will leave it to you.

454
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,720
They’re probably everywhere out there at this point.

455
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,720
Why did you guys take me here?

456
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,810
I want to go back to my apartment.

457
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,100
Hold on.

458
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,280
Let’s go inside and talk.

459
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,580
Don’t worry.

460
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,280
This place is 100% safe.

461
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,730
I promise that I won’t scare you like Mr. Mark did.

462
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,840
This way.

463
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,910
I will get the tea ready

464
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,780
and the snacks for Mr. Tong, as promised.

465
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,000
Sir.

466
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,210
Would you tell me already?

467
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,620
What the hell is going on?

468
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,600
Why did you take me here?

469
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,300
How does the aunty know my name?

470
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,620
That boy at the market back then…

471
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,420
And you…

472
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,080
You’re curious about so many things.

473
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,300
How did you do that?

474
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,450
You’re not curious about how I did that.

475
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,500
You actually want to know who I am.

476
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,670
Who do you think I am?

477
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,080
You are

478
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,690
Mark Amarittrakul.

479
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,160
Right?

480
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,010
The question you should ask me

481
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,510
is not who I am

482
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,000
but what creature I am.

483
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,370
We are non-human beings who are immortal.

484
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,460
With tremendous strength

485
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,830
and different abilities,

486
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:13,170
there is no way that a human like you can run away from us.

487
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,710
Think carefully, Tong.

488
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,240
You already knew the answer.

489
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,380
As to what creature I am.

490
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,310
The creature that feeds on human blood.

491
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,610
A vampire.

492
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,820
Are you going to drink my blood?

493
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,850
We call your blood,

494
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,190
“The Golden Blood”.

495
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,490
The blood that flows through your body

496
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,410
is the most rare, powerful, and precious blood.

497
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,150
It’s wanted by us.

498
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,530
So we have to fool you and those around you

499
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,790
into thinking that you have Hemophilia,

500
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,820
where you can die just by spilling a tiny bit of blood.

501
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,660
But actually,

502
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,140
it’s to protect the precious blood

503
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,020
and prevent something like tonight from happening.

504
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,010
I don’t get it.

505
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,340
Are you saying that everything was a lie?

506
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,390
I’m telling you the truth right now.

507
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,290
That means,

508
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,910
if I bleed, I would be eaten up?

509
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,870
If my blood gets eaten up,

510
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
I will become a vampire like you, is that it?

511
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,940
No.

512
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,360
If your blood gets eaten up,

513
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,210
there is no way you will make it out alive.

514
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,750
That’s because none of us would stop drinking your blood

515
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,300
until they have drunk it all up.

516
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,170
Then chaos would be stirred up yet again.

517
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,450
Why is that?

518
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,450
Why does it have to be me?

519
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:02,870
Because your blood…

520
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,430
Your blood,

521
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,380
just a single drop of it,

522
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,390
had this great of an impact on me.

523
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,090
If I could drink it all up…

524
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,130
But I won’t do that.

525
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,250
Because I will protect you,

526
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,430
the way I have been doing all along.

527
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,580
Sir…

528
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,770
My duty is to take care of you

529
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,980
and I will not let anyone harm you.

530
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,600
Trust in me, Tong.

531
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,600
Until you turn 21,

532
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,570
I will be taking care of you all the time.

533
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,150
Whatever it is about you

534
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:27,570
I know it all.

535
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,910
Do you want to try testing it out?

536
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,520
This is a student’s accommodation.

537
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,970
We don’t allow outsiders to enter.

538
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,530
Is this guitar

539
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,110
a present from you?

540
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,190
Ouch!

541
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,190
Run away.

542
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,180
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t do anything to me?
