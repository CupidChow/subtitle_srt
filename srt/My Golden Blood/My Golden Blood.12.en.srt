are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
Thara sent you here, right?

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,640
Stop hesitating.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,760
Mark’s risking his life trying to save you.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,920
I can’t do it.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,170
I can’t kill Tong.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,640
But the only way that we’ve agreed upon

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,240
is that Tong has to die.

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,250
Tell me where Tong is.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,250
No matter how much you torture me,

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,660
you will never get the Golden Blood.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,120
If you have me,

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,400
everything will end, right?

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,380
Tong.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,920
Don’t do this.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,600
Live the rest of this life on my behalf.

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,150
Tong!

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,290
Tong!

22
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,790
Mark.

23
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,430
Just a piece of iron.

24
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,390
What an insult.

25
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,670
What about your men?

26
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,780
Are you still expecting anyone to save us?

27
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,570
When you go against Thara,

28
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,960
that’s like you’re raging a war against all other vampires.

29
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,640
If it’s for Tong, I can do anything.

30
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,790
So, what’s your next move?

31
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,960
Any plans?

32
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,940
What about Aunty Wan?

33
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,940
She should be able to help us.

34
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,050
I’m sorry, Tong.

35
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,800
But life’s not something we can choose.

36
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,760
At this point,

37
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,130
I don’t think there’s any need to put on a show.

38
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,180
For me to fully devour the Golden Blood,

39
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,760
there’s no need for you to be intact with all your limbs, though.

40
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,180
If I cut out the annoying part,

41
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,360
perhaps it might taste better.

42
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,980
Are you sure

43
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,290
that once you had my blood,

44
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,770
your plan would go through?

45
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
(I’m sorry.)

46
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,159
(For not being able to protect you.)

47
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,740
The voice I’m hearing

48
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,860
is the sound of success.

49
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,770
I’ve never thought things would turn out like this.

50
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,380
Am I

51
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,540
part of what killed those people?

52
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,250
And now

53
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,970
Tong is…

54
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,550
Stop that right now!

55
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,159
I said, stop it right now!

56
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,370
You’re hopeful right down to the last minute.

57
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,170
As expected of a human.

58
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,730
You have no right to make any choices.

59
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,310
Your life and every drop of your blood

60
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,380
is mine.

61
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,710
Take him away!

62
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,180
Let go!

63
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,150
Let go of me!

64
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,230
Let go!

65
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,230
Thara tricked all of us.

66
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,810
You don’t have to feel guilty.

67
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,690
But now, you have to choose which side you’re going to join.

68
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,600
The right thing

69
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,100
or Thara.

70
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,440
Aunty Wan,

71
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,980
we want you

72
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,980
to help us find a way to defeat Thara.

73
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,940
I know

74
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,770
that you’ll be able to help us.

75
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,810
If you’re talking about a way
then there’s one.

76
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,310
But it’s too risky.

77
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,400
I’m begging you.

78
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,419
Let me go.

79
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,380
I would do anything.

80
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
If you want me to keep making blood for you

81
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,990
then I’d gladly do it.

82
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,260
Just let me stay alive.

83
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,040
The true power

84
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,790
is what I want.

85
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,300
The power that can make me rise above the other vampires.

86
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,440
All of them.

87
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,450
I will bite into your neck.

88
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,380
Then suck out the Golden Blood until the last drop

89
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,930
for the power to kill other vampires.

90
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,580
You know what, Tong?

91
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,580
With the power of your blood,

92
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,400
it can end the immortal life of any vampire.

93
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,520
Isn’t that so delightful?

94
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,070
In the past,

95
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,180
when Miss Thara is to perform any important ritual,

96
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,140
she would do it here.

97
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,440
So I think this is probably the place.

98
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Would this really work?

99
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,020
I’m not too sure either

100
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,760
since this is also my first time.

101
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
It will work out no matter what.

102
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Because it’s our only way to survive.

103
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,760
It’s time, everyone.

104
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,680
Our holy celebration is about to begin.

105
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,570
Get them!

106
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,960
Go ahead and rescue Tong, Nakan.

107
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,130
Mark is on his way.

108
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,040
You won’t be able to lay a finger on me.

109
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
You guys seem to never learn.

110
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,190
Surprise!

111
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,750
I even let you go.

112
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Did that not hurt enough, Nakan?

113
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,990
That’s right.

114
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,230
It almost felt painless

115
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,760
compared to what you did to me.

116
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,520
That

117
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,150
was what pain is.

118
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,370
I will help make your pain disappear forever.

119
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,370
I know and I can see everything.

120
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,520
You had better give up now.

121
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,190
That doesn’t mean you can fight it.

122
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,670
The weapon you’ve prepared won’t work, Nakan.

123
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,160
And your plan to lock me out

124
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,500
and take Tong away

125
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,680
will never work.

126
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,580
No matter how you play it out,

127
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,890
I will always be ahead of you.

128
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,400
You’d better give up now.

129
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,590
Then let’s give it a go.

130
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,140
See who’s going to get to checkmate first.

131
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,800
The loser

132
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,750
will never be me.

133
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,790
Mark!

134
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,060
Mark!

135
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,640
Had you given in in the first place–

136
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,980
Stop it.

137
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,700
You were never going to let me live anyway.

138
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,600
Why should I fight someone good like you?

139
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,720
The power you get from taking others’ lives,

140
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,260
I won’t have any more of it.

141
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,790
Mark!

142
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,420
Nakan!

143
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,970
What are you doing?!

144
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,720
That’s how the game is played out

145
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,040
so I have to give in.

146
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,760
This is the same power-debuffing potion

147
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,610
you used to disenchant my spell.

148
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,850
You’re thinking of giving up now?

149
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,580
You told me yourself

150
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,850
to do all that it takes

151
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,380
to get out of here.

152
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,920
Mark,

153
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,520
take Tong and hurry out of here!

154
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,090
Hurry up, Mark!

155
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,580
You’re cunning down to the last minute!

156
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,870
Tong's blood used to make the disenchanting perfume

157
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,170
should work on Miss Thara too.

158
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,070
It should have some power-debuffing effect.

159
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,470
To kill a vampire,

160
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,470
you have to pierce through the heart.

161
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,140
I will use this to take down Thara.

162
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,360
But Miss Thara can foresee the future.

163
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,140
How can we get close to her?

164
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,040
I’ll take care of that.

165
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,890
Aunty Wan, you just have to try and draw the vampires out
as much as you can.

166
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,600
The fight is not over,

167
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,600
don’t get too happy just yet.

168
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,960
Mark.

169
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,619
I thought I would never get to see you again.

170
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,180
If I fail,

171
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,260
there’s only one way.

172
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,960
That is
you have to kill Tong.

173
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I still insist, Mark.

174
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,140
That it’s the only way to end it all.

175
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,340
If that time really comes,

176
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,520
I’ll be the one who ends everything.

177
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,040
I hope it never ends up that way.

178
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,410
Because killing someone you love with your own hands

179
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,180
would probably become a nightmare for you
for the rest of your life.

180
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,540
It’s alright now, Tong.

181
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,970
I’ve never thought someone like you would ever betray me.

182
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,030
Had I known that what you want was to kill people,

183
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,980
I would have never helped you in the first place.

184
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
But it’s nice that you dare betray me.

185
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,230
Thank you

186
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,450
for neatly extracting Tong’s blood for me.

187
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,480
Who would be so stupid

188
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,560
to have you extracted the blood just for the disenchanting perfume?

189
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,370
I saved some aside for power boosting.

190
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,860
You are horrible!

191
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,290
You tricked and used everyone!

192
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,960
When did I trick or use anyone?

193
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,120
Everything was mine from the start.

194
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,700
The lab,

195
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,370
the Golden Blood,

196
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
and you too.

197
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,570
If I want you to live,

198
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,730
then you are to live.

199
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,560
If I want you to die,

200
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,170
then you are bound to die.

201
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,510
The more you try to run,

202
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,710
the more people will have to sacrifice their lives.

203
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,350
Go and get the Golden Blood!

204
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,010
Stop playing hide and seek.

205
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,940
Pop your heads out
so there can be fewer injuries.

206
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,300
Since you guys

207
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,360
never stand a chance against me anyway.

208
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,000
Things turn out like this again.

209
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,060
I don’t want anyone

210
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,990
to get into trouble because of me anymore.

211
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,310
My parents,

212
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,770
Tonkla,

213
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,350
and other people.

214
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,190
Tong.

215
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,400
It’s not your fault at all.

216
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,560
What if it’s you?

217
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,610
I can’t let that happen.

218
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,410
Mark.

219
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,140
Mark.

220
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,860
Look at me.

221
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,600
Mark.

222
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,850
There’s only one way left.

223
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,290
You know it.

224
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,130
If that is how we can defeat Thara,

225
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,590
then go on with it.

226
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,690
Take my blood.

227
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,830
Mark.

228
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,910
Mark.

229
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,160
If you drink my blood,

230
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,570
part of me

231
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,310
will forever be with you.

232
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,760
Take down Thara

233
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,390
for my sake

234
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,190
and live the rest of this life

235
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,330
on my behalf.

236
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,530
Let me be with you forever, Mark.

237
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,080
I do.

238
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,350
You’ve killed Tong.

239
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,360
Go on and kill me as well.

240
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,700
The immortal life with no one beside you is what you want.

241
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,450
If I die,

242
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
you will have no one left.

243
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,740
You will be alone forever.

244
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,480
Don’t let emotions take over like humans do, Mark.

245
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,370
You once promised to be loyal to me for the rest of your life.

246
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,310
Remember?

247
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,890
Like Nakan said,

248
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,320
I’m just a loyal dog to you.

249
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,120
Have you ever thought of me as your son?

250
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,050
What's the point of realizing the truth now?

251
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,410
Or do you want to know just to feel miserable?

252
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,040
Pierce it through her heart, Mark!

253
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,810
It’s the only way to kill her.

254
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,630
Go ahead and kill me, Mark.

255
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,620
If you dare then go ahead and kill me.

256
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,620
I’m the only family you have left.

257
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,590
What are you waiting for?

258
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,300
This is the only chance.

259
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,710
You are the one

260
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,130
who destroyed my family.

261
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,570
You were the one who made me kill Tong.

262
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,810
You are not my family.

263
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,510
Nakan.

264
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,190
Thanks, Mark.

265
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,330
Finally,

266
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,310
I will get to meet my person.

267
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,690
Finally.

268
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,350
I’m sorry.

269
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,540
For not being able to protect you.

270
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,980
For breaking our promise.

271
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,360
Tong!

272
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,780
Tong!

273
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,980
Tong!

274
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,340
Tong!

275
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,340
Mark!

276
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,630
Tong!

277
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,180
Tong!

278
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,790
I have the Golden Blood now,

279
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,100
I will heal you.

280
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,610
I don’t feel so well.

281
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,320
I’m about to die.

282
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,360
Hang in there, Tong.

283
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,570
Stay with me.

284
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,000
Stay with me now, Tong.

285
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,560
The power probably only saved me temporarily.

286
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,060
It’s no use.

287
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,840
I want to be with Mark forever.

288
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,860
If I were immortal like Mark,

289
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,220
we would get to be together.

290
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,210
Are you sure about that?

291
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,380
I can be anything

292
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,170
as long as I get to be with you, Mark.

293
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,390
I’m back.

294
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,770
Welcome back, Tong.

295
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,420
(The world still goes on.)

296
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,920
(Seasons still change.)

297
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,620
(Humans still move forward)

298
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,020
(without knowing that there are some of ‘us’)

299
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,480
(who are still lurking and wandering among them.)

300
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,790
(If you look at it on the face value,)

301
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,700
(there is no difference from 10 or 100 years ago)

302
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,980
(when we try to maintain the balance between the two words.)

303
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,620
(Drawing a clear line and not crossing that line.)

304
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,920
(But for me right now,)

305
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,390
(we’re changing and moving forward as well.)

306
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,880
(To take down the wall between the two worlds.)

307
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,760
When that man realizes that his heart

308
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,670
is made for the monster who’s immortal.

309
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,690
(We are creatures with power beyond those of humans.)

310
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,260
(With special powers and an immortal life.)

311
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,360
(No heart and no emotions.)

312
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,280
(Seems undefeatable and horrifying, like a monster.)

313
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,280
(But what humans don’t know is that)

314
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,360
(those differences don't make us different.)

315
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,640
The monster passed on a special power

316
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,040
and brought that man back to life.

317
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,980
They then lived together happily ever after.

318
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,400
Like other couples.

319
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,980
Is it made up or is it a true story?

320
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,070
It’s time.

321
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,400
(But the thing is)

322
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,370
(the unknown is what’s frightening for humans.)

323
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,760
I will get back to the story later.

324
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,530
(That’s why the change has to start at the get-go.)

325
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:10,320
(So that they can see that the place of darkness they’re afraid of)

326
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,590
(is actually harmless.)

327
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,250
Are you nervous?

328
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,580
I don’t know how it will turn out

329
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,280
but at least she deserves to know

330
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,370
what the Golden Blood that’s flowing inside her is.

331
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,130
So she wouldn’t have to be raised the way I was.

332
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,780
Then you don’t have to worry about anything

333
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,580
since what you’re about to do is a good thing.

334
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,790
You’re good at consoling people like a human now.

335
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,090
Let’s go.

336
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,490
Navin.

337
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,950
Happy birthday.

338
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Thank you, Tong and Mark.

339
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,850
Before you make a wish,

340
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,370
I have something to tell you.

341
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,390
Is my blood that special?

342
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,820
It’s special

343
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,650
but it’s not something that will tie you down.

344
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,770
From now on,

345
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,170
I will do everything to ensure that

346
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,790
your life will remain the way it has been.

347
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,030
I will be beside you

348
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,870
and take care of you.

349
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,940
Trust me,

350
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,570
the Golden Blood has the right to live
just like the other kids.

351
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,340
(Something new that I’ve just discovered,)

352
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,220
(love.)

353
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,010
(Love is magical beyond any power.)

354
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,060
(Love is what makes a human’s heart so strong)

355
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,750
(that they can mutter strength to move forward.)

356
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,590
(And it makes a vampire’s heart beat like a human’s once again.)

357
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,140
(It makes me realize that whether you are a human or a vampire,)

358
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,990
(love is crucial for both of us.)

359
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,770
(I want the others to realize this too.)

360
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,650
It’s the prototype of a synthetic Golden Blood

361
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,490
mentioned by Mr. Mark previously.

362
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,370
It’s something that will make it easier for us
to live with humans.

363
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,650
(The future we have in mind)

364
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,840
(might bring us to something unforeseen or failure)

365
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,890
(but being in love)

366
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,030
(and living with the hope of building a life with someone)

367
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
(can make the heart so warm)

368
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,050
(that you’re up for conquering a tall mountain.)

369
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,520
Are you sure, Mr. Tong?

370
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,580
The synthetic Golden Blood might have strong side effects.

371
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,070
I think you should

372
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,830
find a volunteer to experiment instead.

373
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,850
I am the volunteer

374
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,550
who’s willing to do it 100%.

375
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,000
That’s why I’m the best candidate for a tester.

376
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,860
Approved?

377
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,460
Mr. President?

378
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,740
I always trust in your decisions.

379
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,660
(When the new day comes,)

380
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,010
(when we’re able to grasp the success at the finish line,)

381
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,740
(if this story is a book,)

382
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,110
(the epilogue should thank every sacrifice)

383
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,100
(for giving us the chance)

384
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,130
(to change everything for the better)

385
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,530
(and for allowing us to live our lives the way we want.)

386
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,410
(The mundane life that’s so simple)

387
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,130
(with only hope that the person who made the vampire’s heart beat again)

388
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,130
(would stay happy and stay with him forever.)

389
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,870
My favorite scent.

390
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,130
It’s quite nice.

391
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,290
But I think my favorite

392
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,300
smells even better.

393
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,620
ABLE TO SMELL FLOWERS
TRAVEL THE WORLD
RIDE A ROLLERCOASTER AND FEEL SCARED
HANGING UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE EIFFEL TOWER

394
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,830
I’ve requested a holiday leave for the both of us.

395
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,400
Where shall we cross off the checklist next?

396
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,830
I’m so excited.

397
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,950
But when I’m really about to get to live,

398
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,820
I don’t know where to start.

399
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,230
Shall we randomize it?

400
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,500
A random?

401
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,570
Close your eyes.

402
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,180
Try and choose.

403
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,190
Is this your pick?

404
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,880
Can this be my pick?

405
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,430
If you pick this one,

406
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,180
you’ll never be disappointed.

407
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,800
I'll make you forget about the time.

408
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,620
Then… better not.

409
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,390
Are you sure?

410
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,650
This one.

411
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,970
Are you ready for Paris, mon cœur?

412
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,910
Oui, mon amour.

413
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,220
You know what, Tong?

414
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,430
We can be the longest-lasting couple now.

415
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,910
I will secretly put up our picture

416
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,550
at the museum that you took me to.

417
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,770
Is anything wrong?

418
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,520
Hmm?

419
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,390
I…

420
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,370
have a feeling.

421
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,880
A feeling?

422
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,540
Mark.

423
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,380
Are you going to ask me to marry you?

424
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,130
Hmm?

425
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,910
No?

426
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,520
No.

427
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,570
I don’t know when you’re going to ask for my hand

428
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,550
but I know that I’m always ready.

429
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,010
So what is it?

430
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,130
Hmm?

431
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,120
What were you about to say just now?

432
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:36,170
Hmm?

433
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,190
No.

434
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,830
I’d better not say it.

435
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,130
I think it’s a bit cheesy.

436
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,860
Cheesy?

437
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,340
You make me even more curious.

438
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,620
Tell me.

439
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,450
Are you going to tell me?

440
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,380
Nope.

441
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,490
Why?

442
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,240
What are you going to do?

443
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,670
Huh?

444
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,210
This.

445
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,850
Hey, hey.

446
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,590
Okay, okay.

447
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,410
I’ll tell you.

448
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,870
Well…

449
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,870
“Forever” is only possible

450
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,790
because of you, Mark.

451
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,600
Hey!

452
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,190
Why are you laughing?

453
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,560
No, nothing.

454
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,310
(Immortality which used to be a horrendous poison,)

455
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,410
(like the cold that makes you lonely,)

456
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,030
(won’t be the same from now on.)

457
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,540
(Because a vampire like me)

458
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,940
(is starting to have a heart.)

459
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,980
(I have someone who would hold my hand)
(and be with me every minute)

460
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,920
(from now and forever.)

461
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Haven’t you found anyone you like?

462
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,190
Working with us is not easy, Tong.

463
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:14,750
You know that.

464
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,860
Then shall I sign up to be your secretary?

465
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,500
What do I have to do as a secretary?

466
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,970
First of all, make me some coffee.

467
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,200
Here are your two pure espresso shots, Mr. Mark.

468
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:05,970
Number two, you have to be on standby with the president
24 hours a day.

469
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,830
It happens that I don't have to sleep anyway.

470
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,410
Then number three,

471
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,970
the secretary has to give me a cheer-up kiss every hour.

472
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,910
I think

473
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,690
you seem love-deprived, Mr. President.

474
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,610
You can’t do that?

475
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,490
Why don’t you

476
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,900
let me pass the probation and start working now?

477
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,710
There’s one last condition.

478
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,280
If the president gets hungry,

479
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,970
the secretary has to give it to him

480
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,330
until he’s satisfied.

481
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,120
Hold on.

482
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,150
Hold on.

483
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:29,510
I think this is not the place, Mr. President.

484
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,190
Did you forget

485
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,770
that I own this place?

486
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,360
Does this mean

487
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,970
I’m hired now?

488
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,760
You have to pass the probation first.

489
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,350
The office hours are over now.

490
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,820
So what if it’s not office hours anymore?

491
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,120
It's past office hours

492
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,990
so you have to give me overtime incentives.

493
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,840
If you want anything,

494
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,320
go ahead and let me know.

495
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,390
I’ll spare no expenses.
