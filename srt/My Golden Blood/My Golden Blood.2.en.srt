are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,670
The knife.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,720
Put that down.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,390
You have to take good care of Tong.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,590
Never let him bleed.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,500
Can you do that?

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,830
Yes, Miss.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,680
This place is extremely dangerous, Tong.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,170
We call your blood,
“The Golden Blood”.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,420
If your blood gets eaten up,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,930
There is no vampire that would stop drinking your blood

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,860
until they have drunk it all up.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,550
If I bleed, I would be eaten up?

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,640
My duty is to protect you

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,110
and I will never let anyone harm you.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,990
Trust in me.

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,270
Do you really think that

21
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,640
in this vast world,

22
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,110
humans are the most almighty creature?

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,160
Amid the people brushing past each other every day,

24
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,340
there are other creatures that look exactly like humans
hiding among them.

25
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,130
Creatures that are more powerful.

26
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,340
That have special powers

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,530
and are immortal.

28
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,540
Let go of him right now!

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,530
You are violating the most crucial rule.

30
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,050
Don’t stick your nose in!

31
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,690
Do you not realize that or is this intentional?

32
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,030
Mark.

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,370
You lot!

34
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,380
Take this woman away

35
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,380
before she causes more trouble.

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,630
Yes, Miss Thara.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,700
Miss Thara, I wasn’t–

38
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,700
I wasn’t trying to drink his blood.

39
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,770
I haven’t violated the rule yet.

40
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,950
Please don’t punish me, Miss Thara.

41
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,780
The power of lust

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,270
can always ruin a human.

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,820
If you've learned to follow the rules,

44
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,660
you will get to come outside again.

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,190
Sir.

46
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,810
Forget all the things that happened

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,790
and follow me.

48
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,970
To live peacefully with humans,

49
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,190
the first and most crucial rule of ours

50
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,470
is to never kill a human.

51
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,690
We try to abide by this rule strictly.

52
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,390
Using all the resources we have

53
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,500
whether it’s wisdom, money, or connection

54
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,060
until we’re able to produce artificial blood

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,110
and doesn’t have to drink human blood.

56
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,800
There is no more need to kill

57
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,800
or harm humans.

58
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,370
But not everyone abides by the rules.

59
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,690
Drinking blood from a living and breathing human

60
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,270
is challenging and luscious for us.

61
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,860
The war between the rulekeepers and those not
has been waging all this time.

62
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,280
We are still in control now

63
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,300
since we have a strong leader with great power like Miss Thara.

64
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,590
Yet, her power is unmatched against the power of

65
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,580
the Golden Blood.

66
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,370
Are you talking about me?

67
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,090
Your blood is the reason why I have to be here.

68
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,020
I think there must have been a misunderstanding.

69
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,090
It can’t be me.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,910
It’s you.

71
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
I’ve been assigned to protect you

72
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
since 20 years ago.

73
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,600
How is that possible?

74
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,540
Because your Golden Blood

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,540
is the most powerful thing.

76
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,590
Think about it,

77
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,840
If your blood falls in the hands of those thirsty for power,

78
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,270
not just us

79
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,250
but the humans will also be in trouble.

80
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,080
Can I leave now?

81
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,740
Leave?

82
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,990
And allow yourself to almost get eaten up
like at the market just now?

83
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,650
But even when I’m here,

84
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,690
there's no guarantee that I won't get eaten up.

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,659
You’re a vampire too.

86
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,700
So does that weird aunty,

87
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,690
isn’t that right?

88
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,790
Is that right?

89
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,830
Yes?

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,020
Or no?

91
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,710
How long have you been there?

92
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,680
I’ve been here for a while.

93
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,690
But you didn’t notice me.

94
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,150
It’s alright.

95
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,380
Oh, by the way.

96
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,380
I have something for you.

97
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,080
You should hurry along, Mr. Mark.

98
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,080
I will take care of things here.

99
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,550
Mr. Mark.

100
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,039
What the…?

101
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,570
Oh!

102
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,870
Is this your room?

103
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,050
Why is it such a mess?

104
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,310
I’ll pay for the mess.

105
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,530
Have your secretary send me the details.

106
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,870
I didn’t see you at the event.

107
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,450
Was it boring?

108
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,470
It was alright.

109
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,710
Do you have any suggestions for me?

110
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,470
So that I can improve.

111
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,660
Perhaps that might make you and Miss Thara
feel better about me for once.

112
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Shall we really celebrate now?

113
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,880
Is this style

114
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,420
to your liking?

115
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,270
You do know

116
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,260
that what you’re doing is against the rule, right?

117
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,490
Relax!

118
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,690
I was about to have a bit of blood.

119
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,040
I wasn’t going to kill her.

120
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,490
That’s not against the rule.

121
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,630
Come on!

122
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,010
Thara is not around.

123
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Don’t act like such a good guy.

124
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,300
Stop it.

125
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,770
Even if it’s you,

126
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,440
if the rule is breached
I won’t let it slide, Nakan.

127
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,850
It’s nothing!

128
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,160
Just kidding.

129
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,160
It’s too serious.

130
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
I had better go.

131
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,980
Do you have any more business with me,

132
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,290
Miss Thara?

133
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,370
What about you?

134
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,270
Is there anything else I should know?

135
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,430
My apologies.

136
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,610
What happened, Mark?

137
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
It’s not fair to put all the blame on you, though.

138
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,510
I also have my share on this.

139
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,570
I didn’t see in my vision that Tong’s going to come to this event.

140
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,490
Otherwise, I would have warned you beforehand.

141
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,950
Did Nakan meet Tong?

142
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,170
No.

143
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,690
But that’s only a matter of time.

144
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,230
My power is getting weaker.

145
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,290
My vision is deteriorating.

146
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,050
We can’t let the Golden Blood fall into Nakan’s hand.

147
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,000
The power of the Golden Blood is too almighty.

148
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,550
I don’t think I’m fit for this mission anymore, Miss Thara.

149
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,250
Is it because I’ve gotten weaker?

150
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,150
Did I make you doubt my vision?

151
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,980
No.

152
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,150
It’s just that…

153
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,770
The vision I had on the first day I met you was crystal clear.

154
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,220
I saw the next leader of Amarittrakul.

155
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,710
My vision is never wrong.

156
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,480
But even without the vision,

157
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,680
there’s no one more suitable than you are.

158
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,340
We need your power.

159
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,970
Your entire healing ability

160
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,570
will allow us to live peacefully with humans the way it has been.

161
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,470
But I still slip up.

162
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,790
It’s not too long.

163
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,990
The mission to protect the Golden Blood will be completed soon.

164
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,980
Then no one, even Nakan,

165
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,340
would be able to exploit the Golden Blood.

166
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,810
Hang in there just a little more.

167
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,250
You’re the only one I can trust.

168
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,380
What should I do next?

169
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,780
I’ll take care of him.

170
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,380
Alright, Mr. Mark.

171
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,080
Aunty Wan, can you smell something?

172
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,320
What smell?

173
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,220
Can we smell anything apart from blood, Mr. Mark?

174
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,970
Hey!

175
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,340
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t do anything to me?

176
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,630
And I haven’t.

177
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,620
Until you turn 21.

178
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,050
I will be taking care of you all the time.

179
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,380
Starting now.

180
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,270
What?

181
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,020
No.

182
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,630
I can take care of myself.

183
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,960
It’s obvious that you can’t.

184
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,210
No.

185
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,810
I’m not okay with this.

186
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,540
I wasn’t asking for your permission.

187
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,700
I was just telling you what’s going to happen.

188
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,849
Right now, there’s no place that’s safe for you.

189
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,940
You have to come with me.

190
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,150
Where do I have to go again?

191
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,510
Why do I have to go with you?

192
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,150
Hmm?

193
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,470
Because you made a mistake
and bled at our event.

194
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,170
I’m telling you straight,

195
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,730
I don’t even know who else is aware of this.

196
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,650
You might have become a target.

197
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,630
That’s just a ‘might’, though.

198
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,290
This is not a joke, Tong.

199
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,220
Fine.

200
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,860
I’ll take good care of myself.

201
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,710
Let me go home.

202
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,510
Promise I won’t tell anyone about what happened last night.

203
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,470
No.

204
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,530
Everything’s too dangerous right now.

205
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,110
I swear.

206
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,130
From now until I turn 21,

207
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,470
I won’t make myself bleed.

208
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,210
Okay?

209
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,290
No, you have to come live with me for now.

210
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,360
To live?

211
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,930
How can I live with someone I’ve just met?

212
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,460
We didn’t ‘just’ meet.

213
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,140
It’s been 20 years.

214
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,060
Easy for you to say that.

215
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,460
You were the only one following me around.

216
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,780
I don’t know you.

217
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,140
I’ve been trying to protect you for 20 years.

218
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,970
Making sure that nothing would happen to you.

219
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,880
You didn’t even have to know about my existence

220
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,190
but you ruined it because you showed up at that event.

221
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,430
You brought this on yourself.

222
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,930
Who would have known!

223
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,460
Now you know!

224
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,910
I’m asking for cooperation here.

225
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,510
Can I have that?

226
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,130
Fine.

227
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,620
But, can I pack up my stuff from the apartment first?

228
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,770
(What should I do?)

229
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,720
(A vampire?)

230
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,160
(A vampire should fear sunlight.)

231
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,120
(You’re done for!)

232
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,260
(Come on.)

233
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,780
(Come on out.)

234
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,580
(What?)

235
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,240
(The sunlight has nothing on him?)

236
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,730
(He keeps following me!)

237
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,450
(A granny.)

238
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,490
(Bingo!)

239
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,010
Granny!

240
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,500
May I help you?

241
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,310
Isn’t this heavy?

242
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,290
Let me help you too.

243
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,310
This bag as well.

244
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,710
Hey!

245
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,820
This way.

246
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,250
Thank you, boy.

247
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,860
Oh, where did your friend go?

248
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,310
To AIC University.

249
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,360
10 Baht.

250
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,630
Dang it.

251
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,110
I forgot to bring my wallet
and my phone.

252
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,200
I’ll have my friend pay for it once we arrive at the university.

253
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,850
Get off.

254
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,450
Out with you.

255
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,900
Sorry.

256
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,450
Hey!

257
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,740
How come you’re here?

258
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,890
Why didn't you tell me you wanted to hop on the bus?

259
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,430
Let’s go.

260
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,040
Your wallet and phone are in here.

261
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,390
I’ll give it back to you
after we’ve arrived at your apartment.

262
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,010
Do you know where my apartment is?

263
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,980
I’ve been watching you from afar for 20 years.

264
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,170
How would I not know?

265
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,620
Whatever it is about you

266
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,230
I know it all.

267
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,550
No way.

268
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,170
I don’t believe you.

269
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,690
Do you want to try testing it out?

270
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,100
But if I get it right, you have to stay put.

271
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,310
You do it.

272
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,780
Aw!

273
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,570
Come on, let me go.

274
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,720
Let’s get going.

275
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,390
Mister!

276
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,340
Give it to me already,

277
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,230
the bag.

278
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,850
Give it.

279
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,050
I need the keycard.

280
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,970
Let go already.

281
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,510
Hello, Mr. Somchai.

282
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,150
Oh, hello.

283
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,790
Excuse me, this is a student’s accommodation.

284
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,470
We don’t allow outsiders to enter.

285
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,470
Alright.

286
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,030
Kla!

287
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,230
Dude!

288
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,710
Hey there.

289
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,710
Where have you been last night?

290
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,970
You didn’t even answer my calls.

291
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,540
Hmm?

292
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,320
Hold on.

293
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,680
I have something to tell you.

294
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,170
I swear it’s the truth.

295
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,520
Alright, spill it.

296
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,280
I got kidnapped by a vampire last night.

297
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,790
A vampire?

298
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,360
For real!

299
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,390
Hold on, Tong.

300
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,370
Though you are my very best friend,

301
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,890
what you just told me is complete nonsense.

302
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,770
And I know where you were last night.

303
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,490
How did you know?

304
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,550
How can I not know?

305
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,210
Didn’t you disguise as me?

306
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,750
Then you managed to disappear.

307
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,400
They called and scolded me, obviously.

308
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,830
Shit.

309
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,310
I’m sorry.

310
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,090
I didn’t know things would blow up like this.

311
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,900
You’re ruining my name.

312
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,550
I’m so sorry, dude.

313
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,410
I’ll clean the toilet for you.

314
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,990
For a week!

315
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,030
There’s no need for that.

316
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,920
It’s good that you’re alright.

317
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,750
Next time,

318
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,740
let me know when you’re going somewhere.

319
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,350
You’re sick afterall.

320
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,870
Dude.

321
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,140
About my sickness,

322
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,830
I’ve learned that I’m not sick.

323
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,140
I’m well.

324
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,100
Wow, Tong!

325
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,770
You disappeared for a night

326
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,110
and learned 2 new things?!

327
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,990
One about a vampire,

328
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,270
and another about you not being sick.

329
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,380
What if you disappear for another night

330
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,120
and learn even more things?

331
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,470
If I were you

332
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,450
I wouldn’t believe it either.

333
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,730
Hey, go and get some rest.

334
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,940
I’ll get to work.

335
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,830
Alright?

336
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,810
And today,

337
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,830
stay at the apartment.

338
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,820
Don’t go anywhere,

339
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,710
got that?

340
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,130
WAYS TO TACKLE A VAMPIRE.

341
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,570
(Things that would weaken a vampire’s power is)

342
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,690
(a cross.)

343
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,990
(You can also use garlic, holy water, and light.)

344
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,190
Hey!

345
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,620
Mister!

346
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,530
How did you get in here?

347
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,870
Your balcony wasn’t locked.

348
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,500
Forget vampires,

349
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,500
had it been a thief and you’re done for.

350
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,260
What are these chopsticks for?

351
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,080
A cross!

352
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,360
Burn, doesn’t it?

353
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,510
Hey.

354
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,780
It’s working, right?

355
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,970
Don’t come any closer.

356
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,900
What are you doing?

357
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,200
That’s messy.

358
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,870
Don’t come any closer.

359
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,430
If you do,

360
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,850
I will swing this.

361
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,730
What is it?

362
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,330
Your towel.

363
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,160
Oh?!

364
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,300
Stop fooling around.

365
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,100
I’ll give you 10 minutes.

366
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,850
Why aren’t you scared of anything?

367
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,670
Everything was a conspiracy theory.

368
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,950
What’s that?

369
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,810
All that you’ve heard and seen

370
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,340
were made from our conspiracy theory.

371
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,170
We intentionally made humans have wrong perceptions about us.

372
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,180
That means

373
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,410
what they say about

374
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,390
vampires being scared of sunlight

375
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,230
and crosses…

376
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,210
Those are all said so that humans would think
we’re blood-sucking ghosts

377
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,200
who hide in the dark.

378
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,160
Those who

379
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,030
have a pale complexion,

380
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,810
big fangs,

381
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,080
and like to hunt at night?

382
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,000
That’s right.

383
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,070
What for, then?

384
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,410
So that we can live blending in with humans

385
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,590
without anyone noticing.

386
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,350
Then,

387
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,970
don’t you have anything you’re scared of?

388
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,330
Then where did the movies get it from?

389
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,750
So what is the truth and what is not?

390
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,470
That’s what we want.

391
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,650
For humans to be confused and keep wondering.

392
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,970
Are you done packing up?

393
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,450
Let’s not try to stall for time.

394
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,140
If you’re done then let’s go.

395
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,550
Mister.

396
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,350
I’m hungry.

397
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,970
Can I first get something to eat?

398
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,260
What do you want to eat?

399
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,680
I’ll order it for you.

400
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,680
By the way,

401
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,880
what can you eat?

402
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,880
I’ll have some tomato juice.

403
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,890
I see.

404
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,990
Is this another theory to trick me?

405
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,270
That vampires like to drink red drinks
that look like blood?

406
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,410
I can eat anything, actually.

407
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,410
It’s just that I can’t taste or smell anything.

408
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,860
Then why do you drink it?

409
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,590
I like the texture of it.

410
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,950
What smell?

411
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,990
Can we smell anything apart from blood, Mr. Mark?

412
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,750
Do you want to try this?

413
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,720
Can I try it?

414
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,200
Here.

415
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,590
Are you taking this guitar along?

416
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,450
Yeah.

417
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,600
Mister.

418
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,750
Can I sit down and play this guitar for a bit?

419
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,960
You do know that you have to come with me anyway, right?

420
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,540
I know.

421
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,390
I just want to play it for a second.

422
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,040
Please?

423
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,990
Alright.

424
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,130
Do you have a song you want to hear?

425
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,870
I’ll play it for you.

426
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,650
Any song’s fine.

427
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,400
Let me ask you something.

428
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,590
Is this guitar

429
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,490
a present from you?

430
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,370
Is that important?

431
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,300
If you want me to go with you

432
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,050
then you have to answer me first.

433
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,980
My duty is to protect your blood.

434
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,250
Ouch!

435
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,130
Hey!

436
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,050
Mister!

437
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,600
Tong.

438
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,380
Tong.

439
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,790
Mister!

440
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,570
What’s wrong?

441
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,010
Tong.

442
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,120
Run away.

443
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,610
Mister?

444
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,670
Run away!

445
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,670
That’s it, right?

446
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,190
That’s it.

447
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,990
I’ll take care of it.

448
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,530
Sir, I’m here to report a crime.

449
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,600
Calm down, boy.

450
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,660
Calm down then tell me about it.

451
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,050
Yes, sir.

452
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,720
Go on.

453
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,500
I was harmed

454
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,710
by a vampire.

455
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,050
A vampire?

456
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,300
Yes.

457
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,050
I know it’s hard to believe.

458
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,380
But the vampire,

459
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,070
Mark,

460
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,430
Mark Amarittrakul.

461
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,790
He drank my blood

462
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,310
and he said my blood is special blood

463
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,330
that causes vampires to fight to get it.

464
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,600
Believe me, officer!

465
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,030
His family are vampires.

466
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,940
They’ve been chasing after me since I was young.

467
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,560
We’ve only confronted each other now
because I was bleeding, officer.

468
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,300
He was trying to drink my blood!

469
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,050
Sergeant,

470
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,910
let's subdue the crackheads fighting case.

471
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,570
Yes, sir.

472
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,870
You’re done here.

473
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,070
You can go home now.

474
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,210
Officer!

475
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,790
Officer!

476
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,910
Wait a minute!

477
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,790
You’re reporting for being harmed?

478
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,480
Yes.

479
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,950
You said you were being chased after?

480
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:55,900
Yes.

481
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,010
Then wait for me in the room.

482
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,990
Follow me.

483
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,830
Wait for me inside.

484
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,480
This is already the second time, Mark.

485
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,780
Are you up for it?

486
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,910
Yes.

487
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
The Golden Blood is powerful indeed.

488
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,560
Even you who usually have great control over yourself

489
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,860
could get driven this far by it.

490
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,810
I will change the Golden Blood protector.

491
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,460
Miss Thara,

492
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,740
please give me another chance

493
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,620
to keep on carrying out this duty.

494
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,940
I heard you said you have the special blood

495
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,390
wanted by the vampires?

496
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,500
How delicious is your special blood compared to the others?

497
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,590
I…

498
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,950
I think I should wait for the other officer to come.

499
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,080
I was just asking according to the manual.

500
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,410
Just wanted to know

501
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,450
what’s so special about your “special blood”.

502
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,190
Does it smell sweeter?

503
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,440
Does it taste sweeter?

504
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,860
Or does it strengthen my power?

505
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,870
Just in time

506
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,190
that I haven't been feeling too well lately.

507
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,240
Ouch.

508
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,770
Aunty, I’m sorry.

509
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,860
- Are you okay?
- 	I’m fine.

510
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,890
Get out of the way!

511
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,330
Stop!

512
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,880
I said stop!

513
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,210
Boy.

514
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,970
You’d better come out.

515
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,170
Why are you wasting time by running?

516
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,150
It’s just a room with 4 walls.

517
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,050
Where can you escape to?

518
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,200
Stop!

519
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,660
Tong!

520
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,010
Hey!

521
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,930
Mister!

522
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,900
Mister!

523
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,020
Mister!

524
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,310
Mister!

525
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,090
Hey!

526
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,510
There’s blood everywhere.

527
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,870
Mister!

528
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,430
What should I do?

529
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,940
Didn’t you say you are immortal?

530
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,910
Mister!

531
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:46,800
Mister!

532
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,800
Blood…

533
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,030
Blood…

534
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,440
Mister!

535
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,490
Drink my blood.

536
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,120
My blood can heal you, right?

537
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,090
Here, Mister!

538
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,430
No.

539
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,310
Why not?

540
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,180
Even if I have to die

541
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,730
I will never drink your blood.

542
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,560
Why not?

543
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,080
Then what should I do?

544
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,790
Hey!

545
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,090
Mr. Mark!

546
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,500
Your wounds are gone.

547
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,700
You’re alright now, right?

548
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,510
Mister?

549
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,270
Hey!

550
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,490
Mister.

551
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,830
Are you alright?

552
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,720
(Can we smell anything apart from blood, Mr. Mark?)

553
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,170
You smell so nice.

554
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,300
Are you sure

555
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,790
you want to live here with me?

556
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,080
I'll live with you

557
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,550
until I turn 21.

558
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,570
Since you're the host,

559
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,690
I'll give you this dish.

560
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,450
Hey, what are you doing?

561
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,620
I'm measuring out your size.
