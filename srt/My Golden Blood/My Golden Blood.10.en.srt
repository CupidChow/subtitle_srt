Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,770
The infatuation Mark has for you

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,640
might be just
the power of the Golden Blood.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,520
Miss Thara asked me to break up with you

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,690
and I don’t want to break up with you.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,050
Even without the Golden Blood,

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,380
I will be with you.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,040
Pae is taking Tong somewhere.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,430
Watch out, Mark!

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,580
I bet she’s been hypnotized.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,290
Mark!

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Hurry up, Kla!

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,620
It's alright.

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,630
Mark!

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,720
Live on, my friend.

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,320
Kla!

20
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,280
Come visit us if you’re free,

21
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,870
Tonkla.

22
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,090
We’re not scared of you.

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,030
Without Tonkla,

24
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,860
we wouldn’t have become friends like this.

25
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,140
Without Tonkla,

26
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,560
I would have been alone right now.

27
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,600
You have us now, Tong.

28
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,500
Come on, guys.

29
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,500
If he sees that we’re sad,

30
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,660
he won't rest in peace.

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,829
Show him some smiles.

32
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,400
Thank you so much for coming.

33
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,980
Yes.

34
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Thank you.

35
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,180
Miss.

36
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,900
Tong.

37
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,290
Have some.

38
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,470
Thank you.

39
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,660
Thanks for organizing this funeral for Tonkla.

40
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,920
It’s totally alright.

41
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,730
It's thanks to Mr. Mark and Miss Thara

42
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,200
for being our sponsor.

43
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,510
They’ve been so kind to Tong and Tonkla.

44
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,120
You have to return their favors

45
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,740
by studying hard and working hard, got it?

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,780
Yes, Miss.

47
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,620
This reminds me

48
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,640
of when you guys were young.

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
When you and Tonkla

50
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,630
used to make sandwiches for the boys at the orphanage.

51
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,380
No, not that one.

52
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,380
Nah, just add that.

53
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,470
Top it off.

54
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,010
Hmm!

55
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,940
Friends have to share.

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,660
Here.

57
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,810
I thank you for taking care of Tonkla all along.

58
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,980
It’s Tonkla who has been looking out for me all these times.

59
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,870
Sometimes, he even cares too much about me.

60
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,900
From now on, live well, Tong.

61
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,380
Yes, Miss.

62
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,830
Eat some.

63
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,070
I’m not hungry.

64
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
You keep telling others to eat

65
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,070
but you’re not eating anything at all.

66
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,610
Eat some.

67
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,460
I don’t want to eat.

68
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,200
I don’t feel like eating.

69
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,570
Tong.

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,280
Cry it out.

71
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,770
When humans are sad,

72
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,360
they must cry it out, don’t they?

73
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,510
I’m afraid I won't be able to stop.

74
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,740
I don’t want to be weak in front of Kla.

75
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,500
Now no one will see.

76
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,200
You can let it out now.

77
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,900
This stuff,

78
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,060
just bring all of them along.

79
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,040
You don’t have to throw them away.

80
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,350
I have lots of space in my penthouse.

81
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,020
Can I

82
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,540
sleep here tonight?

83
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,700
May I be with you?

84
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,160
Humans are too fragile.

85
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,500
Death must have been so painful for them.

86
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,930
You looking out and caring about Tong is a good thing.

87
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,870
It seems like you two didn’t follow my words.

88
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,920
Me and Tong

89
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,140
will try to keep some distance like you said.

90
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,660
How well do you think you know this ‘love’
that you have just known, Mark?

91
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,310
The feeling you have now

92
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,150
is because you were infatuated with the Golden Blood.

93
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,560
If one day, the power of the Golden Blood wanes away,

94
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,640
you will fall out of love within the blink of an eye.

95
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,840
Don’t you think so?

96
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,460
It’s up to you to decide.

97
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,620
Have a think about it yourself.

98
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,180
Any progress on Nakan?

99
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,170
We’re looking for him.

100
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,580
We haven’t found him yet.

101
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,120
It’s a shame that my power is too weak

102
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
that I can’t see where he’s hiding.

103
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,320
You don’t have to worry, Miss Thara.

104
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,020
No matter what,

105
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,640
I will find him.

106
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,540
The others have been captured

107
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,340
except for us who are here.

108
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,200
How long until I recover?

109
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,180
It’s going to take around 3 days.

110
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,980
We have to escape before tomorrow night.

111
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,500
Otherwise, all of us will be dead.

112
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,560
All these

113
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,720
are my collectibles

114
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,500
These are more than all my life’s belongings.

115
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,480
That’s only normal.

116
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,350
I’ve been living over a hundred years longer than you.

117
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,940
This is not too much.

118
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,140
You can put your stuff here too.

119
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,740
So it can become our room.

120
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,710
What’s this notebook?

121
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,960
It’s my diary.

122
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,980
Do you have any secrets I can’t know about?

123
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,410
There are no secrets.

124
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
If you want to know anything just ask,

125
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,700
I will tell you.

126
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,820
Nah.

127
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,080
It hits different.

128
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,080
Let’s do this.

129
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,600
Read it later.

130
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,820
Come with me for now.

131
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,390
Where are we going again?

132
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,860
Just come.

133
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,570
A smell of roses?

134
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,120
Did I forget our monthsary?

135
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,690
Or are there any special occasions?

136
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,210
No.

137
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,400
I heard that humans

138
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,290
use smells to relax.

139
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,100
I used to not understand it

140
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,980
but I think I do now.

141
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I thought they said aromas help with relaxation.

142
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,120
The chaos that happened

143
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
was because of my Golden Blood.

144
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,060
Without me,

145
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,780
Nakan wouldn't have hurt people.

146
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,420
Tonkla wouldn't have…

147
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,550
Tong,

148
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,160
stop blaming yourself.

149
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,440
Tomorrow, I will squeeze the truth out of Nakan’s man.

150
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,440
Mark,

151
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,920
can I come with you?

152
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,620
It’s too much of a risk.

153
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,200
Are you not worried about me

154
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,890
and want me to be within your sight all the time?

155
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,540
It’s because I am worried about you.

156
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,320
That’s why I want you to stay here.

157
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,619
I think Nakan doesn’t dare lay a hand on me.

158
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,780
When I was kidnapped by Nakan,

159
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,780
he wanted to drink my blood

160
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,260
but he didn’t.

161
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,980
It’s like he’s waiting for something.

162
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,730
I think there’s more to it.

163
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,140
I want to know what Nakan actually wants.

164
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
Please, Mark?

165
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,540
You have to be within my sight all the time.

166
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,960
I know

167
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,550
that you will always protect me, Mark.

168
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,380
You’d better tell me straight,

169
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,720
where is Nakan?

170
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,830
Yes, sir.

171
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,150
Would you like to sit at my office for a bit?

172
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,450
It’s alright.

173
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,200
Are you not going to say it?

174
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,400
You’re forcing me to do this.

175
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,280
Mark.

176
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,390
I think

177
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,600
I know a way.

178
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,780
Let me try something.

179
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,140
Trust me.

180
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,760
Tong!

181
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,290
Trust in me.

182
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Tell me where Nakan is

183
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,850
and I’ll let you try the Golden Blood.

184
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,510
Tong.

185
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,140
Just tell me where he is.

186
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,200
Tong, stop it.

187
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,890
Tell me where Nakan is!

188
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,950
That’s enough, Tong!

189
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,930
Tong!

190
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Tell me!

191
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,370
I’m telling you now!

192
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,630
Nakan is at the residence in Khao Yai!

193
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,930
Give me the blood!

194
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,510
Don’t ever do such a risky thing again.

195
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,080
Especially with Nakan,
let us deal with it.

196
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,620
But I’m really alright.

197
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,150
You have to remain the safest!

198
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,620
You know how much you mean to us.

199
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,960
These are the documents about Nakan’s purchase of lands in Khao Yai.

200
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,960
I will send some men with you to hunt Nakan down.

201
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,960
Take this and try to come up with a plan.

202
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,790
Yes.

203
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,180
While I’m away,

204
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,340
who’s going to take care of Tong?

205
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,770
Seriously?

206
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,170
You want me to move in and live with Miss Thara?

207
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,460
Your Mother?

208
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,260
Think of it as living with your Mother-in-law.

209
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,140
To think of any house you could live in right now,

210
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,840
it would have to be Miss Thara’s

211
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,900
that I can trust the most.

212
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,620
Let’s swap.

213
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,800
I’ll wear your shirt

214
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,610
and you wear mine.

215
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,650
So that I can feel like you’re with me all the time.

216
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,580
You’re pretty romantic.

217
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,940
I know.

218
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,060
Then

219
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,530
can you put it on for me?

220
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,070
Come on.

221
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,800
Quit fooling around.

222
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,040
That’s enough.

223
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
This will be your armor.

224
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,370
So that every time you feel scared,

225
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
you will think of me.

226
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,000
You brought that too?

227
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,920
Well, that day,

228
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,050
a certain someone did a surprise for me

229
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
so I couldn’t finish it.

230
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,930
You have lots of free time in hand while you're here

231
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,860
I suggest you write a diary.

232
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,840
I don’t know what to write.

233
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,630
My life’s boring.

234
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,760
Boring?

235
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,480
Both about the Golden Blood

236
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,470
and about our presence,

237
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,500
aren’t there enough materials to write about?

238
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,940
Then why don’t you write when you miss me?

239
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,750
I will come back and read every word.

240
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,440
Do you want me to be writing all day long?

241
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,400
Does joking around like this

242
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,650
mean that you've loosened up a bit now?

243
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,260
Maybe a bit.

244
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,620
Why didn't you come in if you've already arrived?

245
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,490
Hello.

246
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
You’re here too?

247
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
I’m just seeing him off.

248
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,640
I’m leaving soon.

249
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,660
You should have known

250
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,040
what the most important thing right now is, Mark.

251
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,100
Hurry up and go.

252
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes.

253
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,760
Follow me, Tong.

254
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
This is Mark’s old bedroom.

255
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,420
You’re fine with it right, Tong?

256
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,650
Yes, no problem.

257
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,920
Mark will be okay, right?

258
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,060
I’ve sent some good people with Mark.

259
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,710
You don’t have to worry.

260
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,900
Make yourself at home.

261
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,240
Take care of “Gluay”.

262
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,610
Hmm?

263
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,390
This guy

264
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,640
is "Gluay"?

265
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,330
He's Mark's first cat.

266
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,860
He found him at the orphanage.

267
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,000
This is Mark’s father.

268
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,700
He passed away long ago.

269
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,820
Humans have a limited lifespan.

270
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,180
But we’re immortals.

271
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,370
An intimate relationship like that

272
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,340
would only cause misery to the one who has to live on.

273
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,660
Have some rest, and make yourself at home.

274
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,070
If there’s anything, come and find me at my study.

275
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,700
Yes.

276
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,760
Humans and vampires are impossible

277
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,700
but it has already happened.

278
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,780
Isn’t that right, Gluay?

279
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,110
Isn’t that right?

280
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,580
The report didn’t say exactly where his residence is.

281
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,100
Let’s divide and find him.

282
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,900
If you find him, call me immediately.

283
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,100
Did you call me in?

284
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,800
Have a seat.

285
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,720
Our medical center is about to send some exchange students abroad.

286
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,370
It's a non-conditional scholarship, with no limit on the field of study.

287
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,370
I think it would be a suitable scholarship for you.

288
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,900
For me?

289
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,850
Why?

290
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,940
Because you’re already ready.

291
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,000
You also have a dream of living your life freely, right?

292
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,820
Next month?

293
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
I think it’s too sudden.

294
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,300
I thought you would need time to adjust.

295
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,300
So I moved the date closer.

296
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,100
And

297
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,420
you want me to go alone?

298
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,470
When I had to take over the company,

299
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,560
it was hard doing everything by myself.

300
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,280
There was no one among us that I could trust.

301
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,330
Until I met that boy.

302
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,630
The one I want to pass on the power of this kingdom to

303
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,000
if anything would ever happen to me.

304
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,560
So Mark won’t be able to go with you, Tong.

305
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,580
I’m sorry, it’s time for my medicine.

306
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,780
Have a read through the details of the scholarship.

307
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,990
I know that the relationship between a vampire and a human is hard.

308
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,580
I also don’t want to go against your words

309
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,000
since you’ve been doing everything for me all along.

310
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,310
I really can’t take this scholarship.

311
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,600
Being stubborn like this

312
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
is not good for either of you.

313
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,630
I will prove to you

314
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,760
that I’m good enough.

315
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,190
I won’t cause anyone any trouble.

316
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,590
I want to be with Mark until the last day.

317
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,620
Yours

318
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,890
or Mark’s?

319
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,510
Miss Thara.

320
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,430
Things that I’ve never thought would exist,

321
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,280
about the vampires,

322
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,520
the immortal lives,

323
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,500
the Golden Blood,

324
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,940
they’ve all happened.

325
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,960
I don’t know what my future with Mark would be like

326
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,660
but I know that I want to be with him.

327
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,920
I don’t want to be away from him.

328
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,380
Regardless of whether

329
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,660
you agree with it or not.

330
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,260
Yes, Miss Thara.

331
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,840
Right now?

332
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
I’ve talked to both of you

333
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,930
about the fact that you guys are dating.

334
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,980
I told you guys to break up.

335
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,120
But it seems that both of you
didn't give much thought to what I said.

336
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,090
Sorry, Miss Thara

337
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,160
but I can’t do it.

338
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,730
Even when you know that dating each other

339
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,970
would only bring misery, despair, and loneliness,

340
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,770
you still insist on dating Tong?

341
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,140
Yes, Miss.

342
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,990
Even if I send Tong abroad to study,

343
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,460
you will also follow him, Mark?

344
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,390
You might have other people in your life, Miss Thara.

345
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,150
But in Tong’s life, there’s only me.

346
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,150
I might have disappointed our people

347
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,140
but I don’t want to disappoint Tong.

348
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,139
I still don't agree with this

349
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,770
but if you bring Nakan to justice according to our rules,

350
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,600
I will let you guys meet

351
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,260
and we’ll talk about this again.

352
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
If I manage to bring Nakan to justice,

353
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,040
you will accept us, right?

354
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,340
- But capturing Nakan is dangerous…
- Then so be it.

355
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,280
I’m willing to.

356
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,300
No matter what, I’ll get Nakan.

357
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,989
If you can really do it,

358
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,320
I will hear you guys’ wishes out.

359
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,580
But if not,

360
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,510
then this conversation never happened.

361
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,340
Thank you, Miss Thara.

362
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,810
There’s no need to frown like that.

363
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,270
Relax, Tong.

364
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,160
How can I not

365
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,560
be worried?

366
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,760
We don’t know how many of Nakan’s men are still out there.

367
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,280
I’ll be back as soon as possible.

368
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Trust in me.

369
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,450
You’re the only one I have left, Mark.

370
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,170
Can you promise me

371
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,640
that you will be safe?

372
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,210
We never break promises.

373
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,430
You should stay put at home

374
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,080
and please take care of Gluay.

375
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,430
Don’t worry.

376
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,960
Come back quickly.

377
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,390
Alright, Gluay?

378
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,630
Then I’ll get going.

379
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,050
Almost there.

380
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,530
Everyone standby.

381
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,960
[First day at the orphanage. 7 Months old. A cheerful and healthy good boy.]

382
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,880
[Tong at 8 with the birthday cake he likes.]

383
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,750
[Tong, 10 years old. He gets along well with friends.
He’s kind and is loved by his friends.]

384
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,750
[Tong, 17. He’s now interested in sports. Basketball is his favorite.]

385
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,610
He took all these?

386
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,540
[Tong, 20 years old. This year is when Tong’s going to become a college student
and move to Bangkok to study.]

387
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,380
[Tong, 21 years old.]

388
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,170
On my 21st birthday, my Golden Blood will be gone

389
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,540
And everything will be over.

390
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,250
I want to be the family
who stays with Mark all the way to the last day.

391
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,380
Go and check over there.

392
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,150
Gluay!

393
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:00,900
Where’s he going?

394
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,010
Hey.

395
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,250
Stop it.

396
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,770
With such a wound,

397
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,860
you won’t be able to get away.

398
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,810
Let go!

399
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,070
Stop using the Golden Blood in your filthy plans.

400
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,860
“Filthy plans”?

401
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,180
What does that mean?

402
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,480
I’ll never let you hurt Tong or Miss Thara ever again.

403
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,040
Miss Thara

404
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,430
is using you as an obedient slave.

405
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,490
Don’t you ever wonder

406
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,570
why she has you watch over the Golden Blood?

407
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,060
I don’t need to know the reasons.

408
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,850
Do you think I wanted power and all those bullshit positions?

409
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,180
You’re wrong.

410
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,130
What I want the most

411
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,110
and what I've wanted for hundreds of years
is to get rid of Thara.

412
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,900
The one who wants to turn the Golden Blood
into an elixir of life for herself.

413
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,900
Thank you so much, Miss Thara,

414
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
for getting me this present from a foreign land.

415
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,770
You don’t have to thank me.

416
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,160
It’s me

417
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,090
who should thank you.

418
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,630
She says she’s protecting the human with the Golden Blood

419
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,040
but in the end,

420
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,350
Thara is keeping the Golden Blood alive

421
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,240
not to protect

422
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,910
but to kill them when they turn 21.

423
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,050
Because the power you get from the Golden Blood

424
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,050
allows you to kill the others among us.

425
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,070
That’s how Thara stepped up as the new leader.

426
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,660
But the more she uses the power,

427
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,390
the more her body deteriorates.

428
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,740
She wants the Golden Blood again.

429
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,330
(On the night of the 21st year,)

430
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,300
(the ability of the Golden Blood will have ripened.)

431
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,880
(The power of the blood will be awakened completely.)

432
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,370
(Whoever tastes the blood)

433
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,590
(will have the power over all the vampires)

434
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,560
(and will be capable of destroying the vampire’s immortality.)

435
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,590
Help!

436
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,070
Miss Thara!

437
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,570
Miss Thara!

438
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,010
Help me, Miss Thara!

439
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,350
Think carefully, Mark.

440
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,850
Think about those with the Golden Blood when they’ve turned 21.

441
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,460
Where have they gone?

442
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,810
Where have those humans gone?

443
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,740
If the Golden Blood was so dangerous

444
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,650
then why didn’t Thara announce it
and has everyone protected them?

445
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,980
Everything

446
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,250
was for the safety…

447
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,690
The safety of what?

448
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,170
Or is she afraid that it would be taken away?

449
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,880
She chose you because you were the most obedient one.

450
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,430
Let me tell you something

451
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,780
once the Golden Blood turns full 21,

452
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,170
Tong’s done for.

453
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,800
Miss Thara!

454
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,180
Miss Thara.

455
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,250
What’s this?

456
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,170
Sorry.

457
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,430
You were not born to become anyone’s family.

458
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,430
You were born for me.

459
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,480
Miss Thara.

460
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,260
I don't know if there's a god

461
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,680
or any holy beings in this world.

462
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,290
But I’m grateful

463
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,100
that I get to know Tong.

464
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,720
I’m grateful

465
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,460
for making a non-human without a heart like me

466
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,250
know love.

467
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,890
A human like me

468
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,990
will die someday.

469
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,270
I don’t want you to be sad later on.

470
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,330
Tong.

471
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,380
I would have been even more sad

472
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,690
if I didn’t get a chance to meet you

473
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,510
while living this immortal life

474
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,990
You were not born to become anyone’s family.

475
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,210
You were born for me.

476
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,140
Once Tong turns 21 years old,

477
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,370
he’s done for.

478
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,070
This is Tong’s last chance.

479
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,070
You have to get rid of Thara.

480
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,750
Help!

481
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,550
Help me!

482
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,940
Mark will come back and save me.

483
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,810
He will learn all the truth.

484
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,850
You think Mark’s going to believe what you say?
