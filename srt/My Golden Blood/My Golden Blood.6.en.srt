1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,530
Characters, actions, places, occupations,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,800
and events in this series are fictional and
created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,500
They are not intended to urge or promote
any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,010
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,610
What if the person who kissed you

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,190
says that they kissed you
because they were spellbound.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,400
No feelings involved.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,300
And that makes the person
being kissed frustrated.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,760
What do you think the reason is?

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,900
Because you have feelings for that person.

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,450
I’ve never seen him like this before.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,960
I can’t explain it either.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,820
Is the love between us and humans

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,210
even possible?

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,610
If it’s bitter then why don’t you drink some water?

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,500
Here.

17
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,150
I forgot that I can taste flavors again now.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,070
Over the past 100 years,

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
I’ve never felt this way before.

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,110
“Felt this way”?

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,170
All the feelings have changed.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,860
My body

23
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,000
and…

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,400
And…?

25
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,490
My heart.

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,180
You’ve been reading lots of
novels lately, aren’t you?

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,100
Tong,

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,070
I’m serious.

29
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,880
All these time,

30
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,220
I’ve been so scared of changes.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,600
Everything that has to do with my body.

32
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,710
I’m scared to have feelings.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,640
I’m scared to have desires.

34
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,419
I’m scared of becoming more human.

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,490
But now I know

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,790
that I’m not afraid of anything.

37
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,220
As long as I get to be with you.

38
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,829
To take care of you

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,100
and protect you.

40
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,500
To take care of me and protect me

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,070
as what?

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,510
A bodyguard?

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,620
As a bodyguard

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,180
and in other statuses too.

45
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,970
As a bodyguard should be enough, no?

46
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,000
Why, Tong?

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,700
Our feelings are aligned now, aren’t we?

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,190
Isn’t that too easy?

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,180
Then why should it be hard?

50
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,710
You have to show me

51
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,200
that you’re not just a bodyguard.

52
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,420
Also,

53
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,330
we’re still staying an arm’s length apart.

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,530
An arm’s length?

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,050
We’ve been

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,780
even closer.

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,970
Alright,

58
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,010
we’re going to continue
about Gods and Love today.

59
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,230
Last week, we talked about Eros…

60
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,950
Didn’t you say you guys made up?

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,250
Or did you and Mark…

62
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,130
fight?

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,160
What?

64
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,580
No?

65
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,310
I wasn’t listening.

66
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,510
What did you just say?

67
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,070
I asked if you guys fought.

68
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,350
That’s why you’re so cold to each other.

69
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,340
Yeah, that’s right.

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,060
I knew it.

71
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,670
Why did you guys fight

72
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,130
that make you sit so far away from each other?

73
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,620
Hmm?

74
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,840
No bodyguards do this,

75
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,100
Mr. Mark.

76
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,800
We did even more,

77
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,810
Tong.

78
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,370
How can you call me that?

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,060
You have to call me “Mister”.

80
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,650
But…

81
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,400
Don’t think of fighting your master,
Mr. Bodyguard.

82
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,900
I wasn’t even thinking of fighting.

83
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,840
If I really do,

84
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,900
a pillow wouldn’t stop me.

85
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,930
That’s true.

86
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,600
Did I scare you?

87
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,700
No.

88
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,150
Tong.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,659
Nothing will be able to harm you,

90
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,630
not even me

91
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,640
or Nakan.

92
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,800
What if we run into Nakan at school again?

93
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,870
Well,

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,040
we have to act as normal as possible.

95
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,640
But I can’t be close to Tong…

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,600
“Mister”.

97
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,370
I can’t be too close to Mr. Tong like before.

98
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,570
Because I’m afraid that Nakan would know
that you’re the one I’m protecting.

99
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,470
Then from now on,

100
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,920
we stay 2-arm’s length apart.

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,140
That wouldn't be necessary, isn’t it?

102
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,000
You said it yourself.

103
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,580
“For my own safety”.

104
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,700
So are we going with that?

105
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,940
So what did you guys fight over?

106
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,900
Why are you taking so long to think?

107
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,620
I see.

108
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,330
I see!

109
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,170
I figured it out now.

110
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,909
About the research.

111
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,100
Yeah, right.

112
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,300
I knew it.

113
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,170
I should have this skill with lotto too.

114
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,910
For example, Poseidon.

115
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,890
He’s been adapted into lots of literary works.

116
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,010
He’s been interpreted in many different forms.

117
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,850
I want you to read, interpret,

118
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,340
and hand it in to me as
an assignment for next week.

119
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,530
(Even though)

120
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,100
(the rain has worn out
but it’s still pouring a little.)

121
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,950
(It’s kind of going away.)

122
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,940
Hey, the due date is next week

123
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,890
but you’re starting already?

124
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,120
So diligent.

125
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,039
I’ve never been to the sea.

126
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,800
Shouldn’t we do a little research
when doing a report?

127
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,670
You’ve never been there either, right?

128
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,800
Yeah.

129
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
I’ll get on with the practice.

130
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,420
Alright.

131
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,530
Tong.

132
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,600
You’ve never been to the beach?

133
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,910
Yeah.

134
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,960
Kids like us never get to go on trips anywhere.

135
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,000
Then shall we go to the beach?

136
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,730
Didn’t you say we have to keep some distance?

137
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,240
That’s right but this is for the project.

138
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,400
It’s an exception.

139
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,640
I want to go

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
but better not.

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,790
It’s a waste of money.

142
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,380
I’ll take care of that.

143
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,140
I said better not.

144
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,160
Then let’s do this,

145
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,510
if you can get all my friends to go

146
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,850
then I might change my mind.

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,570
That’s a piece of cake.

148
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,260
Under a condition that

149
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,700
you can not ask them directly
and not buy them things.

150
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,870
Don’t use money to solve all your problems,

151
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,300
Mr. Bodyguard.

152
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,940
Guys, guys, guys!

153
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,420
Check your phones.

154
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,170
- Quickly, Dome!
- What’s up?

155
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,030
- Quickly, Pupae, you too.
- What’s up?

156
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,910
Did you get it too?

157
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,230
Did you get it?

158
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,940
I got it too!

159
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,780
Yeah?

160
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,230
- Yeah, here it is.
- Tong, take a look!

161
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,550
Where did you get this?

162
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,010
There’s a booth in front of the university
and I played their games.

163
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,610
You’re amazing Tonkla!

164
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,900
Wow, it’s 5 stars!

165
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,840
You finally did it, huh.

166
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,130
Aren’t we so lucky?

167
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,940
Don’t you act innocent.

168
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,500
It’d be even better

169
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,210
if I get to sleep in the same room with you.

170
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,200
I bought you some clothes

171
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,650
it’s a great fit for the beach.

172
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,540
Well, no one could ever tell
that you’re going to the beach.

173
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,170
Nice shirt.

174
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,060
Can I get changed?

175
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,810
Hop on.

176
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,040
Make yourself at home.

177
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,810
Then me and Pae will sit at the back.

178
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,440
Can you open the trunk? I’ll put my stuff in.

179
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,760
- So then–
- Hey, Tong, can I sit in the front?

180
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,040
I get motion sickness.

181
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,050
I really can’t do it.

182
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,140
Alright, I will just sit at the back.

183
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,050
Okay, thanks, dude.

184
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,380
Come on.

185
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,800
2-arm’s length according to the rules.

186
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,130
Hello.

187
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,650
Hello.

188
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,580
Wow!

189
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,740
This place is huge.

190
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,690
Huge indeed.

191
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,440
So pretty.

192
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,540
This is all thanks to your luck, Big guy Tonkla!

193
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,460
Not a sweat!

194
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,420
Are you really thankful?

195
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,290
I am, I am.

196
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,460
No need for that, brother.

197
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,870
My luck happens to be super good.

198
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,380
Are you ready?

199
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,350
I’m ready.

200
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,200
You’ve got the suits?

201
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,970
Yup.

202
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,710
Oh, okay.

203
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,820
Wow!

204
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,020
So big!

205
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,620
So beautiful!

206
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,150
- This is gorgeous!
- That’s right.

207
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,770
Tonkla, you go ahead and pick the room.

208
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,120
Let’s have the voucher owner choose first.

209
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,850
Me and Pae can sleep in any room.

210
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,380
What about the room on the left?

211
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,610
That’s the biggest one.

212
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,410
You can sleep alone without sharing your bed.

213
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:36,960
Alright.

214
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,160
I’ll sleep with Tong.

215
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,200
I’m sacrificing for you.

216
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,560
You’ve been driving a long way

217
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,740
so you can sleep alone
without sharing your bed.

218
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,470
It’s alright.

219
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,230
I’m fine.

220
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,100
Just go with what you want.

221
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,670
It’s really alright.

222
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,460
Why would you want to share a bed with anyone?

223
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,320
Okay.

224
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,030
Okay.

225
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,260
- Let’s go.
- Let’s move.

226
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,950
Then I’ll take the room inside.

227
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,720
See you. I’ll get unpacked.

228
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,510
Are you filming an MV or something,

229
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,560
Mr. Bodyguard?

230
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,860
I’m waiting for the heroine to my MV.

231
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,350
What heroine?

232
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,810
I’m the hero too.

233
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,050
Then lie down right here, Mr. Hero.

234
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,020
Were you in such a hurry to see me?

235
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,360
Hurry?

236
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,110
Hey.

237
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,810
If we watch the sunset here tomorrow,

238
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,600
wouldn’t we get a clear view of it?

239
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,580
Hey,

240
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,660
are you annoyed by me or something?

241
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,590
Nothing.

242
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,720
It's just that things didn’t go as planned.

243
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,680
That’s what they called annoyed.

244
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,940
I wanted things to be even more perfect.

245
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,530
Things are perfect right now.

246
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,100
It’s actually the opposite.

247
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,900
I think it can be better.

248
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,589
Isn’t it good right now?

249
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,800
It’s actually very nice.

250
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,859
You didn’t think this place
would be beautiful, right?

251
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,080
It’s probably “perfectly imperfect”.

252
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,610
Beauty and perfection

253
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,160
can stem from imperfection sometimes.

254
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,570
So do you like it?

255
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,430
I do.

256
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,200
I wasn’t talking about the trip.

257
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,990
I’m so sleepy, Mr. Bodyguard.

258
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,640
Shall we hit the hay?

259
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,930
Just a moment.

260
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,700
Can I be here just for a bit longer?

261
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,680
Please?

262
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,070
Okay.

263
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,100
Hey.

264
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
Let me ask you something.

265
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,000
When we’re together,

266
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,020
is there anything I should watch out for?

267
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,460
What do you mean?

268
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,070
You once told me

269
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,680
that even my sweat has an impact on you.

270
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,930
So I was wondering

271
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,220
what I should do so that it would be
easier for you to be around me.

272
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,900
I still stand my ground.

273
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,530
There’s nothing you should be cautious about.

274
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,740
No matter what happens,

275
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,320
I will endure it.

276
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,750
Better keep your ground, Mr. Bodyguard.

277
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,450
Would you like to test it out?

278
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,110
I can’t believe you wore the shirt inside out.

279
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,510
Must have been running to see me.

280
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,200
Stop making fun of me.

281
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,690
I wasn’t in a hurry.

282
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,420
♪ Would you please stay with me like this for a long time? ♪

283
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,290

Good night.

291
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,100
Are you trying to test me?

292
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,920
Have you got my clothes washed?

293
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,940
Didn’t you say you can endure it?

294
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,830
What did you think I was going to do?

295
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,960
Good night.

296
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,600
Right.

297
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,010
Try this bread.

298
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,560
You’re suddenly health-conscious?

299
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
Do you think you’re funny?
Didn’t think I would have known?

300
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,250
Go and get yours. Go!

301
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,670
I’ll get some bread.

302
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,050
You’re about to toast the bread?

303
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,500
Oh, that’s right.

304
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,860
Then I’ll sell it to you.

305
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,700
2 Baht.

306
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,760
2 Baht?

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,240
That’s so cheap!

308
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,050
Can I have 2?

309
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,200
Okay.

310
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,630
Here you go.

311
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,920
Thank you. You’re so kind.

312
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,500
Let me pay you.

313
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,710
What’s your name?

314
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,100
I’m Meena. What's yours?

315
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,330
I’m Tong.

316
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,900
Thank you, Meena.

317
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,800
Meena, are you bothering him?

318
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,550
Not at all.

319
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,900
I was buying some toast from Meena’s bakery.

320
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,210
Let’s go back to our table.

321
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,030
Let’s play again, Tong.

322
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,000
Okay.

323
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,710
I’ll be waiting.

324
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,550
Yes, bye-bye.

325
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,110
Bye-bye!

326
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,720
Let’s go.

327
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,640
Wow! I want to dive in already!

328
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,800
Hurry along!

329
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,410
Alright.

330
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,910
Where’s Mark?

331
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,300
Is he not going to join us?

332
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,380
Woah!

333
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,330
Nice timing.

334
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,800
Come here.

335
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,630
Help me choose my speedo.

336
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,820
Which one do you like?

337
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,660
They’re the same color.

338
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,600
Doesn’t matter which one.

339
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,140
They’re in different shades.

340
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,100
Tell me which one you like.

341
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,120
This one,

342
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,700
this one,

343
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,680
or this one?

344
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,570
I’ll compare it for you.

345
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,330
What about this?

346
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,110
That one.

347
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,940
This one?

348
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:27,880
Okay.

349
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,770
Hey! Hold on.

350
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,930
What’s wrong?

351
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,930
I’m taking it out and putting
the new one on for you to see.

352
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,370
The old one’s fine.

353
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:38,920
I’ll...

354
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,270
get going.

355
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,650
Come out when you’re done.

356
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,800
Mister.

357
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,210
I can’t reach my back.

358
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,510
Would you put it on for me?

359
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,530
Here.

360
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,810
Go on.

361
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,810
Done.

362
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,540
Mister.

363
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:48,940
Thank you.

364
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,600
If that was your test,

365
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,180
I would say that it was a breeze.

366
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,140
Why is it so hot today?

367
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,390
If you do this,

368
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,350
what would you do if I can’t hold back?

369
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,610
But sorry,

370
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,410
your plan failed.

371
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,200
This is like an accelerator.

372
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,900
If you press here, it goes flying forward.

373
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,000
Not too fast.

374
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Isn’t it like driving a motorbike?

375
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,050
Shouldn’t be too hard.

376
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,730
Have you driven a motorbike before, Tong?

377
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,420
Never.

378
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,940
But I’ve seen it.

379
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,360
It’s not the same.

380
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,040
You’re a newbie

381
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,470
so you need a teacher.

382
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,330
Then,

383
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,650
teach me, Teacher Mark.

384
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,950
That will need a trade-off.

385
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,730
What is it this time?

386
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,860
From now on,

387
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,500
you should stop calling me “Mister”.

388
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,730
Call me by my name instead.

389
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,820
Mark.

390
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,040
Would you please
teach me how to ride a jetski?

391
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,410
If you say this,

392
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,340
you won’t get to get off the jetski.

393
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,450
Mister!

394
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,010
The sun is so big.

395
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,950
Mark.

396
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,400
The sun is so big.

397
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,180
So that you won’t forget
that you came here with me.

398
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,000
I’ll probably forget soon.

399
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,000
I think I know a way.

400
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,970
Shall we go ahead and get washed up, Tong?

401
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,300
The class is over.

402
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,520
So the deal is off.

403
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,000
So cruel, Tong.

404
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,900
That’s enough.

405
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,200
You will slip that out when we’re with friends.

406
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,950
What’s wrong?

407
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,810
Are you shy?

408
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,700
I’m not talking to you anymore.

409
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,420
Better get washed up and eat.

410
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,970
Then shall the two of us
wash up at the same time?

411
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,660
Fine.

412
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,770
But you can get washed up outside.

413
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,510
I’ll definitely lock the door.

414
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,220
Tong!

415
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,830
- Oh!
- Over here.

416
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,730
Our table is over there.

417
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,950
Didn’t you say the buffet is over?

418
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,410
It is.

419
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,810
But the hotel is giving out
free drinks tonight.

420
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,510
What a stroke of luck!

421
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,520
Really?

422
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,140
Yeah.

423
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,000
That’s cool.

424
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,100
You’re really one with luck.

425
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,100
I’m treating you with my luck today, then.

426
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,170
Look at that.

427
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,390
So pretty.

428
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,220
Wow.

429
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,300
Hey, hey, hey.

430
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,250
Enough watching.

431
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,210
Let’s raise our glasses.

432
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,750
- Cheers!
- Bring it in!

433
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,740
Come on.

434
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,430
How can you drink water?

435
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,280
How can you drink water
when you’re on a trip?

436
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,780
Here.

437
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,110
Just a bit. Give it a try.

438
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,700
Try. Just a little sip.

439
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,600
Just a bit.

440
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,710
No, I’m not drinking.

441
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,810
Come on! You’re on a trip!

442
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,860
Hey, then let’s do this.

443
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,300
Let’s play a game.

444
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,300
The loser has to drink a shot.

445
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,530
Okay!

446
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,070
No turning down.

447
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,790
You have to play.

448
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,540
Here, I’ll get the setting.

449
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,420
Tong!

450
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,330
One drink. Here you go.

451
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,540
- I don’t drink.
- That won’t cut it.

452
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,360
Go on. Hurry up.

453
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,230
Drink up!

454
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,900
I’ll drink on Tong’s behalf.

455
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,710
Next!

456
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,500
Mark is a vampire.

457
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,440
He won’t get drunk.

458
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,650
Spin it!

459
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,889
Drink up!

460
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,840
Yay!

461
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,150
Drink up!

462
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,650
You’re so drunk.

463
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,400
How will you protect me now, Mr. Bodyguard?

464
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,020
Drunk?

465
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,360
I’m not drunk.

466
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:28,980
Hey!

467
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,140
Mister!

468
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,940
I’ll use this to make fun of you until you’re old.

469
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,420
Hey!

470
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,740
Are you alright, Kla?

471
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,540
He’s fine.

472
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,090
See this?

473
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,900
I’m standing straight up.

474
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,300
See that?

475
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,200
180 degrees.

476
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,190
180.

477
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,060
Not 185 and not 184.

478
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,910
180 on the dot.

479
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,910
I’ll use the restroom.

480
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,320
Don’t worry about me.

481
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,670
I’m not worrying about you.

482
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,570
I’ll go with you.

483
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,300
I’m really alright.

484
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,660
Stand up.

485
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,800
Pae, Dome, please take care of Mark.

486
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,320
- Alright.
- No worries.

487
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,890
Let’s go.

488
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,630
Take it slow.

489
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,730
Shall I go with you?

490
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,110
- No, it’s fine.
- Don’t fall asleep!

491
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,400
Are you sure?

492
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,450
Yeah.

493
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,210
I told you I’m fine.

494
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,200
As if!

495
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,540
Tong, walk straight for once.

496
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,000
Will I ever get to the toilet today?

497
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,000
It’s me who couldn’t walk straight?

498
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,130
My apologies, sir.

499
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,910
Shouldn’t have drunk so much.

500
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,560
Meena!

501
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,670
Where are you Meena?

502
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,050
Meena!

503
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,880
Excuse me,  have you seen
Meena playing around here?

504
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,950
Meena?

505
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,980
Oh!

506
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,850
I haven’t seen her since this morning.

507
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,070
What do we do?

508
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,480
Please calm down.

509
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,710
I’ll help you look for her.

510
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,050
When was the last time you saw her?

511
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,620
We last saw her at the pool.

512
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,800
Then I’ll help you look for her.

513
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,900
Let’s go, honey.

514
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,870
Alright, Thank you.

515
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,860
Meena!

516
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,500
Meena, where are you?

517
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,280
Tonkla, once you’re done, wait out front.

518
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,020
I’ll come and get you.

519
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,010
Meena!

520
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,780
Meena, are you around here?

521
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,120
Meena!

522
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,020
Meena!

523
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,400
Meena.

524
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,010
Here you are.

525
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,470
Your parents are looking for you.

526
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,460
Would you come with me
to my room to get something?

527
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,770
First, shouldn’t we tell your parents
that we’ve found you?

528
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,940
So that they won’t worry.

529
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,770
I have something to give
my parents as a surprise.

530
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,370
Please?

531
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,980
Alright.

532
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,850
I’ll come with you.

533
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,730
Oh?

534
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,540
Tong hasn’t come back to the table?

535
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,300
- What?
- We haven’t seen him.

536
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,300
Tong went missing?

537
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,650
Probably not.

538
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,170
He’s probably waiting at the toilet.

539
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,210
Oh?

540
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,210
Oh?

541
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,460
Meena.

542
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,670
Anything I can help?

543
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,090
Meena.

544
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,700
What’s wrong with you, Meena?

545
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,590
Meena!

546
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,140
Get yourself together.

547
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,540
Meena!

548
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,050
Tong, help me!

549
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,080
Tong!

550
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,180
Help me!

551
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,900
Tong!

552
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:28,920
Meena!

553
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,160
Meena!

554
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,530
Meena!

555
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,400
Meena!

556
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:51,840
Meena.

557
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,090
Meena.

558
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:20,930
Tong!

559
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,380
Hold it.

560
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,660
It’s alright, Tong.

561
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,570
What’s going on?

562
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,900
That kid was probably hypnotized by Nakan.

563
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,150
I’ll check if she’s alright.

564
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,810
But let’s get going for now.

565
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,640
Mark.

566
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,300
Mister.

567
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:47,810
Mark.

568
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,290
Mark!

569
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,190
Mark!

570
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,440
Mark!

571
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,390
Mark!

572
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,710
I’m sorry.

573
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:23,710
I’m sorry.

574
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,320
I’m sorry.

575
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,000
I still stand my ground.

576
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,650
There’s nothing you should be cautious about.

577
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:43,920
No matter what happens,

578
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,220
I will endure it.

579
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,260
Are you alright now?

580
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,400
I’m fine.

581
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,830
What about you, Tong?

582
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,820
Is Tong okay?

583
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,960
I didn’t hurt Tong, did I?

584
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,400
I’m fine.

585
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,900
I was just surprised.

586
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,580
I’m sorry

587
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,320
for being late to help you.

588
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,510
I make people around me get hurt again.

589
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,190
I thought I was doing my best
in looking out for myself.

590
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,200
But when things turn out like this

591
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,100
I don’t know if more people
would get hurt because of me.

592
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,890
I’m sorry.

593
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:44,810
Tong.

594
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,340
It’s not your fault.

595
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,700
I told you.

596
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,080
That I would take care of you

597
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,500
and I will do that for the rest of my life.

598
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,390
Are you Tonkla?

599
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,310
Prof!

600
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,130
What a coincidence.

601
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,300
What brings you here?

602
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,450
Well, I have some business to take care of.

603
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,580
Wow.

604
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,040
It must have wrapped up nicely, right?

605
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,120
You seem so happy.

606
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,070
That’s right.

607
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,650
We got a huge sum of profit.

608
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,980
Do you have anything you want to eat?

609
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,840
Since we ran into each other…

610
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:00,800
Oh my, Prof!

611
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,160
It’s my treat.

612
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,840
What a shame, Prof.

613
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,120
I’m so full right now.

614
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,010
Then can I treat you to this special wine?

615
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,860
As a token of gratitude.

616
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,490
I’ll have to bother you on
lots of things from now on.

617
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,590
My pleasure, Prof.

618
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,710
Cheers.

619
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,900
The hotel found Meena.

620
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,100
She’s safe and didn’t get hurt anywhere.

621
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,290
She didn’t remember anything.

622
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,120
There’s nothing for you to worry about anymore.

623
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,400
Some chocolate?

624
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,400
Maybe it can help make you feel better.

625
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,050
It’s all ruined.

626
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,740
Then you don’t have to eat it.

627
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,160
Thank you.

628
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,720
Without you,

629
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,610
I don’t know how I would have dealt with it.

630
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,130
No, actually.

631
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,380
I might have died.

632
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,700
Don’t say that, Tong.

633
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,710
Have you forgotten?

634
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,740
I’m your bodyguard.

635
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,510
It’s my duty to take care of you.

636
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:38,980
But I...

637
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,900
I don’t want you to be my bodyguard anymore.

638
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:43,970
Hold on.

639
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,140
How can you suddenly

640
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,020
Then, does this mean…

641
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,570
Or do you want to be just a bodyguard?

642
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,270
For Tong,

643
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,900
I can be anything.

644
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,960
Do you think

645
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,340
it would be better

646
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,600
if I move back to your house?

647
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,100
Would you be okay with that?

648
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,560
You’re going to shower?

649
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,850
I’ve recalled it.

650
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,680
What my dream was.
