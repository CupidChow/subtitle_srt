Let others look here, okay?

75
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,200

77
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,830
if you sit quietly, you look cool, right?

78
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,490
Do you think so too?

79
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,320

I'm going to take a shower and dress up.

86
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,300
Can't you just protect me from afar?

87
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,830
Are you sure?

88
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,680
This is my room. I'm safe no matter what.

89
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,820
Because Tonkla is always with me.

90

But I don't think so.

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,240

96
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm sure I'll make friends.

97
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,040
In that case, except Tonkla.

98
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,810
When will you make friends and kick me out?

99
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,380
When will I make friends?
Are you going to protect me from afar like you used to?

100
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,560
I'll think about it.

101
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,160
Why are you working so hard?

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,160
The deadline is still early.

103
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm not trying hard. I'm just making a summary.

104
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,460

3 important rules for real friends.

107

One, know how to share.

108

Two, friends don't need to say anything and help.

109

3. Be sincere and don't betray each other.

110
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,230
What's wrong?

111
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,730
Just look for friends according to the list.

112
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,740
Oh, Tong, what era is this?

113
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,500

The biggest problem of college life is having no friends.

116
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,580
Don't be dramatic. You'll get it soon.

117

128
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,020
You were waiting for me this morning?

129
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,990
Yes. Don't tell me you rented this house.

130
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,570
I told you I have the obligation to take care of you.

131
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,100
If you need anything, I can help you in time.

132

What are you doing here?

133
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,110
Did you move here and live with us?

134
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,120
If the owner doesn't want to sell the building,
Or I'll buy the whole building.

135

No, this is for my new friend in college.

137

143
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
It's a bonus.

144
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,640
Okay.

145
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,470
Really?

146
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:07,950
Yes.

147
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,900
Then sign it.

148
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,730
Are you sure?

149
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,730
You can trust them?

150
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,640
Of course.

151
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,910
Hello?

152
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,760
Where are you? I'm at the library.

153
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
But

154
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,820
It's too much if I do it alone.

155
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,750
When are you coming I'll wait for you

156
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,020
Wait

157
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,410
Whoa

158
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:00,600
Oh.

159
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,140
I warned you.

160
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,850
You just don't have any friends. Don't be so sad.

161
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,210
If you want to make friends, I can hire someone to be your friend.

162
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,510
You don't have to work so hard.

163
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,390
No.

164
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,620
I don't want fake friends.

165
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,290
I want true friends.

166
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,550
Human friendship is boring.

167
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,040
Friendship is for benefit.

168
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,720
If you don't want to be sad,

169
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,910
you shouldn't trust others.

170
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,910
But I'm not a pessimist like you.

171
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,670
In literature, there are good people and bad people.

172
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,720
It's just that you've met all the bad guys.

173
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,340
Your three tests are useless.

174
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,400
Human heart is like an hour hand.

175
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,400
change at any time.

176
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,830
I don't know why you're unhappy.

177
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,940
At least friends can make us not lonely.

178
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,950
And we don't have to fight alone.

179
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,620
I didn't expect that much.

180
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,820
[I'm playing basketball. I'm hungry.]
[Buy me something to eat.]

181
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,190
You don't have to help me, but you're ordering me around.

182
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,010
Where are you going?

183
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,990
To fulfill your duty as a friend.

184
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,860
A vampire like you won't understand.

185
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,780
It's better to end up like this.

186
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,120
You can do whatever you want.

187
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,380
You losers!

188
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,170
Don't forget to wash your pants and return them to me.

189
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,170
Who will be the substitute?

190
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,470
The list will be handed in next season.

191
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,220
What should I do?

192
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,220
Let me try.

193
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,460
Forget it, Tong.

194
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,580
Whoa, who is this?

195
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,810
Is he your friend, Tonkla?

196
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,910
I forgot to introduce him. This is my friend Tong.

197
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,820
He's a classmate from the Literature Academy and my childhood friend.

198
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,320
I want to play a game.

199
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,440
Are you serious, Tong?

200
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,710
Why?

201
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,780
What should we do?
Think about it.

202
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,530
Our team is short-handed.

203
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,260
We can’t hand in the list.

204
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,460
We need four people.

205
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,090
Tong.

206
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,040
Do you have any friends?

207
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,740
You should invite him to the competition.

208
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,460
Is that so?

209
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,290
Tonkla is my only friend.

210
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,010
You don't have a whole faculty?

211
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,500
Whoa.

212
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,300
That person

213
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,359
That person

214
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,250
Whoa.

215
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,280
Hey.

216
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,480
Are you interested in joining my basketball team?

217
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,980
No, I don't.

218
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,770
No.

219
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,050
Don't invite him. It's a waste of time.

220
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,740
He won't call.

221
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,150
Find someone else.

222
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,550
I can join.

223
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:36,930
Whoa

224
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:37,840
Whoa.

225
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,790
Yes!
But I have to see

226
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,080
if this team is so good that I can join.

227
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,600
Let's play one-on-one. Whoever scores will win.

228
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,370
If you're worried about losing,

229
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,050
you can tell me now.

230
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,130
Hey, vampire.

231
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,800
That's not nonsense.

232
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,690
Are you sure?

233
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,740
Come on.

234
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,230
Whoa
I'll do it.

235
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,300
Oh, Tonkla, catch!

236
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,410
He's not that good.

237
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,410
Come on.

238
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,710
Come on

239
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,870
Whoa.

240
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,030
I'll cheer for you, Tonkla.

241
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,520
I made a mistake.

242
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,090
To be honest, if you beg me now,

243
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,150
I can admit defeat.

244
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,530
No.

245
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,060
I want to win with dignity.

246
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,360
If I make one shot, you'll lose.

247
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,750
How about this?

248
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,280
If you score a goal,

249
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,650
you win this game.

250
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,040
But if I make one more shot,

251
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,080
you have to give me sandwiches every morning.

252
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,540
Okay?

253
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,700
Wait.

254
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,830
Where are you going?

255
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,480
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

256
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,970
You can do this, right?

257
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,420
One shot!

258
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,890
Deal!

259
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,920
It's in!
Yeah yeah

260
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,090
How did you do it? It's amazing.

261
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,850
Great.

262
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,660
Great.
We made it.

263
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,420
Will you join our team?

264
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,860
As I said.

265
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,700
Great, we finally formed a team. You can participate in the competition.

266
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,910
Let's take a photo together.

267
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,710
Let's take a photo.
Hurry up

268
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,690
Hurry.

269
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:42,980
Come on. Come on.

270
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,690
Let's go. Let's go.

271
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,210
Here.

272
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,210
Let's do it.

273
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,840
Hurry.

274
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,060
Let me help you.

275
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,540
You scared me.

276
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,950
From now on,

277
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,390
If you come out suddenly,
Can you make some noise or let me see it first?

278
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,250
Sure, I'll make some noise from now on.

279
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,960
To be honest, other vampires...
Would I like to be around humans like you?

280
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,390
Or do you think you're the only one?

281
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,470
Only to you.

282
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,960
One Piece!

283
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,580
Do you like it?

284
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,580
You know that too?

285
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,580
I know.

286
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,030
Have you forgotten? I've lived a long life.

287
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,120
You know what? These are my favorite clothes.

288
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,530
When someone came to the house of first love to donate,

289
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,760
I remember. I almost died when I was separated from Tonkla.

290
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,800
Hey.

291
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,120
Thank you.

292
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,720
Smells good.

293
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,440
I love your scent.

294
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,080
Why does it smell so good?

295
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:56,470
I don't think it smells like me. It must be the smell of the fluid.

296
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,780
Hey.

297
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,480
You can let go of my hand now.

298
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,580
Didn't you say

299
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,230
vampires don't know these things?

300
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,610
I know.

301
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
I can't explain.

302
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,790
There must be something special.

303
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,180
I only know I like it.

304
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,500
What brings you here?

305
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,110
How did you know I was here?

306
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,840
Can you read minds too?

307
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,850
Here.

308
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,180
Consider it as a thank you for buying me dinner.

309
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,580
and collect my clothes.

310
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,340
You don't have to repay me. I'm willing.

311
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,630
Friends should help each other.

312
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,220
But if we're friends, we have to share.

313
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,290
That means we're friends.

314
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,550
Let me think about it.

315
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,780
Then why did you go out today?
I need your help.

316
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,480
What is it?

317
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,520
This is the fluid you used.

318
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,890
Why did you buy the same flavor as me?

319
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,360
Because you smell good. I like it.

320
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,120
Then why did you buy it at this supermarket?

321
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,510
Actually, there's one in the supermarket near our dorm.

322
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,560
It's not Tonkla's part-time job yet.
But he forgot to bring the documents.

323
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
So I have to send him a document to get his signature.

324
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,010
Over there.

325
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,720
What are you waiting for?

326
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,460
Let him sign the document. You said it was important.

327
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,410
I thought I could wait for him to rest for this round.
I'm worried that people might think he's sneaking around.

328
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,550
I'll go get some water.

329
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,380
Handsome handsome

330
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,380
Do you want sausages

331
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,490
[Sausage]

332
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,380
Here.

333
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,620
Do you want some sauce?

334
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,090
This looks good on you, sir. This is a high protein sausage and meat.

335
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,930
Thank you.

336
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,980
What are you doing here?

337
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,580
Long time no see.

338
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,930
I put some products here. So I came to see the effect.

339
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,260
What do you think?

340
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,900
Then why did you go to the sausage stall?

341
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,330
Then why can't I go?

342
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,570
You're not interested in anything other than blood.

343
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,870
I'm here to buy something and inspect my business.

344
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,510
I pretended to be interested in human products.
so that I can hide myself.

345
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,790
Isn't that good?

346
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,110
I should be asking you. Why are you here?

347
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,210
I'm here to send a document

348
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,460
Thara Group has acquired this university.

349
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,200
I'm just here to take care of her.

350
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,150
Oh.

351
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,080
Is there anything I should know?
Mrs. Hara never told me about this.

352
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,720
You don't need to know.

353
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,460
Why is the air conditioner broken today?

354
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,540
[Because there's no...]

355
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,250
How many times do I have to see it?

356
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,520
I told you not to act tough. What if you get hurt?

357
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,880
Just a little.

358
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,140
That's all. What will happen?

359
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,910
Of course.

360
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,070
Did you forget you were...
Gold blood

361
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,640
You forgot you're... I know.

362
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,640
How many times are you going to nag?

363
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,130
And...

364
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,340

I like classic works too.

372
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
You've lived for over 100 years, but you're still fooled.

If he didn't hurt my pride,
I could have forgiven his arrogance easily.

386
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,650
I could have ignored his arrogance.

387
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,120
If he hadn't shocked me,

388
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,540
Before I realized that I love you, I would have fallen for him.

389

He released a new product.
He said he liked seeing me dance in a sausage suit.

You want me to be careful of him? Are you crazy?

417

He's my friend.

418
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,250
It's dangerous anyway.

419
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,410
You can't trust a friend or anyone.

420
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:31,360
But I trust Tonkla.
I know him well. He won't betray me.

The more you doubt Tonkla, You know what?

433
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,460
It makes me more doubtful.

I'm talking about friendship. Do you think someone like him knows?

452
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,160
It's not as good as finding answers online. It must be cheap.

453

463

Is this how you measure people's feelings? You're so shallow.

464

00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,960
It smells weird.
Only a vampire like you can drink it.

553
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:05,000

When you kiss someone, Your feelings will tell you.
What's the difference?

566
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,100
He acted like nothing happened.
It's because he doesn't like it.

567
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,650
But you're restless because you like him.
