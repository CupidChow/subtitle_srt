Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,250
Do you think

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,900
it would be better if I move back to your house?

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,400
Would you be okay with that?

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,280
Tong’s in danger.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,350
Where are you going?

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,520
The test is not done.

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,170
You meant to use Tonkla as bait to get me here.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,550
Why is it not working?

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,700
Is it because...

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,650
of the Golden Blood?

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,400
I’ve recalled it.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,260
What my dream was.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,250
It’s to live this life with you Tong.

18
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,610
Mark!

19
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,650
It’s me!

20
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:18,960
Mark!

21
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,870
Mark!

22
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,000
Mark!

23
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:23,980
Hey!

24
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,770
Mark…

25
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,150
Tong…

26
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,790
I’m sorry.

27
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Mark!

28
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,220
There you are.

29
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,580
Last night,

30
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
I fell asleep waiting for you.

31
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,590
I’m sorry.

32
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,860
It’s alright.

33
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,470
I should have waited for you.

34
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,900
No,

35
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,400
I meant what happened last night.

36
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,130
About that, it’s also alright.

37
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,120
I almost harmed you.

38
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,920
But in the end, you didn’t.

39
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,010
Mark.

40
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
We’ll find a way to cope with this.

41
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,850
I believe so.

42
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,030
I…

43
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,180
I don’t want you to be afraid of me.

44
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,170
I trust in you, Mark.

45
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,770
I told you, right?

46
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,770
That I trust you.

47
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,370
Will you stop pouting now?

48
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,070
Will you stop pouting now?

49
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,840
Hmm?

50
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,600
Not yet.

51
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,500
I forgot about the quiz.

52
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,230
I haven’t read it!

53
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,980
Have you read it?

54
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,669
Almost until the end.

55
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,270
Yeah?

56
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:44,700
How was it?

57
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,440
Can you give me some spoilers?

58
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,380
Sure.

59
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,680
Kla!

60
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,030
Wake up!

61
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,150
There’s a quiz!

62
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,330
Get up!

63
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
“She smiles with her eyes squinted,”

64
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,730
“full of delight”

65
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,050
“from the sweet anniversary present.”

66
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,330
“The ring placed on her ring finger”

67
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,100
“as a vow of eternal love.”

68
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,200
Anniversary?

69
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,190
Is it important?

70
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes,

71
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,520
in the end, the main leads get together.

72
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,330
Wow!

73
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,040
That’s great.

74
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,480
It’s good that we have Mark.
Otherwise, I would have died.

75
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,380
Tonkla, you wait here in the car.

76
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,560
Why?

77
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,420
There’s a limit on the number of visitors.

78
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,150
Then, I can wait here with Tonkla.

79
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,320
You go on up.

80
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,870
You have to come with me.

81
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,570
Miss Thara wants to see you.

82
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,050
You guys can just go ahead.

83
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,260
I can wait in the car.

84
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,700
I have to revise for the quiz anyway.

85
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:18,880
Go on.

86
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,180
Wait here.

87
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,370
It’s going to be quite hectic these days, Tong.

88
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,240
I understand.

89
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,980
It’s because of me.

90
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,910
Never blame yourself, Tong.

91
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,410
You did nothing wrong.

92
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,340
But I was the cause of everything.

93
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,720
I can't help anyone

94
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,780
and even am a burden.

95
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,100
But right now, there’s a way

96
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,700
that you can help us.

97
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,200
That’s why I wanted to see you.

98
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,550
What is it?

99
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,860
Mark told me.

100
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,050
That Nakan couldn’t hypnotize you.

101
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Does that have any effect on anyone?

102
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,120
Did I put anyone in trouble?

103
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,500
No one was affected.

104
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,580
It makes us realize that...

105
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,900
your blood is key to helping all of us.

106
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,120
What should I do?

107
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,440
We’ll have to ask for your blood
to extract and make a medicine out of it.

108
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,380
That’s if you agree to do it.

109
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,000
I do.

110
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,210
I’m willing to do it.

111
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,820
Aunty Wan will take care of
making this medicine.

112
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,310
It's the hope that you will be
able to protect others, Tong.

113
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,830
But until this is completed,

114
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,030
trusting ‘other’ people is still dangerous.

115
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,090
It’s the danger from unforeseen circumstances.

116
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,700
I got it, Miss Thara.

117
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,000
‘Other’ people mean strangers,

118
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,250
people around you,

119
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,020
and all your friends.

120
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,310
Tonkla as well?

121
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,500
The first book for this semester is Illiad.

122
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,950
Then we’ll go on to The Odyssey.

123
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,050
Sounds unfamiliar, right?

124
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,770
What if I say

125
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,090
“Troy’s Trojan Horse”?

126
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,440
Does that ring a bell?

127
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,080
The story is about the war
between Troy and Greece.

128
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,160
But in the end, Troy, with their strong defense

129
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,570
that Greece used 9 years to fight,

130
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,040
faced defeat.

131
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,300
Do you know why?

132
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,970
Because they’re careless?

133
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,880
I think it's because they're foolish.

134
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,520
A big city with established power

135
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,450
usually falls because of something like this.

136
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,000
They let the Trojan Horse in during the war,

137
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,510
that’s careless.

138
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,530
Otherwise, their ego was in their way.

139
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
Any questions?

140
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,230
Isn’t the reason why Troy lost the war

141
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,890
was because they were tricked?

142
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,160
On top of that, the story was made up.

143
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,280
Although the Trojan Horse doesn’t exist,

144
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,400
the fall of Troy is true and evident in history.

145
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,210
That’s a long time ago.

146
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,650
A thousand years before Christ.

147
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,720
I don’t think anyone would ever
fall for that trick now.

148
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,120
Have you ever heard of “Trojan”?

149
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,990
The Trojan Virus came from
the name of the civilians of Troy.

150
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,890
It’s when you leave something inside

151
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,760
like the Trojan Horse and wait for it to blow up.

152
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,980
The Trojan Horse strategy still exists.

153
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,900
It just changes with time.

154
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,150
Who would be stupid enough

155
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,150
to actually make a wooden horse?

156
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,400
Isn’t that right?

157
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,100
Watch out.

158
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,110
This strategy still works

159
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,120
because humans still have
feelings and emotions.

160
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,010
For example, love.

161
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,490
It’s the source of weakness

162
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,270
for humans.

163
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,300
Prof. Nakan is like a villain in movies.

164
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,100
He says things in such an annoying way.

165
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,650
But from now on,

166
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,960
there might be a way to stop Nakan.

167
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,560
The way is...

168
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,500
What is it?

169
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,200
Okay.

170
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,150
You guys want to keep it between you two?

171
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,910
Then I won’t stick my nose in.

172
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,500
I’ll get going.

173
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,950
I need to get the registration code
from my advisor.

174
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,010
Mark.

175
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,490
Tonkla already knows about you, though.

176
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,660
But it’s better for him not to know about this.

177
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,450
For the safety of the plan and yourself.

178
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,410
But Tonkla said it

179
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,100
that we’re the same team now.

180
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,500
Do you still not trust Tonkla?

181
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,750
I trust Tonkla

182
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,330
but I don’t trust Nakan.

183
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
If Nakan hypnotizes Tonkla,

184
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
he might hurt you.

185
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,530
Tong.

186
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,150
If Aunty Wan's plan goes through,

187
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,790
everyone will get to live their lives

188
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,030
and there would be no need
to worry about anything.

189
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,380
I get it.

190
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,290
I’m just afraid that Tonkla would be offended.

191
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,600
I understand.

192
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,470
Tonight, let’s buy some delicious food,

193
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,810
ones that Tonkla likes,
and let’s make up with Tonkla.

194
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,050
[Tonkla Tongsrignam]

195
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,290
[Prof. Nakan Amarittrakul]

196
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,790
You’re my advisor

197
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,720
so I’m here to get my registration code.

198
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,360
By the way, have you got your part-time money?

199
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,450
Oh, I went home early that day

200
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,660
so I didn’t go through with the experiment.

201
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,430
Mark must have told you

202
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,490
not to meddle or talk to me.

203
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,420
And you trust him.

204
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,790
Mark is my friend.

205
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,440
Mark doesn’t have good intentions for you.

206
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,859
He just wants you guys to believe so

207
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,250
and succeeded.

208
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,010
You don’t have to try to bluff me.

209
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,330
I don’t believe you.

210
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,020
I just want to warn you.

211
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,200
That Mark just wants something from Tong.

212
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,460
Something that I don’t know

213
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,560
what exactly it is.

214
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,170
Alright, alright.

215
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,550
It’s okay if you don’t trust me.

216
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,200
But as your advisor,

217
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,950
I would love to see you take the grant.

218
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,680
I won’t take the grant.

219
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,510
I don’t want to owe anyone anything.

220
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,500
Especially someone I don’t trust.

221
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,400
Are you going to throw away your future

222
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,330
because of Tong?

223
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,880
You’re denying the scholarship,

224
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,200
trying to make money to pay for school fees,

225
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,220
while Tong lives abundantly?

226
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Don’t you think you have
a choice to live a better life?

227
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,000
I’m happy with how things are right now.

228
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,050
Eyes don’t lie.

229
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,110
You might have been raised to give it up

230
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,910
for Tong.

231
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,750
I wasn’t giving it up.

232
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,420
I gladly did it.

233
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,350
Everyone deserves the best.

234
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,570
Don’t you ever wonder

235
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,210
why you always have to give
good things up for someone else?

236
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,640
Alright, you all.

237
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,010
Take one each.

238
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,050
You can pick the one you want.

239
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,650
I want this.

240
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,890
What about this one?

241
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,500
Miss, I want this one.

242
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,910
Let’s see.

243
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,930
That one’s also nice.

244
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,210
I think

245
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,030
this one has long sleeves

246
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,560
it’s a better fit for Tong.

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,700
Just in case Tong bumps into things. Right?

248
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,690
But last time you gave it to Tong already.

249
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,140
I want this one.

250
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,040
That’s not nice, Tonkla.

251
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,740
A good boy has to share,

252
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,400
help out, and take care of the one weaker than you.

253
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,570
Do you want to be a bad boy?

254
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,030
Me and the other boys don’t like a bad boy, though?

255
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,120
No.

256
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,900
Well done.

257
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,660
Then, let’s give this one to Tong, yes?

258
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,660
Alright.

259
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,490
There are so many other ones.

260
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,650
Being used to sacrificing

261
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,170
until you forget that you are important enough

262
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,460
to deserve the best too.

263
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,560
I was also taught by Thara that way too.

264
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,150
To give things up for Mark.

265
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,350
For the organization.

266
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,430
But sometimes, you have to be selfish.

267
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,640
You can’t just back down for others all the time.

268
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,700
This is a scholarship from the university.

269
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,400
It has nothing to do with Tara Group or me.

270
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,520
Have a think about it.

271
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,910
Thank you.

272
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,580

273
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,570

Wow, Tong.

278
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,630
You can sing so well.

279
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,230
Next time,

280
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,910
sing for me again.

281
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,320
No.

282
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,660
When someone’s listening closely

283
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,260
I would get all tense up.

284
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,460
I can’t do it.

285
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,600
By the way,

286
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,490
Miss Thara said

287
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,050
I need to get my blood extracted for the medicine,

288
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,840
so when is that?

289
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,320
Aunty Wan has to get
the tools and place ready first.

290
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,560
Then I will bring your blood to her.

291
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,300
Isn’t Aunty Wan going to do it at the florist?

292
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,680
We don’t have all the tools there.

293
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,900
The medicine is one that
has never been made before.

294
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,040
So, where are we going?

295
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:56,910
I’m not telling.

296
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,450
But I think you will like it.

297
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,300
Hey, did you bring me here

298
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,320
because you thought I was a nerd?

299
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,680
No.

300
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Come on, this way.

301
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,730
In that era,

302
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,490
you were already born, right?

303
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,230
I’ve been through all the eras, Tong.

304
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,610
Alright,

305
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,620
Grandpa Mark.

306
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,730
Does the picture resemble the real thing?

307
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
Yeah, so much that it makes me nostalgic.

308
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:58,900
Hey!

309
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,930
There’s a train.

310
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,840
Come on.

311
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,300
Hello, Grandpa.

312
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,490
Welcome to Tour Tong Train.

313
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,540
Welcome aboard.

314
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,220
Where shall we go today?

315
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,300
Hold on tight!

316
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,950
Wherever that love takes me.

317
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,720
Here’s your picture.

318
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,300
Thank you.

319
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,660
This is not Mister Mark.

320
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,160
Then what?

321
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,450
Master Mark.

322
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,570
Was that a sincere laugh?

323
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:04,990
It was.

324
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,540
See this couple here?

325
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,640
Yeah.

326
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,580
They’re the couple who’s been
together for the longest

327
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,330
in Thai history.

328
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,700
Guess how long they were together.

329
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:32,790
40?

330
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
40 years?

331
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,560
You almost got it.

332
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,830
They were together for 85 years.

333
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,220
85?

334
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,050
But I can be with you for even longer than that.

335
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,830
I can’t live that long.

336
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,820
What do you think

337
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,350
makes them stay together for so long?

338
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,200
I guess

339
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,640
love?

340
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,630
A human should be able to
give a better answer than mine.

341
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,320
Let’s go to another place.

342
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,710
There’s a place I want to take you to.

343
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,850
Tong.

344
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,400
Happy one monthsary being together, Tong.

345
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,570
Hold on.

346
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,070
Where did you learn this from?

347
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,310
Why?

348
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,820
Is it not good?

349
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,100
It’s good.

350
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,260
It’s just that…

351
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,420
you’re way more head over heels than I thought.

352
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,100
Head over heels?

353
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,540
Isn’t this what humans do on anniversaries?

354
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,630
I saw it on the internet.

355
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,610
Wow.

356
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,340
But... I’m glad

357
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,910
to have you with me.

358
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,660
I also want to apologize for that day again.

359
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,870
There's no need to apologize anymore.

360
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,780
It’s me who should apologize.

361
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,810
It’s our monthsary

362
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,480
but I have nothing for you.

363
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,480
It’s totally fine.

364
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,510
We’re going to be together
for so many years anyway.

365
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,160
Then,

366
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,640
when we got home

367
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,310
I have a surprise for you.

368
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,940
Thank you.

369
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,700
Love

370
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,360
is what’s going to make the strongest wall

371
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,430
crumble so easily

372
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,690
with trust.

373
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,440
You can open your eyes now.

374
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,470
Thank you.

375
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,880
That’s not all.

376
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,080
This song is for Mark.

♪ I was hiding in the shadows ♪

378
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,180
♪ Faces passed me by ♪

[I’ve got everything prepared.]

393
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,060
After collecting the blood,

394
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,450
you will be fatigued.

395
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,890
Have some rest.

396
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,500
I will bring the blood to Aunty Wan
and come right back.

397
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,830
I’m fine on my own.

398
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,890
Please step out of the car.

399
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,480
Don’t make me force you to.

400
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,050
You’ve collected the blood without permission.

401
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,850
[Tonkla: Where are you? I’m about to head home.]

402
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,130
[Tonkla: Want anything to eat?]

403
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,770
[Tong: Can you come back a little later at night?]

404
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,450
[Tonkla: Why?]

405
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,370
[Tong: I’ll fill you in later.]

406
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,100
What’s this?

407
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,400
Mark has taken Tong’s blood.

408
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,380
He’s about to exploit your friend’s Golden Blood.

409
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,360
He’s just putting on a show in front of you.

410
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,200
He’s going to use this blood for Thara.

411
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,700
Don’t try to bluff me.

412
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,460
Judge it from what you saw.

413
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,140
But you’d better hurry up.

414
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,440
Don’t wait until your friend
got drained all the blood out.

415
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,530
[Miss Nuan]

416
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,070
Yes, Miss Nuan?

417
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,260
Huh?

418
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,270
What did you say?

419
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,199
Hello.

420
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,440
Tong!

421
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,400
It’s Miss Nuan!

422
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,710
Miss Nuan got hit by a car!

423
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,989
What? Miss Nuan?!

424
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,300
How is Miss Nuan?

425
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,969
Miss Nuan is in ICU right now, Tong.

426
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,929
Where are you?

427
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,340
Are you at the florist?

428
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,850
Yes.

429
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,280
I’m in front of the florist.

430
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,010
Hurry down.

431
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,989
Kla, are you sure that this is real?

432
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,199
Did Miss Nuan really get hit by a car?

433
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,250
Are you going to doubt even such a thing?

434
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,489
A boy at the orphanage called me.

435
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,350
But you don’t have to go

436
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,590
if you don’t care about Miss Nuan.

437
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,360
Would you believe me now?

438
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,460
Are we going, Tonkla?

439
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,000
Didn’t you say it's urgent?

440
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,790
Kla, hide in the florist.

441
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,610
Hey, Tong, let’s go. We don’t have time.

442
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,340
We can’t go with Nakan.

443
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,900
I just want to help.

444
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,370
If I meant to harm you,

445
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,050
I’d have done that long ago.

446
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,230
You know what I can do.

447
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,730
But this can be part of your plan.

448
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,780
I can’t control anyone from afar.

449
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,130
Also,

450
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,730
I can't control human feelings.

451
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,530
Hello, Tee-lek?

452
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,330
Can you talk to Tong for a second?

453
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,990
Are you still not here, Tonkla?

454
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,450
Miss Nuan is still in the ICU.

455
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,680
This is Tong.

456
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,250
We’re getting there as fast as we can.

457
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,740
You can let Mark know, Tong.

458
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,980
But I’d recommend you to do it quickly.

459
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,920
Let’s go, Tong.

460
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,840
The doctor said they’re not sure
if Miss Nuan will see the light of tomorrow.

461
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,320
Just trust me.

462
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,380
How is Miss Nuan doing?

463
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,940
The patient has lost lots of blood.

464
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,660
I can’t say anything right now.

465
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,710
She’s still in a critical stage
and we need to keep watching.

466
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,990
Doctor,

467
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,100
please help Miss Nuan.

468
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,100
An operation involves high risk

469
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,310
but I will do my best.

470
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:35,670
Tong!

471
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,520
Tong!

472
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,420
Tonkla!

473
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,940
How is Miss Nuan doing?

474
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,750
Yes, how is she?

475
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,200
How is she?

476
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,960
Is she okay?

477
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,810
Miss Nuan…

478
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,450
Right now,

479
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,940
the doctor is taking care of Miss Nuan.

480
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,300
She’ll be fine.

481
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,200
She’s under the doctor’s care

482
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,500
so you don’t have to worry.

483
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,170
Come on.

484
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,470
Don’t cry.

485
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,770
It’s alright.

486
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,800
Shall we live here until
Miss Nuan has recovered?

487
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,170
You guys should go back to school.

488
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,740
That’s what Miss Nuan would want the most.

489
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,330
How can I go back?

490
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:14,960
If I do,

491
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,590
then who would take care of the boys?

492
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,500
Don’t worry.

493
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,330
I’ve got someone to take care
of this place temporarily.

494
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,860
At least you don't have
to worry about their living.

495
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,640
You just have to worry about
getting Miss Nuan treated.

496
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,050
Why are you helping us?

497
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,970
I’m the acting chairman of Tara Group right now.

498
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,040
We’ve been sponsoring
this orphanage for so many years.

499
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,940
If anything happens at this place,

500
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,570
I’m partly responsible.

501
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,330
I told you,

502
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,850
that I won’t harm you guys.

503
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,550
Never mind what Mark said to you,

504
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,610
but I haven’t done anything.

505
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,610
Mark didn’t say anything to me.

506
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,960
What happened at the resort

507
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,610
and at the medical center

508
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,610
was enough to know that you can’t be trusted.

509
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,480
But I’ve never harmed you, Tong.

510
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,360
You saw it yourself at the medical center

511
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,710
or all the times that you go to school.

512
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,280
If I wanted to, I would have done it from the start.

513
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,630
The reason why you couldn’t

514
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,210
is because Mark was there.

515
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,150
Mark didn’t let me warn you

516
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,510
because he wants to use you.

517
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,540
Do you know

518
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,080
what Mark’s going to do with your Golden Blood?

519
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,660
I’m warning you out of goodwill, Tong.

520
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,640
Thara is more cunning than you think.

521
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,480
Mark is no different.

522
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,400
If you don’t believe me.

523
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,430
That’s Mark’s true color.

524
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,160
When he’s around you guys,

525
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,810
that’s just a facade.

526
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,470
Are you really going to go back to Mark?

527
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,940
He seems so scary.

528
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,720
Kla, you’re being played by Nakan.

529
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,060
Mark did that for a reason.

530
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,090
Yeah?

531
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,910
Then why did he take your blood?

532
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,850
Can you really prove that he took
your blood because it was necessary?

533
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,270
I just know it.

534
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,300
There’s really nothing to it.

535
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,300
Then why didn’t you tell me?

536
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,660
Huh?

537
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,200
Why?

538
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,250
Is it something I’m not allowed to know?

539
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,810
Tong!

540
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:26,880
Mark.

541
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,280
Mark, are you alright?

542
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,910
Why did you have to fight
with people from the Tara Group?

543
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,340
Something came up.

544
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,170
Where have you guys been?

545
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,830
Miss Nuan got hit by a car. She’s in the ICU

546
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,570
so Nakan took us to see Miss Nuan.

547
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,180
But don’t worry.

548
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,860
We were very cautious.

549
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,090
Nothing happened.

550
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,770
Neither to Tonkla.

551
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,450
Hey.

552
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,300
Hey,

553
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,470
what are you doing? Hey!?

554
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,590
Tong, let’s go!

555
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,070
Mark is suspicious.

556
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,110
Tonkla, I was trying to see
if you were hypnotized.

557
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,580
Tong, let’s go.

558
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,640
No!

559
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,340
I’m the one who takes care of Tong.

560
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,510
Are you sure you’re taking care of him?

561
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,300
Not that you’re using him?!

562
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,300
Kla, it’s not like that.

563
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,410
Mark has his reasons.

564
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,730
I gave him my blood

565
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,560
because I was willing to.

566
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,560
Then what’s the reason, Tong?

567
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,630
The reason that you can’t tell me?

568
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,410
You changed and only trust Mark.

569
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,430
You freaking…

570
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,680
trust someone whom you’ve just met

571
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,830
even more than the friend you grew up with!

572
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,010
Hold on, Kla.

573
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,830
When the time comes,

574
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,700
I will tell you everything.

575
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,010
But now, would you please calm down?

576
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,690
Fine!

577
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,680
When you decide to trust me

578
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,100
that’s when you’ll see me.

579
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,810
Kla.

580
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,290
Kla!

581
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,650
Kla!

582
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,460
Tong.

583
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,050
Let him be for now.

584
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,150
Where are you going?

585
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,350
I’ll give you a lift.

586
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,690
I’m sad because of what happened to Miss Nuan.

587
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,100
I’m afraid of losing.

588
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,360
I’m afraid that I won’t have anyone left.

589
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,480
And now, Tong doesn’t care about me.

590
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,270
I have no one left.

591
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,240
It’s alright.

592
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,660
Because you won’t feel anything anymore.

593
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,340
You know how dangerous it is to go with Nakan.

594
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,840
Why did you risk it and go with him?

595
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,110
I tried to tell you.

596
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,730
I called you more than a hundred times.

597
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,000
I was fighting Nakan’s men at that time!

598
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,420
But Miss Nuan was in the ICU at that time!

599
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,850
Still, you should’ve waited for me.

600
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,040
Wait?

601
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,650
Wait for what?

602
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,170
Wait for Miss Nuan to die?

603
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,110
It’s still dangerous, Tong.

604
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,620
You know

605
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,220
that if Nakan had you,

606
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,620
- what would happen then.
- What?

607
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,670
Why?

608
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,820
Will the vampire world fall into chaos?

609
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,370
Are you afraid that you’d lose the Golden Blood?

610
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,060
Why?

611
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,200
I’m afraid to lose Miss Nuan too!

612
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,310
Miss Nuan is my Mother, Mark.

613
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,330
I don’t know

614
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,580
if you understand what fear is.

615
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,810
But I’m afraid right now.

616
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,700
Do you think I’m not afraid?

617
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,500
What would someone like you be afraid of?

618
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,860
The reason why I’m upset

619
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,730
is not because of the Golden Blood.

620
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,170
But I’m afraid of losing you.

621
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,480
It’s a feeling that I haven’t felt in a while.

622
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,980
But I definitely know that it’s fear.

623
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,130
I fear that Tong won't understand me.

624
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,820
I fear that Tong won’t trust me.

625
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,010
I fear that I won’t get to be with you.

626
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,110
What’s wrong with you, Mark?

627
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,240
If anything happens to Tong,

628
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,770
I don’t know how I can live on.

629
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,390
No matter what anyone says,

630
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,960
I will trust in you, Mark.

631
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,980
You trust in me, right?

632
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:41,600
Mark.

633
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,490
Mark.

634
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,910
Hey.

635
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,210
It’s alright.

636
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,270
I want it like that night.

637
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,640
Like this?

638
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,110
You and Mark

639
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,750
have crossed the bodyguard line
already, isn’t that right?

640
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,730
Yes.

641
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,420
Me and Mark are dating.

642
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,490
The infatuation Mark has for you

643
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,570
is not love.

644
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,750
It might be just...

645
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,400
the power of the Golden Blood.

646
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,330
You know what you have to do from now, right?
