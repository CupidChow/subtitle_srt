Characters, actions, places, occupations, and events in this series

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,960
are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,730
They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,320
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,360
Mark?

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,720
Hi there.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,260
Are you going to join my group?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,200
How did you get into my class?

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,490
I have to take care of you.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,520
I should be the one asking

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,680
why you are here.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,950
There’s nothing for you to know.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,200
What are you doing?

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,620
If you don’t trust Nakan,

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,640
that’s your business.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,180
But I trust Tonkla.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,440
I told you that Tonkla is my friend.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,740
I can’t believe

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
that you would do this.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
I should warn Tonkla

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,600
instead of suspecting him.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,020
I’m sorry.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,220
Does that mean

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,920
you count me as a friend now?

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,079
(Ever since our breath has been taken away,)

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,660
(we never get to experience human emotions ever again.)

27
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,630
(Stoic.)

28
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,140
(Can’t feel hot.)

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,260
(Can’t feel cold.)

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
(Can’t feel pain.)

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,260
(No different from a beast with a heart)

32
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,560
(but no love.)

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,040
(But at this moment,)

34
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,190
(I don’t want to stop what I’m doing.)

35
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,590
(Not even for a second.)

36
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,460
(No matter what the consequence is)

37
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,800
(I’m willing to give in.)

38
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,320
(Just to experience it for once,)

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,810
(that thing called ‘love’.)

40
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,960
I’m sorry.

41
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,760
It’s okay.

42
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,660
It’s about to rain.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,950
Let’s hurry up and go.

44
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,680
Getting rained on like this,

45
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,680
a human like you would get sick eventually.

46
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,750
Hurry home and wash up.

47
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,800
You too.

48
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,960
We don’t get sick.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,320
We don’t feel anything.

50
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,720
Don’t feel anything?

51
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,170
Then,

52
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,310
what was that kiss just now?

53
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,550
Well.

54
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
After drinking your blood,

55
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,640
my senses have become more human-like.

56
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,330
Your saliva,

57
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,860
blood,

58
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
and sweat,

59
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,480
they make me lose control.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,960
Everything

61
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,040
is because of the Golden Blood.

62
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,780
Was that all?

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,330
That was all.

64
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,230
Why?

65
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,780
That…

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,120
That was my first kiss.

67
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,410
I’m sorry.

68
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,950
I will try to control myself better.

69
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,740
Here you go.

70
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,740
Quickly dry yourself up.

71
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,500
Next time, bring an umbrella along.

72
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,320
Hey!

73
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,510
Why are your lips so red?

74
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,470
What have you done?

75
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,050
I was drinking tomato juice.

76
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,600
Tomato juice?

77
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Hey!

78
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,420
Have you ever kissed anyone?

79
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,500
Why are you asking?

80
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,590
For my homework.

81
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,690
It’s a question about
	analyzing love in literature.

82
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,640
I see.

83
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,640
I have.

84
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,700
Yeah?

85
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,270
Do you think people can kiss without any feelings,

86
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,590
or without any feelings for each other?

87
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,200
I think it’s possible.

88
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,740
But it probably wouldn’t feel like

89
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
kissing the person you like.

90
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,560
When you get to kiss someone,

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,120
your feelings will tell you the difference.

92
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,680
What if the person who kissed you

93
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,850
says that they kissed you because…

94
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,530
What was that kiss just now?

95
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,340
Everything is because of the Golden Blood.

96
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,880
They kissed you because they were spellbound.

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,910
No feelings involved.

98
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,000
And that makes the person being kissed frustrated.

99
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,100
What do you think the reason is?

100
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,330
I think the character feels frustrated

101
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,110
because that character is overthinking,
	overinterpreting things,

102
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,030
and assume that the other person has feelings for them

103
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,490
while the other person wasn’t feeling anything.

104
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,940
Hold on.

105
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,060
You were asking about literature
	so why are you frustrated?

106
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,360
Mr. Mark!

107
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Have some hot tea.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,550
Do you happen to know

109
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,620
what becomes of someone who has drunk the Golden Blood?

110
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,460
I’ve only heard myths about it.

111
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,300
I only knew that it really existed when I met Tong.

112
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,810
We’re like these flowers.

113
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,460
Withered.

114
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,170
Though we have a tough body,

115
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,400
it is senseless.

116
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,250
We just live day after day.

117
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,740
Therefore,

118
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,400
no one knows

119
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,390
how much power the Golden Blood holds

120
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,930
or what change it can bring about.

121
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,360
Isn’t that right?

122
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,810
You smell so nice.

123
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,830
After you met Tong,

124
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,040
you’ve changed a lot, Mr. Mark.

125
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,540
I’ve heard that

126
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,340
its power is tremendous.

127
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,480
Beyond our imaginations.

128
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,050
That’s why people want to own it.

129
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,880
“Eros Love” is named after the God of Infatuation.

130
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,790
This kind of love is seen as dangerous.

131
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,720
It can occur quickly, passionately, and senselessly.

132
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,740
Boy.

133
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
When are you going to stop sneezing?

134
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,620
I told you to get washed up quickly

135
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,700
but you were busy asking me about kisses and shit.

136
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,760
What the heck?

137
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,180
Why did you cut me off?

138
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,210
This kind of love will happen for a short time.

139
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,600
After they lose interest,
	they would seek new love

140
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,540
to spark a new passionate love.

141
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,340
When Eros takes a shot,

142
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,520
he can make humans become infatuated.

143
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,140
(Or does the Golden Blood work like a Cupid's shot)

144
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,990
(that makes Mark have feelings for me?)

145
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,560
For next week,

146
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,070
we will continue with the myth of Eros and Psyche.

147
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,070
No homework for this week.

148
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,110
However,

149
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,330
there’s the Faculty’s Open House event.

150
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,630
All of you please help your faculty mates out
	in preparing for the event.

151
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,630
Everyone has to participate.

152
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,920
Otherwise, no extra credits for you.

153
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,360
Class dismissed.

154
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,920
Man!

155
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,350
Let’s go.

156
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,400
Where are you guys going after this?

157
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,540
To grab something to eat.

158
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,130
Dome and Pupae invited us.

159
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,400
Why don’t you come along, Mr. Mark?

160
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,650
It’s alright.

161
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,480
I’m busy.

162
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,040
What’s up with him?

163
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,790
And what’s up with you too?

164
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,840
What?

165
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,720
Nothing.

166
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,570
Are you alright?

167
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,880
Yeah.

168
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,860
Come on, Tong!

169
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,250
Turn away and sneeze!

170
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,030
What if I catch your cold too?!

171
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,720
Look, you got on my shirt.

172
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,720
Hey, yo!

173
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,160
What’s up?

174
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,960
Hey.

175
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,700
Someone’s left something for you.

176
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,170
It was hung at my locker.

177
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,320
Probably some medicines.

178
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,690
It’s written that it’s for you.

179
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,610
Well, well.

180
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,100
You have someone caring for you these days.

181
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,540
Is my dude about to be in love?

182
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,590
Yeah~

183
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,120
Who is it?

184
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,320
You never told me.

185
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,930
Nonsense.

186
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,920
I only hang out with you guys every day.

187
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,090
How can I see anyone?

188
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,230
Really?

189
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,100
There, there.

190
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,060
Hey, anyone wants coffee?

191
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,640
No?

192
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,200
Then I’ll be right back,

193
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,840
just going to grab it.

194
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,600
Okay.

195
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,190
Guys.

196
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,660
Yeah?

197
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,870
Let me ask you something.

198
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,070
How did you guys get together?

199
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,270
What are you even asking?

200
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
I see that you guys get along well.

201
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,510
So I was just curious.

202
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,630
Actually, I think it’s something led by feelings.

203
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,400
Things like these are abstract.

204
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,740
You have to be together,

205
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,600
see each other’s gaze,

206
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,670
or look at their actions,

207
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,880
and you will know

208
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,480
whether the person likes you or not.

209
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,210
Then if it was the first time you guys kissed

210
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,620
but the other person acts like nothing happened after that,

211
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,050
what is that supposed to mean?

212
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,420
If you ask me,

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,520
if they acted as if nothing happened,

214
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,950
it just means that they have no feelings for you.

215
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,130
That’s why they act like everything’s alright.

216
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,900
But the reason why you’re frustrated

217
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,820
is because you have feelings for that person.

218
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,320
So you’re expecting another answer.

219
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,400
But just maybe,

220
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,270
maybe they like you

221
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,690
but don't dare say it for some reason.

222
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,150
That’s true.

223
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,550
Honestly, I think it's something that needs to be sorted out
	between the two people.

224
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,270
If you keep it to yourself,

225
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,340
you’ll be the one who feels suffocated.

226
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,500
Right, Babe?

227
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,760
That’s right, Babe.

228
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,510
Yes, Miss Thara.

229
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,430
Right now?

230
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,130
Alright.

231
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,240
I’m sorry for calling you in so suddenly.

232
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,069
I’m worried about the vision I saw.

233
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,099
A vision of the very near future.

234
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,330
I think you should be away from Tong for a bit.

235
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,150
Otherwise,

236
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,400
you might have to suffer because of Tong.

237
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
“Suffer because of Tong”?

238
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,610
I don’t know how it can happen.

239
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I’m very worried about you, Mark.

240
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,000
A week from now,

241
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,600
you should take a break from taking care of Tong for a while.

242
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,290
What happened in the vision

243
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,390
might have happened because you’ve had the Golden Blood.

244
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,070
It starts to make you lose control over yourself.

245
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,810
Do you understand, Mark?

246
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,620
How are you doing?

247
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,000
Alright?

248
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,950
Just put that there.

249
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,990
Oh, Tong.

250
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,450
You don’t look alright.

251
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
Do you want to take a break?

252
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,940
I got this.

253
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,440
Is Mark not here?

254
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,780
Mark?

255
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,770
- Yeah.
- 	He’s probably…

256
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,560
Are you okay?

257
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,150
I think you should take some rest.

258
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,000
Get some rest for now.

259
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,800
I’ll take it.

260
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,800
Put that down.

261
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,600
Thanks.

262
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,960
It’s okay. Just go.

263
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,400
You must be very surprised.

264
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,710
Mark happens to have to deal with other work for a while.

265
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,360
But don’t worry.

266
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,170
I’ll be taking care of you temporarily.

267
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,570
Is Mark going to be gone for a big while?

268
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,300
No.

269
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,490
I just happen to see something in my vision

270
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,270
so I wanted him to have a little break.

271
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,860
A vision?

272
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,320
Nothing much.

273
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,040
Mark is a vampire.

274
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,950
When he’s around the Golden Blood for a long time,

275
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,480
who knows what would become of him.

276
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,760
So I thought he should have a break.

277
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,710
You should take lots of rest too.

278
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,910
Drink the tea.

279
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,420
It will help calm you down

280
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
and maybe help with your cold.

281
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,140
I think I’d better take the tea back to my room,

282
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm afraid that you will catch my cold.

283
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,220
That’s adorable.

284
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,420
Don’t worry.

285
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,820
We don’t catch colds.

286
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,770
Oh, right.

287
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,160
Mark says he doesn’t get sick.

288
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,200
You must be very close to Mark.

289
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,870
How are you doing at the university?

290
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
University is quite fun.

291
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,630
If there’s a chance, would you show me around?

292
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
I’m sorry.

293
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,860
I think you should take some medicine
	and get lots of rest.

294
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,230
I’ll give you a lift to the university tomorrow morning.

295
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,320
Okay.

296
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,130
The Golden Blood is powerful indeed.

297
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,140
Even you who usually have great control over yourself

298
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,170
could get driven this far by it.

299
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,850
We’re like these flowers.

300
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,520
Withered.

301
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,970
Though we have a tough body,

302
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,540
it is senseless.

303
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,160
We just live day after day.

304
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,510
My order has to be carried out quickly,

305
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,910
thoroughly,

306
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,300
and in complete secrecy.

307
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,800
Got it?

308
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,150
Yes, Mr. Nakan.

309
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,360
Mr. Nakan.

310
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,540
The most suspicious one is called Tonkla.

311
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,040
I’ve got his name from The Service.

312
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,350
Tonkla was working part-time
	at our Amarita event.

313
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,730
The Golden Blood.

314
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,620
This must be why Mr. Mark is mingling at the university.

315
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
I will try to prove

316
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,270
whether this boy has the Golden Blood.

317
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,700
No need.

318
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,000
I know a way.

319
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,670
[Thara: Tong]

320
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,260
[Thara: Tong]
	[Thara: Something urgent came up this morning.]

321
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,000
[Thara:	Can I give you a lift in the afternoon instead?]
	[Thara: Or you can just take a sick leave for today.]

322
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,090
[Thara: Something urgent came up this morning.]
	[Thara:	Can I give you a lift in the afternoon instead?]
	[Thara: Or you can just take a sick leave for today.]

323
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,840
[Thara: Or you can just take a sick leave for today.]

324
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,480
[Thara: Or you can just take a sick leave for today.]
	[Tong: It’s alright, Miss Thara.]

325
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,440
[Tong: It’s alright, Miss Thara.]
	[Tong: If there’s anything, I’ll make sure to call you.]

326
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,260
I told you
	that if you’re still unwell

327
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,920
then just take a sick leave.

328
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,390
Why are you pushing it?

329
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,680
I got this.

330
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,910
By the way,
	where’s Mr. Mark these days?

331
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,930
He used to follow you around everywhere

332
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,260
and so attached to you.

333
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,170
I haven’t seen him these days.

334
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,130
Where is he now?

335
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,900
Why?

336
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,900
I reckon you used to not like him.

337
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,990
Shielding me from him and all.

338
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,440
That’s right, though.

339
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,340
I didn’t like him very much at first.

340
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,960
But the more I get to know him,
	he’s not a bad guy after all.

341
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,940
Also, he likes to buy us meals.

342
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,820
You pig!

343
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,650
Come on!

344
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,650
Do you not like Mark?

345
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,280
Like?

346
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,380
I don’t like him.

347
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,240
I mean
	him buying us food.

348
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,360
Yeah!

349
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,360
I don’t like it when he buys me food.

350
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,440
When he’s nice to me.

351
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,550
When he meddles with my life.

352
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,830
Then suddenly,

353
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,710
he just disappears whenever he wants.

354
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,450
Do you really not like him?

355
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,080
I don’t like him!

356
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,640
Oh!

357
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,320
Is it that

358
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,020
the kiss thing you asked me that night…

359
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,240
Don’t tell me…

360
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,110
Tong!

361
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,750
Students.

362
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,770
Let’s go standby at the stage.

363
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,970
It’s almost your turn.

364
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,770
Yes, Professor.

365
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,050
Since today is our faculty’s Open House Day,

366
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,880
I would like to introduce a new lecturer

367
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,090
of the Department of Comparative Literature.

368
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,800
He will be giving a lecture on

369
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,860
“The Dynamics of Language in a Digital World”.

370
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
Welcome, Professor Nakan.

371
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,200
Please give a round of applause.

372
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,140
Thank you very much, Professor Nakan.

373
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,880
I think you look even paler.

374
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,230
You should go home and rest.

375
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,560
I’ll go after tidying up this booth.

376
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,830
It’s alright, dude.

377
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,120
Hello, students.

378
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,390
Oh!

379
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
Hello, professor.

380
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,590
What a coincidence.

381
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,800
Indeed!

382
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,810
I didn’t know you teach here too.

383
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,820
Let’s say,

384
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,590
it’s fate.

385
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,610
Since we’re on it,

386
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,770
would you like to help out
	at my new product launching event?

387
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,120
Wow.

388
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,650
You’re offering it to me yourself,

389
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,200
so how can I turn it down?

390
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,280
I’m down.

391
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,320
- Tong, would you take this to the activity room?
	- Thank you for the offer.

392
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,310
My pleasure.

393
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,030
Okay.

394
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,820
Tong!

395
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,460
Tong!

396
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,230
What’s wrong?

397
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,830
Tong!

398
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:05,840
What’s wrong?

399
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,820
Are you okay?

400
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,040
Get up.

401
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,480
Let’s go to the infirmary.

402
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,570
Let’s go.

403
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,560
Let’s go.

404
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,750
Let’s go.

405
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,870
I told you not to push it.

406
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,890
Should have stayed at home in the first place.

407
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
I'll bring you some fever relief.

408
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,850
Oh, Tong.

409
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,990
Shall we wait outside?

410
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,670
Yes, Prof.

411
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,080
I'll be waiting out front.

412
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,840
What was that kiss just now, then?

413
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,320
Because of the Golden Blood.

414
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,430
Was that your friend?

415
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,410
Oh, yes.

416
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,480
Tong is my friend from the orphanage.

417
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
That’s why we have to work extra jobs.

418
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,920
If I were to help you guys out with a scholarship,

419
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,270
what would you say?

420
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,840
Really?

421
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,760
Think of it as my privilege as a special lecturer

422
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,250
for a special student.

423
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,300
Wow, Prof.

424
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,440
You’re helping me out so much.

425
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,920
Are you expecting something from me?

426
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,990
By the way,

427
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,670
what about Mark?

428
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,710
How did you get to know him?

429
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,950
He’s in our group

430
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,310
but I'm not so close to him.

431
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,680
He’s Tong’s friend.

432
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,710
Excuse me,

433
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,710
where’s that student who was sick?

434
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,720
What?

435
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,700
What do you mean?

436
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,670
Didn't I tell you

437
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,770
to watch over Tong from afar?

438
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,270
I’m so sorry.

439
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,880
But Nakan has already infiltrated as a professor at the university.

440
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,360
That still doesn’t mean that

441
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,360
you can go against my order without telling me, Mark.

442
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,480
Miss Thara.

443
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,000
Please have a seat.

444
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,090
Your condition is deteriorating every day,

445
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,720
please let me take care of Tong.

446
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,030
Then Nakan would realize that Tong is special.

447
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,690
We have to make everything as ambiguous as possible

448
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,810
so that Tong wouldn’t be in danger.

449
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,990
All this is for Tong’s sake

450
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
and also for your own good.

451
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
So,

452
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,650
this will be the last time you get to see Tong.

453
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,120
Do you understand, Mark?

454
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,020
(I was in the middle)

455
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,130
(before I knew)

456
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,740
(that I had begun.)

457
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,270
Some herbs for blood nourishment.

458
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,680
Thank you.

459
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,660
I miss the wonderful memories
	between you and him.

460
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,800
Right.

461
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,660
I’m also curious.

462
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,660
If he were still alive today,

463
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,890
how would he be?

464
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,210
But it’s normal

465
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,550
for us to face many lives coming and leaving.

466
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,690
Is the love between us and humans

467
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,080
even possible?

468
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
It’s impossible.

469
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,390
Because we don’t feel ‘love’.

470
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,640
Don’t you ever longed for love?

471
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,270
Guess there is too much pollen here.

472
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,580
Tong.

473
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,640
You seem to care a lot about him.

474
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,400
If there’s any problems between you guys,

475
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,940
I think you should talk it out.

476
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,690
He suddenly disappeared.

477
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,080
What if something bad actually happened to him?

478
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,020
How would I know?

479
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,220
If you’re worried about him then go see him.

480
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,530
Quit playing around.

481
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,740
You’re overreacting.

482
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,260
Tong.

483
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,390
I’m being dead serious.

484
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,820
This whole week,

485
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,560
ever since you were sick,

486
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,510
I think your head is really somewhere else.

487
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,100
If Mark were here,

488
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,090
he would be cushioning you all the time.

489
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,340
And about what happened at the Open House event,

490
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,470
you keep going on about something

491
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,910
and if that wasn’t about Mark,
	then I don’t know what else.

492
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
Fine.

493
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,050
Shall we go?

494
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,670
Everyone’s already left.

495
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,020
It might rain soon.

496
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,850
Here.

497
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,360
Take this umbrella.

498
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,770
So you don't have to be the hero
	in a rainy movie scene like that day.

499
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,780
Let’s go.

500
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,180
Aunty Wan, is Mark here?

501
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,610
It’s good that you came, Tong.

502
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Everything seems so odd.

503
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,900
What do you mean?

504
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Did he just become like this?

505
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,380
Yes.

506
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
I saw him sneezing a little yesterday

507
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,260
but I’ve never seen him like this before.

508
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,620
I can’t explain it either.

509
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,020
I think Mark caught a cold.

510
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,220
I’ll take care of him.

511
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,890
Then, I’ll leave Mr. Mark to you.

512
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,990
These are definitely symptoms of a cold.

513
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,610
Looks like he’s just got a cold for the first time.

514
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,940
Mister.

515
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,780
Wake up and have some medicine.

516
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,930
Easy there.

517
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,230
What?

518
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,560
Are you alright?

519
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,380
The path might have become different for us

520
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,500
but the goal

521
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,100
is to stay alive.

522
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,310
To find ways to live peacefully with humans.

523
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,490
Once you’re ready,

524
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
you will become my right-hand man.

525
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,420
We’ll drive our world forward together.

526
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,500
One day, you will become the leader of our family.

527
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,920
Will I be numb like this

528
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,930
forever?

529
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,100
Though you won’t have feelings like humans

530
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,420
but don’t you fear,

531
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,040
you will have me

532
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,180
and you will grow with it.

533
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,940
(Yes,)

534
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,010
(I was numb.)

535
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,300
(But ever since I met Tong…)

536
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,120
You smell so nice.

537
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,830
(Everything was never the same.)

538
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,370
Wake up and drink some water.

539
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,780
I’ll get you some water.

540
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,370
Stay with me.

541
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,970
Are you high on the medicines?

542
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,620
If my Golden Blood can help you,

543
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,140
then I’ll stay.

544
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,080
It’s not like that.

545
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,860
I admit it,

546
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,640
in the past, I might have wanted to kiss you

547
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,480
because of the Golden Blood.

548
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,410
But now that I’m sick,

549
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,110
I can’t taste or smell anything,

550
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,090
yet I still…

551
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,620
I’m sure that this kiss

552
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,210
wasn’t because of the Golden Blood.

553
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,140
It’s from my true feelings.

554
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,890
Feelings that…

555
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,520
I’ve never felt before in my life.

556
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,280
What about you?

557
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,720
How do you feel about me?

558
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,280
Do you think people can kiss

559
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,940
without any feelings for each other?

560
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,910
When you get to kiss someone,

561
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,320
your feelings will tell you the difference.

562
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,980
♪ Just you and me tonight ♪

563
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,880
♪ Just you and me tonight ♪

564
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,720
♪ Just you and me tonight ♪

565
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,030
Aren’t you afraid of me?

566
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,110
Because you’re a vampire?

567
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,860
♪ Can you please stay here by my side? ♪

568
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,180
(This is the first time I love and care for someone.)

569
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,010
(If vampires are withered flowers,)

570
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,760
(we’ll make them bloom.)

571
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,650
(To receive without fear)

572
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,080
(is probably better than running away.)

573
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,640
(To love and lose)

574
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,460
(is probably better than never having loved at all.)

575
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,700
(If I were to kiss you then go to hell,)

576
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,580
(I would.)

577
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,450
(So then I can brag with the devils,)

578
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,660
(that I saw heaven without entering it.)

579
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,560
(If I were to kiss you then go to hell,)

580
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,430
(I would.)

581
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,710
(So then I can brag with the devils,)

582
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,670
(that I saw heaven without entering it.)

583
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,440
What about Mark?

584
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,070
How did you get to know him?

585
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,620
He’s in our group

586
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,950
but I'm not so close to him.

587
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,300
He’s Tong’s friend.

588
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,860
I still stand my ground.

589
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,660
There’s nothing you should be cautious about.

590
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,820
No matter what happens,

591
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,080
I will endure it.

592
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,430
If you do this,

593
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,300
what would you do if I can’t hold back?

594
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,420
Tong went missing?

595
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,860
Help!
