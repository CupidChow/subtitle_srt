5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,810
Happy one monthsary being together, Tong.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,410
you’re way more head over heels than I thought.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,340
But I’m glad

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,820
to have you with me.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,140
I’m warning you out of goodwill, Tong.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,790
Thara is more cunning than you think.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,690
Mark is no different.

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,830
If Nakan had you,

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,630
what would happen then.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,210
What?

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,220
Why?

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,530
It is not because of the Golden Blood.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,020
But I’m afraid of losing you.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,050
No matter what anyone says,

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,640
I will trust in you, Mark.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,789
You trust in me, right?

21
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,290
Mark.

22
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,790
Mark.

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,790
Did I fall asleep?

24
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,720
Not only did you fall asleep

25
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,480
you probably had a dream too.

26
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,470
I was so happy.

27
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,760
In your dream?

28
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,250
Both in my dream

29
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,560
and last night.

30
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,350
Stop it.

31
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,460
Enough chatting.

32
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,870
I’ll get washed up.

33
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,360
Why?

34
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,870
Are you shy?

35
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
Enough.

36
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,650
Out with you.

37
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
What are you looking at?

38
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,430
There’s no need to be shy.

39
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,370
You told me last night

40
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,710
that I can do anything I want.

41
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,410
That was last night.

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,880
The quota is out today.

43
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,490
Nakan has to attend a meeting abroad on my behalf.

44
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,490
He probably won’t be able to bother you for a while.

45
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,040
You guys will be safe.

46
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,070
Alright, Miss Thara.

47
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,050
Mark.

48
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,650
Get connected with our network abroad.

49
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,000
Immediately.

50
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,590
Yes, Miss Thara.

51
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,140
When I get weaker,

52
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,760
the war for power would probably worsen.

53
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,960
I want to be of some help to you guys.

54
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,470
You’ve helped us a lot, Tong.

55
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,780
But there’s one thing I’m worried about.

56
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,770
What is it?

57
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,830
You and Mark

58
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,920
have crossed the bodyguard line already, right?

59
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,450
You know what I’m talking about, yes?

60
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Yes.

61
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,380
Me and Mark are dating.

62
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
I don't want to hide it from you.

63
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,860
That’s what I’m worried about.

64
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,780
I’m afraid you would get hurt.

65
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,520
The infatuation Mark has for you

66
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,580
is not love.

67
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,410
It might be just

68
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,890
the power of the Golden Blood.

69
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,130
When you turn 21,

70
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,840
Mark won’t need to look after the Golden Blood anymore.

71
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,299
Your feelings for each other

72
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,010
Might become less.

73
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,630
Is that right?

74
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,130
The love between a human and us,

75
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,150
has never happened.

76
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,060
We’ve never had feelings.

77
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
Not even taste.

78
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Everything that Mark has

79
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Is because of the Golden Blood.

80
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,140
Even if you guys are really in love,

81
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,750
Mark is immortal but you are mortal.

82
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,850
The one who would get hurt the most is Mark.

83
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,570
You know what you have to do from now, right?

84
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,590
You want me and Mark

85
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,590
to stop dating?

86
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,780
While Nakan is not here

87
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,270
is probably the best time

88
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,790
for you and Mark to try

89
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,250
and detach from each other little by little.

90
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,170
You will do it for Mark, right, Tong?

91
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,710
Mark.

92
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,300
I think

93
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,850
I will sleep at the apartment tonight.

94
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,650
Why?

95
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,150
Did I do something wrong?

96
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
No.

97
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,590
I’m just worried about Tonkla.

98
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,710
I wasn’t talking nicely to him yesterday

99
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,050
so I thought I wanted to have a talk with him.

100
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,200
Then I’ll come along.

101
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,630
It’s alright.

102
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,150
I just need to make up with Tonkla.

103
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,130
You don’t have to worry.

104
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,670
Miss Thara said the BoD is keeping its eyes on Nakan.

105
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,680
Nakan won’t dare hurt humans or anyone.

106
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,220
Tong, did anything happen?

107
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,470
It’s really nothing.

108
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,970
I just…

109
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,090
want to be alone with Tonkla.

110
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,980
Are you not going to answer my calls at all?

111
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,500
I’ve been calling you so many times.

112
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,570
Can I even talk to you?

113
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,450
You’re full of secrets.

114
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,690
You make me feel like I’m an outsider.

115
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,240
I feel like
it’s good living alone like this.

116
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,020
Kla, I’ve never thought of you that way.

117
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,190
You never tell me anything.

118
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,010
But I really had to.

119
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,340
Mark said it’s better if it’s kept a secret.

120
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,190
I don’t even care what the secret is about.

121
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
I’m sad that you don’t trust me.

122
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,910
How could you choose Mark yesterday?

123
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,380
Don’t you think I was worried about you?

124
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,130
I was lying shaking all night,

125
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,200
afraid that you might get eaten up by Mark.

126
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,670
I’m safe, Kla.

127
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,190
Mark didn’t do anything to me.

128
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,740
Did Mark really not hurt you?

129
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,210
Yes.

130
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,600
He only protects and takes care of me.

131
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,820
Then between me and Mark,

132
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,730
who are you closer to?

133
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,030
Come on.

134
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,310
Even if I have someone,

135
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,350
I still love you like

136
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:24,950
like…

137
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,850
I can die for you, Kla.

138
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,000
Die my butt.

139
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,170
You’re not mad at me anymore, right?

140
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:33,970
No.

141
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,050
Are you really happy being with Mark?

142
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,890
I am.

143
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,490
That’s good.

144
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
As a friend, I just want you to see you happy.

145
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,960
Tong.

146
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,730
Do you know what my dream is?

147
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,400
What?

148
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,720
In my life,

149
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
I just want to see you doing well in everything.

150
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,610
School,

151
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,190
work,

152
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,810
and love.

153
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh!

154
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,040
The basketball championship this year too.

155
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,040
Because the 50,000 Baht prize is going to be mine.

156
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,200
You started it out nicely.

157
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,490
I almost felt moved.

158
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,070
Then don't you worry,

159
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,950
I will make your dream come true.

160
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,170
What can you even do for me?

161
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:52,930
What?

162
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,180
Are you underestimating me?

163
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,970
Oh, boy.

164
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,760
Look there, my friend.

165
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,860
What am I supposed to see?

166
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,940
Your dream!

167
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,200
Look.

168
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,170
Look ahead.

169
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,550
Shoot!

170
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,580
Come on.

171
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,380
Let’s go.

172
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,040
Come on, bring it together.

173
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,650
Come on.

174
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,630
Come on.

175
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,450
Hurry up.

176
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,850
Tomorrow is the final.

177
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,610
The 50,000 Baht prize

178
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,090
must be ours.

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,650
So today, get lots of rest.

180
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,430
Come on, 1…2…3…

181
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,370
Yay!

182
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,090
Where’s the drinks?

183
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,840
Here.

184
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,450
Thanks.

185
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,040
Does your wrist hurt, Tong?

186
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,590
It’s alright.

187
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,890
I’ll take care of it.

188
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,090
The infatuation Mark has for you

189
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,370
is not love.

190
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,050
It might be just

191
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,490
the power of the Golden Blood.

192
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,210
Did you hurt your wrist?

193
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,310
Why are you so careless?

194
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,400
Pae, give me some medicine.

195
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,330
One second.

196
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,910
Here, give me your hand.

197
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,600
Put it on yourself.

198
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,109
Did you guys fight?

199
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,300
Anything’s up?

200
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,050
I have something to talk to you about.

201
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,790
What is it?

202
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,020
These days, I’ve been acting weird

203
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,140
because I don’t know what to do.

204
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,980
If there’s anything, just say it, Tong.

205
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,710
It’s better than avoiding me.

206
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,030
Miss Thara asked me to break up with you

207
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,820
because the thing between us is impossible.

208
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,070
The feelings that you have for me

209
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
might just be the power of the Golden Blood.

210
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,260
And what do you think, Tong?

211
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,150
I don’t know.

212
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,150
I just know that I love you

213
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,610
and I don’t want to break up with you.

214
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,770
I know it’s selfish

215
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,830
that one day, I would have to age and die

216
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,470
while you still have to be here.

217
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,890
So if everything was because of the Golden Blood…

218
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,830
Tong.

219
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,030
All these things

220
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
have never happened to us before

221
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,700
and no one knows what's going to happen in the future.

222
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,440
Frankly speaking,

223
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,990
I also don’t know if what happened to me

224
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,780
was because of the Golden Blood.

225
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,740
But one thing’s for sure,

226
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,830
I’m very happy.

227
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,220
I’ve never felt this way before in my life.

228
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,740
So I’m begging you

229
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,030
to give me a chance to prove myself.

230
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,660
It’s the chance for both of us.

231
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,210
On your birthday next year
when the blood’s power is worn out.

232
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,320
I will prove to you

233
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,590
that even without the Golden Blood,

234
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,030
I will be with you.

235
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,980
Both of you owe me.

236
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,720
For what?

237
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,590
Well,

238
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,890
of me making the history for the vampires’ world.

239
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,230
You? Making history?

240
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,820
I'm the Cupid

241
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,650
who made a vampire and a human fall in love.

242
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,490
Mark, did you know

243
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,480
that Tong making up with you

244
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,250
was all my plan.

245
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,350
Therefore, you have to pay the debt

246
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,020
by paying for my Mookata tonight.

247
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,150
Actually, no.

248
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,200
You have to pay for the entire year.

249
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,070
Sure.

250
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,700
From now on, if you want to eat anything,

251
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,690
just let me know.

252
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,430
Nonetheless,

253
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,530
I still don’t trust you, Mr. Mark.

254
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,830
You’ve been a vampire for hundreds of years.

255
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,620
You must have had countless partners.

256
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,020
You could be playing my friend.

257
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,600
And my friend here

258
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,850
is pretty dumb.

259
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,600
You’re shading me now?

260
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,360
Since you have a mother-in-law already,

261
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,250
I will be your father-in-law.

262
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,580
What mother and father-in-law?

263
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,760
Me and Mark are just boyfriends.

264
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,590
You’re blushing.

265
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,140
Sure.

266
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,210
Then, please take me in officially,

267
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,110
Mr. Father-in-law.

268
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,980
Wait a second.

269
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,310
What’s going on?

270
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,290
You’re in it too, Mark?

271
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,180
Just sleep.

272
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,140
I got this.

273
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,630
Thanks to Nakan,

274
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,620
we get to live together again.

275
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,290
It’s because he knows all our hideouts.

276
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,250
So there’s no need to hide.

277
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,410
When Thara becomes powerful again,

278
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,210
you and everyone will be safe.

279
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,000
I’m also happy
that Tonkla is living with us again.

280
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,310
Actually,

281
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,290
I want to live alone with you.

282
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,150
When I turn 21,

283
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,780
let’s go full lovey-dovey.

284
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,240
When that time comes,

285
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,240
tell me wherever you want to go.

286
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,290
I’ll take you everywhere.

287
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,320
That’s great.

288
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,860
Then I’ll make a list.

289
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,070
I’m sleepy.

290
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,240
Goodnight.

291
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,890
Hey!

292
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,590
What are you doing?

293
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,480
Tonkla is right here.

294
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,170
Hmm?

295
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,330
That’s alright.

296
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,600
Get off.

297
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
We don’t have to be this close.

298
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,980
We’re usually even closer.

299
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,150
There’s no need to be shy.

300
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,590
Fine.

301
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,420
Just this time

302
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,990
that I’ll let you off the hook.

303
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,330
Kla, if you don’t study,

304
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,190
I won’t tutor you anymore.

305
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,010
Damn it!

306
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,520
I don’t feel like reading anymore.

307
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,930
Can you believe it? Nothing registers in my brain.

308
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,750
Today is the finals, Tong!

309
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,650
But if you don’t study

310
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,450
This will be the final of your life too.

311
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,710
You’re nagging like Miss Nuan.

312
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,880
Fine, I’ll study.

313
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,530
Argh!! I can’t get myself together!

314
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,110
Hey, can you help Tonkla?

315
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,280
Can you use your vampire ability to make our team win?

316
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,860
Why should I do that?

317
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,470
The 3 of us are in the same team.

318
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,150
My power is not to be used pointlessly like that.

319
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,140
It’s for helping people.

320
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,270
Think of doing it for my sake.

321
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,340
I’ve never seen Tonkla so excited and serious over anything this much.

322
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,450
I’m afraid he’d be disappointed.

323
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,540
Please?

324
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,130
What would I get if I helped?

325
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,270
You haven’t even played

326
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,210
but you’re asking for the prize already, Mr. Vampire?

327
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,070
A warrior needs a motivation

328
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,630
for him to be more thirsty for victory.

329
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,020
You seem thirsty for something else.

330
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,780
Hey!

331
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,970
Help Kla for once.

332
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,450
See it as doing it for yourself.

333
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,080
Deal.

334
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,620
I give in.

335
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,500
Go, I’ll get stretching.

336
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,030
You keep showing.

337
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,150
Put the shirt on.

338
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,640
If you have something nice,
shouldn’t you show it off?

339
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,400
Wear it already.

340
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,930
Why?

341
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,660
Are you jealous?

342
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,430
Take it.

343
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,630
Urgh!

344
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,160
So annoying.

345
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,160
Go be lovey-dovey somewhere else.

346
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,970
Wow! Big Guy Dome!

347
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,390
Are we having a match until dawn?

348
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,950
The prize is 50,000 and you’ve already spent 5,000 on this stuff.

349
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,270
It's not me.

350
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,750
But we have to thank our sponsor.

351
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,800
Do we have a sponsor?

352
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,550
Yeah.

353
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,790
Keep it up.

354
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,130
This game’s going to be fun.

355
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,890
How did you get here?

356
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,310
I’ve finished my business abroad

357
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,530
so I hurriedly got back.

358
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,810
because I wanted to watch your match.

359
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,630
Our match’s about to start

360
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,170
if you’re here to watch

361
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,780
then sit and watch quietly.

362
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,170
I like this kind of confidence, Tong.

363
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,790
This game’s going to be fun.

364
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,370
Hey! Kla!

365
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,470
I’ll get the inhaler and first-aid kit.

366
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,330
Keep a watch on him, alright?

367
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,360
Sir, we need a time out.

368
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,810
A time-out for the blue team.

369
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,550
Tonkla.

370
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,280
Hey!

371
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,530
Sit down.

372
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,430
Are you alright?

373
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,530
I don’t know,
I just blacked out all of a sudden.

374
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,670
Are you alright?

375
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,390
I’m okay.

376
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,120
I’m alright.

377
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,760
Both teams get on the court.

378
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Hey!

379
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,570
You’re the man, dude!

380
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,370
A secret kick like me didn’t even have to get on the court!

381
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,490
Of course!

382
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,210
We’d better save our secret kick.

383
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,780
50,000!

384
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,630
50,000!

385
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,790
50,000!

386
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,030
(The prototype of the spell disenchanting perfume is done.)

387
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,100
(If it works, we won’t have to be afraid.)

388
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
Do you think it would work?

389
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,400
(We don’t know yet.)

390
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,400
(We could only extract a small amount)

391
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,940
(and there could be side effects we don’t know about.)

392
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,910
(Give the perfume to the one who’s most likely)
(to fall as Nakan’s victim.)

393
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,080
Yes.

394
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,100
Let’s celebrate tonight!

395
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,930
Mookata, of course!

396
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,390
Cheers!

397
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,280
Sorry for not being able to join you guys.

398
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,080
Hey, Mark,

399
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,520
take good care of Tong.

400
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,300
I’m keeping my eyes on you.

401
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,690
Alright, father-in-law.

402
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,690
Alright.

403
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,600
I’ve never seen Tonkla so hyped.

404
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,520
He must be so happy to win.

405
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,830
You do know, right?

406
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,350
That I’m also waiting for a prize from you.

407
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,570
What prize?

408
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,430
I want it like that night.

409
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,050
Like this?

410
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,180
Like this?

411
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,910
Yes,

412
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,150
this is it.

413
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,810
It doesn't hurt anymore, does it?

414
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,800
The mouth doesn’t.

415
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,270
I thought I’d become much more tender last night.

416
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,350
Don’t you smile.

417
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,070
I told you to stop but you won’t listen.

418
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,900
I don’t remember hearing that word.

419
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,920
Wow!

420
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,720
Chef Mark!

421
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,120
You didn't get takeout and just heated it up, right?

422
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,250
My senses have become much better.

423
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,270
Especially, smell.

424
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,510
I can tell everything apart

425
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,040
especially Tong’s smell.

426
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,020
Smells the nicest.

427
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:52,970
That’s

428
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,490
thanks to my blood.

429
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,580
Oh.

430
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,880
While we’re on the topic of your blood.

431
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,460
This is just the prototype.

432
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,240
It might work only temporarily.

433
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,760
We still have to try it out.

434
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,130
If it really works,

435
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,320
we can stop worrying about my friends being safe.

436
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,000
But this bottle is enough for only one person.

437
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,660
I think

438
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,090
we should give it to Tonkla.

439
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,860
You and Tonkla take the exams in the Theatre room.

440
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,180
I have to go to the third floor.

441
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,410
That’s good.

442
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,010
We should stay a bit apart.

443
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,830
What shall we eat after exams?

444
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,990
I mean a meal!

445
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,280
Stop thinking about that stuff for once.

446
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,010
I’m not a human

447
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,750
I don’t have time to be hungry all the time.

448
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,930
Get going already.

449
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,070
Get the exams done quickly

450
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,630
and meet me in front of the exam room.

451
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,140
I’m ready for the test.

452
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,140
I thought you would be throwing up

453
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,320
not being able to come and take the test.

454
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,020
Oh, dude.

455
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,310
2 pints has got nothing on me.

456
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,300
Congratulations on making it out alive.

457
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,000
What’s this?

458
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,210
Remember when I said,

459
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,310
Mark is making something
that would protect us from Nakan’s power?

460
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,230
This is the prototype.

461
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,330
Try it on.

462
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:47,970
Hey!

463
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,030
I’m not done yet, Kla!

464
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,590
If it keeps you safe,

465
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,440
I have nothing to fear.

466
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,050
Are you okay?

467
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,970
Why are you doing that?

468
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,830
To ask for blessings.

469
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,950
We don’t know what side effects it would have.

470
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,490
Better safe than sorry.

471
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,950
Right.

472
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,640
Head into the exam room already.

473
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,200
I'll go to the bathroom and then go in.

474
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,740
Are you okay?

475
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,050
Yeah, go.

476
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,880
Then, don’t be late.

477
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,470
Yeah, yeah. Go.

478
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,150
After you.

479
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,810
Okay.

480
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,510
Tonkla must be in the toilet, professor.

481
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,400
I’m not sure if he has a bad stomach.

482
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,290
I don’t know what’s wrong with Tonkla.

483
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,310
He fell down, hit his head, and lost lots of blood.

484
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,310
He’s in the infirmary right now.

485
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,010
Professor, excuse me.

486
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,020
If you leave the exam room,

487
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,300
you will not be able to take this exam.

488
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,600
Excuse me, Professor.

489
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,210
I will take the re-test.

490
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,990
Kla!

491
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,850
(Hey! Where are you taking Tong?)

492
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,590
Hey!

493
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,430
You can’t leave the exam room!

494
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,770
Dome!

495
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,570
Hey! Someone took Tong.

496
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,600
That way!

497
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,290
Are you sure, Dome?

498
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,390
Watch out, Mark!

499
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,570
Pae is taking Tong somewhere.

500
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,150
I bet she’s been hypnotized.

501
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,500
I couldn’t find Tong.

502
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,030
Why wouldn’t Trojan Horses work?

503
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,620
It depends on which horse you use.

504
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,680
Hey, I’ll help Pae look for the stuff.

505
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,460
She couldn’t find it.

506
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,010
Watch Tonkla, I’ll be right back.

507
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,610
Pae! Have you found it?

508
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,170
Tonkla is not my only horse.

509
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,870
In my vision, I see a person suffering.

510
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,860
There’s bleeding.

511
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,910
Is it Tong?

512
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,680
I don’t know.

513
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,820
But the person I see is about to die.

514
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,130
The place is an abandoned church.

515
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,540
I’ll send you the location.

516
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,130
Miss Thara.

517
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,470
Miss Thara?

518
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,050
Miss Thara?

519
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,200
Mark, focus on driving for now.

520
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,390
I’m worried about Tong.

521
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,770
It’s good that Tong gave me the perfume

522
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,440
otherwise, it would have been me who kidnapped him.

523
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,470
Remember when I said,

524
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,420
Mark is making something
that would protect us from Nakan’s power?

525
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,670
Tong was protecting me

526
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,260
but I couldn’t help even a damn thing.

527
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,730
Don’t feel guilty.

528
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,240
Because the only one at fault is Nakan.

529
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,030
Mark!

530
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,330
As I’ve promised to you all.

531
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,120
The Golden Blood is in our hands!

532
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,130
The highest power will be ours.

533
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,190
From now on,

534
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Thara will be nothing.

535
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,920
And when the time comes,

536
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,410
I’m the only one

537
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,720
who will get to drink your blood.

538
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,750
Stay still.

539
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,070
Mark, don’t you worry about me.

540
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,420
Go and help Tong first.

541
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,770
Oh!

542
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,820
Shit!

543
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,420
Shhh…

544
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,830
I think you’d better stay put.

545
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,850
Because we’re going to be together for a long time.

546
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,510
What are you actually planning to do?

547
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,770
Why don’t you just drink my blood?

548
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,370
If you’re going to kill me
then just get on with it!

549
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,470
I want the Golden Blood so badly

550
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,190
but it’s not the time yet.

551
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,210
I will keep you around like Thara did.

552
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,060
Pretends to be the good guy

553
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,730
but actually wants to hold all the power alone.

554
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,420
Until when will you keep me?

555
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,250
Mark!

556
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,370
Mark!

557
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:34,760
Mark!

558
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,260
Mark!

559
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,050
The Golden Blood is more almighty than I thought.

560
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,130
It makes a clever person like you

561
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,150
barge in stupidly like this.

562
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,590
Control yourself.

563
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,860
You used to use…

564
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,610
More than this.

565
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,880
Wait and see

566
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,330
who will win in the end.

567
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,210
I hate that confident look on you and Thara.

568
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,760
Why?

569
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,930
Do you think the throne you’re on is that stable?

570
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,140
It’s only a matter of time.

571
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,010
I will tear it down!

572
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:42,940
Hurry up, Kla.

573
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,590
Don’t be afraid.

574
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,940
It’s okay.

575
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,420
Hurry up, Kla.

576
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,910
Almost there.

577
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,740
Kla!

578
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:13,940
Kla!

579
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,310
Miss Thara is here!

580
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,340
Mark!

581
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,120
Hurry up and help Kla!

582
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,920
Mark!

583
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,370
Kla…

584
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,010
You,

585
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,730
you can save him, right?

586
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,410
Kla.

587
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,290
Mark…

588
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:43,780
Mark…

589
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,350
Try again.

590
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,290
Mark!

591
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,150
It’s alright.

592
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,290
Mark…

593
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,640
Mark…

594
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,090
Drink…

595
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,930
drink my blood.

596
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,460
You can have my blood.

597
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,110
It will boost your power, right?

598
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,490
Hurry up, Mark!

599
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,490
Mark!

600
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,010
Hey, Tong.

601
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,610
What are you fussing about?

602
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,490
Miss Nuan would definitely scold me

603
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,510
for not taking good care of you.

604
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,010
Stay with me now, Kla.

605
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,430
I only have one friend left.

606
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,680
My dream has come true, dude.

607
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,770
I won the basketball championship.

608
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,620
I got to protect you.

609
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,170
Promise me

610
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,470
to live on, my friend.

611
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:57,990
Kla…

612
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,280
Kla…

613
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,200
Kla…

614
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,350
Kla.

615
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,060
Kla.

616
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,950
Mark.

617
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,160
Kla!

618
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,670
Kla!

619
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,380
They must pay for this.

620
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,130
I promise.

621
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,090
You want me to move in and live with Miss Thara?

622
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,390
Your Mother?

623
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,980
Think of it as living with your Mother-in-law.

624
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,140
I’ll wear your shirt

625
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,000
and you wear mine.

626
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,210
Hey.

627
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,930
So that I can feel like you’re with me all the time.

628
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,710
I would have been even more sad

629
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,600
if I didn’t get a chance to meet you

630
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,170
while living this immortal life.
