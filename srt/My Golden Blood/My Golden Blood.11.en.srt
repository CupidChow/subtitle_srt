Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,770
To think of any house you could live in right now,

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,410
it would have to be Miss Thara’s
that I can trust the most.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,210
If you bring Nakan to justice according to our rules,

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,310
I will let you guys meet

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,890
and we’ll talk about this again.

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,390
Thara is keeping the Golden Blood alive

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,250
Gluay!

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,170
not to protect

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,610
but to kill them when they turn 21.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,370
Tong’s done for.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,420
Help!

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,610
I’m sorry.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,860
Miss Thara.

18
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,430
Your blood?

19
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,130
Yes, the vampires want my blood.

20
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,350
They say it’s the “Golden Blood”.

21
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,450
Vampires?

22
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,860
Don’t cry, my good boy.

23
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,650
Don’t cry, baby.

24
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,050
Please,

25
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,130
don’t harm me.

26
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,150
I’m yielding.

27
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,510
Please stop.

28
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,610
Please.

29
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,590
This boy has hemophilia

30
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,580
please take care of him with extra care.

31
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,390
Alright, Miss Thara.

32
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,030
Thank you so much for your financial support.

33
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,760
Let me know if you need anything.

34
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,650
Alright.

35
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,860
Mark will be taking care of everything from now on.

36
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,290
Yes, Miss Thara.

37
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,550
Ugh, I should take Tong inside.

38
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,610
Let’s go, baby.

39
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,270
This boy is the Golden Blood.

40
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,190
Your duty is to take care of this boy
until he turns 21.

41
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,750
21 years old?

42
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,409
Yes.

43
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,930
He’s the significant human I want you to protect.

44
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Your only duty from now on

45
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,370
is to protect Tong.

46
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,280
Tong.

47
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,130
You can do that, right?

48
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,350
Yes, Miss Thara.

49
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,580
I will protect and look after this boy with my life.

50
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,870
I’m sorry.

51
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,250
You were not born to become anyone’s family.

52
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,130
But you were born for me.

53
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,320
Miss Thara.

54
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,490
I’m the owner of every single drop of blood in your body.

55
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,540
Do you really think that

56
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,380
when you turn 21,

57
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,500
you’re really going to be free?

58
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,720
It’s such a shame.

59
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,590
Had you stayed still just for another couple of days,

60
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,840
you would get to leave this world

61
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,930
without learning the painful truth.

62
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,180
All these times,

63
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,730
you weren’t just being kind to me.

64
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,130
You only wanted my blood.

65
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,700
That’s all?

66
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,390
It’s true that you are adorable

67
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,670
but what can I do?

68
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,140
I’m not going to lose anything I’ve built

69
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,740
just because my power’s running out.

70
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,090
You are no different from that hell of a vampire

71
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,650
who wanted my blood!

72
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,230
I am different.

73
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,750
I let you grow up this big.

74
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,560
Had it been other people,

75
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,570
they wouldn’t have been able to hold back

76
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,470
and bite your neck from the very first day.

77
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,159
Fortunately, I know the secret that others don’t.

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,570
Once Tong turns 21 years old,

79
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,409
he’s done for.

80
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,380
That’s not true.

81
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,710
Stop lying.

82
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,360
It’s almost your birthday,

83
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,420
breathe as much as you can, Tong.

84
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,110
Mark will come back and save me.

85
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,010
He will learn all the truth.

86
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,610
You think Mark’s going to believe what you say?

87
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,860
Mark will believe me.

88
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,440
Because it’s the truth.

89
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,450
But I’m the one who raised him

90
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,130
and took care of him like a mother.

91
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,370
He will never believe what you say, Tong.

92
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,789
Then you can just let Tong die.

93
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,950
If you're just going to follow orders blindly like a dog,

94
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,050
then you can open your eyes wide

95
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,010
when watching Thara suck out all the blood from your boyfriend’s body

96
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,540
and then kill the other vampires.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,570
This is Tong’s last chance.

98
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,990
You have to get rid of Thara.

99
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,150
Help!

100
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,800
Help!

101
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,170
Help me!

102
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,130
Be quiet!

103
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,990
Even if you beat it until your hands fall out,

104
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,080
you would still die anyway.

105
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,540
Mark!

106
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,610
- Mark!
- 	You can’t enter, Mr. Mark.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,630
Step aside.

108
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,530
Mark!

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,870
Miss Thara locked me in.

110
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,190
She’s going to kill me.

111
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,270
Mark.

112
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,000
Thara wants the Golden Blood.

113
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,340
She’s going to drink my blood, Mark.

114
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,190
She won’t do that, Tong.

115
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,980
That’s not true, Mark.

116
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,630
She was just waiting until I turned 21

117
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,700
then the power of the Golden Blood will be enough

118
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,850
for killing the other vampires.

119
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,450
Mark,

120
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,710
you trust me, right?

121
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,170
We have to run away, Mark.

122
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,750
Before Miss Thara’s here.

123
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,570
Where do you want to run away to?

124
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,470
Mark.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,190
Miss Thara,

126
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,890
what Tong said…

127
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,040
When the power of the Golden Blood starts to wane

128
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,540
the human body will react by lashing out.

129
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,470
A delusion, just like this.

130
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,470
Delusion my ass!

131
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,250
Calm down, Tong.

132
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,320
I know your head is a mess

133
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,170
but you have to get yourself together

134
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,150
and realize

135
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,780
that I’m the one protecting you.

136
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,990
That’s not true.

137
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,850
That’s not true, Mark.

138
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,320
You’re going to kill me.

139
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,090
Do you think I could ever do that to Tong?

140
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,190
Mark.

141
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,990
I’m sorry I have to lock Tong in like this.

142
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,110
I was afraid he would hallucinate

143
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,430
and hurt himself

144
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,670
or run away so far that I couldn't protect him.

145
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,280
You see

146
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,370
how bad his hallucination is.

147
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,710
Mark,

148
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,790
you believe me, right?

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,110
Tong is delusional indeed.

150
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,100
Please take care of him, Miss Thara.

151
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,450
Your lover

152
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,970
is like a family to me.

153
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,290
I’ve captured Nakan.

154
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,210
Everything’s ready.

155
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,220
Didn’t you say you would take care of me?

156
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,520
Didn’t you say you trust me?

157
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,850
Mark.

158
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,950
If you leave now,

159
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,700
we’re over.

160
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,790
Mark.

161
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,810
Mark!

162
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,790
Mark!

163
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,170
Will Tong keep on being sick like this?

164
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,700
What would actually happen

165
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,810
when the Golden Blood turns 21?

166
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,340
I’m sorry for not telling you

167
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,930
that something like this would happen.

168
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,970
It’s okay.

169
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,210
It’s the first time

170
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,900
I get to take care of the Golden Blood

171
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,230
unlike you who have handled a few.

172
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,920
Don’t worry.

173
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,220
All the Golden Bloods are like this.

174
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,790
They will get better eventually.

175
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,060
Then where are the rest of them?

176
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,070
I sent them abroad for safety reasons.

177
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,740
After they are out of my care,

178
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,160
all the Golden Bloods

179
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,920
will never have to suffer because of us again.

180
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,100
I’ve sent them to the best places.

181
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,830
Are you sure they’re all safe?

182
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,970
I am sure.

183
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,310
Your definition of ‘safe’ and one for me

184
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,010
must be too different.

185
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,760
Hey!

186
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,860
Hey!

187
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,450
Don’t!

188
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:23,990
Mark.

189
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,970
Hey!

190
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,990
Mark.

191
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,470
What did you do to Mark?

192
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,970
Follow me.

193
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
Thara sent you here, right?

194
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,810
I’d rather die than cooperate with that kind of person.

195
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,070
Do you think I’ve forgotten that you killed Tonkla?

196
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,550
I know you’re still upset about me killing Tonkla

197
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,780
but if you don’t come with me now,

198
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,010
Thara will kill you too.

199
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,130
What's your choice going to be?

200
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,030
Stop hesitating.

201
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,580
Mark’s risking his life trying to save you.

202
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,660
I trusted you all along.

203
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,560
What did Nakan tell you?

204
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,510
He just told me

205
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,550
where the other Golden Bloods are.

206
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,580
And you trusted him?

207
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,650
He’s playing with your head,
do you know that?

208
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,250
He wasn’t playing with my head.

209
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,430
He only told me the truth

210
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,980
of who you actually are.

211
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,570
All the Golden Bloods, after they’ve turned 21,

212
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,720
were killed by Thara

213
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
and buried here.

214
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,180
Since when did you find out about this?

215
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,420
Why did no one know about this?

216
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,870
Who would have believed it if I said it out loud?

217
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,750
Thara gets rid of everyone who gets in the way.

218
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,580
I want to take revenge on Thara

219
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,840
for killing my friend

220
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,270
because of the Golden Blood.

221
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
A revenge?

222
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,570
You’ve tasted Tong’s blood already, right?

223
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,890
You’re the only one who can help me fight Thara.

224
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,800
Do you remember that you’ve vowed

225
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,570
to be loyal only to me.

226
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,790
That was before I knew the entire truth.

227
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,430
I’m powerful

228
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,790
because I have to protect all of us.

229
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,530
If you go against that
then you’re the enemy to all of us!

230
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,790
Vengeance could only get you this far, Mark.

231
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
Because right now,

232
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Tong’s life is in my hands.

233
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,340
You’re wrong.

234
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,369
Tong’s life is in Nakan’s hands.

235
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,290
Get them!

236
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,900
Wait, didn’t you say you would wait for Mark?

237
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,480
If I didn’t say that,

238
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,830
would you have come with me?

239
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,480
And we’re just going to leave Mark there with Thara?

240
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,110
Mark asked me to save you

241
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,290
and not to worry about him.

242
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,930
How can the two of us run away alone?

243
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,150
Hey.

244
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,390
Stop the car.

245
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,110
I told you to stop the car.

246
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,030
I’m heading back to help Mark.

247
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,120
Hey!

248
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,350
So annoying!

249
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,390
Be quiet!

250
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,110
Someone who can kill a man without blinking an eye

251
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,350
could never understand!

252
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,890
That’s enough.

253
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,070
If Mark knows he can get through it

254
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,860
why would you go back and be a burden to him?

255
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,650
Do you really trust Mark?

256
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,060
(Tong, Nakan will take you somewhere safe.)

257
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,930
(Don’t worry. Trust me and run away with Nakan.)

258
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,580
(I’ll come and get you once everything’s over.)

259
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,710
What you have to do right now is come with me.

260
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,940
Where did you hide Tong?

261
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,780
Think carefully, Mark.

262
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,980
You know what I’m capable of.

263
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,990
Don’t worry.

264
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,520
You’ll be safe here.

265
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,330
I’m not worried about that.

266
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,570
Are you worried about Mark?

267
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,290
Can you go back and save Mark?

268
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,660
I can’t save Mark.

269
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,190
But don’t worry.

270
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,590
I’ve sent someone to save him.

271
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,370
Tail it.

272
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
It’ll bring us to the Golden Blood.

273
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,770
I’ll check on it.

274
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,550
Move aside.

275
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,680
Mark!

276
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,170
You seem worried sick about me

277
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,190
so that was worth it.

278
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,550
Who told you to do something so risky?

279
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,390
Ouch!

280
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,120
I can’t be happy
if anything happened to you.

281
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,780
Tong.

282
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,280
Easy on the grab,

283
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,350
I was just kidding.

284
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,370
I can feel pain now.

285
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,010
Fine, I’ll forgive you.

286
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,360
Since you’re doing it for us.

287
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,250
Everything I did

288
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,890
was for us to be together.

289
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,090
Are you sad about Thara?

290
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,770
Sad is one thing

291
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,180
but I’m rather disappointed.

292
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,490
And I’m so upset

293
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,800
that I didn’t know anything all along.

294
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
What Thara did was wrong.

295
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,620
Even if the one harmed was not Tong,

296
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,280
I wouldn’t be fine with sacrificing the Golden Blood.

297
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,180
I’m sorry

298
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,040
for making you face the truth like this.

299
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,820
Tong!

300
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,510
It’s not your fault.

301
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,200
I never want to harm anyone.

302
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,910
I want to protect humans

303
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,670
and I want to protect you.

304
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,520
Even if we have to keep running,

305
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,180
but if that means I get to be with you

306
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,980
then I’m willing to.

307
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,450
You don’t have much time left, Mark.

308
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,940
I can’t do it.

309
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,470
I can’t kill Tong.

310
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,410
But the only way that we’ve agreed upon

311
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,300
is that Tong has to die.

312
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,410
There has to be other ways.

313
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,170
Any way that Tong doesn't have to die.

314
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,600
The reason why I let you run away with Tong

315
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,250
was because you asked

316
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,350
to be with Tong for the last time before you guys part.

317
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,610
I can’t do it.

318
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,340
One day, Thara will find him.

319
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,820
No one can escape Thara.

320
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,850
One day, the thing between you guys will have to come to an end.

321
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,150
Tong’s death is the only way we can end this.

322
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,230
And if you don’t do it…

323
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,010
If you don’t!!

324
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,040
I will do it myself.

325
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,320
Have you ever thought

326
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,780
of having a family like that?

327
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,180
There was only Miss Thara

328
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
who was like my only family.

329
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,810
So I didn’t think about building another family.

330
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,860
But now,

331
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,180
Tong is my only family.

332
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,410
Let’s build a small house and live there together.

333
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,770
Let’s have a small library that I like.

334
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,930
As for you,

335
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,950
we can bring all those old stuff and put them together.

336
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,790
If it’s a small house,

337
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,670
it won’t be able to hold all my collectibles.

338
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,830
I will cook for you every day,

339
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,530
every meal until you're sick of it.

340
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,650
We can take turns.

341
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Those things aren’t important at all, Tong.

342
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
As long as we get to be together.

343
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,190
I’m also curious

344
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,570
what our future

345
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,070
has in store for us.

346
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,470
If you can have one superpower

347
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,830
what would you choose?

348
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,270
Stopping time.

349
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,850
Why?

350
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,230
I want to stop the time right now

351
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,550
so that I can be with you forever.

352
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,600
I also want to be with you for a long time.

353
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,550
What about you?

354
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,470
I want to be immortal

355
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,050
so that I can be with you forever.

356
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,350
No matter how old you get,

357
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,500
I will be with you forever.

358
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,090
I will be by your side

359
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,720
because I was born to be yours.

360
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,670
I was born to be yours too.

361
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,310
This is like

362
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
a trial to living together before getting married.

363
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,690
What’s the difference with how we’ve been?

364
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,940
The difference is that this time,

365
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,410
we get to live without fear.

366
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,040
There’s nothing we should or shouldn’t do.

367
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,770
We can just do whatever we want.

368
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,830
I’ll put a ring on you for now.

369
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,770
Aren’t you going to invest in me a little?

370
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,510
It’s called

371
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,850
a rusty style.

372
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,690
I’ll get you a better ring.

373
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,500
Things will get better, Tong.

374
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,670
Not too long,

375
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,470
and everything will end.

376
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,330
There’s no such thing.

377
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,980
I know

378
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,900
how this story will end.

379
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,390
Tong.

380
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,990
Things will end

381
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,190
if I die, right?

382
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,060
One day, Thara will find him.

383
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,550
No one can escape Thara.

384
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,430
One day, the thing between you guys will have to come to an end.

385
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,840
Tong’s death is the only way we can end this.

386
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,890
And if you don’t do it…

387
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,680
If you don’t!!

388
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,510
I will do it myself.

389
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,770
I don’t want to make it difficult for you.

390
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,560
No, Tong.

391
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,570
Not at all.

392
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,270
We’ll be alright.

393
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,540
Both of us will run away together.

394
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,000
Yes?

395
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,390
A human like me

396
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,960
have to die before you one day.

397
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,320
If my death will put an end to everything

398
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,510
and keep Mark safe,

399
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,610
then I’m willing to.

400
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,370
And you want me to hurt you?

401
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,230
Huh?

402
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,370
You want me to kill you?

403
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,270
You can let Nakan do it.

404
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I know he can do it.

405
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,000
Just let Nakan finish me.

406
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,690
Then what, Tong?

407
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,790
Are you going to leave me here alone?

408
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,320
If you leave me

409
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,090
then what’s the point of living?

410
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,870
I told you already, didn’t I?

411
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,430
That I was born to protect you.

412
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,950
If you weren’t here
then what am I supposed to do?

413
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,570
There has to be a way, Tong.

414
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,010
I will protect you, I promise.

415
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,570
Even without Thara,

416
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,750
there will be another vampire who wants to kill me eventually.

417
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:17,640
I can’t make you protect me forever.

418
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,510
Our love should have been beautiful

419
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,160
like in the novels we’ve read.

420
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,590
Who would have known

421
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,990
that it would turn out to be a tragedy like this?

422
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,810
If I have to live without you,

423
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,210
I don’t know how to live.

424
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,530
I’ll choose our ending.

425
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,180
What do you mean, Mark?

426
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
You want me to run away

427
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,350
while you fight Thara?

428
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,120
It’s the only way that I don’t have to kill you.

429
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,310
You said we would run away together.

430
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,790
Even if we’re not together,

431
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,430
as long as I know that you’re safe,

432
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,810
that’s enough.

433
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,410
Run far away

434
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,590
and never come back.

435
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
But this is not what we’ve agreed upon!

436
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,390
I will take responsibility for everything.

437
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,370
Get up!

438
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,450
Now, do you know what I can do

439
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,850
to get what I want?

440
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,340
Search everywhere thoroughly.

441
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,580
There’s nothing, Miss Thara.

442
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,620
You will never get what you want.

443
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,510
Why do you like to make a mess out of things?

444
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,150
Even if we don't die

445
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,470
when in pain,

446
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,910
we feel it no less than humans do.

447
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,570
Huh?

448
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,430
Tell me where Tong is.

449
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
No matter how much you torture me,

450
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,770
you will never get the Golden Blood.

451
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If I cut off your mouth,

452
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,190
you won’t be able to heal anyone anymore.

453
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,910
Go ahead.

454
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,500
Tong!

455
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,140
Tong!

456
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,770
If you have me,

457
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,190
everything will end, right?

458
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,670
Tong.

459
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,790
Don’t do this.

460
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,230
I will go with you.

461
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,120
Just let Mark go

462
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,410
and never harm him again.

463
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,640
You’ve made a smart choice.

464
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,730
Tong.

465
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,410
Please.

466
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,390
Don’t.

467
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,650
I'm sorry

468
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,550
but I think this is the best way out for everyone.

469
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,910
It’s alright, Mark.

470
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,010
The time I spent with you

471
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
was more than worth it.

472
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,210
I want to build a future with you

473
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,510
but I know that won’t be possible.

474
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,650
No, Tong.

475
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,180
Live the rest of this life on my behalf.

476
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,110
Tong!

477
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,510
Let’s go already.

478
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:56,530
Tong!

479
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,480
Tong.

480
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,070
Tong.

481
00:44:59,090 --> 00:44:59,660
Tong.

482
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,990
Tong!

483
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,150
Tong!

484
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,330
Tong!

485
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,590
Tong!

486
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,910
Tong!

487
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,310
You know what, Tong?

488
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,280
With the power of your blood,

489
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,980
it can end the immortal life of any vampire.

490
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,200
It’s time, everyone.

491
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,990
Our holy celebration is about to begin.

492
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,900
Would this really work?

493
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,570
It will work out no matter what.

494
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,190
Because it’s our only way to survive.

495
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,610
Mark is on his way.

496
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,190
You won’t be able to lay a finger on me.

497
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,950
You guys seem to never learn.
