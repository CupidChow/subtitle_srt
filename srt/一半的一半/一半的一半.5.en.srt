9
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,219
He still doesn't know, does he?

10
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,890
He doesn't know
that you have feelings for him.

11
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,500
You said you liked to look at him.

12
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,369
A one-sided love, to be exact.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,739
Not anymore?

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,140
Well...

15
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,390
I like it.

16
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,659
I like to look at him.

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,359
How he cherishes you,

18
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,170
and yearns for you.

19
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,670
Seeing someone
putting in such effort.

20
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,370
It's all so nice.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,379
Ha Won doesn't know
how you feel, does he?

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
No.

23
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,480
I don't want him to know.

24
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,859
You didn't know how much
Ha Won liked you.

25
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,560
I wish that...

26
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,430
he doesn't know too.

(A Piece of Your Mind)

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,860
Why are you following me out?

29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,360
It's late. Let me walk you home.

30
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,300
- So...
- Don't.

31
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,270
- Don't do what?
- Don't do anything.

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,270
But I haven't.

33
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,840
Exactly, and it's all fine.
Don't worry about what Ji Su said...

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,639
- I'll forget it ever happened.
- What...

35
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,680
No, don't even do that either.

36
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,780
What do you mean
you like to look at me?

37
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,050
- Good night.
- Wait for me.

38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,490
I won't do anything.

39
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,560
Are you sure about that though?

40
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,159
Isn't there anything
I can do for you?

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,900
Will you do anything I ask of you?

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,069
Go ahead and ask.

43
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,270
It won't be easy.

44
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,810
That's for me to decide.

45
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,909
You must be in a good mood.

46
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,310
You turned out to be
Ji Su's trigger point,

47
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,580
so of course you are.

48
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,419
Well, it's all true, so good night.

49
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,030
You've got to be kidding me!

50
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,439
Ji Su.

51
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,050
Is it too awkward here?

52
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,050
How about I head to the studio?

53
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,159
You seem to be
more comfortable there.

54
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,379
I'm here at the studio.

55
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,089
Here, let me unplug this.

56
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,629
Is it too dark in here?

57
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,310
Why is this place comforting to you?

58
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,149
You said the sound felt cozy.

59
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,259
Ji Su?

60
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,500
Okay, we'll take it
one step at a time.

61
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,939
After I left Norway,

62
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,480
you repeatedly said this
when you got scared...

63
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,579
on the way home.

64
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,620
Won, I can do this by myself.

65
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,230
I can get used to this.
One step at a time.

66
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,410
So all right.

67
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,480
We'll take it one step at a time.

68
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,029
Did you manage to talk to her?

69
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,560
No, she won't talk to me.

70
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,160
Anyway, just remember
that I know nothing.

71
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,829
We'll end up becoming...

72
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,269
a microphone rental shop
at this rate.

73
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,339
Why can't we record
music like that at my studio?

74
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,670
It pays a lot by the hour.

75
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,740
But Jin Moo brings us a lot of gigs.

76
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,839
How's that any good...

77
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,009
when they bring
their own engineers with them?

78
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,009
We can't put you to use.

79
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,850
I guess this field
is tough to crack, right?

80
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,620
It's the same for every other field.

81
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,160
What if you're 60
when people finally recognize you?

82
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,129
This isn't so bad, you know.

83
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,990
I'm grateful to even have a job.

84
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,259
What a liar.

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,240
You'll probably get your chance
before you turn 60 though.

86
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,709
Gosh.

87
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,750
You can leave those here.

88
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,579
Let me at least put these back.

89
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,279
I'll do that. I forgot that
I had a visitor coming over.

90
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,850
I see.

91
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,320
I'll take that.

92
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,129
Good job today.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,230
Just a second.

94
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,070
My gosh.

95
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,980
Can you get the door for me?

96
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,009
Sure.

97
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,580
Goodness.

98
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,159
I can't believe you.

99
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,669
How can you blurt out my secret?

100
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,940
A one-sided love is supposed
to be kept a secret, you know.

101
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,570
What are you talking about?

102
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,169
Ha Won heard what you said.

103
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,240
Were you with Ha Won?

104
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,179
You said you were at home.

105
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,419
What were you two doing
alone at night?

106
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,179
That's Han Seo Woo.

107
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,990
Leave with an interval.
Don't cross paths with her.

108
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,659
Nothing good will come from meeting.

109
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,519
- Avoid her.
- Why must I do that?

110
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,759
The Kim Ji Su
you are desperate to know about.

111
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,590
Seo Woo knows too much about her.

112
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:54,429
And Seo Woo, in turn, wants to
know about you more than anyone.

113
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,899
However crazy you both get,

114
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,299
the conclusion is Kim Ji Su.

115
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,600
Why even go there?
It's best you don't know.

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,710
Don't even mention Ji Su's name.

117
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,639
Ji Su, Ji Su. You say it the most.

118
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,139
I do?

119
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,610
The address is 47-431 Okin-dong.

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,250
It's a house that doubles as
Ha Won's office.

121
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,220
This is where
we discuss what's important.

122
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,090
It's the shipping address.

123
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,830
That's why he wanted
the plates sent there.

124
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,330
- I guess so.
- The plates.

125
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,269
I know that I sold them,

126
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,600
but why did I?

127
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,539
She doesn't know why she sold them?

128
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,740
(Prescription)

129
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,950
If you keep talking to her,
she finds out herself.

130
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,549
Don't you think it would be nice
to open the window and record here?

131
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,450
Not just a concert hall,

132
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,259
but recordings made at homes
or churches sound nice too.

133
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,620
The sound here is nice.

134
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,190
In a nice church,
the piano sounds nicer.

135
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,799
This house is like that.

136
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,559
I'll try recording something here.

137
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,799
If you do, play it for me.

138
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,269
You bet I will.

139
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,769
Use work as an excuse
to stay here with Won.

140
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,740
Stop it.

141
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,710
Are there any curtains?

142
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,450
- No.
- How far does the sun reach?

143
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,750
It lights the whole living room.

144
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,519
Sunshine is rare in Oslo
and the days are short.

145
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,460
I saw photos from Korea and
there were curtains in every room.

146
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,059
Won and I used to say...

147
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,659
why would they hide from
the precious sunlight?

148
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,330
Sunlight is precious to me too.

149
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,399
- I live in a semi-basement.
- Do you?

150
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,700
Have you been to Ha Won's place?

151
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,940
Of course not.

152
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,240
I wonder how he lives.

153
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,879
- Shall I visit for you?
- You just need an excuse.

154
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,750
Show me this place.

155
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,059
He won't even invite me over.

156
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,860
I'm sending proof that
this is his office.

157
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,830
Ha Won goes there to work.
You go for personal reasons.

158
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,379
- I feel more comfortable.
- What?

159
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,250
I feel more comfortable around you.

160
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,350
Let's pick out some furniture
that will suit this room.

161
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,820
He only needs the minimum.

162
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,019
Won doesn't keep unnecessary things.

163
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,990
Help me out.

164
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,730
Then do me a favor as well.

165
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,399
What is it?

166
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,590
What's odd is,

167
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,860
Ji Su doesn't know
why she sold the plates.

168
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,100
Why did she sell them?

169
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,639
I don't know.

170
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,110
This is where you live?

171
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,090
I send an email.

172
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,960
The shipping address
is too bare. Buy these.

173
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,200
- This is Ji Su's taste.
- We picked them out together.

174
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,669
Buy all these.

175
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,840
That way, she'll do me a favor.

176
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,379
She's always worrying about you.

177
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,309
What's there to worry about me?

178
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm worried about
the person who lives here.

179
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,590
The door looks shabby.

180
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,320
And it looks cold and damp.

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
You're staring at me
a little too obviously.

182
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,240
That was offensive.

183
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,139
I won't say. I scored a big one.

184
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,710
- What is it?
- What will you do for me?

185
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,440
You always ask what I'll do.

186
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,649
Say it, and don't
worry about the severity.

187
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,679
I really will tell you,
so you must do it for me.

188
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,620
I always wake at 2am and 4am.

189
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll call you when I do.

190
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,399
It's quite severe, isn't it?

191
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,139
I'm always awake then.

192
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,870
- Call me.
- I can?

193
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,519
Ji Su agreed to talk to you.

194
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,919
Tomorrow evening.

195
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,559
You're moved.

196
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,590
I did it, didn't I?

197
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,769
- What are you doing?
- Looking at you pitifully.

198
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,210
I'm looking at you pitifully.

199
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,490
Seo Woo.

200
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,529
Thank you.

201
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,460
(2:04am)

202
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,599
(Mr. Dawn)

203
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,210
(Han Seo Woo)

204
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,160
Room service.

205
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,500
- Shall I extend your stay?
- No.

206
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,440
You won't come back to work?

207
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,410
I plan to visit
all the hotels in the chain...

208
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,910
and spend the coupons
I collected on the job.

209
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,309
You never took a holiday.

210
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,750
You must have lots of coupons.

211
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,880
Enjoy your stay.

212
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,410
What about Seo Woo?

213
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,180
She already ate and left.

214
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,549
What are you wearing?

215
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,690
What's wrong with it?

216
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,859
It's just you and me.
Why can't I dress comfortably?

217
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,529
Try and keep the chemistry alive.
I'm going to leave.

218
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,839
Will you please finish your soup?

219
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,119
It's what he used to wear.

220
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,359
Hurry up and send me the list.

221
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,660
Please don't take too long.

222
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,690
Hey, Min Jung.

223
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,799
Did you come early to see me?

224
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,460
Would you like to come with me
to my office?

225
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,069
No, I'll be there after I eat this.

226
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,539
Are you going on a trip?

227
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,640
Dr. Song,
our appointment is at 1:30pm.

228
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,980
- Yes.
- It's 1:15pm right now.

229
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,250
I'll see you on time.

230
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,650
My gosh.

231
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,349
I feel like it's been ages
since I last went on a trip.

232
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,720
I don't know why I live like this.
I always eat gimbaps and sandwiches.

233
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,720
Dr. Song.

234
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,029
Right.

235
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,900
Oh, I almost forgot.

236
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,730
Would you like to participate
in a test experiment?

237
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,799
It's not out in the market yet.

238
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,039
But there's a conversational
AI device...

239
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,839
that can be run based on
your personality and emotions.

240
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,210
What do you think?
Are you interested?

241
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,009
I'll see you at 1:30pm.

242
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,849
Okay, fine.

243
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,880
My goodness.

244
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,450
I bought this a while ago,
so it's still warm.

245
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,289
You can eat this, too.
I'll see you later at my office.

246
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:54,960
Gosh, my back.

247
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:59,200
My back hurts so much because
I'm always sitting in my office.

248
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,670
I heard it's really good
for your menopause...

249
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,599
to always keep your body
moving like this.

250
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,970
See you in 10 minutes. 10 minutes.

251
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,420
Gosh, tuna? I don't want this.

252
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,900
Did you find a place to stay?

253
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,329
Did you come all the way here
to ask me that?

254
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,180
Well, you never answer my calls.

255
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,349
Just go ahead
and enjoy your love life.

256
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,750
You don't need to walk on eggshells.

257
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,990
Gosh, you don't care at all.

258
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,420
I'll go now.

259
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,589
My goodness, you clumsy girl.

260
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,869
Why do you look so down?

261
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,869
Now that I don't have
a lot of work to do,

262
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,440
I keep getting sick.

263
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,480
Why don't you have work to do?
Chang Seob eats the most.

264
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,910
You guys ate a lot as well.

265
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,420
I took such good care of you guys.
You guys ate like pigs.

266
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,019
Look at you yelling at me.
Now, you sound more like yourself.

267
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,759
Then...

268
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,660
why don't you move back in?

269
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,630
I have coupons left
at the hair salon I used to go to.

270
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,329
You can use them instead.

271
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,799
It's my gift.

272
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,089
What time is she
going to talk to you tonight?

273
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:06,890
I'll be in charge of the hardware
and sensor signal.

274
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,089
Do Hyun will be in charge
of the processor and output.

275
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,630
I'm going to be in charge
of the software training.

276
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,259
How far have you tested it?

277
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,069
She won't give me an answer.

278
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,640
Let me help.

279
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,670
- Where are you going?
- Outside to take a break.

280
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,970
Ji Su.

281
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,700
What time do you want
to talk tonight?

282
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,750
Okay.

283
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,519
See you tonight at 6pm. Good luck.

284
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,819
Is she leaving?

285
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,660
Tonight at 6pm.

286
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,500
Finally.

287
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,829
- Good work.
- Thanks.

288
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,329
- Good work.
- Good work.

289
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,799
- Good work.
- Thanks.

290
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,569
Who are you meeting
tonight at 6pm?

291
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,269
Is it near the studio?

292
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,769
Give out our business cards
to everyone you meet.

293
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,339
Let's do our best
to promote the studio.

294
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:07,180
My gosh, we didn't decide
on the location.

295
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,450
Have a seat.

296
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,190
My goodness, hello.

297
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,319
Hey, In Wook.
Let's sit right next to them.

298
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,660
You can get a discount
when you come to practice.

299
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,799
- Why don't I get one?
- I was just about to give you one.

300
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,670
Here.

301
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,579
I heard your wife went on a trip.
Is she not back yet?

302
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,579
No, she's still there.

303
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,990
Why do women go on a trip
by themselves?

304
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,890
What about men?

305
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,789
I don't think it has
anything to do with gender.

306
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm sure everybody has
a good reason for it.

307
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,930
Maybe she needed some time
to think on her own.

308
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,069
Or she could've gone there
to meet someone.

309
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,569
Meet whom?

310
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,039
Sun Ho, that's enough.

311
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:10,240
He's very sensitive these days
because of the recording.

312
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
I heard In Wook's going to be
left out. That's nonsense.

313
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,150
I've never heard of that before.
Who told you that?

314
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,950
That's not it.
The recording just got canceled.

315
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,589
Try to set a new recording date.

316
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,000
In Wook will
quickly get back on his feet.

317
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,630
Excuse me.

318
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,569
You left something very important.

319
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,140
Did I do something wrong?

320
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Why are you being so cold to me?

321
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:52,380
Just be honest and tell me
what made you get so angry.

322
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,750
Is it because I told you your wife
probably left to meet someone?

323
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,619
You have a wild imagination.
I was talking about a friend.

324
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,220
A female friend.

325
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:02,660
She could've gone to meet
a friend who's... Gosh.

326
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,960
Your wife...

327
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,500
You're handsome.

328
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,509
What did I just say?

329
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,099
Do you see me?

330
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,269
No, I don't.

331
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,210
I see you. Over here.

332
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,349
I see you, too.

333
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,529
Let's go that way.

334
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,940
Ji Su, we didn't decide
where you two were going to talk.

335
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,670
I'm near the recording studio.

336
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,079
The footbridge?

337
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,849
Yes, I know where it is.

338
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,289
You'll only talk to him once?

339
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,220
Must you draw the line like that?

340
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Okay, just once.

341
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,930
All right.

342
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,869
Promise me you'll talk...

343
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,069
to Ha Won later on.

344
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,079
Even though it's just this one time.

345
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,319
You can rest now.

346
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,259
You heard her, right?
She'll only talk to you once.

347
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,109
What can one say
in that short period of time?

348
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,309
It's hard to decide.

349
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:08,339
There's something
I'd like to hear...

350
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,609
and something
I'd like to say to her.

351
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,519
I'll get going then.

352
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,660
(5:59pm)

353
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,289
Ji Su.

354
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,269
Ji Su?

355
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:17,910
Ji Su?

356
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,579
Ji Su.

357
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,119
Ji Su...

358
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,059
Misery found me
but I never contacted him.

359
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,329
I won't ever.

360
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,170
I know.

361
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
I know why you don't want to,

362
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,569
but please talk to him.

363
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,119
Ji Su.

364
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,460
Ji Su?

365
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,890
"Ji Su. Ji Su. Ji Su."

366
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,200
Were you going
to call for me all day?

367
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,950
What is it?

368
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,849
Why aren't you saying anything?

369
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Right...

370
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,400
This is it though.
You only get one conversation.

371
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,440
What will you talk about?

372
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,079
I thought about
what I should talk to you about.

373
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,489
You know,

374
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,260
I have wondered about...

375
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,059
what we'd talk about
if we were to talk one last time.

376
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,869
- Then was this on purpose?
- Yes.

377
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,800
I wanted to know what you'd say
for our final conversation.

378
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,840
But here you are lost for words.

379
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,349
"Ji Su. Ji Su."

380
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,920
I kept listening to you
saying my name.

381
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,289
Do you see the cathedral
with the blue roof?

382
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,260
- Yes.
- You can see three trees above it.

383
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,800
Then there's the housing building
for students.

384
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:02,739
What about the high school...

385
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,670
- on the left?
- I don't recall.

386
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,840
So where's Seo Woo?

387
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,250
Can you find her for me?

388
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:19,489
And then what?

389
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,260
- Just find her first.
- Why?

390
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,090
I want to do her a favor,
that's all.

391
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,230
How does it feel to know
that she likes to watch you?

392
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,300
- I don't know.
- Well, that's a first.

393
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,909
It felt odd to me.

394
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,010
Well,

395
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,380
I can't deny that you two
seem compatible in a way.

396
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,780
There's someone I think that will
get along well with Ji Su.

397
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,980
Is the conversation over already?

398
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,320
This is what Ji Su wants.

399
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,289
This is making me uncomfortable.

400
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,000
I saw a lot of pretty things.

401
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,929
- Can you show me...
- Do something.

402
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,199
what's behind Seo Woo?

403
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:54,320
Look at the shelf
in front of Seo Woo.

404
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,090
It's my favorite diffuser. Buy one.

405
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,190
I don't have the money.

406
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,360
- But I don't need it.
- Well, it's for me.

407
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,599
The candle next to it
smells nice too.

408
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,760
I'd rather not buy that.

409
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,570
Seo Woo, I'm sorry.

410
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,599
We should go.

411
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,039
What's that behind you?
Something's sparkling.

412
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,940
They're stickers.

413
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,650
I think these are much prettier.

414
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,219
Are you at the footbridge?

415
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,059
Yes.

416
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,360
I feel like I'm there with you two
which is nice.

417
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,739
Are you standing side by side?

418
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:47,840
Are you close?

419
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,710
We are
since we're sharing earphones.

420
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,139
Then you must be looking
at Ha Won from the side.

421
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,219
I guess you can say that.

422
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,650
Ha Won, the same goes for you too.

423
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,550
Actually, no.

424
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,260
She's looking at me,
so I'm seeing her from the front.

425
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,389
Now, you can see my profile.

426
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,300
Ha Won's profile face
is what I last saw too.

427
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,500
At the cafe!

428
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,170
You ran away after seeing him there.

429
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,440
Sure. If you say so.

430
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,710
What's that supposed to mean?

431
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,539
When else did you see me?

432
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,349
Is the sun setting?

433
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,349
Show me what you two are seeing.

434
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,500
So that's what it looks like...

435
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,030
when the sun sets over there.

436
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,630
I'd wanted to see.

437
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,809
I thought it would be nice
to see the sunset from there.

438
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,579
I remembered that Seo Woo
told me to go to a high spot,

439
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,579
and that's the place I saw.

440
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,829
It would be nice
to see the sun set here.

441
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,639
That's the extent of my last memory.

442
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,409
After that,

443
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,619
there's nothing.

444
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,579
She doesn't know
what happened after.

445
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,219
She doesn't know
why she sold her plates,

446
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,389
and she doesn't know...

447
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,130
she went to Norway.

448
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,230
She'll find out on her own.

449
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,170
She can't. She can't know.

450
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,070
She can't find out
what happened to herself.

451
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,289
Stop it.

452
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,260
Stop talking to her.

453
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,929
The more you say,
the more she learns.

454
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:34,900
And if she gets the hint,
she'll know everything.

455
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,900
Why did she sell the plates?

456
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,570
To do whatever she could.

457
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,409
She sold her plates
and went to Norway.

458
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,280
It's all related to
why she was unhappy,

459
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,750
and you know about it.

460
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,579
Right?

461
00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:58,119
Ji Su.

462
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:01,460
Why did she have a tough time?

463
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,960
She didn't want to speak of it.

464
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,559
Don't try to find out.

465
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,940
She'll find out in the end!
Just stop it!

466
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,809
If there's no Ji Su, there's
no reason for her to be unhappy.

467
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,219
There's nothing. It doesn't exist.

468
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,179
That's what it's like.

469
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,389
Not being able to see it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

470
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,530
It's there.

471
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,199
To me.

472
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,530
That's an illusion
that weirdos have.

473
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,170
Unrequited love
is on the same spectrum.

474
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,750
Seo Woo.

475
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,179
I meant...

476
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:26,399
Don't mock me.

477
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:32,129
I do my best to promote the studio.

478
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:37,038
I comfort the sensitive freaks
who are musicians.

479
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:40,938
I'll show everyone by doing this.

480
00:43:43,379 --> 00:43:44,449
This way.

481
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,018
My goodness.

482
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:28,819
(2:09am)

483
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:29,828
(2:10am)

484
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,049
(Mr. Dawn)

485
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:10,728
I'm not sure if this will
make sense to you,

486
00:45:12,899 --> 00:45:15,069
but what I was told the most...

487
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,138
was to forget Ji Su.

488
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:22,038
To give up.

489
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:26,078
But...

490
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:29,449
I don't know what that means.

491
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:36,989
What do you do
to forget and give up?

492
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:43,299
She was there when she wasn't.

493
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:46,538
She was there
when I couldn't see her.

494
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:51,268
How can I explain that?

495
00:45:54,038 --> 00:45:56,708
I didn't know how to
put that into words,

496
00:45:57,248 --> 00:45:59,149
so I don't tell anyone about it.

497
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:06,658
I'm just saying.

498
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:15,598
It's different from
your one-sided love.

499
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:18,669
You're right. It's different.

500
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:20,638
I do this for myself.

501
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:24,038
My one-sided love makes me happy.

502
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:27,478
It's very different from you.

503
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:38,748
You can't stand
being curious, can you?

504
00:46:43,288 --> 00:46:45,158
Ji Su said her husband...

505
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:47,799
made a mistake.

506
00:46:49,529 --> 00:46:50,828
That is what...

507
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:54,899
weighed her down so much
that she couldn't go out.

508
00:46:56,138 --> 00:46:58,839
She sold the plates just so
she could do something.

509
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:03,049
That's all that I know.

510
00:47:04,348 --> 00:47:07,419
To be more accurate,
that's the extent that...

511
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,219
Ji Su explained as the reason for
her unhappiness.

512
00:47:12,618 --> 00:47:14,018
That's it.

513
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,458
That's why I'm telling you.

514
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:20,129
Don't try to find out any more.

515
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:23,169
What Ji Su didn't say...

516
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:26,768
should be kept unknown.

517
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:10,578
In Wook, how did you...

518
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:19,618
If you guys were going to lie to me,

519
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:24,089
you should've done a better job.

520
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:26,699
No, it's just...
Why didn't you tell him?

521
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:28,129
I thought you already told him.

522
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:29,669
When did I say that?

523
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:32,799
You should've told him.
You guys are unbelievable.

524
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:35,339
What's wrong with you?

525
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:37,438
You're the one who wanted him out.

526
00:48:50,288 --> 00:48:52,018
Mr. Kang, what brings you here?

527
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,018
I came to the studio.

528
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:56,328
I'll unlock the door for you.

529
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:06,538
Is the door lock locked?

530
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:08,799
Just a second.

531
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:36,058
Did you come to work?

532
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:38,098
I think the door's locked
from the inside.

533
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:39,938
What...

534
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:41,899
What...

535
00:49:44,268 --> 00:49:45,268
No!

536
00:49:52,748 --> 00:49:54,848
Mr. Kang, I'm really sorry.

537
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:57,149
But can you go somewhere...

538
00:49:57,549 --> 00:49:59,788
for just 30 minutes?

539
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,158
I'll meet the person in charge...

540
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,618
and open the door for you.

541
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:06,658
I'll send you the passcode
as soon as I get there.

542
00:50:06,658 --> 00:50:07,728
I'm sorry.

543
00:50:18,868 --> 00:50:20,739
Don't try to find out any more.

544
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,149
What Ji Su didn't say...

545
00:50:23,149 --> 00:50:24,478
should be kept unknown.

546
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:42,328
My gosh, why did you drink so much?

547
00:50:42,728 --> 00:50:45,169
I can normally hold my liquor.

548
00:50:45,328 --> 00:50:47,569
Goodbye alcohol.
I'm going to stop drinking.

549
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:49,169
No one's going to believe you.

550
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:53,578
If you sent me the passcode,

551
00:50:53,578 --> 00:50:55,638
I would've opened the door
for Mr. Kang.

552
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:59,078
- Who?
- Mr. Kang is waiting.

553
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,049
Wait a second.

554
00:51:04,348 --> 00:51:06,049
Mr. Kang sent me a text yesterday.

555
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:08,319
I even texted back.

556
00:51:09,518 --> 00:51:10,828
But I don't remember anything.

557
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:14,529
Thank goodness I tried so hard
to promote our studio.

558
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,098
- The passcode.
- I'm so proud of myself.

559
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:19,199
I just sent it to you.

560
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:21,569
Look.

561
00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:24,638
But... But what am I doing here?

562
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:27,038
- Don't you live here?
- I don't live in Seoul.

563
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:29,779
Gosh, look at this mess.

564
00:51:30,149 --> 00:51:33,449
Is this supposed to be a bedroom,
a living room, or a kitchen?

565
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:36,018
I should get going now.
Mr. Kang is really angry.

566
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:37,149
I'm going to call a cab.

567
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:39,589
Wait for me.

568
00:52:13,788 --> 00:52:15,319
There's someone in the studio.

569
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:17,828
- I wonder who's there.
- The cab is here.

570
00:52:20,558 --> 00:52:21,998
He's my uncle.

571
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,429
It's okay. If you politely...

572
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:27,299
ask him to leave,
he'll go ahead and leave.

573
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:28,638
He's a kind guy.

574
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:31,208
Or I'll just tell him
to leave instead.

575
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:34,038
Wait just five minutes.
I'll be right there.

576
00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:35,478
Okay, bye.

577
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,679
I wonder what made him
stay up all night this time.

578
00:52:40,419 --> 00:52:41,719
What do you think?

579
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:44,018
He stayed up all night thinking
about someone's unhappiness.

580
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:05,908
Uncle, you should leave.

581
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:08,339
Mr. Kang is there.
You should let him inside.

582
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,489
He's a sensitive guy,
so he won't ask you to leave.

583
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,089
You should leave first. Hurry.

584
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:23,929
What are you doing?
Get in the elevator.

585
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,899
I left my cell phone inside.

586
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:29,429
I'll see you there.

587
00:54:03,328 --> 00:54:04,368
Ji Su.

588
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:07,138
Can you guess where I am right now?

589
00:54:24,049 --> 00:54:25,118
Ji Su.

590
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:28,319
Stop the music.

591
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,638
You told me you've never been
to Ha Won's house, right?

592
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:47,208
Well, I have.

593
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:54,848
Let me tell you what I saw there.

594
00:54:57,649 --> 00:54:59,788
The entire house
was filled with you.

595
00:55:06,658 --> 00:55:07,728
But...

596
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:10,799
this isn't right.

597
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:25,149
I heard In Wook's going to be
left out. That's nonsense.

598
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:27,779
I've never heard of that before.
Who told you that?

599
00:55:28,978 --> 00:55:31,449
I heard your wife went on a trip.
Is she not back yet?

600
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:39,728
It's not like she went there
to meet her first love.

601
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:43,498
- If we could apologize...
- To whom?

602
00:55:43,498 --> 00:55:45,069
If I could apologize to Ha Won...

603
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:48,839
You're not in touch anymore.

604
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:19,868
"209-0696".

605
00:56:35,118 --> 00:56:36,919
"209-0696".

606
00:56:38,419 --> 00:56:40,188
Can I borrow your phone?

607
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:43,158
I'm sorry,
but we don't have a phone.

608
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:46,699
I'm sorry.

609
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:51,469
But can you call this number
and check if the receiver...

610
00:56:51,899 --> 00:56:53,669
is a man or a woman?

611
00:56:54,598 --> 00:56:55,638
You want me to check?

612
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:01,578
You just need to let me know
if it's a man or a woman.

613
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:13,658
If a guy picks up,

614
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:18,429
can you ask him
if his name is Ha Won?

615
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:30,038
Never mind.

616
00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:33,538
Forget I asked.

617
00:57:36,339 --> 00:57:39,279
Sir! You left your money...

618
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:46,888
Just stop it already.

619
00:57:48,618 --> 00:57:50,058
Just...

620
00:57:55,828 --> 00:57:58,169
let me only mourn you.

621
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:26,029
You hoped her misery
would bring her back.

622
00:58:26,188 --> 00:58:28,299
You wished she'd call
if things got tough.

623
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:31,669
That's the hope
you've been living with.

624
00:58:32,899 --> 00:58:34,169
But that's enough.

625
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:38,938
It's time you end
your unrequited love.

626
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:44,848
You said you didn't know
how to or why you needed to.

627
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,978
Well, my one-sided love...

628
00:58:48,118 --> 00:58:50,518
has at least a one-percent chance.

629
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,348
How can I dare say that?

630
00:58:54,919 --> 00:58:56,618
Because you're at least alive.

631
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:01,998
But yours has no chance at all,

632
00:59:02,029 --> 00:59:03,799
so let it go.

633
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:08,498
I'm sorry...

634
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:11,509
I know this hurts.

635
00:59:12,638 --> 00:59:14,908
And that's why I'll move on too.

636
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:18,908
I'll not hold on to that
meek one-percent chance.

637
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:21,518
But you should've
moved on years ago.

638
01:00:25,348 --> 01:00:26,848
Where on earth did he go?

639
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:20,129
But you're miserable.

640
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,299
My life is good.

641
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:26,308
I'm somewhat unhappy
but somewhat in bliss.

642
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:29,509
She'll find out in the end!
Just stop it!

643
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:36,348
If there's no Ji Su, there's
no reason for her to be unhappy.

644
01:01:36,348 --> 01:01:38,819
There's nothing. It doesn't exist.

645
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:40,788
That's what it's like.

646
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,629
Well, my one-sided love
has at least a one-percent chance.

647
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:49,429
Because you're at least alive.

648
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,239
Are you alone?

649
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:00,268
Yes.

650
01:02:02,308 --> 01:02:04,308
There's something
I wanted to do for you.

651
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:06,808
What's that?

652
01:02:12,518 --> 01:02:14,719
I want to give you a hug,

653
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:18,228
but...

654
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:20,259
That's out of the blue.

655
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:21,859
I wish to give you a hug...

656
01:02:22,828 --> 01:02:24,868
and pat you on the back.

657
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:29,699
Yell at the top of your lungs.

658
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:33,268
What's gotten into you?

659
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:36,478
Yell at the top of your lungs.

660
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:37,879
Go ahead.

661
01:02:42,919 --> 01:02:44,419
Some more.

662
01:02:48,388 --> 01:02:49,658
That's it.

663
01:02:52,288 --> 01:02:55,458
When you said
you'd only let me talk to you once,

664
01:02:56,498 --> 01:02:58,929
I thought about
what I wanted to hear from you...

665
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:03,938
and what I wanted to say to you.

666
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:11,509
I couldn't decide
on which I wanted though.

667
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,018
And now?

668
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:17,388
I'll say what I want to tell you.

669
01:03:24,529 --> 01:03:26,089
Because saying this...

670
01:03:26,188 --> 01:03:30,158
will be like giving you that hug.

671
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,029
And what's what?

672
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:39,438
Whenever you were upset...

673
01:03:41,879 --> 01:03:43,179
or depressed,

674
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:45,279
I used to say this to you.

675
01:03:50,078 --> 01:03:51,489
Ji Su.

676
01:03:53,188 --> 01:03:54,618
Ji Su...

677
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:57,728
Ji Su.

678
01:03:58,629 --> 01:03:59,828
Ji Su?

679
01:04:08,438 --> 01:04:09,768
"Ji Su."

680
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:12,438
"Ji Su."

681
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:15,538
"Ji Su."

682
01:04:18,808 --> 01:04:20,179
"Ji Su."

683
01:04:25,219 --> 01:04:26,388
"Ji Su."

684
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:32,859
You can...

685
01:04:35,399 --> 01:04:36,529
rest now.

What kind of music
do you want to listen to?

688
01:05:54,808 --> 01:05:57,379
I guess you missed Mr. Dawn.

689
01:05:57,379 --> 01:05:58,478
You have a vacant room, right?

690
01:05:58,478 --> 01:06:01,319
You should vet people
before letting them in!

691
01:06:01,518 --> 01:06:04,419
I'm curious as to how
that one percent will grow.

692
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,819
I'll teach him to be strong.

693
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:07,719
You think you know better?

694
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:10,888
Mr. Kang, I've had it with you
and your constant shenanigans.

695
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:12,328
Why let him push you around?

696
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,529
How can one never cry?

697
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:16,998
Don't you have anything
to say to Mr. Dawn?

698
01:06:17,029 --> 01:06:18,368
It's good to see you,

699
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:19,929
