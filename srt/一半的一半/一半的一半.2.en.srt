9
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,219
Is it really someone
you shouldn't see?

10
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,630
I can't ever.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,929
I just need a piece of Ji Su.

12
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,870
It was nothing.

13
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,480
It was someone I met
for the first time,

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,549
but he just dug into my heart.

(Kim Ji Su)

17
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,750
Why did you do that?

18
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm sorry,

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,730
but I heard you two
were long-time friends.

20
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,060
Friends?

21
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,700
As if you know anything about us.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,129
I just...

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,569
Did Ha Won put you up to this?

24
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,639
I don't know.
I honestly don't know who he is.

25
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,370
I...

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,009
All I wanted was to do you a favor.

27
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:22,210
Do you know what
his last words to me were?

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
"Call me when
your life becomes miserable."

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,889
Misery found me...

30
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,060
but I never contacted him.

31
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,689
I won't ever. Do you know why?

32
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,860
It's because...

33
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,629
(Episode 2)

34
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,689
(To Mr. Dawn)

35
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:41,330
Mr. Dawn, the two
weren't able to meet,

36
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,530
but maybe it was for the best.

37
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,669
Maybe I shouldn't have
gotten involved at all.

38
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,009
I wonder what their story is.

Mr. Lee Han Seok.

42
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,209
Excuse me.

43
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,350
Please come to Gate 7
on the 4th floor...

44
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,420
near the M elevator.

45
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Hey.

46
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,459
Where are you?

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,870
I'm at...

48
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,800
Okin-dong in Jongno-gu.

49
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,000
It's Ha Won.

50
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,509
This is the address?

51
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,550
Yes.

52
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,550
What is this place?

53
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,519
When we talked,

54
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,759
I noticed the address on the wall.

55
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,189
Doesn't it look so sweet?

56
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,089
A typical Korean house.

57
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,199
Since when were you in Seoul?

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,100
I wasn't.

59
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,970
Where are you coming from?

60
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,240
- A lecture.
- You flew in from the US?

61
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,110
You wanted to see me,
so I left during a lecture.

62
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,759
It sounds like important news.

63
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,819
Let's get some fresh air first.

64
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,889
I'm okay now.

65
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,160
Still, you should be careful.
Your mom will tell me off.

66
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,300
It's really okay.

67
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,930
There's a park. Let's go there.

68
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,879
Your mom always used to say,

69
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,009
"Ha Won can't live in Seoul."

70
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,819
"He'll get rashes all over
and can't survive."

71
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,350
"He must live close to trees."

72
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,189
That was when I was young.
I'm totally fine now.

73
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,259
Say what you want to say.
You said it's important.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,360
Why the rush?

75
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,399
"What would Korea be like with you?"

76
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,500
"Korea... Korea..."

77
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,970
We only imagined it
and now we're both here.

78
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,040
Let's take our time.

79
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,680
Are you free?

80
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,649
Yes.

81
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,120
- Shall we go there?
- You want to go somewhere?

82
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,519
The place you wanted to go to.

83
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Me?

84
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,800
"A single leaf, without a sound,"

85
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,740
"landed softly on my shoulder."

86
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,540
"The universe
put a hand on my body."

87
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,639
"It's so light."

88
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,410
"Misiryeong Valley Sunset".

89
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,720
It's beautiful.

90
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,070
Ha Won. Look over there.

91
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,820
It's a place we only imagined.

92
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,419
I'm so glad we came here together.

93
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,389
Now I can tell you.

94
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm getting married.

95
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,330
(A Piece of Your Mind)

96
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,539
So what? She ran away?

97
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,940
She didn't exactly run away.

98
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,080
It's the same thing.
Why did she run away?

99
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,139
She fell out of love and dumped him.

100
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,909
My gosh. I don't believe it.

101
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,350
Ji Su dumped him?

102
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,389
I'll plant a cluster of herbs here,

103
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,220
and when I have guests,

104
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,529
- I'll make them tea.
- You'll never tell me.

105
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,470
After he broke up with Ji Su,
he told me...

106
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,139
I couldn't believe it.

107
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,080
When my grandma
was a diplomat, she said...

108
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,450
sometimes the Korean expats
are victimized.

109
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,179
She felt a lot of guilt about
not being able to help them.

110
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,590
Things are different now.

111
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,419
Anyway, for reasons similar to that,

112
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,690
Ha Won ended up on his own
and Grandma brought him over.

113
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,789
That's how he became my uncle.

114
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,129
- I told you before, right?
- The really smart guy.

115
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,029
The first time I met the kid...

116
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,139
The two of us are friends.

117
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,200
I call him uncle and by his name.

118
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,210
I call him lots of things,
but it's the same guy.

119
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,159
He was in a lecture in the US,

120
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,000
but he got a call from Ji Su
and boarded a plane.

121
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,899
He came to Seoul then
and hasn't left since.

122
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,230
Where is this place?

123
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,080
(47-435 Okin-dong, Jongno-gu)

124
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,070
Uncle?

125
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:18,580
Sun Ho.

126
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,250
I witnessed the beginning of
the persistent unrequited love.

127
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,049
Oh, that place was that address.

128
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,220
What's wrong with you?

129
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,019
Why did that make me so sad?

130
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,730
Where did you live?

131
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,659
That question is blocked.

132
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,399
What does that
have to do with research?

133
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,600
Where did you stay with Kim Ji Su?

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,809
Oslo. Seoul.

135
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,110
Gangneung.

136
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,639
When did you
go to Gangneung with Ji Su?

137
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,679
We broke up there,

138
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,620
and I stayed there alone
for a few months.

139
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,379
- What year was that?
- 2013.

140
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,720
2013?

141
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,720
It was when we were
developing the GPS tracker.

142
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,360
Where did you live
is a blocked question,

143
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,490
but when I ask where you stayed
with Ji Su,

144
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,629
you spilled everything.

145
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:12,730
you spilled everything.

146
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,769
If I mention Ji Su,

147
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:21,210
it'll answer any question.
Isn't that weird?

148
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,370
I think it's related to
the trigger point.

149
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,809
Change the password setting.

150
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,379
Are there any other issues?

151
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,580
None if it's not your device.

152
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,250
We'll train it with
virtual patients,

153
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,919
improve the accuracy,
then share it with the hospital.

154
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,220
We need to test this...

155
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,120
with real patients
for better accuracy.

156
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,289
So...

157
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,490
this should be scrapped.

158
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,500
Let's end the unofficial tests
that we've kept to ourselves.

159
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,639
- What?
- What?

160
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,009
Well... I always talked
to that thing.

161
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,049
And it responded
to all the nonsense I said.

162
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,320
I feel a little sad...

163
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
thinking that I'll no longer
be able to talk to it.

164
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,960
What?

165
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,769
It's for therapy.

166
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,799
Yes, it's for therapy.

167
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,419
What do you think, Seo Woo?

168
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,620
I like it.

169
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,419
Why don't you mix it yourself?

170
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,990
What?

171
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,190
But I'm not...

172
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,059
You need to practice to improve.

173
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,360
You have good ears,
so I'm sure you'll do well.

174
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,470
Thank you.

175
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,139
It's weird to see everyone here.

176
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:02,169
Everyone here including myself
used to be the original members.

177
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,279
What did you hear
from the recording studio?

178
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,940
Hasn't anyone told you anything yet?

179
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,279
No, not yet.

180
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,049
We're planning to record this week.

181
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,049
And?

182
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,490
You can come by
and take a look if you want.

183
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,590
It's a small studio,
but the sound comes out great.

184
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,159
You'll learn a few things.

185
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,690
Right.

186
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,730
(To Mr. Dawn, the two
weren't able to meet,)

187
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,860
(but maybe it was for the best.)

188
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,700
I wonder if Mr. Dawn
no longer comes here.

189
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,980
Excuse me.

190
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,590
She told you
that her life is miserable?

191
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,960
Her life was miserable,
but she refused to talk to him.

192
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,889
So that means her life is miserable.

193
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,330
I'm going to stop getting involved.

194
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,039
You can drink if you want.
I don't drink.

195
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,539
No, it's okay.

196
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,610
I feel bad for that guy
named Ha Won.

197
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,110
I don't get
why you feel bad for him.

198
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,779
He's just like me.

199
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,919
How so?

200
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,350
He believes in something
that's not even there.

201
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,590
I'm really good at doing that.

202
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,559
I do my best to get what I want,
dream of things,

203
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,289
overanalyze all the time,

204
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,200
and use up a lot of my affection,
time, and sincerity.

205
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,500
But he stood strong
for over 10 years.

206
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,139
Who likes someone
for that long these days?

207
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,039
These days,
people compete with love.

208
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,669
People always fight about
who loves whom more.

209
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,309
Love is unmeasurable, but people
are always busy measuring things.

210
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,809
But on the other hand,
he just wants a piece of her.

211
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,320
He told you a lot of things.

212
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,620
I wonder how he managed
to keep liking her for 10 years.

213
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,220
I'm so curious.

214
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,490
Wouldn't it be possible
if someone's that precious?

215
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,430
I think it's possible if that person
is what keeps you grounded.

216
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,809
Just a few words are enough
to keep people grounded.

217
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,109
"Just a few words".

218
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,119
If I hear something I want to hear,
I think that will enable me...

219
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,089
to keep going
for about three more years.

220
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,460
But no one's ever said it to me.

221
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,660
"I want you to stay."

222
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,460
The realtor called me
numerous times...

223
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,299
and asked me to sell
the semi-basement room.

224
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,299
If it weren't for you,
I would've sold it right away.

225
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:47,970
"Seo Woo."

226
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,140
"I want you to stay."

227
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,480
I'll be off now.

228
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,279
Okay. Bye, Seo Woo.

229
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,079
The cello doesn't sound right.
Do you hear that?

230
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,579
- "Seo Woo."
- You're right.

231
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,519
"I want you to stay."

232
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,700
I wonder what Ha Won will do next.

233
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,730
He probably won't do anything.

234
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,440
Really? Are you sure?

235
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,579
(Rice)

236
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,990
I heard you're miserable.

237
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,940
I heard you're miserable.

238
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,420
I heard you're miserable.

239
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,190
You call me in years,

240
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,160
and that's what you say to me?

241
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,559
I told you to call me.

242
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,569
I could instantly tell from behind
that you're miserable.

243
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,269
Why did you run when you can't
even run that well?

244
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,109
It's been so long.

245
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,579
I'm not miserable.

246
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,150
Then why did you run away?

247
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,420
Because you showed up
out of nowhere.

248
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,119
Then how was I supposed to show up?

249
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,430
Ha Won,
I can't talk to you right now.

250
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,130
- Let's talk next time...
- When?

251
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,039
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.

252
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,650
(Ha Won)

253
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,990
My fiance knows you.

254
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,930
I think he's bothered by you.

255
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,329
Who is he? How does he know me?

256
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,470
We were together
ever since you left.

257
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,640
You met him in Norway?

258
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,940
But I can't think of anyone...

259
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,740
Can you not guess?

260
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,539
Please.

261
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,480
Do you love him?

262
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,019
Well...

263
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,160
I think he turns me
into a better person.

264
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,430
We both like
the same kind of music...

265
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,460
So...

266
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,460
do you love him?

267
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,569
Yes.

268
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,750
I hope you respect my decision.

269
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,859
Of course, I respect your decision.

270
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,960
But...

271
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,430
you can go ahead and get married.

272
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,339
Meanwhile,
I'm going to keep loving you.

273
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,740
My love for you...

274
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,980
won't affect your life
in any kind of way at all.

275
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,319
I promise I won't disturb you.
So don't worry...

276
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,420
and respect my choice too.

277
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,329
I believe you'll have a happy life.

278
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,869
And you should.

279
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,740
But...

280
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,910
do call me when life gets miserable.

281
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:48,430
(Ji Su)

282
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,380
The voice recording, the bowls,
and the delivery address.

283
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,480
That was all you, wasn't it?

284
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,750
Why though?

285
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,680
It was a message.

286
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,690
I was reminding you...

287
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,390
to call me if you're miserable.

288
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,289
I was going to do this
every 10 years,

289
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,859
but I caught you on my first try.

290
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:21,130
That again?

291
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,140
I can't say that
I'm perfectly happy,

292
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,140
but I can't say
that I'm miserable either.

293
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm somewhat unhappy
but somewhat in bliss.

294
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,210
You're being cryptic.

295
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,150
Have a good life.

296
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,789
- Ji Su...
- I won't run next time.

297
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,619
Happy now?

298
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:49,890
Ji Su.

299
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,529
"Ji Su..."

300
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,099
It's been a while
since I heard that.

301
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,880
Ha Won, my life is not that bad,

302
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:13,619
so don't worry.

303
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:26,500
I was going to ask you
before throwing it out.

304
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,700
Why would you get rid of it?

305
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,500
Put this outside on a rainy day.

306
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,200
That sometimes spruces it up.

307
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,869
It's known to enjoy
the sweet taste of rain.

308
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,410
What if someone steals it?

309
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,809
Seriously? It's better than...

310
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,640
throwing it away and letting it die.

311
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,049
- Welcome!
- Do you make deliveries?

312
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,119
Yes, of course.

313
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,130
It's like he doesn't remember me.

314
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,630
Are you looking for
something in particular?

315
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,670
- Something small.
- Check the plants over there.

316
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,640
You can take your time.

317
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Hello, this is Han Seo Woo.

318
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,700
Yes, Seo Woo.

319
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,740
Is that Seo Woo?

320
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,170
Hello.

321
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,009
I recognized you
the moment you walked in.

322
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,279
- Don't you remember me?
- Hello?

323
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,849
I'm here, go ahead.

324
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,950
The cello sonata recorded...

325
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,750
was confirmed by Mr. Choi.

326
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,420
The file has been sent via email.

327
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,420
I mixed it myself...

328
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,559
and Mr. Choi gave me his approval.

329
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,529
I'd like you to hear it as well.

330
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
It's my first, you see.

331
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,000
- Congrats. I'll check it out.
- Congrats on what?

332
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,210
I'll ask her myself
once you hang up.

333
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,410
Someone here wants to call you.

334
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,440
Oh, I see.

335
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,049
Have a good day then.

336
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,420
You hung up already? Now I feel bad.

337
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,450
Han Seo Woo.

338
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,130
Seo Woo, I hear I should
congratulate you on something.

339
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,789
Of course, I know.

340
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,029
The world is a small place.

341
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,829
Could you come here
if you're not too busy?

342
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,400
I'll give you the address.

343
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,509
There's something I want to ask.

344
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,269
Am I allowed to
always be at the studio?

345
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,440
Even when...

346
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,910
there is no recording scheduled?
I'm usually always there anyway.

347
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,880
I don't know.

348
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,250
Then give me an answer...

349
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,019
so that I can decide whether or not
to care for the place.

350
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,220
Is that how you usually operate?

351
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,460
Of course. I care for every inch
of the place I work at.

352
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,829
In that case,
your question seems reasonable.

353
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,369
Hold on.

354
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,609
Yes?

355
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,450
Ask her to be there.

356
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,049
Okay.

357
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,789
You're good.

358
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:42,589
Sorry?

359
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,630
You're to be there.

360
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:47,430
You're to always be at the studio.

361
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,099
Is it Ha Won who's
giving those orders?

362
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,970
Your world has been revolving
around Ha Won lately, hasn't it?

363
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,539
Well, I've been someone
important to him.

364
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,609
As if. He doesn't consider
anyone to be important to him.

365
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,049
Let's head inside.

366
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,799
(Ji Su)

367
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Hey.

368
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,950
I was busy doing the laundry
to pick up earlier.

369
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:42,549
What's up?

370
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,049
You're even doing laundry now?

371
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,589
All I can do is
scoff at those words.

372
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,960
You called for no reason,
didn't you?

373
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Yes.

374
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,289
You're here.

375
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,680
(Ji Su)

376
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,650
(Shindongmun Station)

377
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,259
What other messages did you send?

378
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Just a second ago,

379
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,869
the sky darkened
and it started to rain.

380
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,140
- Yes.
- That's my message too.

381
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,240
The sun rising and setting,

382
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,210
the wind blowing,
it raining, and everything.

383
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,819
Everything you saw and heard.

384
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,259
That's my message for you
to be happy no matter where you are.

385
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,650
It's from Kang In Wook.

386
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,250
Jin Moo, must the recording
be on the day after tomorrow?

387
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,150
- Yes, probably.
- How many hours do we get?

388
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,880
An hour.
This place isn't easy to book.

389
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,920
Record what I'll be playing.

390
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,190
Han Seo Woo.

391
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,299
Ms. Han, can you turn up
the volume for the piano?

392
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,369
Sure thing.

393
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,099
Find me.

394
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:50,210
Maybe it wasn't a person talking.

395
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,869
Wait here.

396
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,210
In Wook.

397
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,250
If we could apologize...

398
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,720
To whom?

399
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,930
Should we go to Oslo?

400
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,559
Shall we go?

401
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,839
You'll just talk to thin air.
Just say it now.

402
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,380
If I could...

403
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,750
apologize to Ha Won...

404
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,289
You're not in touch anymore.

405
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,130
I have his email address.

406
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,329
- If I call...
- There's nothing to apologize for.

407
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,869
It weighs too much on me.

408
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,070
I told you already that
it's too much for me.

409
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,670
Ji Su.

410
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,769
It's not a problem
as long as you're okay with it.

411
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,610
The mess we're in now...

412
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,679
No.

413
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,719
It's your problem now.

414
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,289
I saw you come in.

415
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,300
Do you know this place?

416
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,329
It's my favorite cafe.
Isn't it nice here?

417
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
You were looking at something.

418
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,000
I was people-watching.

419
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,340
I do that a lot.

420
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,510
On your own?

421
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,610
In case someone comes.

422
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,010
I'm so dull-witted.

423
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,780
I'll sit at another table.

424
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,920
I have some good news.

425
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,119
I can come to the recording studio
whenever I want.

426
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,219
Congratulations.
I don't go there anymore.

427
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,159
You're done?

428
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,260
Now in the mornings,
there won't be any coffee, music

429
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,730
or cleaning up to do.

430
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,070
I guess not.

431
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,539
Right here.

432
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,809
This is where Ha Won
failed to meet Ji Su.

433
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,949
And I almost saw him.

434
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:59,260
Is there something
you want to ask Ha Won?

435
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,130
No.

436
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:06,059
I just want to see him from afar.

437
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,630
From afar?

438
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,070
His full face. From afar.

439
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,369
Why from afar?

440
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:17,809
If we're close,
he'll see that I pity him.

441
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,710
The look on my face.

442
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,480
I just want to see
what he looks like.

443
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,920
A guy who looks like that
went through that.

444
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,119
I just want to see his face.
Why would I ask him anything?

445
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,860
You should work at the studio that
wants you to stay for a long time.

446
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,030
Okay.

447
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,300
You can stay here.

448
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,369
You said you're waiting for someone.

449
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,269
I doubt they'll come.

450
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,409
They must. I can sit...

451
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,309
I have many other favorite cafes.
I'll go somewhere else.

452
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,030
I feel rotten to know
I won't see him again.

453
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,119
Ha Won.

454
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,329
Shall we go to Norway?

455
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,000
When?

456
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,840
Tomorrow works.

457
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,139
Why?

458
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,880
I need your help.

459
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,480
I need you to do something there.

460
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,119
What?

461
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,760
You just have to say one thing.

462
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,230
What one thing?

463
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,530
I'll say it now.

464
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,630
It's...

465
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,730
It's fine. Tell me.

466
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,440
I'll hear it first, then help you.

467
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,340
I shouldn't have
brought it up. Sorry.

468
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,139
- I'll call you...
- Let's go. Tomorrow.

469
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,409
I'll help first, then listen.

470
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,849
Okay. Let's meet at that cafe.

471
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,050
I know.

472
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,219
The one you ran away from.

473
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:52,260
See you there tomorrow morning.

474
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,929
There's nothing to apologize for.

475
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:01,269
It weighs too much on me.

476
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,639
I told you already that
it's too much for me.

477
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,809
No. Forget it.

478
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,280
I'll call you again in the evening.
I'll think about it some more.

479
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,110
Think about what?

480
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,449
It might be hard for you.

481
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:17,590
See you tomorrow.

482
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,210
Did you come to the cafe?

483
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,780
Yes.

484
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,710
You can wait inside.

485
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,179
Thank you.

486
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,949
Leave.

487
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,030
I'll stay and find out the reason.

488
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:19,500
Again, I'm sorry about
what happened that day.

489
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,500
Let me know when you're free.

490
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,769
(To Kim Ji Su. Again, I'm sorry...)

491
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,010
(about what happened that day.
Let me know when you're free.)

492
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,039
(I'm nearby.)

493
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,139
I'm nearby.

494
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,719
Over here.

495
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,489
It's either a gift
or a small burden.

496
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,500
- What is it?
- A plant.

497
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,699
You can keep it
if you know how to take care of it.

498
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,769
If not, you just need to water it
every now and then.

499
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,300
It's a little sensitive.

500
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,269
I'm great at growing plants.

501
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,039
Then it's a gift. You can keep it.

502
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,809
What were you doing nearby?

503
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,179
I needed to make a decision.

504
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,690
I'm going to leave on my own.

505
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,860
I'm a little scared,
but I'm still going to go.

506
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,489
It bothers me a little
to hear that you're scared.

507
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,099
I'll be fine.

508
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,699
I've become a lot more courageous
after having talked to you.

509
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,469
You can tell me more.

510
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,340
I'm ready to listen
to anything you have to say.

511
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,849
You gave me a gift,
so go ahead and tell me whatever.

512
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,619
You can even tell me
what bothers you.

513
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Before...

514
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:01,900
I met my husband,

515
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,170
something happened to him.

516
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,280
He made a mistake.

517
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,050
And I've been struggling...

518
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:15,920
ever since I found out.

519
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,389
It turned my entire world
upside down.

520
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,659
I never knew...

521
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,659
how it felt...

522
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,369
to be in torment.

523
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,639
This...

524
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,110
This feeling...

525
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,309
You didn't go
to the mountains, did you?

526
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,449
I told you to go somewhere high.

527
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,920
It really helps
to look down at the view.

528
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,090
You can even shout
at the top of your lungs.

529
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,059
Would you like to shout in there?

530
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:00,230
It's completely soundproof and
a great way to relieve your stress.

531
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,900
This isn't exactly
what you want to hear, is it?

532
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,809
There's probably something else
that you want to hear.

533
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,550
Something that will
put your mind at ease.

534
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,389
"It's okay."

535
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,159
"It's not a big deal."

536
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,510
Everyone makes mistakes.

537
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,550
Even nature makes mistakes.

538
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,550
My parents...

539
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,420
passed away due to a forest fire.

540
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,929
I rarely tell people this.

541
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,170
Even nature makes mistakes.

542
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:18,139
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

543
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,719
Wait.

544
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,449
(To Mr. Dawn. Please clean up
before you head home.)

545
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,289
(To Mr. Dawn. Please clean up
before you head home.)

546
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,159
"A night-like afternoon".

547
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:18,500
Even lifeless things fall sometimes.

548
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,940
They're all machines in there.
It's funny that it just fell.

549
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,969
What is this?

550
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,739
This...

551
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,809
I think Mr. Dawn wrote this.

552
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,380
I wonder what his job is.

553
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,219
This is a flowchart.

554
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,250
"Mr. Dawn"?

555
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,159
He rents this place
for four hours at dawn.

556
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,389
So I call him Mr. Dawn.

557
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,500
I actually ran into him yesterday
at the cafe...

558
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,860
that we frequently went to.

559
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,869
He told me he won't be
coming here anymore.

560
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,170
He suddenly called out of nowhere
and asked if I was miserable.

561
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,809
And I was so puzzled.

562
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,610
But I guess this is how he did it.

563
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:06,179
You told me that you've
never met Ha Won, right?

564
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,179
No, I only saw his back from afar.

565
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,289
I think you'll meet him soon.

566
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,360
Or you might've met him already.

567
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,389
What?

568
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:21,099
I'm relieved.

569
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,989
Is something bothering you?

570
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,090
I just can't seem to focus.

571
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,900
This is our last day.

572
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:16,199
We just need to record
one more piece. Then it'll be over.

573
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,349
Why did she go?

574
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:28,949
Why did she have to go?

575
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,760
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

576
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,809
In Wook sure isn't himself.

577
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:45,150
It was great. That was amazing.

578
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,659
So she didn't come today either.

579
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:03,829
I'm sure she will someday though.

580
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:06,690
When she does,
I'll tell her how long you waited.

581
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,300
I hope your patience is rewarded.

582
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,000
Don't you go back on that promise.

583
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,099
I won't.

584
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:16,170
Look at the size of the moon today.
It's as if it's rolling toward us.

585
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,710
Make a wish.

586
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:25,010
It'll come true.

587
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,230
Hello?

588
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,030
This place...

589
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,099
is blinding.

590
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:49,199
It's amazing here.

591
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,869
Now I realize...

592
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,739
why I've been living my life
the way I have.

593
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,079
My anxiety is gone too.

594
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:58,449
Where are you right now?

595
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,849
On the path
Ha Won and I always used to walk on.

596
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,889
In Norway?

597
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,619
I don't know how I managed
to forget about this place.

598
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,059
Is this the normal tone
your voice carries?

599
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,960
Talk about it being different.

600
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:16,400
I'm glad you went there.

601
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,530
I can handle it all, you know.

602
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,599
I'm quite strong.

603
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,300
I'm glad I came here
by myself though.

604
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,280
Seo Woo,

605
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,409
could you tell Ha Won not to wait
for me at the cafe anymore?

606
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,579
I left Korea without telling him.

607
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,690
Being the stubborn guy he is,
he'll keep on waiting.

608
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,019
But I don't know who he is.

609
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,690
The answer's easy.

610
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:43,590
Consider it as a pop quiz.

611
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,289
I'll call you in a while,
so get thinking.

612
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:49,000
Here's a hint.

613
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,400
You've already met him.

614
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,139
I'll call you back.

615
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,670
But...

616
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:01,539
Who on earth is Ha Won?

617
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:08,980
Wouldn't it be possible
if someone's that precious?

618
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:13,690
I think it's possible if that person
is what keeps you grounded.

619
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:16,260
No way.

620
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,670
Misery found me
but I never contacted him.

621
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:25,329
She told you
that her life is miserable?

622
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:31,639
"I want you to stay."

623
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:34,980
You're to be there.
You're to always be at the studio.

624
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,909
You should work at the studio that
wants you to stay for a long time.

625
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,920
Was that you as well?

626
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,019
Ms. Moon?

627
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:35,539
I haven't played the piano
in a while.

628
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,440
Your favorite piano student
didn't turn out to be gifted.

629
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,079
Only you didn't know.

630
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,119
Living in Seoul hasn't
irritated Ha Won's skin.

631
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,880
He's quite healthy.

632
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,010
I loved you so much,

633
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,179
and not just as Ha Won's mom.

634
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,219
May I...

635
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,389
apologize instead?

636
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,510
(Kim Ji Su)

637
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,019
Is it really Mr. Dawn?
Ha Won is Mr. Dawn?

638
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:38,949
Hello?

639
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:40,920
This place...

640
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,059
The signal...

641
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:44,889
Ji Su?

642
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:50,429
Seo Woo. Did I get through?

643
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,300
I was afraid.

644
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,269
What's the matter?

645
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:01,440
It snowed so much here.

646
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:05,880
My old neighborhood
is just up the trail.

647
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,349
Can't you walk along a larger road?

648
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,820
I can't go anywhere right now.

649
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,159
I'll get better
when it stops snowing.

650
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:22,599
Are you listening to music?

651
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,199
It sounds nice.

652
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,719
It's scary...

653
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,099
but beautiful.

654
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,000
I was always here with Ha Won.

655
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:07,809
Did you call for rescue?

656
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:09,840
They must have
something like that there.

657
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:12,349
They're coming.

658
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:15,250
Then hang up. Save your battery.

659
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,449
I should do that.

660
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,320
Ga.

661
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,289
Gya.

662
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:55,289
Gyeo.

663
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,230
Go.

664
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:01,659
Gyo.

665
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,269
Ga.

666
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,369
- Ga.
- Gya.

667
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:13,710
- Geo.
- Gyeo.

668
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,880
- Go.
- Gyo.

669
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,949
- Gu.
- Gyu.

670
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:20,179
- Geu.
- Gi.

671
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,119
- Na.
- Nya.

672
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,289
- Neo.
- Nyeo.

673
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,219
- No.
- Nyo.

674
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,019
- Nu.
- Nyu.

675
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:29,320
Neu.

676
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,360
Ga.

677
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,590
Gya.

678
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:41,900
A single leaf, without a sound,

679
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,769
landed softly on my shoulder.

680
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:48,840
The universe put a hand on my body.

681
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:50,949
- It's so light.
- It's so light.

682
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,820
A single leaf,

683
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:00,920
without a sound,

684
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:04,130
landed...

685
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,559
softly...

686
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,730
Stop looking outside the window.

687
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,869
Look at the ceiling.

688
01:07:19,909 --> 01:07:21,079
It'll make you feel at ease.

689
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,420
Yes, Ji Su.

690
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:04,519
Now...

691
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:07,559
I'll stop waiting.

692
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,670
Wait just a moment.

693
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,869
Wait. Ha Won.

694
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,439
In case someone comes.

695
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,409
Ha Won.

696
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,890
Wait just a moment.

697
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,789
Ji Su.

698
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:48,300
Hello? Ji Su.

699
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,439
I'm scared.

700
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,930

702
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,140
"Find me."

703
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:41,779
Tell Ha Won that...

704
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,739
Kim Ji Su won't come back.

705
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,250
She left everything behind.
She loved Norway.

706
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:50,279
Why didn't you pick up?
Where were you?

707
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,449
Ha Won! I was worried about Ha Won!

708
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,920
What did you imagine?

709
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,859
A conversation with
the real Kim Ji Su.

710
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,289
Shall I lend you the device?

711
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:03,329
This person is curious about
everything about you.

712
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:05,770
This is how I miss someone.

713
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,539
The last person you saw...

714
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:10,939
and talked to.
