00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:50,809
I need you to do something for me.

3
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:54,009
You just...

4
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,707
have to go...

5
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,149
back and forth so I can see you.

6
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,618
The thing you said you liked looking at...

7
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,018
You don't mean...

8
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,388
Me?

9
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:12,528
I can't say exactly what this feeling is.

10
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:14,499
But...

11
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,798
I need you.

12
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:24,509
Can you stay?

13
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,608
Please stay.

14
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:05,549
(A Piece of Your Mind)

15
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,918
I have to stay.

16
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,827
So what? Why are you complaining to me?

17
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:23,667
Hey. I'll call you back in five minutes.

18
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,027
Where are you going?

19
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:27,168
- I need to go.
- Look how you're dressed.

20
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:33,409
You're right. Not now.

21
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:36,179
Hey. Snap out of it.

22
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,318
Hey. Girls keep hitting
on me like crazy lately.

23
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,648
That was a coworker just now
that everyone says is pretty.

24
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,917
She calls when she's drunk
and flirts like crazy.

25
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,929
Why is this happening to me lately?

26
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,327
No one liked me in college.

27
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,558
That's right.

28
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,697
This is so disturbing.

29
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:56,099
Should I answer this or not?

30
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,697
You say she's a coworker, so answer it.

31
00:02:57,698 --> 00:03:00,168
If anything happens later,
it's all your fault.

32
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,539
Then don't answer it.

33
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,539
Who was it,
that you had to take it outside?

34
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:11,279
Well... So...

35
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:15,017
Seo Woo ran out like a crazy girl.

36
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,517
I stopped her and sent her home.

37
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,918
What got into her in
the middle of the night?

38
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,529
I should stay for him.

39
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,268
How do I do that?

40
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,208
Seo Woo.

41
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:44,809
Seo Woo!

42

43

Eun Joo.

45
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:53,759
Let me see.

46
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:57,559
Come over here.

47
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,128
Don't get any stupid ideas.

48
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,129
What do you mean?

49
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,197
I heard you ran around like a crazy girl.

50
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:06,539
I did not.

51
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,108
Don't think about doing
something rash again.

52
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:10,339
What?

53
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,147
I won't. Come on.

54
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:19,378
I get so nervous this time of
year, with your suicidal thoughts.

55
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,848
That's not it.

56
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,447
I'm so sick of it.

57
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,249
Get your head on straight, got it?

58
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,879
Seo Woo. A bunch of young kids came today,

59
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,189
taking pictures and traveling.

60
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:31,948
It looked nice.

61
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,288
You should date too.

62
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:49,537
I don't know where my own things are.

63
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:51,009
Should I bring it to you?

64
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:54,708
No, I'll go down.

65
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:59,619
Level B-3.

66
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:01,319
I'm here.

67
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,619
Go to C48.

68
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:52,468
I want to play this for you,

69
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:56,439
Mom,

70
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:59,038
Dad.

71
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,488
When will you be done with work?

72
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:19,849
(When will you be done with work?)

73
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,929
You're okay, right?

74
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:25,698
I texted just because.

75
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:30,609
"How are you? Isn't the weather nice?"

76
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:33,979
I like it when I get
random texts like that.

77
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:37,109
I feel cared for.

78
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:40,648
I'm okay.

79
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:43,818
I just saw something I like looking at,

80
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,448
so I'm in a very good mood.

81
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,198
I got my hopes up for nothing.

82
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,338
I'm working on what to do
to make it feel like...

83
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:02,838
I'm "staying" with you.

84
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:06,078
That's why I'm texting you for no reason.

85
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:11,048
Do you need anything right now?

86
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,478
(Before Dawn)

87
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,278
You usually have your head on the
table when you're in the studio,

88
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:16,819
so maybe a cushion?

89
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:20,819
Or slippers.

90
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,559
I'm sure you need something.

91
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,778
I'm okay.

92
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,088
Guess what you often say like a habit.

93
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:57,989
A habit?

94
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,328
What is it?

95
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:02,999
"I want people to hear it."

96
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,239
Keep the door open so
more people can hear it.

97
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,268
This is the last song we recorded here.

98
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,109
"I want people to hear it."

99
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,638
I want to play this for you.

100
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:05,828
Mr. Kang.

101
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,267
About the house concert,
I think it was booked a long time ago.

102
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,999
- You remember, right?
- I forgot about it.

103
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,938
I thought so.

104
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:16,108
The rehearsal is today.

105
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:19,079
If you can't make it,
let them know in advance.

106
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,239
Soon Ho, didn't you say
you were a gardener?

107
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,749
Yes, and I still am.

108
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,178
How do you throw out plants?

109
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:27,878
Why are you throwing them out?

110
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,989
- Because they're dead.
- I see.

111
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,088
Can you send me pictures of them?

112
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,558
I'll check the state they're in.

113
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:37,388
(Mr. Kang)

114
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:40,699
Oh, gosh.

115
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:43,168
None of them are dead.

116
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,027
They're dead.

117
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,868
If you can't keep them,

118
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,999
will you send them to my farm?

119
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,808
- Are they in your balcony?
- Yes.

120
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:54,338
The eucalyptus is missing.

121
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,509
The one you bought for your wife that time.

122
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,278
Eucalyptus...

123
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,719
What does it look like again?

124
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,058
We have the same one in our studio.

125
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:07,818
Seo Woo got it as a gift.

126
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,657
It was neglected and almost died,

127
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,829
but I saved it. Hold on.

128
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:13,499
Who...

129
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,469
gave it to Seo Woo?

130
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,099
I didn't ask her.

131
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,009
Ji Soo went to the studio...

132
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:31,609
and gave the plant to Han Seo Woo.

134
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,688
What's with the two of them?

135
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,268
The weather is so nice.

136
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:52,469
I hate it.

137
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,318
She threw...

138
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,648
the plant away.

139
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:43,938
I want to play it for you.

(Express Bus Timetable)

142
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,578
As you can see,
the buildings are still ablaze...

143
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,109
as if they had been bombed.

144
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:22,979
Do you want to go to your house with me?

145
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:24,278
No.

146
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,048
I won't go.

147
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,219
I don't think I can.

148
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,358
Is it like history taking?

149
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,359
It's different.

150
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,268
You can ask more casually.

151
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:46,668
I can find its point
of reaction right away.

152
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,239
Hold on.

153
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,109
Ms. Kim Min Jung.

154
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,618
I know you'll react right away...

155
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,749
if I talk about your daughter.

156
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:28,709
Where are you?

157
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:32,479
You're where?

158
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,679
This is where I need to stay for you.

159
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,849
It's a huge improvement that
you went to the bus terminal.

160
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,249
You said you hadn't gone since.

161
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,489
Right.

162
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,859
I can go with you.

163
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,658
It's okay.

164
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,027
I talked so big to my mom...

165
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:27,038
that I'd bring her what I recorded.

166
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,068
She always asked me when I was going to,

167
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,009
saying she'd listen to
it 1,000 times if I did.

168
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:35,739
Once my gift is ready,

169
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:39,009
I'll decide whether or not to go.

170
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,648
Let me hear what you recorded.

171
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,018
I'll pick the best one for you.

172
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,658
Would you know if you heard?

173
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,318
You'll be shocked.

174
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,328
This one is...

175
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:04,209
Brahms.

176
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,139
"Cello Sonata..."

177
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,439
"Number Two."

178
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:12,808
- What's next?
- Next one is...

179
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:33,338
It's not very good.

180
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,668
He's a great pianist,

181
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:37,867
but he's in a slump these days.

182
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:41,009
He played this when he was slumping.
You can tell?

183
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,078
I have no choice.

184
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,348
I'll have to show you my skills.

185
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,918
Do you play an instrument?

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,919
My mom was a piano teacher.

00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,848
So you learned.

188
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,418
I told her that I liked
listening, but hated playing,

189
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:56,828
so she didn't teach me.

190
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,328
I learned a little from
watching, that's all.

191
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,399
Just wait and see.

192
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,899
I'll come with my recording gear next time.

193
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:06,699
I can't wait.

194
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,889
You look like you slept a bit,

195
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,219
or maybe not.

196
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:31,788
Once everything is resolved,

197
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:34,459
you'll be able to sleep.

198
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,328
Your body will send a signal.

199
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,669
"It's all good now.
The complicated things are over."

200
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:45,209
Then you'll fall asleep.

201
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,139
Losing someone next to you.

202
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:51,449
It's tough every time you experience it.

203
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,889
But if you have someone,
you're bound to lose them.

204
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,419
And you need a way to endure it each time.

205
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,297
What was your way?

206
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,729
Well, for me,

207
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:13,499
I just needed one person who understood.

208
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:18,009
"I'm struggling. I'm lonely. Help me."

209
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,739
The one person who would
listen every time...

210
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,969
if I tell them right
away without hiding it.

211
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:25,948
Who was it until now?

212
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:27,378
Eun Joo.

213
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:32,489
But she's starting to
get exhausted recently.

214
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:36,429
But then again, it's been a long time.

215
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,528
One percent.

216
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:41,159
And one person.

217
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,628
That's all you need.

218
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:02,449
You left all your stuff at the studio.

219
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,988
That's right. I only brought my phone.

220
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,459
Let me go with you.
I left something there too.

221
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:13,098
Like your heart?

222
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,297
My bicycle.

223
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:17,669
Oh, I see.

224
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,367
I'm slightly concerned...

225
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,878
about what I should do to stay with you.

226
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,479
How were the texts?

227
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:34,377
Did it make you feel like
someone was with you?

228
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,778
It did for me.

229
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,649
It's not that I want someone
physically next to me,

230
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,989
but more like in the air around me,

231
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:45,159
warming my surroundings.

232
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,499
Your texts are effective.

233
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:51,298
That's good to hear.

234
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,239
I'll go inside then.

235
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:04,449
Bye.

236
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:08,548
- My bicycle.
- Oh, right.

237
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,189
Your bicycle.

238
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,239
What's this?

239
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:37,449
What...

240
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:40,548
What are these?

241
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:52,259
He is so silly.

242
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:56,259
They're pretty. I love them.

243
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,419
Darn, he's so distracting.

244
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,588
In Wook, will you let me work?

245
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,459
I'll leave a little while later.

246
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,297
I can stop thinking when I'm here.

247
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:30,598
I see. Stay here then.

248
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:32,067
Eat and sleep here.

249
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:34,068
Don't think. That's the worst.

250
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:35,567
They can make...

251
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:38,538
your brain and heart rot away.

252
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,308
All right.

253
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:47,919
Jin Moo.

254
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:52,088
It's just a single plant,

255
00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:59,689
but I feel like I'm being laid bare.

256
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,628
(Eunjoo Homestay)

257
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:05,267
Seo Woo.

258
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,837
I wasn't late yesterday.

259
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:09,097
Open the door!

260
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,739
Hurry up.

261
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,538
Take this.

262
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,608
Gosh.

263
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:21,618
I'm so tired.

264
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,518
Hey, your face isn't covered.

265
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:32,057
Cover it back. This memorial isn't for you.

266
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,357
Whatever, it's fine.

267
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:37,028
No, cover it with something.
Anything is fine.

268
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:38,729
Do it already.

269
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,108
There you go. Good job.

270
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,749
Let's bow.

271
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,767
Ma'am, Seo Woo is staying
in the semi-basement...

272
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:14,568
because she wants to.

273
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:17,239
I just can't change her mind.

274
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,679
So don't be disappointed in me.

275
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,249
It's good now.

276
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,889
If I don't say this,
it makes me feel uneasy all year round.

277
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,528
You aren't exhausted yet.

278
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:39,828
What are you saying?

279
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:45,428
What about Chang Sup?
Did he not come home again last night?

280
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:48,068
No. I guess he's very busy.

281
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,639
He doesn't usually pull all-nighters.

282
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,338
Maybe things are unusual right now.

283
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,409
Thanks.

284
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:04,689
How much must I talk with it
to find its point of reaction?

285
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,448
I haven't talked to
someone for this long...

286
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:10,087
since my boyfriend when I was 22.
I was up all night.

287
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:11,357
It depends.

288
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,027
I'm sure...

289
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,557
her daughter is the point of
reaction, but it's not responding.

290
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:17,428
Or it could be something unexpected.

291
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,198
No, I'm 100 percent sure it's her.

292
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,668
She had leukemia.

293
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:24,567
When she knew she was terminally
ill, she called me...

294
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:26,509
and made an appointment for her mom.

295
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:29,308
In case my mom does something rash.

296
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,308
She's very weak emotionally.

297
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:33,649
Please see her at least once a week.

298
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:36,278
You are...

299
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,048
very sweet.

300
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,788
I envy your mom.

301
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:46,858
But Kim Min Jung never
talks about her daughter.

302
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,158
It would be healthier for her if she did.

303
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,198
Her daughter did the right thing.

304
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,838
Things could've been bad
if she was left alone.

305
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:58,108
"I'm struggling. I'm lonely. Help me."

306
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:01,878
The one person who would
listen every time...

307
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,138
if I tell them right
away without hiding it.

308
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,178
She vents, which means
she has the will to live.

309
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,389
If she didn't have that will,
she wouldn't talk at all.

310
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:15,818
People should listen to each
other and help each other out.

311
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:19,627
Gosh, what in the world must I say...

312
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,729
for Kim Min Jung to come out?

313
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:23,628
This is so difficult.

314
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:25,268
(General Ward A)

315
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:29,038
Ms. Kim Min Jung.

316
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:31,868
You may go in now.

317
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,409
- It smells like food in here.
- Sorry.

318
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:41,679
I had to eat in my office...

319
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,189
because I'm working on a paper.

320
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:46,149
I'm sorry.

321
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,558
- Here.
- Thank you.

322
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:55,097
What happened to the address?
Are you moving?

323
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:56,128
I plan to.

324
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,199
You didn't tell me.

325
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:01,068
Eunjoo Homestay? That's it?

326
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,868
- Do you know them?
- How would I?

327
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:07,878
I need the address.

328
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:10,649
I won't stop communication and disappear.

329
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:12,578
How can I trust you?

330
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,749
Anyway,

331
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,358
send me the address sometime today.

332
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:22,818
Okay.

333
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:27,558
What shall we chat about today?

334
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,628
Doctor. Your teeth.

335
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:34,589
- Sorry. Did something get stuck?
- What did you eat?

336
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,718
I wondered how you were doing,

337
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,419
as well as the babies in the balcony.

338
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,659
If you don't mind,

339
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:00,999
should I take all the
babies in the balcony?

340
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:04,328
It's more depressing if
your plants are dying.

341
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:05,999
It's okay.

342
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:08,168
Just throw them out.

343
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:11,038
Leave them out front, and I'll raise them.

344
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,639
The performer is in a
slump and holed up at home,

345
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,048
and his plants are dying.

346
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:23,919
To be honest, I don't know how to
help someone get out of a slump.

347
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,288
I've never seen it before.

348
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:29,959
But I know exactly how to
save plants from dying.

349
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:32,628
At least one of you should live.

350
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:36,798
- I'll take care of...
- You won't take care of it.

351
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,429
All you do is run away.

352
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,438
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

353
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,669
I'm ready to go.

354
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,138
She's close to my wife.

355
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:50,649
I don't want her saying things.

356
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:54,149
Are you actually married?

357
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:00,558
There's the balcony.

358
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:22,038
Shall we begin?

359
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:45,999
Are you ready?

360
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,739
My gosh.

361
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:38,078
I never said I was good.

362
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:41,219
- I guess not.
- Did you not like it?

363
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,719
Want to try one more time?

364
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:47,787
No. Mix it nicely and make it sound good.

365
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:50,088
I don't know if I'm that good.

366
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,848
Where to?

367
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:19,517
One to Yangnyang please.

368
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:20,689
Okay. Yangnyang.

369
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:50,489
Have a nice trip.

370
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,798
I recorded this.

371
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,838
I'm doing well.

372
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,579
Don't worry about me.

373
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:12,168
I'm home.

374
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:15,938
Mom.

375
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,809
Dad.

376
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,608
You mixed it nicely.

377
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:35,358
I wanted you to stay,
so I should follow you around.

378
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,699
You came alone,

379
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,398
so you don't mind going
back together, right?

380
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:27,809
I think this time of
year will get better now.

381
00:41:58,168 --> 00:41:59,438
Thank you.

382
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:10,318
Stay for dinner.
I want to have the welcoming dinner now.

383
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:13,088
Are you kidding me?

384
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:17,088
What? Because I was rude to her?

385
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:20,789
We're dating, okay? Satisfied?

386
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:23,829
What's wrong with you?
You're embarrassing me.

387
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:26,628
Are you embarrassed of me?

388
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:28,998
Is that why you've been so mean to me?

389
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:34,978
Why you...

390
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:46,587
I'm really sorry.

391
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:47,818
It's okay.

392
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:50,687
I made gimbap. Share with the others...

393
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,288
It's okay. I'm late.

394
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:54,159
What? But...

395
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,559
Give me a gimbap.

396
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:59,028
I'm hungry.

397
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,748
The doctors' lounge was my home.

398
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:16,119
When I was in my 20s?

399
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,019
Living in a homestay...

400
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,259
and hanging out in groups...

401
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:25,928
I've never experienced that.

402
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:29,357
Searching for details regarding...

403
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,429
- experiences...
- Min Jung, stop.

404
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:35,038
How's Eunjoo Homestay?

405
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,738
Searching for information regarding...

406
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:39,309
- Eunjoo Homestay...
- Stop the search.

407
00:43:39,938 --> 00:43:41,708
Stop with Eunjoo Homestay.

408
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,208
I went to see Eun Joo.

409
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:53,389
Who's Eun Joo?

410
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:56,458
The owner of the homestay
owner where I lived in my 20s.

411
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,228
She was full of energy.

412
00:43:58,628 --> 00:44:01,128
I feel like seeing her will
give me the strength to live.

413
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:03,599
Min Jung, is that you?

414
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:06,168
My gosh.

415
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:08,468
Why did you suddenly become Min Jung?

416
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:10,639
It's me. What's wrong with you?

417
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:16,509
Min Jung, is that you?

418
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:18,079
I told you, it is.

419
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:47,567
The person you have
reached is not available.

420
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:50,378
Please leave a message after the tone.

421
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:56,679
Seeing you...

422
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:58,949
is making me even more depressed.

423
00:45:20,438 --> 00:45:21,739
Thank you.

424
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:35,458
(Eunjoo Homestay)

425
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:44,998
I'll go now.

426
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:48,068
The mattress was delivered.

427
00:45:48,938 --> 00:45:51,099
I brought the sofa in by myself too.

428
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:54,908
You moved that heavy thing all by yourself?

429
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:56,338
Yes. It was really hard.

430
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,239
I was afraid I'd dislocate my shoulder.

431
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:01,978
You should've...

432
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:05,248
done that with me.

433
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,259
1, 2, 3.

434
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:15,798
Slowly.

435
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:28,808
- Here.
- No, no.

436
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:29,937
In the bedroom.

437
00:46:29,938 --> 00:46:32,349
- Bedroom?
- 1, 2, 3.

438
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:53,528
Finally, the bedroom and living
room have been differentiated.

439
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,769
She was critical that they weren't before.

440
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:01,309
It's the door to dreams.

441
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:05,708
The pillows are nice.

442
00:49:22,874 --> 00:49:24,044
Is there food for me?

443
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:27,244
You said you don't eat breakfast.

444
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:28,945
I need to eat today.

445
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:33,215
I don't need soup.

446
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:35,584
I'll scoop the rice for you.

447
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:38,085
The person eating should
scoop however much they want.

448
00:49:41,664 --> 00:49:43,965
Chang Sup is late because of work,

449
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:46,234
and Jin Soo is sleeping...

450
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:47,465
I don't care.

451
00:49:54,135 --> 00:49:55,244
What's your problem?

452
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:57,405
I said to call.

453
00:49:58,814 --> 00:49:59,914
My bad.

454
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:04,044
Eun Joo.

455
00:50:05,514 --> 00:50:07,354
I went to my hometown.

456
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:11,294
Good girl.

457
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:15,465
I've been feeling down since yesterday.

458
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:18,195
You're amazing.

459
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:23,535
Did you go by yourself?

460
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:28,874
I'm so proud of you.

461
00:50:31,175 --> 00:50:33,474
I was going to eat with her
because I felt sorry for her.

462
00:50:34,374 --> 00:50:36,385
- I'll be home later.
- Okay.

463
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,825
Where did she go?

464
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:56,204
I wonder if he's up.

465
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:25,794
What good babies. You grew more.

466
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:29,035
What? Yes.

467
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:33,035
You're happy to have new family members?

468
00:51:41,544 --> 00:51:42,544
Hey.

469
00:51:43,144 --> 00:51:45,414
I have lotion and BB cream.

470
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:48,525
- You can use them all.
- Thank you.

471
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:50,683
You didn't go home?

472
00:51:50,684 --> 00:51:52,293
Good for you.

473
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:54,825
The studio has no
business, but good for you.

474
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:55,325
Where are the chairs?

475
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:57,525
Why would we have chairs?

476
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,024
Then do people listen standing up?

477
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:01,124
It's a house. They lie down.

478
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:02,794
Everyone brings a pillow.

479
00:53:03,525 --> 00:53:05,464
That's why it's in a house?

480
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:06,994
You almost fooled me.

481
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,063
Seo Woo,

482
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:11,424
why are you in such a good mood
that you're being so silly?

483
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:14,005
She's full of energy too.
She's carrying everything.

484
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:16,473
I went to my hometown yesterday.

485
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:17,544
Was it a day trip?

486
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:19,374
Seo Woo...

487
00:53:22,544 --> 00:53:23,584
What is it?

488
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:26,414
What is it? Why can't I be in the loop?

489
00:53:26,514 --> 00:53:29,485
You got over your trauma.

490
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,794
What trauma?

491
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:34,224
Hey. I want in too.

492
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:39,035
You rode a bike?

493
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,034
You never even took it
out after coming to Seoul.

494
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:42,164
I even drove too.

495
00:53:42,735 --> 00:53:44,005
How far did you go?

496
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:46,774
I drove for about five hours round trip.

497
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:49,774
Why are you doing things
you never did before?

498
00:53:49,775 --> 00:53:51,644
That's why you passed out and slept.

499
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:55,314
You're becoming high maintenance.

500
00:54:16,505 --> 00:54:18,505
You're hiding something, aren't you?

501
00:54:19,874 --> 00:54:21,005
Your wife...

502
00:54:21,974 --> 00:54:23,044
isn't coming.

503
00:54:24,604 --> 00:54:26,874
You can't accept that.

504
00:54:28,075 --> 00:54:30,014
- You're half right.
- I am?

505
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:33,615
Then what is it that you can't accept?

506
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:36,354
Tell me whether or not
this is the absolute worst.

507
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:38,055
That way, I can try to help.

508
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,595
The absolute worst...

509
00:54:40,894 --> 00:54:42,465
already happened.

510
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:47,834
How much does Seo Woo know?

511
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:08,285
Why won't he pick up?

512
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:09,954
I have a bad feeling about this.

513
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:27,905
Why didn't you come in?

514
00:55:29,305 --> 00:55:31,814
- You look terrible.
- I'm...

515
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:35,485
just too anxious right now.

516
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,755
Can you try to take some deep breaths?

517
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:43,724
Take some deep breaths.

518
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:45,755
There's someone I can't see.

519
00:55:48,124 --> 00:55:49,264
I want to avoid it.

520
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:51,695
At the performance?

521
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:54,064
Who? I'll get rid of them.

522
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:57,005
You look like anxiety swallowed you up.

523
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:59,104
Take deep breaths.

524
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:04,144
Come out. I'll hold you up.

525
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:06,414
Come out and try to stand.

526
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:07,874
Put your feet on the ground.

527
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:09,485
Come on.

528
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:16,425
Mr. Kang. Play with your
eyes closed just for today.

529
00:56:16,885 --> 00:56:19,755
Play today, and quit the piano afterward.

530
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,014
Your world won't fall apart even if you do.

531
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:27,764
What you're afraid of won't happen.

532
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:53,255
Just a minute, please.

533
00:57:02,164 --> 00:57:04,763
Don't stress about today's recording.

534
00:57:04,764 --> 00:57:07,535
Mr. Choi said not to feel pressured.

535
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,414
You're okay, right?

536
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,686
You're okay, right?

537
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:44,665
You're all set.

538
00:57:52,275 --> 00:57:54,516
Hey, we need to listen to this together.

539
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:56,985
She found Kim Min Jung's point of reaction.

540
00:57:58,215 --> 00:57:59,255
Play it.

541
00:57:59,315 --> 00:58:01,255
Okay, I'm putting you on speaker.

542
00:58:02,786 --> 00:58:06,055
It's Eunjoo Homestay.
It was Eunjoo Homestay!

543
00:58:06,056 --> 00:58:07,255
Eunjoo Homestay?

544
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:09,226
Awesome.

545
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,624
I go to work at the hotel
early in the morning,

546
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,536
eat a light lunch...

547
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:17,064
or eat at a pretty restaurant
and take a picture,

548
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:19,334
and post on my social
media page around 1pm.

549
00:58:19,335 --> 00:58:23,075
I call my daughter as
soon as my drama ends...

550
00:58:23,076 --> 00:58:25,274
and chat with her about
it, then I go to bed.

551
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:26,976
That's my daily life.

552
00:58:27,476 --> 00:58:30,414
How did you find the point of reaction?
It's so random.

553
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:32,314
I don't think it was random.

554
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:34,455
It may be subjective, but it's connected...

555
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:35,955
to a positive self-concept.

556
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:38,254
- Positive...
- It's purely personal,

557
00:58:38,255 --> 00:58:41,055
everyone has a memory
that activates their will,

558
00:58:41,056 --> 00:58:43,595
no, a memory that keeps them living.

559
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:45,865
Something that motivates you.

560
00:58:45,866 --> 00:58:47,365
Is it like the most beautiful
moment in one's life?

561
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:49,205
No, it's different.

562
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:53,335
It's like the healthiest experience.

563
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:55,306
A small piece of the person.

564
00:58:58,415 --> 00:58:59,444
(House Concert)

565
00:58:59,445 --> 00:59:01,246
It looks nice.

566
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:15,926
It's very different.

567
01:00:16,386 --> 01:00:17,585
Isn't it good?

568
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:20,295
I feel like he's back.

569
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:23,326
Is he doing well?

570
01:00:37,206 --> 01:00:40,375
I guess the person he
can't see didn't come.

571
01:01:11,445 --> 01:01:12,945
I guess you're better.

572
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:14,715
You're completely different.

573
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:17,715
I feel extremely anxious,

574
01:01:18,585 --> 01:01:20,516
but it's strange. It made something...

575
01:01:21,585 --> 01:01:22,956
surface for some reason.

576
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:27,695
Maybe your confidence
and anxiety are alike.

577
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:30,525
It was as good as your best performance.

578
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:32,835
I don't know what I feel.

579
01:01:35,436 --> 01:01:36,604
Great job today.

580
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:37,834
Great job today.

581
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:39,936
In Wook is buying dinner tonight.

582
01:01:40,275 --> 01:01:43,275
He looks like he had no clue.

583
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:44,945
Yes, let's go.

584
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:47,775
- What about Seo Woo?
- Seo Woo!

585
01:01:48,686 --> 01:01:50,016
Why are you going without me?

586
01:01:53,315 --> 01:01:54,715
You should come with us.

587
01:01:54,786 --> 01:01:58,425
But... I have a lot to put away.
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

588
01:01:58,426 --> 01:01:59,525
Please do...

589
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:01,326
my recordings going forward.

590
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:06,695
Are you officially hiring Seo Woo?

591
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:15,505
I'll do my best.

592
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:17,676
Great work everyone.

593
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:35,664
Where did you sleep?

594
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:37,065
Where I chatted with it.

595
01:02:37,426 --> 01:02:39,395
So that's the house.

596
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:43,465
That house is perfect for you.
It's quantum mechanics, you know?

597
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:46,834
It really comes down to the interactions.

598
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:49,076
It meshes with you for some reason.

599
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:52,475
Something in that house
having a certain mass...

600
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:54,345
It isn't an atom or a photon.

601
01:02:54,346 --> 01:02:59,155
Whatever it is cuts through
the air like this...

602
01:02:59,156 --> 01:03:02,084
and increases the electrical energy...

603
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:04,624
in your nerve endings from zero...

604
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,955
to bring them to their
maximum excited state.

605
01:03:06,956 --> 01:03:09,925
Sure. It's the perfect
situation to make things up.

606
01:03:09,926 --> 01:03:12,765
"Something, somehow, for some reason..."

607
01:03:12,766 --> 01:03:14,136
Why are you walking so fast?

608
01:03:14,936 --> 01:03:16,305
Was I walking fast?

609
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,406
Yes.

610
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,135
I have plans.

611
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:20,375
What's the meeting about?

612
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:24,075
It's just...
It's not a meeting, but it kind of is.

613
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:25,346
See you tomorrow.

614
01:03:28,576 --> 01:03:30,516
I see. "Just"?

615
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:34,186
Why is he acting out of character?

616
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,195
Oh my gosh.

617
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:20,096
When did you come?

618
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:22,105
Just now.

619
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:24,706
But...

620
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:27,875
Were you watching the whole time?

621
01:04:33,346 --> 01:04:35,485
I thought I felt eyes on me.

622
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:44,525
So this is how you look...

623
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:47,855
when you sleep well.

624
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:51,996
You always looked very irritable.

625
01:04:52,295 --> 01:04:56,105
But... I'm getting a
different vibe from you.

626
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,835
I slept well for the first time in a while.

627
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,105
This is how I feel.

628
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:10,714
I analyzed why I slept
so well all day long.

629
01:05:10,715 --> 01:05:13,255
You were tired. You drove and stuff.

630
01:05:14,485 --> 01:05:15,685
It's the house.

631
01:05:15,686 --> 01:05:17,785
That house is a good fit for you.

632
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:20,855
That house is perfect for you.
It's quantum mechanics.

633
01:05:20,956 --> 01:05:23,194
Please, anything but quantum mechanics.

634
01:05:23,195 --> 01:05:24,664
Like frequencies.

635
01:05:24,665 --> 01:05:27,734
Looking at quantum mechanics,
it's mutual interaction.

636
01:05:27,735 --> 01:05:30,235
Your special frequencies matched.

637
01:05:30,465 --> 01:05:33,005
It went from here to there.

638
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:36,205
The special frequencies
within that house...

639
01:05:36,206 --> 01:05:37,645
were picked up by you.

640
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:39,975
Something somehow...

641
01:05:39,976 --> 01:05:41,016
That's why...

642
01:05:41,746 --> 01:05:43,345
you could feel me behind you.

643
01:05:43,346 --> 01:05:45,556
Exactly. The house is the reason.

644
01:05:47,516 --> 01:05:48,556
You're astute.

645
01:05:49,156 --> 01:05:52,456
So there's something in the
house that helps me sleep.

646
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:54,525
That certain something.

647
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:57,445
I should sleep there from now on.

648
01:05:58,195 --> 01:06:00,665
Nice.

649
01:06:02,235 --> 01:06:03,536
Did you sleep well?

650
01:06:04,136 --> 01:06:06,206
I did. I slept like a log.

651
01:06:07,476 --> 01:06:09,076
I think I know why.

652
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:12,644
You know how new blankets are all crinkly.

653
01:06:12,645 --> 01:06:13,915
And they feel nice.

654
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:15,915
I fell right asleep.

655
01:06:19,056 --> 01:06:20,485
- The blanket.
- I'm positive.

656
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:24,926
I didn't get to see you sleep.

657
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:27,625
- Next time?
- Sleep with me again next time.

658
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,235
I mean...

659
01:06:37,436 --> 01:06:40,036
Is "Sleep with me" the right way to say it?

660
01:07:03,995 --> 01:07:06,596
Everyone's there, so I have to go.

661
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:12,835
Are you going to the house?

662
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,745
I want to see if it really is the location.

663
01:07:17,306 --> 01:07:18,346
I see.

664
01:07:20,176 --> 01:07:21,646
You see what?

665
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:26,016
Why are you so awkward?

666
01:07:33,155 --> 01:07:34,396
When I was coming here...

667
01:07:35,766 --> 01:07:37,266
It's not like we made plans,

668
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:40,396
but I hoped...

669
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:42,905
you'd be here.

670
01:07:43,835 --> 01:07:47,436
It was a very unfamiliar
feeling, but it felt warm.

671
01:07:57,245 --> 01:07:58,316
That sounds...

672
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:00,856
really nice.

673
01:08:05,896 --> 01:08:07,755
(Mr. Kang In Wook)

674
01:08:08,325 --> 01:08:10,665
I think he's calling
to tell me to hurry up.

675
01:08:10,995 --> 01:08:11,995
Excuse me.

676
01:08:14,795 --> 01:08:15,835
Hello.

677
01:08:16,236 --> 01:08:17,705
I'd like to listen...

678
01:08:19,335 --> 01:08:20,905
to my performance at the studio.

679
01:08:22,606 --> 01:08:23,606
Right now?

680
01:08:24,676 --> 01:08:26,375
I left the studio.

681
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,415
This is...

682
01:08:31,146 --> 01:08:32,686
very unusual for me.

683
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:36,926
The food is good here.

684
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:38,185
Let's drink until late...

685
01:08:38,186 --> 01:08:40,654
and work in the afternoon tomorrow.

686
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:42,665
- Yes, sir.
- Eat up.

687
01:08:43,325 --> 01:08:44,495
It'll take 10 minutes.

688
01:08:45,766 --> 01:08:47,665
It wasn't an important performance,

689
01:08:50,436 --> 01:08:51,736
but it's meaningful to me.

690
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:57,405
Will 10 minutes really do?

691
01:09:00,146 --> 01:09:01,176
Okay.

692
01:09:06,285 --> 01:09:10,055
Mr. Kang In Wook had been
in a slump all this time,

693
01:09:10,056 --> 01:09:12,155
and did really well today.

694
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:14,896
He wants to listen to the recording.

695
01:09:15,896 --> 01:09:16,995
I'll wait.

696
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:31,375
Kang In Wook.

697
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:49,865
It's definitely different.

698
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:55,535
Tension.

699
01:09:56,266 --> 01:09:58,835
There's a tension that anxiety creates.

700
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:03,405
Anxiety created by a person
I really don't want to see.

701
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:08,146
Did you see the person
earlier at the recital?

702
01:10:13,115 --> 01:10:15,195
No. I thought the person was
there, but I was wrong.

703
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:17,426
You were anxious thinking
the person was there.

704
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:20,356
I see.

705
01:10:24,995 --> 01:10:26,035
Let me try to play.

706
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:30,205
You want to play right now?

707
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:13,115
I'll be done soon.

708
01:11:13,646 --> 01:11:14,946
Is he playing right now?

709
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:17,146
I think he felt inspired.

710
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:37,566
Sorry.

711
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,676
We can listen together.

712
01:13:09,266 --> 01:13:12,196
I'll text often.

713
01:13:13,795 --> 01:13:16,606
You said that made you
feel like I was with you.

714
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:23,476
I am helping, aren't I?

715
01:13:27,016 --> 01:13:30,615
I'm helping you, but I feel
like I'm the one receiving help.

716
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,316
Giving feels like receiving,

717
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:35,615
and receiving feels like giving.

718
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:39,255
Isn't that what it means to be together?

719
01:13:41,955 --> 01:13:42,995
You are...

720
01:13:44,096 --> 01:13:45,726
of great help.

721
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:48,365
I'm glad.

722
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:55,905
The more I think about it,
the more I like the phrase...

723
01:13:56,276 --> 01:13:58,146
"being in the air".

724
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:01,346
Staying by your side comfortably like air.

725
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:02,846
How nice is that?

726
01:14:03,215 --> 01:14:05,545
Unintrusive like flowing water.

727
01:14:06,915 --> 01:14:08,915
It's nice feeling like
someone is by your side.

728
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,486
It provides a sense of security.

729
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:16,965
I can stay as much as you want.

730
01:14:19,596 --> 01:14:21,165
It's not like anyone can do it.

731
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:23,306
It's only because it's me.

732
01:14:23,936 --> 01:14:25,436
Why can you do it?

733
01:14:28,306 --> 01:14:30,905
Because you are such and such a person,

734
01:14:31,146 --> 01:14:35,016
and I am such and such a person.
I think that's why it's possible.

735
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:37,285
That "such and such" is for you to fill in,

736
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:41,015
but it's like we share...

737
01:14:41,016 --> 01:14:43,926
the one thing we wish
others would understand.

738
01:14:50,426 --> 01:14:51,625
I'll do it too.

739
01:14:53,665 --> 01:14:55,766
I'll be the person who stays...

740
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,136
for you.

741
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:21,926
(Epilogue)

742
01:16:51,785 --> 01:16:54,186
(A Piece of Your Mind)

743
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:55,516
Your hand.

744
01:16:55,915 --> 01:16:58,084
Briefly and affectionately.

745
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:02,055
How does it feel to be in the studio
with Kang In Wook all day long?

746
01:17:02,056 --> 01:17:03,766
Eun Joo and her boyfriend broke up.

747
01:17:03,896 --> 01:17:04,964
Get out.

748
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:06,066
Oh my gosh.

749
01:17:06,865 --> 01:17:08,364
You're leaving anyway.

750
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:09,464
I want to settle down here.

751
01:17:09,465 --> 01:17:10,465
Out of the blue?

752
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:13,005
Did my 1 percent grow to 20 percent?

753
01:17:13,335 --> 01:17:15,105
Someone's hand that I want to hold.

754
01:17:15,106 --> 01:17:17,105
Isn't it really nice...

755
01:17:17,106 --> 01:17:18,306
to hold their hand?

756
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:22,276
Close your eyes.
