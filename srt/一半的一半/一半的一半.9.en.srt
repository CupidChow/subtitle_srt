(A Piece of Your Mind)

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,619
It's not because of the location...

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,060
and it's not because I'm tired.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,100
I think I'm sleeping well...

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,299
because someone's been by my side.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,630
I miss you.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,640
No one else will use that bedding.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,969
Come whenever
you want to sleep well.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,079
I can't sleep in your room.

17
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,879
I can hear what you're thinking.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,519
What you're thinking.

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,719
You're right.

(Episode 9)

22
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,390
You haven't quit, have you?

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,030
You'll say what you don't mean.

24
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,599
Don't. I'm at peace right now.

25
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,260
Yes. Why are you at peace?

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,270
It's because of these babies.

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,599
There is definitely a reason.

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,169
You wake up one morning...

29
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,379
and suddenly think of 100 reasons
you shouldn't like him.

30
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,810
- How do you know...
- Listen.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,479
Kang In Wook and Han Seo Woo
sit in the dark together...

32
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,620
and just work hard.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,719
But to a stranger,
that doesn't make sense.

34
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,360
Whether nothing happens
or something does,

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,659
there is definitely a reason.

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,530
Think about it.

37
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,159
Something simple and minute...

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,400
that seems meaningless
will come to mind.

39
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,139
Will you stay here?

40
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,069
Mr. Kang doesn't
need me for practice.

41
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,439
You stay here for me.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,449
There cannot be no reason.

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,919
I must put Ji Su back.

44
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,759
Mr. Kang.

45
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,199
Your playing is good.

46
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,669
It's so good, I think of it
before I go to bed.

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,569
How could you write such music?

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,469
If someone like me thinks it's nice,

49
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,539
then it really is nice, isn't it?

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,349
Did you listen to it that much?

51
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,680
It stuck with me immediately.

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,150
Can I stay and listen here?

53
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,590
Do as you wish.

54
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,509
- Sun Ho, move to the side.
- What?

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,909
Okay.

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,710
You don't have to hide, though.

57
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,719
Okay.

58
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
My gosh.

59
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,310
Sun Ho asked me to fix the blinds.

60
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,410
Did she send you on an errand too?

61
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,980
No, well...

62
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,949
You could've just said yes.

63
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,389
So,

64
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,490
if you don't have time to see me,

65
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,459
why do you come to my place?

66
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,569
What's the difference between
seeing me and seeing my place?

67
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,240
Was that deliberate?

68
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,079
Going back and
staying only for a while.

69
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,610
Yes.

70
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,680
You can't lie.

71
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,819
- It's...
- I miss you.

72
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,290
I want to be with you.

73
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,660
And I want to hold hands.

74
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,699
It's my first two-way relationship.

75
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,970
That's how I feel.

76
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,740
Will you stay? I'll leave.

77
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
No.

78
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,180
Are you still there, Sun Ho?

79
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,730
Are the plants
from my place doing well?

80
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,490
Of course, they are. I'm...

81
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,069
I thought that was all my wife left.

82
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,379
In a completely unexpected place,

83
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,050
she released me so I could breathe.

84
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,819
Playing this tune...

85
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,319
helps me go on.

86
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,120
My wife.

87
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,060
She left this world.

88
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,850
I got the test results back.

89
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,590
And? You don't
have anything, do you?

90
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,259
The doctor said to me that...

91
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,370
he's never seen such a clear colon.

92
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,370
That made me wonder...

93
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,809
why I'd suffered so much.

94
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:00,240
Everything I'd worried about
was lifted in an instant.

95
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,480
Having to see him
morning and evening...

96
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,620
after we broke up was such a pain.

97
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,350
I get to see him
after our break-up...

98
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,919
when you're not supposed to.

99
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:11,659
There are pros.

100
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,090
Most people break up
to stop seeing each other.

101
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,129
You have to face each other
if you work in the same office.

102
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,659
You don't provide breakfast.

103
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,259
- Shall I kick him out?
- Yes.

104
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,169
Aren't you Chang Seob's friend?

105
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,429
It's hard on you.

106
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,200
Who doesn't struggle
after a break-up?

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,070
- Chang Seob.
- Darn it.

108
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,769
That's all I have to say.

109
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,639
You, you.

110
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,750
Tell me another of your 100 reasons.

111
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,450
I can't do that
on the spur of the moment.

112
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,720
There had better be 100.

113
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll make you list them all.

114
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,389
Well, it's like...

115
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,289
What was it?

116
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:49,330
Hand over your 100 reasons.

117
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,200
You can't. Why did you lie to me?

118
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Give me 100 reasons.

119
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,870
Give me 100 reasons.

120
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,809
100 reasons. 100 reasons.

121
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,840
He kept telling me.

122
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,779
"I need you, Seo Woo."

123
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,950
"Be there for me."

124
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,220
To come. To be with him.

125
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,320
- I miss you.
- He misses me.

126
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,090
I want to be with you.
And I want to hold hands.

127
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,059
It's my first two-way relationship.

128
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,799
There's no reason I can't go.

129
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,200
This is clearly
a two-way relationship.

130
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,320
- That thing.
- That thing.

131
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,549
It's yours.

132
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,279
The temperature dropped suddenly.

133
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,009
This will be uncomfortable.

134
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,820
Your back and shoulders will hurt.

135
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,289
There's always a way.

136
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,720
This posture helps
the blood flow better in your legs,

137
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,559
and it helps you
fall asleep more easily.

138
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,409
How did you know?

139
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,120
I could feel you staring at me.

140
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,419
Did it snow?

141
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,429
It's the spring snow.

142
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,399
The word "spring" makes
everything sound better.

143
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,840
Spring snow. Spring night.
Spring cold.

144
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,639
"Spring cold"?

145
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Yes.

146
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,509
It's the kind of cold you get
when you get lonely in spring.

147
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:41,049
That's not what it actually means,
but Eun Ju and I use it like that.

148
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,659
The sound of the snow falling
woke me up.

149
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,860
You heard the snow fall?

150
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,330
It's hard to hear that in Seoul.

151
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,629
You can barely hear that
even in the countryside.

152
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,470
The snow needs to pile up on crocks
for you to be able to hear that.

153
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,279
I could hear it every now and then
after I turned 18.

154
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,179
That's interesting.

155
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,690
Today's my first time
recording at the studio.

156
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,419
It's an official recording,
and I'll be in charge.

157
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,330
I'm glad it's snowing.
It's a good sign.

158
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,759
Sweep the entire place.

159
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,629
Hurry up.

160
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,730
Don't forget the corner over there.

161
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,789
Oh, gosh.

162
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,019
Are you okay?

163
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,360
It's nothing to worry about.

164
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,789
I must've made you even more nervous
than you already are.

165
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,799
Didn't you hurt your hand?

166
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,630
I don't scar that easily.

167
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,470
I'm more worried about you.

168
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,769
Do you think
I'll be able to do a good job?

169
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:14,869
Of course.

170
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,079
By the way,
how's the musician's condition?

171
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,880
I tried my best to bring out
his best condition,

172
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,650
but we chose
the final piece yesterday.

173
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,920
He'll do well.

174
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,150
In Wook always does great
as long as he's in good condition.

175
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,920
Give me some good luck.

176
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,470
Shall we begin?

177
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,140
Okay.

178
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,029
I really liked it.

179
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,839
Then let's go with this one.

180
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,039
Okay.

181
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,480
You did great.

182
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,779
You too.

183
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,089
Thank you for letting me
record this piece.

184
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,529
I'll share the final recording
before I upload it.

185
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,759
You can share it with whomever
before it gets released.

186
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,599
I don't have anyone
I want to share it with.

187
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,869
I'm really tired right now.

188
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,140
Oh, okay.

189
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,160
Well...

190
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:33,200
You two should be happy.
What's with the long face?

191
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,509
- We all did great.
- Yes.

192
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,750
Here you go.

193
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,089
Thank you.

194
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,789
Gosh, this looks delicious.

195
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,089
It's good.

196
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,420
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

197
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,230
He can cook most of the food
we usually order,

198
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,200
but he can't fry chicken like this.

199
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,099
It's a pity that I can't eat this
every time I crave chicken and beer.

200
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,529
Our chef needs some improvement...

201
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:06,640
when it comes to fried chicken
and Pyeongyang-style cold noodles.

202
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,410
Everything will be perfect
once he masters them both.

203
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,440
But doesn't he cook cold noodles?

204
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,109
It's not perfect.

205
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,549
If the pressure in the extruder
is too strong,

206
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,019
the noodles come out too hard.

207
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,589
But if it's too weak, the noodles
break apart too easily.

208
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,089
It's important to use
just the right amount of buckwheat,

209
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,690
but that's really hard to do.

210
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,829
Someone should donate
their noodle extruder.

211
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,460
- Forget it.
- Okay.

212
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,230
We're trying to find a way.
Hey, wipe your mouth.

213
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,200
Plus, it takes up too much space.

214
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,839
There needs to be some pressure...
Hey, wait.

215
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,809
I put the blueprint
in your storage room.

216
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,509
Yes, it's still there.

217
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,410
It's still there?

218
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,450
My gosh, wait.

219
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,980
Okay, done.

220
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,720
Also, I'm taking a few days off
starting today.

221
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,059
Cheers.

222
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,289
- Let's eat.
- Cheers, guys.

223
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,559
- Get some needed rest.
- Got it.

224
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,240
Remember the plant
you were interested in?

225
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,339
I couldn't give you that
since it's Seo Woo's.

226
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,650
Anyway, here you go.

227
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,920
What's this?

228
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,349
I bought them a few days ago.

229
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,519
I wanted to use them today,
but the timing didn't seem right.

230
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,390
A few days ago,

231
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,470
the day before
you mentioned your wife.

232
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,140
Anyway, you should celebrate.

233
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,470
I'm sure it'll be fine
just for today.

234
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:51,509
Still, that's just my opinion,
so the choice is yours.

235
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,039
Jin Su, breakfast is ready!

236
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,579
Where did one of the chairs go?

237
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,990
Oh, the lady
at the end of the room took it.

238
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,390
I see.

239
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
No!

240
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,789
- What...
- What's going on?

241
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,700
I still have the key
from when I stayed in that room.

242
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
What's this about?

243
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,940
You know...
The hanging from the ceiling.

244
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,210
It's a common method.

245
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,440
Even in "The Shawshank Redemption",
the inn, ceiling, chair...

246
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,109
- We should get in there.
- What are you talking about?

247
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,180
This isn't some inn, you know.
Don't be absurd.

248
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,779
- My gosh. What do we do?
- The key.

249
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,549
Yes, the key. Open it!

250
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,890
Oh, no.

251
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,160
No!

252
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,099
My gosh.

253
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,970
What did you write up there?

254
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,180
How can I remember
when it was years ago?

255
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,279
You were the student
who lived in this room?

256
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,410
Min Jung?

257
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,049
Just "Min Jung"?

258
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,690
Even as a kid, you always
used to treat me like a peer.

259
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,019
You're so old now.
I can hardly recognize you.

260
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,789
I thought you were
older than me at first too.

261
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,930
She called me a rich girl...

262
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,430
just because I was
being given this business.

263
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,900
You have no idea
how annoying it was.

264
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,329
- But I'm right.
- As if.

265
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,599
You're not going to do
anything bad, right?

266
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,539
- Why would I?
- What's this?

267
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,509
You wrote a boy's name
and then erased it.

268
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,440
Seo Jun Hui?

269
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,119
Gosh, now I remember.
I was so silly back then.

270
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,650
There's more. Cha Hyun Woo.

271
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,319
It seems like you scratched it off
with your nails.

272
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,759
What else could I do
after breaking up with him?

273
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,019
How many boyfriends did you have?

274
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,190
You could've at least
erased them properly.

275
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,289
I was popular, you know.

276
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,400
"A fun day filled with joy."

277
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,230
"Don't forget this day."

278
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,029
"May 2002."

279
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,799
- What day was that?
- I have no idea.

280
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,910
But you wrote not to forget it.

281
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,940
I guess it was something fun.

282
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,380
So there she is.
The happy and bright Min Jung.

283
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,119
Cheer up.

284
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,690
Another name would make it
look like the Big Dipper.

285
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,259
Welcome, Min Jung.

286
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,359
- You gained a lot of weight though.
- What?

287
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,930
I'm glad you got rid
of those awful curls.

288
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,769
- Should I write Chang Seob's name?
- Stop it!

289
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,009
Wait, hold on.

290
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:15,109
Pressing that
will upload the song, right?

291
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,720
- Just a second.
- Done.

292
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
("No. 1" by Kang In Wook
was successfully uploaded.)

293
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,630
(Han Seo Woo, No. 1)

294
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,900
Mom, Dad,

295
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,940
this is the song I edited
that was finally released.

296
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:16,670
Amazing, right?

297
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,700
(A fun day filled with joy.
Don't forget this day. May 2002.)

298
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,420
What did you think of the music?

299
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,720
How can it not be good
when you recorded it?

300
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,349
How can I congratulate you though?

301
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,259
Any thoughts?

302
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,559
I've never thought about
these things before.

303
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
Seo Woo.

304
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,099
You two...

305
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,400
He's Mr. Dawn, the guy
who works here during the night.

306
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,309
Right, Mr. Dawn.

307
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,380
Hello, there.

308
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,710
I heard a lot about you.

309
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,779
Do you know each other through work?

310
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,680
He booked the studio,
but he got the hours wrong.

311
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,559
Now that you're done,
you should leave.

312
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,430
- Bye.
- Bye.

313
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,089
Goodness.

314
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,930
Just a second.

315
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,440
Why didn't you tell me
you were friends?

316
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,779
We're friends.

317
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,319
Uncle!

318
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,490
Seo Woo?

319
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,730
Just so you know,
I decided to congratulate you...

320
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,269
on your first recording
with a tangible gift.

321
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,440
Take a look at your bank account.

322
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,410
(Wired transfer from Moon Sun Ho,
3,500 US dollars)

323
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,880
(Receive wire transfer)

324
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,319
(Wire transfer for audio file)

325
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,920
(Receive wire transfer)

326
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,559
You receive a raise of 30 percent!

327
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,759
My gosh. You startled me.

328
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,089
Congratulations.

329
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,430
It's the least I can do
for my top engineer.

330
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,769
Thank you.

331
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,829
How did you do all this?

332
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,200
The frying pans did.

333
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,359
Congratulations.

334
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,730
I can't believe it.

335
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,210
I've been congratulated more today
than I would be in my whole life.

336
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,470
I don't know if I can have it all.

337
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,210
Dig in.

338
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,630
It's good.

339
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,970
You said...

340
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,640
that you sometimes
hear the snow fall.

341
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
It started when you around 18.

342
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,950
Did something...

343
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,720
happen to you back then?

344
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,619
My mom...

345
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,000
I've never
talked about her out loud...

346
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,500
that I can't seem
to find the words.

347
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,470
She died in a similar way...

348
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,279
your parents did.

349
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,650
Because of heavy snow.

350
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,920
That was it.

351
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,819
But the reason...

352
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,589
However much I thought,

353
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
I just couldn't accept it.

354
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,660
I waited for it to snow.

355
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,599
To find out...

356
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,440
a reason that made sense.

357
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:52,910
I was surprised when you said that
even nature makes mistakes.

358
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,950
Nature can never make mistakes.

359
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,259
That's what I wanted to believe.

360
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,289
That's why...

361
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,299
you heard the snow fall
since you were 18.

362
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,180
I ruined your special day
with a sob story.

363
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,660
When I woke up this morning

364
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:50,200
And saw the bed covers
folded up nicely

365
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:58,609
I suddenly had a thought

366
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,410
I wish I disappeared

367
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,789
If I were to disappear

368
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,230
As if I were never

369
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,699
Even in this place

370
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,469
If I go on living like this

371
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:38,150
Then there will be a reason

372
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,550
Where I cannot disappear

373
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,159
If I go on living like this

374
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,000
A reason...

375
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,469
where you must never disappear.

376
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,730
(From Seo Woo)

377
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,599
I got a raise.

378
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:34,539
Here's a red cardigan
instead of red thermal underwear.

379
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,010
Now I'll pay 70 percent of the rent.

380
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,710
If you wear this,

381
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,309
you'll think of
what you can do for yourself.

382
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,250
Promise you'll do that.

383
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,730
What I can do for myself,

384
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,769
only I know.

385
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,199
Only I know.

386
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,579
Hey. My team
chose my project this time.

387
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,119
I focused only on ASMR tracks.

388
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,289
They'll release mine on the app.

389
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,300
He used to love eggs.

390
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,900
I remember Cha Hyun Woo.

391
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,400
What about Seo Jun Hui?

392
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,110
He was younger than me.

393
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,349
Do you need to go to the farm?

394
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,719
No.

395
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,190
Hoon is over there.
To cool down for a couple of days.

396
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,849
Doesn't he know I'm in Seoul?

397
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,260
How dare he order me...

398
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,920
Tell him to clean up
while he's there.

399
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,760
And take his things from storage.

400
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,960
He can't get into the storage.

401
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,099
You can go and let him in.

402
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,730
Okay.

403
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,929
Do you need anything?

404
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,000
Cash. That house needs cash.

405
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:19,940
Hello.

406
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,440
Ma'am.

407
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,309
Did you hurt your wrist?

408
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,380
Yes. Up to the elbow.

409
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:29,789
I'm getting forgetful.

410
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,820
I can't work for a while.

411
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:37,460
But my last project was your first.

412
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,159
So I'm really pleased.

413
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,570
You must come back when you recover.

414
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,170
We're a team.

415
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,769
I was really good at it.

416
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:50,340
You were. You turned
tuning into an art.

417
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,539
You almost cried in the studio.

418
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,510
Isn't that why
you decided to work here?

419
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,050
Isn't it a great place to cry?

420
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,489
Is it your first time here?

421
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,920
My senior asked to see me here.

422
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,389
I'll wait outside.

423
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,030
How old are you?

424
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,389
In my last year of university.

425
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,130
It's a tough age.

426
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,769
But it's nice, isn't it?

427
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,940
You lived with your parents.

428
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:25,269
Your mom's in the kitchen
when you wake up.

429
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:30,809
In the evening, your dad
comes home from work.

430
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,050
And you had siblings.

431
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,000
It feels like a dream.
How did I manage that?

432
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,309
My parents died in an accident.

433
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,150
I'm okay, but sometimes I just...

434
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,019
Just a moment.

435
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,349
Come in here.

436
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,099
Don't hold back.
You can cry in here.

437
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,809
I'm really glad you took this job.

438
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,380
You're very good.

439
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,989
Did you come
all the way here to say that?

440
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,090
Of course.

441
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,820
I wanted to praise you.

442
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,510
In a place that you liked, Ji Su,

443
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,250
in the atmosphere you liked.

444
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,690
I wanted to say hello.

445
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:11,809
Ji Su.

446
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,750
Ji Su?

447
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,949
Is it broken?

448
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:25,920
What's broken?

449
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,329
What is broken?

450
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,070
Are you alone?

451
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,809
Yes.

452
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,409
What's that?

453
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:48,639
It's nothing.

454
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,079
I didn't know you were coming.

455
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:56,519
- I'll be off now.
- Were you...

456
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,460
really alone?

457
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,360
No one's here.

458
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:08,960
Someone was here.

459
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,139
I love cash.

460
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,769
Shopping is the best way
to cheer myself up.

461
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:19,780
Hey, guys.

462
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,980
Thanks, Uncle.

463
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:27,320
My goodness. Mr. Kang.

464
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,389
I didn't know you were here.

465
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,789
What's the matter?

466
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:38,230
I must be crazy.

467
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,230
I even hear things now.

468
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,110
We also receive projects
from a large corporation.

469
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,179
They collect people's voices.

470
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,610
Anyway, that's what you heard.

471
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,349
What kind of company
collects people's voices?

472
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,849
It's confidential.

473
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:04,920
Anyway, it's not a weird place.

474
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,389
And you're not crazy, okay?

475
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,039
I normally don't like hearing people
talk about their hardships.

476
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:21,469
It's depressing.

477
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:24,940
But I'll be nice and hear you out.

478
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:26,780
Go ahead and tell me what happened.

479
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,469
"Kim Ji Su".

480
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:53,769
(From Kim Ji Su, To Moon Jung Sook)

481
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,079
We'll talk here.

482
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,449
Ji Su likes seeing the sunset.

483
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,619
So I'll talk to her then.

484
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:27,400
Hoon.

485
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,969
Hoon.

486
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,840
It's cold outside.
Here's your takeout food.

487
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:44,289
- Hey, wait.
- Give me that.

488
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:53,230
I'm doing well.

489
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,769
My husband and I had a hard time
getting used to living in Seoul.

490
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:02,440
But I'm relieved to know
that you're somewhere nearby...

491
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:05,070
because I don't know anyone here.

492
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:07,710
Come to think of it,

493
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,010
I always end up
living in unfamiliar places.

494
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,750
I used to miss Seoul
when I was in Oslo.

495
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,920
But now that I'm in Seoul,
I miss Oslo.

496
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,460
Especially around this time of year.

497
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,489
The entire neighborhood
was like a huge Christmas tree.

498
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,059
Merry Christmas.

499
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,869
December 24, 2019.

500
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,269
P. S.

501
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:36,710
Please forget about what I wrote...

502
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,710
in the previous letter.

503
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,719
- Hey.
- Is this the previous letter?

504
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
Yes, that's it.

505
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,519
I'd like to meet you one day.

506
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,519
Here's my phone number.
Please call me.

507
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,289
Once Ha Won is okay,
everything else will also be okay.

508
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:02,030
Everything will be okay.

509
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,400
(I found out
why Ha Won's mother died.)

510
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,599
I found out
why Ha Won's mother died.

511
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,469
I'd like to meet you one day.

512
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:15,539
Here's my phone number.
Please call me.

513
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,079
Once Ha Won is okay,
everything else will also be okay.

514
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,679
Everything will be okay.

515
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,150
(I found out
why Ha Won's mother died.)

516
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,320
I found out
why Ha Won's mother died.

517
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,630
Hey.

518
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:35,429
I already checked everything.

519
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:38,269
It came to the wrong address.

520
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,039
(From Kim Ji Su)

521
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,570
Ji Su.

522
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:16,940
Guess where I am.

523
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:21,909
It sounds like you're at the place
where I delivered my plates.

524
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,349
You're right.

525
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,760
I found out
why Ha Won's mother died.

526
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:39,530
I feel so distressed.

527
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,199
Please call me, Ms. Moon.
I want to meet you.

528
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:45,500
(December 16, 2019, From Kim Ji Su)

529
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:48,969
It seems like
you don't read my letters,

530
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,840
and that puts me at ease.

531
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,579
I've always wanted
to say this out loud.

532
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:00,050
I miss...

533
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:02,219
Ha Won.

534
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:10,289
Once Ha Won is okay,
everything else will also be okay.

535
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:11,929
(January 22, 2020, From Kim Ji Su)

536
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:12,929
Everything...

537
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,300
will be okay.

538
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,800
What I regret the most...

539
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,769
is having told her the truth.

540
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,380
I gathered all your old videos.

541
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,219
My videos?

542
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:34,849
Some are from back when
you used to be in your early 20s.

543
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:38,889
I'm going to open
your own webpage later on.

544
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,619
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

545
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:45,059
It's really hard to get chosen
as a pianist in April's Piano.

546
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,800
And this is your first time.

547
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,500
I'm so happy.

548
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,639
This is nice.

549
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,670
You worked so hard.

550
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:00,480
You have no connections here.

551
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,210
And I know how much effort
you put into this.

552
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,280
I'm glad the world
finally acknowledges that.

553
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:08,219
You no longer need to struggle.

554
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:10,989
"Struggle"?

555
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,829
This is nothing.

556
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,929
What gives me a hard time
is what lies deep inside my heart.

557
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,630
What is it?

558
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,139
If I tell you,

559
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,769
would you be able to understand?

560
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,309
Let me hear what it is first.

561
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,750
Then I won't tell you.

562
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:42,250
Go ahead. I'm in a great mood.

563
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,789
It's something that happened
when I was really young.

564
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,389
How young?

565
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,159
When I lived in Norway.

566
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,900
How bad could it be?

567
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,940
It's fine as long as no one died.

568
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,099
What if someone did?

569
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:05,570
You look so startled.

570
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,639
No, I'm not startled.

571
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,719
When I used to live in Europe,

572
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:17,590
I didn't make any Korean friends
because I wanted to adjust.

573
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,760
I was young and stubborn.

574
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:25,289
I didn't even use Korean.

575
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,699
And there's this Korean guy
I used to hate.

576
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,929
Why did you hate him?

577
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,570
Actually,

578
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,809
that doesn't matter.
You could hate people for no reason.

579
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
So what happened?

580
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,210
"You could hate people
for no reason."

581
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,909
"That doesn't matter."

582
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,250
That's correct.

583
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,699
It was snowing.

584
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,300
It was snowing heavily.

585
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:11,110
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

586
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:15,309
Are you Korean?

587
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,449
You've been walking past here
for about two months now.

588
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,619
You never answered me,
so I thought you weren't Korean.

589
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,389
You go to the nearby
high school, right?

590
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:27,960
Everyone at the school
was finding shelter,

591
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,059
but I ended up saying...

592
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,400
Ha Won's on his way here.

593
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:46,440
So let me get this straight.

594
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:49,639
Because of an unnecessary lie
you told someone,

595
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,579
that person suffered an accident?

596
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,920
So what?

597
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:01,090
Why did you tell me?

598
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,489
It's not a big deal
unless you make it a big deal.

599
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,159
You shouldn't have told me.

600
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,099
It was a mistake.

601
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,800
Why can't you say...

602
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,000
that it's all right?

603
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,469
How is this all right?

604
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:17,539
Ji Su...

605
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,349
You can't be this way. Back then...

606
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,980
Ha Won...

607
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:30,849
Oh, no.

608
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:35,789
Ji Su, why can't you
take my side on this?

609
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,559
Why?

610
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,159
Just tell me it's all right...

611
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,199
and I'll be able to live again.

612
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,199
Why couldn't she take my side?

613
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:53,070
If only she had taken my side.

614
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,380
It wasn't a big deal.

615
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,750
It's okay.

616
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,789
It's all right.

617
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:31,150
Let me hear the music
you recorded with Ms. Eun.

618
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,710
I'll know immediately.

619
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:36,380
There's this feeling, you know,
and I'll detect it.

620
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,489
Are you ready then?

621
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,159
I can't wait.

622
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,730
The pianist is Kang In Wook.

623
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,119
It's scary...

624
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,289
but beautiful.

625
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:18,690
You shouldn't have told me.

626
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,760
I know why Ha Won's mother died.

627
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,699
It wasn't due to the heavy snow.

628
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:31,010
Ji Su, why can't you
take my side on this? Why?

629
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,110
My husband was involved.

630
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,210
I can't handle this by myself.

631
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,880
I want the world to know,

632
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,679
but I also can't say anything.

633
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,150
It's why I'm writing to you.

634
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,159
I'm writing to you because
I know you won't read them.

635
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,889
You should go with Consul Moon.

636
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,130
You'll be better off
than staying with my mom.

637
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,829
I'll feel more relieved too.

638
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,070
It won't snow.

639
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,300
I can't leave this place.

640
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:36,400
You can.

641
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,610
I'll stay and
find out what happened.

642
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,929
Look up at the ceiling.

643
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:03,130
It'll calm you down.

644
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,909
I remember...

645
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,050
why I sold the bowls.

646
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,190
I finally remember.

647
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,360
I remember the reason.

648
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,500
I remember...

649
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,500
why.

650
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,139
Could it have been something else...

651
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,710
than the heavy snow?

652
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,219
She died someplace
that wasn't the shelter.

653
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:56,920
You've already asked me that
thousands of times.

654
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:58,420
It seems she went out
to look for you.

655
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,389
That's what I don't understand.

656
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,460
She knew how to stay safe
in a blizzard.

657
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,960
Go to the school
or the halfway shelter.

658
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,670
She knew better than anyone,
so why would she be elsewhere?

659
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,699
Ha Won...

660
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,070
It seems like Ji Su
found something out recently.

661
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,809
If it was something
she thought you should know,

662
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,739
she would've told you.

663
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:24,179
She didn't because
it wasn't important.

664
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,380
She sought you out.

665
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:30,389
She wrote numerous letters to you.

666
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:31,489
If that was the case,

667
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,760
then it really
must not have been important.

668
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,929
I'm certain that
something else happened.

669
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:38,989
Can this old lady
give you some advice?

670
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,099
A lot of what's true
can make you suffer...

671
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:42,699
and some things are better
not known.

672
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,070
I don't care about...

673
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,099
what happens afterward
or how it can shape my life.

674
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,940
What terrifies me the most...

675
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,349
is not knowing what I should.

676
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,019
Gosh, it's cold.

677
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,119
It's chilly outside.

678
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,960
Ha Won,

679
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:12,889
remember how we first met?

680
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:14,760
It was in Boston.

681
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:20,000
When a blizzard hits, the snow
stacks up to at least our knees.

682
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,500
Right? But then I saw
a guy on the street...

683
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,309
staring up at the sky.

684
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:30,079
At first, I thought your neck
would be sore the next day.

685
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,250
But then I realized...

686
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,019
that you were glaring at the sky.

687
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:38,719
It was intense.

688
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:42,019
Ha Won,

689
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,030
I'm sure Kim Ji Su...

690
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,699
thought about her too
whenever it snowed.

691
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:50,400
But then...

692
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,599
she recently figured out
it wasn't just the snow...

693
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,369
that caused your mother's accident.

694
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:00,809
It must've been something
that could ease your mind.

695
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,139
A realization.

696
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:07,579
I'm sure that's all
she wanted to tell you.

697
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:09,079
I have a theory.

698
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,150
And what's that?

699
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:11,750
The reason Ji Su was miserable.

700
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,920
Didn't you spend years trying
to not think about her husband?

701
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,289
I never said it was her husband.

702
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,000
Well, what else can it be?
Still, you decided to block him out,

703
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:23,059
so keep it that way.

704
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:36,610
Hello?

705
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,610
Sun Ho, it's me.

706
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,980
Yes?

707
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,079
Is Kim Ji Su's husband a foreigner?

708
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,380
I'm curious as to
why you want to know.

709
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,750
Kim Ji Su and Ha Won
were the only Koreans in Norway.

710
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,820
Why do you think they were so close?

711
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,289
It was only those two.

712
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:53,590
Anyway, don't you dare
ask Uncle about that.

713
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:55,599
He even left his phone here.

714
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:57,469
He can't do anything without it.

715
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,630
- He left it here on purpose.
- Why?

716
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,599
To distance himself from the world.

717
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:04,739
I don't care if he does.

718
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,239
- You won't come here?
- Why should I?

719
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:08,739
I'm really busy. Bye.

720
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,849
Why did she snap?

721
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:23,860
Hey, you.

722
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:27,030
What are you doing
outside someone's home? Move.

723
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,130
Why are you smiling?

724
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:33,800
I'm here to see Seo Woo.

725
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,010
You're the 100...

726
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,880
It's nice to meet you.

727
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:50,280
Come on in.

728
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,489
Seo Woo's not picking up.

729
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,300
Did you not call her?

730
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,269
I'll wait at the studio.

731
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,000
Tell her to come over.

732
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,300
I left my phone at home.

733
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:11,139
Did you have breakfast?

734
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,739
It's fine. I don't feel well.

735
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:14,809
Oh, dear.

736
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,909
If I don't even offer you water,

737
01:01:16,909 --> 01:01:18,380
Seo Woo will kill me.

738
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:22,880
Sit down.

739
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:30,860
When you don't feel well,

740
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,389
crusty rice in water is best.

741
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,210
It's nice.

742
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,780
Why did you come
without an appointment?

743
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,150
Because I wanted to see her.

744
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,519
You won't say
anything upsetting, right?

745
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,789
I don't want her to get upset.

746
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,030
No.

747
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,159
When I'm with Seo Woo,

748
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:11,400
my mind clears.

749
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,800
And I feel relaxed.

750
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,469
She does that to you.

751
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:20,239
Looking at her cheers you up.

752
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,610
I feel the same.

753
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,050
So,

754
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,849
why does Seo Woo
have so many issues?

755
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:36,659
She has 100 reasons that
stop her from liking someone.

756
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:39,090
I asked for them all,

757
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,699
and they're all stupid.

758
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,730
Tell me just one.

759
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,070
She feels as if someone's
misfortune is her happiness.

760
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,239
How silly.

761
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:51,710
Right?

762
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,309
She's usually quite cheerful,

763
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:56,940
but she gets timid suddenly.

764
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,510
She's always leaning over like this,

765
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,079
slouched over like a wet rag.

766
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,150
"I don't know. I won't do it."

767
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,380
"Leave me alone."

768
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:05,590
She made up those 100 reasons...

769
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:07,789
because she felt like
shrinking away.

770
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,530
Is the food bad?

771
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:12,489
Why won't you eat?
It's an insult to me.

772
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:17,800
It's good.

773
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,460
My goodness.

774
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,500
Is something up?

775
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:57,610
What is it this time?

776
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,369
Talk to me.

777
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,409
You're acting weird.

778
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,550
Hey.

779
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,489
Go home. Don't stay outside.

780
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:19,190
Are you going home?

781
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:24,769
- I came to see Seo Woo.
- Seo Woo?

782
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:27,869
She's out on work, with Mr. Kang.

783
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,070
They're shooting
a music video. Cool, right?

784
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,269
I want to promote him
as best we can.

785
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,139
- Did you call her to meet?
- No.

786
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,380
I miss her.

787
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,579
My gosh. Hey.

788
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,289
- You... Is that...
- It's that.

789
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:06,570
I don't like the sound.

790
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,449
It echoes too much.

791
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:22,260
Can't you just pretend to play?

792
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:24,760
You were against that,
so we're even recording you.

793
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,929
We'll edit the video
to fit the music,

794
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:29,059
so let's just shoot.

795
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,969
It's not even a classical piece.

796
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,480
Ms. Moon chose this place because...

797
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,289
it has a nice look...

798
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:53,090
that will suit the poster too.

799
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:55,090
Then you haven't been here.

800
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:58,590
Forget Sun Ho, but you should've
checked the location.

801
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:03,829
The locations we can
go to right now are...

802
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,400
one, our recording studio.

803
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,469
Two, Mr. Choi's studio.

804
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:09,539
We can check the schedule,

805
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:12,110
or we can shoot
where you used to live,

806
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,480
or a place that's familiar to you.

807
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,909
My house sounds good.

808
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,409
The apartment I lived in
when I was four.

809
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,780
My aunt who was a pianist
lived in Oslo.

810
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:22,820
Can we shoot there?

811
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,519
When can we find a house
with a nice sound?

812
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,460
There is one.

813
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,230
My friend said it sounded nice.

814
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,800
Never mind.

815
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,230
Number two. Jin Moo's studio.

816
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:40,769
Okay.

817
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,519
- My goodness.
- Did I startle you?

818
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:00,760
This is nothing.

819
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,260
I almost passed out
with shock earlier.

820
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:05,989
- It's nice to see you.
- What did you do?

821
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:11,000
As you can see,
the sound wasn't great here,

822
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:14,599
and the director said,
"It's not even a classical piece."

823
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,000
We decided to shoot at
Mr. Choi's studio.

824
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:19,869
- I got him to say yes.
- No way. It's not pretty there.

825
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,380
This place is pretty,
but the sound is terrible.

826
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:26,480
How dare you?

827
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:29,849
That's it.

828
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,420
That's why you're so high-spirited.

829
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,519
Han Seo Woo you...

830
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,460
(Kim Hoon)

831
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:45,000
I said I won't come over.

832
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,610
(Eun Ju)

833
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,940
Did you meet the guy
who wanted to see you?

834
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,150
(Call history)

835
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:04,349
(Mr. Dawn)

836
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:09,559
The phone is turned off...

837
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,699
It's really bad here.

838
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:20,600
The plants in the entrance
are all dead.

839
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,069
That's impossible.

840
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:25,369
- Send a photo.
- Get over here.

841
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:26,909
See for yourself.

842
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,380
My gosh. What is he up to?

843
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:34,380
I'll get going now.

844
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,449
Let's go.

845
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:19,229
They look fine.

846
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,970
Hoon lied.

847
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:31,770
Where is he?

848
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:47,789
How pretty.

849
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:52,029
Where's Hoon?

850
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,800
- What is the matter with you?
- Wait.

851
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,970
Sun Ho. Sun Ho, wait.

852
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:00,970
I need your help, Sun Ho.

853
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:02,970
(It wasn't because of the blizzard.)

854
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,000
What?

855
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,369
Kim Ji Su's husband is the reason
why Ha Won's mom died?

856
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,510
My gosh, what a crazy jerk.

857
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,609
I can't believe this.

858
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:14,149
How are we going to catch him?

859
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:15,649
We should find him and ask.

860
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:16,819
I disagree.

861
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,420
Are you kidding me?

862
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,720
You can't do anything with this.
It'll only make Ha Won miserable.

863
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,229
Hoon, let's say Ha Won
found this guy.

864
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:29,060
He'll let go after he finds out
what really happened.

865
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,029
He's Kim Ji Su's husband.
He won't be rude to him.

866
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:33,930
Why not?
He has every right to be angry.

867
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:37,869
Anyway, we need to catch that jerk
and put an end to this.

868
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,640
I'll deal with this.

869
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,680
You should tear that apart.
I trust you.

870
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,779
You tear it apart.

871
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:45,449
It's your letter.

872
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:50,989
I can't believe Kim Ji Su
had to go through all this.

873
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:53,489
My gosh.

874
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:55,560
(From Kim Ji Su, To Moon Jung Sook)

875
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,260
I remember why I sold the bowls.

876
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,060
I remember...

877
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,729
why.

878
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,899
She can't. She can't know.

879
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:09,970
She can't find out
what happened to herself.

880
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,970
The more you say,
the more she learns.

881
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,539
And if she gets the hint,
she'll know everything.

882
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:16,979
In a place that you liked, Ji Su,

883
01:11:16,979 --> 01:11:19,449
in the atmosphere you liked.

884
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:22,119
Ji Su likes seeing the sunset.

885
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,020
So I'll talk to her then.

886
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,220
The pianist is Kang In Wook.

887
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,689
What triggered you, Ji Su?

888
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,239
Ha Won.

889
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,979
Would you like to go to Norway?

890
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,710
All I need is a yes.

891
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,210
Once Ha Won is okay...

892
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:56,579
Ji Su's husband apparently
made a mistake.

893
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:57,850
The reason Ji Su was miserable.

894
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:01,020
Didn't you spend years trying
to not think about her husband?

895
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,920
I never said it was her husband.

896
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,529
I found out
why Ha Won's mother died.

897
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:50,500
(A Piece of Your Mind)

898
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:52,369
Do you know anything about him?

899
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:53,770
I like you a lot.

900
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,579
Kim Ji Su. She's my friend.

901
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,510
Should I just mess it up?

902
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,149
Don't suppress yourself.
Shout from the top of your lungs.

903
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,720
I'll stay by your side.

904
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,819
Would you like to live here?

905
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:08,390
I like how empty this house is.

906
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,319
I guess he can't afford
a frying pan.

907
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,029
I get to fill it up.

908
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:13,859
Why did it have to be him?

909
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:15,630
I'm dying to know.

910
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:19,069
We can't let Ha Won and In Wook
meet each other.
