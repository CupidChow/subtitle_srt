The medicine box...

10
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,630
Where is it?
Seo Woo said it was here.

11
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,769
Here it is.

12
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,640
What's this?

13
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,879
What's this?

14
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,890
I wonder who this is.

15
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,840
The first song he ever wrote.

16
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,310
When she told you thousands of times
that she was suffering,

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,909
you ignored her.

18
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,040
What do you want to hear now?

19
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,349
You don't have the right.

20
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,549
Ji Su...

21
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,450
In Wook...

22
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,530
But no matter
how much I tried to call her...

23
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,560
That's enough.

24
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,099
Do you have any idea what you did?

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,400
What you took from me,

26
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,129
what you crushed,

27
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,439
and what you ruined?

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,539
Do you know
how my days have been...

29
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,180
or how my life has been?

30
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,050
Do you even fully understand
what you did to me?

31
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,889
Don't force Seo Woo
to do any favors for you.

32
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,529
After having gone through
a hard time,

33
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,899
I've finally come to a conclusion.

34
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,680
My husband regrets what he did,
and that hurts me.

35
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,050
His tears give me pain.

36
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,250
I want to tell him that it's okay...

37
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,329
and that he shouldn't
suffer anymore.

38
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,629
(I want to be able to...)

39
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,430
I want to be able to give strength
to my husband.

40
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,699
And now that I've come
to a conclusion,

41
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,480
I'll be able to talk about this
with a smile on my face...

42
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,480
once time passes by.

43
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,680
I'll contact you again
once that day comes.

44
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,250
Consul Moon,
I hope you stay healthy.

45
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,689
From Kim Ji Su.

46
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,180
Ji Su.

47
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,680
Who do you think...

48
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,850
told In Wook how you truly feel?

49
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,490
The person whom
In Wook hurt the most.

50
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,560
It was Ha Won.

51
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Ji Su.

52
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:11,740
I told him how you truly feel.

53
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,110
Now,

54
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:16,980
be in peace.

55
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,170
You weren't hurt. You're okay.

56
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,639
You're normal.

57
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:21,810
I'm...

58
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,279
quite strong-boned. I'm healthy.

59
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,060
Min Jung leaves tomorrow.

60
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,089
I have to go.

61
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,240
Did you cry?

62
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,839
I don't cry.

63
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,250
That's right.

64
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,750
You say you never cry.

65
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,560
It so happened that...

66
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,529
Ha Won...

67
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,100
saved Kang In Wook.

(A Piece of Your Mind)

69
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,939
You're going so far.

70
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,180
There are nursing homes
near Seoul too.

71
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,209
It's close to the sea.

72
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,519
I wanted to live close to the sea.

73
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,620
It's only nice for a while.

74
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,490
My parents said Geojedo Island
was great when...

75
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,960
they first moved, but now
they're not so pleased.

76
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,860
It's fine if it's good
for even a while.

77
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,659
Aren't you afraid of living in
an unfamiliar place?

78
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,269
I am. Why wouldn't I be?

79
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,940
But I must go.

80
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,940
I want to try and fight it out.

81
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,679
I'm not weak.

82
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,080
I want to prove it to myself.

83
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,210
It's all good to be brave.

84
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,850
I don't know.

85
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,750
- Hey.
- What?

86
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,460
Why do you run
a boarding house? You hated it.

87
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,460
I insisted on taking over.

88
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,230
I wanted to work hard
for five years,

89
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,629
save up, then live as I wanted.

90
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,000
Five years have passed.

91
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,700
Yes. That passed long, long ago.

92
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,909
My goal changed.

93
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,509
To Seo Woo.

94
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,279
I'll quit once she moves
above ground level.

95
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,649
Eating well and living well
makes her feel guilty, she said.

96
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,120
She feels more comfortable
down there.

97
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,220
She keeps saying she's fine,

98
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,190
but she's truly fine
when she's above ground.

99
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,970
I'll make sure
she moves to another room.

100
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:56,929
I can't relax otherwise.

101
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,740
I'm home.

102
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,809
- Hey, Jin Su.
- Hi.

103
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,840
Were you drinking
without snacks again?

104
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,379
We have no snacks.

105
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,509
I thought so, so I bought some.

106
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,250
- What did you get?
- Sausages and...

107
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Mom.

108
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,899
Give me a little strength.

109
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,309
Why do I feel so sad?

110
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,179
It's crazy.

111
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,990
You were such a nuisance.

112
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,029
That was our deal.

113
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,159
- You were too much.
- It's not my fault.

114
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,330
- Still.
- What?

115
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,370
Hey.

116
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,139
She doesn't drink.
She shouldn't drink.

117
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,779
Seo Woo, Seo Woo. Seo Woo?

118
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,889
What is wrong with you today?

119
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,519
It's fine. Give it back.

120
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,659
She can drink.

121
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,370
Why do I feel so sad?

122
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,350
Why do tears keep falling?

123
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Stop it.

124
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,529
Min Jung leaves tomorrow
and you're doing this?

125
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,799
I don't know. My heart breaks.

126
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
(Missed call)

127
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,889
(You have 2 missed calls. Mr. Dawn)

128
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,929
Ji... Ji Su?

129
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,529
Ye...Yes, it's me.

130
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,399
What...

131
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,570
How come...

132
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,740
I heard In Wook's music.

133
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,669
Didn't you play it?

134
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,580
That... That was...

135
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,549
Good. I was going to
ask for a favor.

136
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,990
Do you know how In Wook
confessed his love for me?

137
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,149
Suddenly...

138
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,919
I wouldn't know.
Who is Kang In Wook?

139
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,490
He said he watched me
for 10 years.

140
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,269
He liked watching me,
so he didn't leave Oslo.

141
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,840
I can't forget what he said
and the look on his face then.

142
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,799
He was so cute.

143
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,539
He liked you for a long time.

144
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,350
He likes being where you were,

145
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,250
listening to what you listened to,

146
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,389
and he wants to feel what you felt.

147
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,450
I like watching him.

148
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,490
It's unrequited love.

149
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:45,259
Ji Su's trigger point.
Mr. Kang's unrequited love.

150
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,370
I want to hear In Wook's voice.

151
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,070
- Help me out.
- No.

152
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,340
I don't know who he is,

153
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,909
and don't want to know him.

154
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,980
It'll be hard for him,
so just let me listen.

155
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,210
Not a conversation.

156
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,450
He's not suffering at all.

157
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,179
I had a lot to drink last night
and I can't talk right now.

158
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,350
- You can rest now.
- I'm...

159
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm dead, am I not?

160
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,460
I have a practice session today.

161
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,490
Hello.

162
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,259
I'm not in the mood to say hello,
but I did.

163
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm talking to you.

164
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,470
Don't you have
anything to say to me?

165
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,379
Do you think I'm talking to you
because I want to?

166
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,679
I'm sorry.

167
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,690
He talked.

168
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,829
Is everything going well...

169
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,299
with the preparation
for Piano in April?

170
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,269
You get to perform
at an amazing show.

171
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,910
Why... Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

172
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,279
He talked again.

173
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,779
Can you play...

174
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,019
piece number one for me?

175
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,589
I want to hear you play it
right now.

176
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:31,890
Seo Woo.

177
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,619
You can't just ask me to...

178
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,789
Please play the piece.

179
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,509
I want to hear In Wook's voice,
and I want to hear him...

180
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,309
play the piano.

181
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,910
He'll have a hard time talking to me
since I'm dead.

182
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,079
Please do me a favor.

183
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,589
Let me hear him from afar.

184
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,990
Seo... Seo Woo.

185
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,359
Please continue. I'm listening.

186
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,099
The longer you play, the better.

187
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,470
I'll listen to you play
for just five minutes.

188
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,309
I was totally wrong...

189
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,750
about everything.

190
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,119
I was a fool.

191
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,990
So don't be bothered
by what I said to you.

192
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,430
Ha Won and Ji Su...

193
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,720
Please speak as if Ji Su
can listen to you.

194
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,230
I'll explain later.

195
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,059
Just do as I say.

196
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,740
Is it the device?

197
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,789
She knows that she's dead.

198
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,789
She wanted to hear your voice.

199
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,069
Let's give Ji Su what she asked for.

200
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,099
Ji Su asked for...

201
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,819
I made this piece...

202
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,720
as I thought of Ji Su.

203
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,059
And...

204
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,519
I made this for Ji Su as well.

205
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,329
I thought of her...

206
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,900
when she didn't even know
who I was...

207
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,500
and also when I had
one-sided feelings for her.

208
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,710
Then one day...

209
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,250
She looked at me
for the very first time.

210
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,160
Even after we got married,

211
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,220
I always...

212
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,099
thought of Ji Su
as I played the piano.

213
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,430
I love her.

214
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,339
And I miss her.

215
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,109
Wasn't it difficult to talk to me?

216
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,180
It just felt like...

217
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,049
talking to a friend
who lives really far away.

218
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,220
Do you think
you can keep doing that?

219
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,950
Please be honest.

220
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,230
I don't think so.

221
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,529
You're very honest.

222
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,829
Then here's my last request.

223
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,700
Can you...

224
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,500
please get rid of me?

225
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,019
Farewell, my early 20s.

226
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,430
(I'm so excited and happy.
Let's not forget today.)

227
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,730
We'll take you to the bus stop.

228
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,759
Let's just say goodbye outside.

229
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,529
Let us take you there.

230
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,000
I won't come back.

231
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,539
My gosh.

232
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
Why isn't Seo Woo here yet?

233
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,369
Let us take you to the bus stop.

234
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,609
No, it's okay.

235
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,579
Let's just say goodbye
in front of the boarding house.

236
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,950
Just wish me good luck,
and let me leave in peace.

237
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,579
Don't make such a big fuss about it.

238
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,619
Just act like I'm going
to the supermarket or something.

239
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
She seems nervous.

240
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,589
Min Jung.

241
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,359
Let me give you a hug.

242
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,799
No.

243
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:35,809
Okay.

244
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,809
I'll see you.

245
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:49,859
Smile.

246
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,470
You'll visit on your day off, right?

247
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,599
Don't forget to text me in advance.

248
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,000
I'll cook a nice meal
for us to enjoy.

249
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,539
I'll treat you something
even better next time,

250
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,740
so come by when you can!

251
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,079
I'm fine, you know.

252
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,349
Tell Eun Ju that.

253
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,210
Don't be a stranger, okay?

254
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,019
Join us for meals
and stay the night if you want.

255
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,549
Don't cry all the time...

256
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,490
and enjoy your love llife.

257
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,259
Sure.

258
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,900
Don't worry.

259
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,460
Don't you worry!

260
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,000
Be brave.

261
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,240
Be brave!

262
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,210
Have courage!

263
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,250
That's the Eun Ju Boarding House
I remember.

264
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,619
Thanks for injecting me with energy.

265
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,660
Eun Ju,

266
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,789
I now have the strength to go on.

267
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,809
Can you please get rid of me?

268
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,619
I shouldn't exist.

269
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,519
- Please get rid of me.
- How...

270
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,160
can I?

271
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,289
You could ask Ha Won to...

272
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,329
No.

273
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,299
He shouldn't have to say...

274
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,630
goodbye to you again.

275
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,500
Right, I agree.

276
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,970
I'll...

277
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,279
do it.

278
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,410
I'll get rid of
the device so that...

279
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,589
you'll never speak to anyone again.

280
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:00,420
I know it's not an easy request,
but I'm counting on you.

281
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,490
I remember the day we first met.

282
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,359
I was at my lowest, you see.

283
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,099
With a box of bowls in my arms,
I walked up a hill...

284
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,299
only to see you waiting at the top.

285
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,970
That's when I first realized
that people do actually glow.

286
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,180
Ms. Kim Ji Su?

287
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Brightly glowing.

288
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,950
I felt really grateful.

289
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,019
And I was worried
the bowls might shatter.

290
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,049
You were waiting for me
outside your house.

291
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm grateful for everything,
Seo Woo.

292
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,160
You can now get rid of me...

293
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,299
and forget about me.

294
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,099
Bye.

295
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:31,609
I can't do this right now.

296
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,480
Wait, that came out weird.

297
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:35,890
I can't look at you.

298
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,420
- Seo Woo?
- I can't...

299
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,690
look at you right now.

300
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,660
Bye.

301
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,200
(Mr. Dawn)

302
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,299
You're happy to see me, right?

303
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,410
I bet you are.

304
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,880
We parted ways
but was reunited after 35 minutes.

305
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,519
I didn't expect
a goodbye like that earlier.

306
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,869
I hope you're not letting
what Kang In Wook said get to you.

307
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,900
I'm not easily fazed
by other people's words.

308
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,069
I don't care.

309
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,789
Your arm will be too numb
to comfortably sleep.

310
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,859
It's the perfect amount of weight.

311
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,299
I'm already close to falling asleep.

312
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,079
(Voice recording 007)

313
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:00,980
With a smile you said to me

314
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,819
Just like a bird

315
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,630
I wish to fly far away

316
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,539
Seo Woo?

317
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,170
I'm all right.

318
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,079
It's just that...

319
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,579
I'm a little confused right now.

320
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,450
Even I find myself
to be a little weird too.

321
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,920
What brought Mr. Kang
back to his senses...

322
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,690
seemed to have been you,

323
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,630
and that...

324
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,099
makes me feel terrible.

325
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,000
It's awful.

326
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,900
I shouldn't exist.

327
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:54,839
Please get rid of me.

328
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,910
I'll...

329
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,210
do it.

330
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,410
It was the right choice
for everyone...

331
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,920
and not just him.

332
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,690
So there's no reason
for you to be sad.

333
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,519
But it still doesn't
feel right to me.

334
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,329
Mr. Kang.

335
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,130
I understand now...

336
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,440
how it feels to
get between two people.

337
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,210
If I get between Ji Su and Ha Won,

338
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:46,250
they don't crush me
from either side.

339
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,519
It hurts so much...

340
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,719
how they crush me twice as hard.

341
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,489
Slip out of it for a while.

342
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,130
Then you can see...

343
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,670
whether you were stuck in-between...

344
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:11,239
or standing side-by-side.

345
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,369
Will you come back to the studio?

346
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,309
I'm not sure.

347
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,809
Studio Moon cures slumps.

348
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,880
It's true.

349
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,210
You got me out.

350
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:56,420
I spent all my energy on that.

351
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,489
I'm exhausted now.

352
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,030
I want to apologize.

353
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,599
To whom?

354
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,929
You hurt so many.

355
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,139
To you and...

356
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,110
Ha Won.

357
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,739
You can apologize to me right now.

358
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:27,750
I'm sorry and...

359
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:33,159
Thank you for getting me out.

360
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:38,929
To Ha Won...

361
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,869
I'll give him the message.

362
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,869
But if he insists on
speaking to you face-to-face,

363
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,239
I'll tell you so.

364
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,539
Can we do that?

365
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,650
If he says he's fine,

366
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,650
then he really is.

367
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:06,519
While you suspected Ji Su...

368
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,289
and Ha Won for over 10 years,

369
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,099
Ha Won figured out for himself...

370
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:16,630
how to escape
the hardships he faced.

371
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,699
He has his own method.

372
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,710
It's not even all of it.

373
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:28,340
He hangs on to just a piece of
what was precious to him,

374
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,050
and uses that to stay grounded
and achieve his dream.

375
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,949
And protect himself too.

376
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,489
Are you annoyed that
I praised him so much?

377
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,530
No.

378
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,429
You have...

379
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,429
a great uncle.

380
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,550
(Concert Hall)

381
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,409
Come if you're free.

382
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,090
It's...

383
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,360
quite nice here.

384
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,130
See you at the studio.

385
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,500
Studio Moon cures slumps.

386
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,869
You need to escape yours.

387
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,599
I'll come to
Eun Ju Boarding House today.

388
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,269
(Han Seo Woo)

389
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,510
Where are you?

390
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,610
At work.

391
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,750
When do you leave?

392
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,949
In 30 minutes.

393
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,489
I'll get back to you.

394
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm leaving now.

395
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,829
When you leave,
do you walk through the lobby?

396
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:31,869
No.

397
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,039
- Are you here?
- No.

398
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,739
I'm at the shipping address.

399
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,139
You sound like you're here.

400
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,010
How do you get out?
Do you not pass through the lobby?

401
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,409
I have a separate hallway.

402
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,719
Why do you ask?

403
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Just because.

404
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,820
You want to see me?

405
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,989
Yes.

406
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,829
I want to see you from a distance,

407
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,900
but you don't pass through here.

408
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,300
I'm at the studio,
so I can't fly to you.

409
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,880
Seo Woo.

410
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,349
Speak.

411
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,090
Okay.

412
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,760
I'll speak.

413
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:28,889
I must.

414
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,760
I figured out...

415
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,030
why I'm acting so strangely.

416
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,010
There's one thing I can't stand.

417
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,579
Something I can't get over.

418
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,889
I'm scared of being sad.

419
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:02,219
When I'm looking at you...

420
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,630
I feel so...

421
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,260
Why do you feel sad
when you look at me?

422
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,570
That's where my problem starts.

423
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,670
It's not your fault at all.

424
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,170
I'm...

425
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,409
I'm the problem, so...

426
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,139
I can't be without you.

427
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,340
For a short while.

428
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,980
It won't be for long.
For just a short while...

429
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,050
No.

430
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:31,289
Seo Woo. Seo Woo.

431
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,659
Look at me.

432
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,130
No. Pretend I'm there.

433
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,730
Pretend I'm in front of you.

434
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,739
Pretend you're in front of me.

435
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,800
Pretend you're in front of me.

436
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:18,900
For a while, just a short while,

437
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:22,440
let's spend time apart.

438
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,210
- Seo Woo.
- While we're apart,

439
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,880
do something for me.

440
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,610
For me,

441
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,349
do anything that gives you strength.

442
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
Place your hand...

443
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,170
beneath your ear...

444
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:58,639
where you can feel your pulse.

445
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,360
Remember this
every time you feel your pulse.

446
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,559
I love you so much.

447
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,730
And I care about you a lot.

448
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,670
Don't give up because you feel sad.

449
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,510
I'll wait.

450
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,570
So whenever you're ready,

451
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
promise me...

452
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,750
that you'll contact me.

453
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:41,880
I promise.

454
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,090
I'll think of this pulse...

455
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,230
as something that protects me.

456
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,230
I'll remember what you said
every time I feel my heartbeat.

457
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,380
Drink this and sleep well.

458
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,150
(Drink this and sleep well.)

459
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,179
(From Kim Ji Su)

460
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:03,090
("Piano in April",
Kang In Wook's recital)

461
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:05,389
I'll do well,

462
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:08,829
Ji Su.

463
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,610
(Pianist, Kang In Wook)

464
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:03,650
(We look forward
to a fantastic recital.)

465
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,699
That was great, In Wook.

466
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,599
Ji Su.

467
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,199
Here.

468
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,539
- She'll call.
- I never asked.

469
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,380
You're so confident
that I feel sorry for you.

470
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,710
I don't know how to explain this.

471
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,380
But we can't break up.

472
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,480
Do we have our latest test results?

473
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,690
Isn't that Jin Hwan's voice?

474
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,219
We decided not to use mine.

475
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,719
It's that sound engineer's voice,
isn't it?

476
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,239
The temperature is 17.5°C.

477
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,400
- The weather is clear.
- Seo Woo?

478
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,039
But it will be a little dry.

479
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,179
You look more than 30 years old.

480
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,579
Were you here for that long?

481
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:46,949
Let's see.

482
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,650
You sound amazing.

483
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,989
Seo Woo, you should listen to this.

484
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,269
Do you know Seo Woo?

485
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,670
Searching "the sound of reed organs"
on the web.

486
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,170
This isn't Seo Woo.

487
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,210
It's just her voice.

488
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,750
You see, it's not Seo Woo yet.

489
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,219
Just a second.

490
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:24,219
It hasn't been triggered yet.

491
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:28,719
What did she like?

492
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,260
Eun Ju Boarding House.

493
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,230
Searching "Eun Ju Boarding House"
on the web.

494
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:42,769
Your grandmother?

495
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:54,980
Hey, you're here.

496
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,989
Why do you look so startled?

497
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:01,760
You're not allowed to mess around
with the machine like that.

498
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,329
I know how to turn it on and off.

499
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,760
I started studying
sound engineering.

500
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,030
I'll be overseeing
your practice today.

501
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:12,170
You'll be overseeing it?

502
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,170
Yes, I'll just watch.

503
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,539
I noticed that the lineup
for the concert is quite amazing.

504
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,510
- You'll have to practice hard.
- Will you be...

505
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:21,980
coming to the studio again?

506
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,010
When did I ever quit?

507
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:27,119
I should never have
started the business...

508
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,650
if I was going to give up so easily.

509
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:31,889
I'm going to study hard...

510
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:35,090
so that I can help Seo Woo
record your next album.

511
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,730
It takes about two years
to release an album, right?

512
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,760
I don't work with people
who don't know about music.

513
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,969
I guess I should
study music as well.

514
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:45,599
I have a lot to do.

515
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,239
Then how about we make a bet
and see who finishes first?

516
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,570
Your album or my self-teaching.

517
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,880
Let's live diligently.

518
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,789
Hey, I tried doing
what Seo Woo told me to do.

519
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:14,260
- But it won't work.
- Why aren't you coming over?

520
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,260
Are you going to visit
this week or not?

521
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:18,369
You're working really hard again,
aren't you?

522
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,940
Okay, I'll go.

523
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,570
- Can you ask her for me?
- Just a second.

524
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:31,010
Seo Woo, she wants to know
if there's anything different.

525
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:32,849
I don't know.

526
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,280
Seo Woo doesn't know either.

527
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,449
- What could it be?
- What?

528
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,219
What did you say?

529
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,860
"Misiryeong Valley Sunset"?

530
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,699
I'm memorizing it.

531
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,599
Who's that?

532
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,840
Okay, fine.

533
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,039
You there, who's Mr. Dawn?

534
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,940
Searching Mr. Dawn...

535
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,510
Min Jung!

536
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,780
Gosh, I brought her out.

537
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,650
Look here.

538
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,090
I brought her out.

539
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,760
It's Seo Woo.
Would you like to talk to her?

540
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,889
Sure.

541
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:17,960
Mr. Dawn.

542
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:24,300
Mr. Dawn brings out
Han Seo Woo's courage?

543
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,429
Makes sense.

544
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,800
And who's that?

545
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,639
Some guy.

546
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,719
This way.

547
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,750
Stay with me.

548
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:46,389
When Ms. Han was at her lowest...

549
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:49,420
With them,
that memory is always vivid.

550
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,389
Those are the people
I rarely forget about.

551
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,260
The one who helped her
be herself again.

552
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,860
I'm Mr. Dawn.

553
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,199
Mr. Dawn,

554
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,900
good night.

555
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,840
Thank you for everything.

556
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:08,079
What you liked to see...

557
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,179
Are you saying...

558
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:14,280
I miss you. I want to be with you.

559
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,920
And I want to hold hands.

560
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,150
Stay with me.

561
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:21,360
Things will get better.

562
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,260
Things will get better.

563
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,829
I love it the most
when it's 17°C outside.

564
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,199
It's the best temperature
for a walk.

565
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,269
It's the perfect temperature
for one to start healing.

566
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,969
Do you want to live here?

567
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:38,869
Come here after work.

568
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,380
I'll be here when you come,

569
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,849
and when I leave, you can stay.

570
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,949
When Ms. Han was at her lowest,

571
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:54,019
someone injected energy
into her life.

572
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:58,730
That someone you can call "me".

573
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,699
Seriously?

574
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:02,800
Her trigger point seems complicated,

575
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,269
but it's easy to explain.

576
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:05,500
Isn't it fascinating?

577
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,070
Just like a failure
can become a success,

578
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,510
her trigger point
is like a flip of a coin.

579
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,139
I'm intrigued and mesmerized.

580
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:14,139
The lightning.

581
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,980
Have a crack at that one again.

582
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,150
We have lightning.

583
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,349
Ji Su was afraid of it.

584
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:28,519
The piano.

585
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,059
How is it?

586
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,590
How about some pepper?

587
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,199
Sure, sounds good.

588
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,429
Ji Su, you should listen
to yourself while you play.

589
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,400
The lightning.

590
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:46,139
Roaring.

591
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,119
Mom.

592
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:58,190
We have lightning.

593
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:05,789
Your mom plays the piano
whenever there's a thunderstorm...

594
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,530
so that you wouldn't be afraid.

595
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,719
I finally found someone
that is precious to me,

596
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,989
so shouldn't I become
a different person too?

597
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:13,530
If Seo Woo had not been
in my life,

598
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,969
I wouldn't have even
thought about going.

599
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:29,039
- Eun Ju.
- Hey, Su Ji.

600
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,949
Flowers have blossomed everywhere.

601
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,719
It's nice to see it again.

602
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,250
- What about dinner?
- I ate, of course.

603
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,690
Good. Anyway, head inside first.

604
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,789
I'm going to wait out here
for Seo Woo.

605
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,230
She's been in low spirits lately.

606
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,559
Got it.

607
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,710
(Please do not take,
Eun Ju Boarding House)

608
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,780
(Please do not take,
Eun Ju Boarding House)

609
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:12,550
Seo Woo.

610
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,230
Me too.

611
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:31,440
Let's go home.

612
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,250
Seo Woo,

613
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,849
when did you draw the heart?

614
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,420
- A heart?
- Yes.

615
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,789
There's a heart somewhere?

616
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,090
- Wasn't it you?
- What do you mean?

617
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:47,519
It wasn't you?

618
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,289
What's this heart
you're talking about?

619
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,489
This right here.

620
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,860
It wasn't me.

621
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,130
- It wasn't you?
- No.

622
00:59:56,199 --> 00:59:57,300
Then who was it?

623
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:58,769
I think I know.

624
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,000
(Please do not take,
Eun Ju Boarding House)

625
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:03,869
(Please do not take,
Eun Ju Boarding House)

626
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,639
Eun Ju,

627
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,239
do you have a hammer or something?

628
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,250
Why do you ask?

629
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,449
I need to get rid of something...

630
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,650
and a hammer is what came to mind.

631
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,320
- Destroy what?
- What?

632
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:53,789
Well,

633
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:56,159
someone asked me...

634
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:57,929
Who would make
such a brutal request?

635
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,460
Don't do it.

636
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,260
Look at the state you're in.

637
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,300
You can barely say it
without stuttering.

638
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,800
Don't bother with such cruel favors.

639
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:08,440
That's not the case.

640
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,469
Don't.

641
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:13,510
You don't have to, so don't do it.

642
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,079
Have you eaten dinner?

643
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:23,119
I was going to finish this
when I close the boarding house,

644
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,389
but let's have it tonight.

645
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:33,690
I'm done adding meaning
to everything I do,

646
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,730
so let's eat.

647
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,880
If you think you're alone,

648
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,510
you'll end up
being swayed by others.

649
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:52,449
But you're not alone.

650
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,519
Think of the people who loved you,
who loves you now,

651
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,949
and who will love you in the future.

652
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,190
Feels reassuring, right?

653
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,860
That is why you'll never be weak.

654
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,900
You take good care of yourself,

655
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,099
so you have yourself.

656
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:10,630
You're one to do
what's best for yourself,

657
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:11,900
so what's going on?

658
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:14,269
Why are you
hurting yourself like this?

659
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,170
Now, eat this,
get back on your feet,

660
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,510
and tell me who made the request.

661
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,739
Whoever it is will feel my wrath.

662
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,349
Why ask a difficult favor
and bring someone pain?

663
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:27,949
Just don't do it.

664
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,090
I won't.

665
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:39,730
I don't think I have to do it.

666
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,400
I think I was out of my mind.

667
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:47,500
Hey, you can't eat this then.

668
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:50,539
No, these are tears of realization.

669
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:51,909
Tears of joy.

670
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:55,739
Eat.

671
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,880
My dear Seo Woo.

672
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:32,309
I refuse to get rid of you
as you asked.

673
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,780
But I'll keep you
where no one will find you.

674
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,820
I also refuse to forget you
as you asked.

675
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:45,760
I'll remember you.

676
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,110
It's the kind of weather you like.

677
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,050
Spring new shoots and grow well.

678
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,230
Seo Woo, you've been
breaking up with everybody.

679
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,469
I'm sure there's a reason.

680
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,170
Someone special came and went.

681
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,340
That's why Uncle left.

682
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,179
Where to?

683
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,780
He went to that place.

684
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:47,590
He thought of you
and plucked up the courage.

685
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,460
Where's that?

686
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,289
I didn't think he'd go there.

687
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:53,730
He didn't have to, but he went.

688
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,730
I was against it. Why go there?

689
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,960
Where did he go?

690
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,010
The place I couldn't have gone
if it hadn't been...

691
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,409
for Ha Won.

692
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:12,980
I'm back,

693
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,679
Mom, Dad.

694
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,610
I know where he went.

695
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:52,130
I'm back.

696
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:33,439
With a smile you said to me

697
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:41,550
Just like a bird

698
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,550
I wish to fly far away

699
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:03,449
(Han Seo Woo)

700
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:16,130
(Han Seo Woo)

701
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:21,600
Hello?

702
01:13:23,539 --> 01:13:24,609
Hey.

703
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,279
What do you see?

704
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:38,520
The sky.

705
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:45,090
What about you?
What are you looking at?

706
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,760
The night sky.

707
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,760
A garden.

708
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,500
And a clothesline.

709
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:54,539
You're at the shipping address.

710
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,470
You sound better.

711
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:01,880
I felt a bit better once I came
to the shipping address.

712
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,979
And I felt a lot better
as soon as I heard your voice.

713
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,579
I can't even remember
when I was sad.

714
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:13,590
Your voice alone
is already very effective.

715
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,289
It's more than enough.

716
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:18,130
You'll fully recover
once you see me.

717
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,090
A complete recovery.

718
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:24,500
Then I can't wait to see you.

719
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,569
When can we meet?

720
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,270
Tomorrow.

721
01:14:33,909 --> 01:14:34,979
See you tomorrow.

722
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,909
Tomorrow.

723
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,050
Sounds nice.

724
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:22,720
Once I board the plane,
I'll be in Seoul in about 12 hours.

725
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,569
I'll be there in two hours.

726
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,050
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

727
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,319
You're here.

728
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,420
I'm back.

729
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,550
