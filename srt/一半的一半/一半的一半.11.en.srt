came here to look for you.

She'd always run away from home.

the boarding house for your parents.

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,479
That's what I meant.

60
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,849
The little thing
never listened to her parents,

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,550
and always yelled back.

62
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,719
She never even looked
the boarders in the eye.

63
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,889
I only remember
being nice to the boarders.

64

You've been walking past here
for about two months now.

141
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,600

so I thought you weren't Korean.

tell you guys to go home?

I didn't need to say.

151
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,740
So I went back.

152

from the bottom of my lungs.

But no matter
how much I tried to call her...

165
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,179
There were two pairs of rain boots.

166
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,049
They were for both me and Ha Won.

167
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,149
They were for me and Ha Won.

168
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,220

172

because it was very windy and dry.

173
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,460
But that wasn't why.

But I've never done that before,
so I don't know how.

How am I supposed to take revenge?

00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,750
Why is everything...

180
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,789
so complicated and difficult?

Hey.

182
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,460
Don't be sad.

about everything.

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,099
You should be angry and annoyed,
but you're just being sad.

185
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,369
That's not good for you.

186
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,539
You have every right to be angry.

187
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,130
What was that?

188
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:02,670
Thank you for everything.

189
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,980
You should go home.

190
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,869
How is everything?

191
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,470
I suddenly wanted to call you
for some reason.

192
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,940
You must be telepathic then.

193
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,539
Sun Ho called.
She said I should call you.

194
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,250
I hear you're having a hard time.

195
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,180
What's going on?

196
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,119
Tell me about my mom.

197
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,220
You're the one
who forbid me from mentioning her.

198
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,160
I thought you were going to move on.

199
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,329
I still thought
memories of her would be vivid,

200
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,470
but now I'm not sure.

201
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,539
I want to hear about her.

202
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,740
Of course, you do.
She was a beautiful person,

203
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,609
so why would you forget about her?

204
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,339
Ms. Im Su Ock.

205
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,450
Radiant, confident, and stunning,

206
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,190
She was an amazing performer too.

207
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,920
The same can't be said about
the Korean food she made.

208
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,289
Did you know that...

209
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,529
she blamed it on
how you'd enjoy everything?

210
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,960
Gosh.

211
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,569
Need some help?

212
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,170
With what? I'm not doing anything.

213
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:49,339
Please have a seat.

214
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,410
What should I make
for breakfast tomorrow?

215
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,750
How about sandwiches?

216
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,349
If you make a breakfast dish
that you never made before,

217
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:02,119
would Chang Seob
consider it as special...

218
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,619
or think that you're
messing with him?

219
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,630
He'll like that I made
something different.

220
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,730
He's that simple, you know.

221
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,480
I've been going there for years now.

222
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,920
I guess I wanted someone...

223
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,230
to be around
to comfort me like this.

224
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,529
Doesn't it feel like
you're being centered?

225
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,740
Someone's holding you
so that you wouldn't fall.

226
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,940
This is how I'll always be.
I'm never loosening my grip.

227
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,589
You see,

228
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,529
I know what I need to do...

229
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,599
to elevate my mood.

230
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,930
I take good care of myself,
you know.

231
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,500
First, I need to get to work
bright and early.

232
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:03,210
I enter the empty building...

233
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,279
and open the windows
to let the fresh air in.

234
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,250
While brewing some coffee,

235
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,009
I turn on the music
recorded the day before.

236
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,380
Then I take my coffee...

237
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,720
and take a sip by the window.

238
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,190
It makes my day.

239
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,329
What about you?

240
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,799
I'm thinking about it.

241
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,900
You need to dig deep and find...

242
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,640
what makes you happy.

243
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,240
It's not something
you can figure out easily,

244
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,740
so put some thought into it.

245
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,809
Can I hear another one of yours?

246
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,980
I also love it when
I turn around while walking home...

247
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,319
to see a beautiful sunset behind me.

248
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:52,990
I can picture it.

249
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,490
Tell me one more.

250
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,700
Even though
I go to work at the same hour,

251
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:05,269
some mornings are
brighter than others.

252
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:10,069
The world changes its tune
as the seasons alternate.

253
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,809
I love watching the transformation.

254
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,210
A small change occurs every day...

255
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,250
and it's like playing
Red Light, Green Light.

256
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,589
I've just added one on my list.

257
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,289
I love listening to you
speak about what you love.

258
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,099
Is there something you want to say?

259
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,240
There aren't many things
in this world I like.

260
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,250
What else?

261
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,279
Let me see.

262
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,519
The recording studio.

263
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,490
I love being able to listen to
the best musicians perform...

264
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,130
through good-quality
sound equipment.

265
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,029
I just love it.

266
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,369
I'd love to listen to something.

267
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,549
As in what?

268
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,480
The tune lingers in my head,
but I don't the name of the song.

269
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,619
My mom played it often.

270
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,089
Hum it for me.

271
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,130
I only know a few bars.

272
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,930
I can find it for you.

273
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,509
I'll find out what the song is
and play it for you...

274
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,680
on the piano.

275
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,549
You did that for me once too,
remember?

276
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,359
There's something
you want to say to me.

277
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Go ahead.

278
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,569
Kang In Wook
won't get away with this.

279
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,710
Don't bother getting
your hands dirty.

280
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll take care of it.

281
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,480
That's not what you wanted to say.

282
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,950
Ms. Moon is being absurd.

283
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,019
That's Sun Ho I know.

284
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Am I all right?

285
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,670
No.

286
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm not okay.

287
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:54,769
It's true...

288
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,269
that I'm not all right.

289
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,950
Right now,

290
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,380
it's like I'm wrapped within a fog.

291
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,589
Weird, isn't it?

292
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,589
Even I find myself weird.

293
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,210
It'll get better.

294
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
The world changes automatically,
remember?

295
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,150
Let that thought guide you.

296
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,019
"It's 12°C today,"

297
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,720
"but it'll be 17°C tomorrow."

298
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,420
"I'll be able to get better."

299
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,990
"It was cold today,"

300
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,099
"but tomorrow..."

301
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,359
"will be warm."

302
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,069
"I'll be able to get better."

303
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,869
I love it the most
when it's 17°C outside.

304
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,069
It's the best temperature
for a walk.

305
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,710
It's the perfect temperature
for one to start healing.

306
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,859
I need to set up
a clothesline outside...

307
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,230
and even go for a walk.
It'll keep me busy for sure.

308
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:24,890
How nice.

309
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,019
(Eun Ju Boarding House)

310
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,869
Are you leaving your shampoo
by any chance?

311
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,109
No, I'm taking it.

312
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,410
But it's almost empty.

313
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,109
If you want, I can leave it.

314
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,150
Good.

315
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,480
Hey, Jin Su,
aren't you even grateful?

316
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,549
Wait a second!

317
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,119
- Jin Su, here you go.
- Thanks.

318
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:40,470
Perfect. My favorite soup.

319
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,440
This soup has a story?

320
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,039
It's not really a story.

321
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,980
What's the matter?

322
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,250
Min Jung, do you have
another job interview?

323
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,950
Yes. Three today.

324
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,950
There are lots of nice side dishes.

325
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,450
- It's the usual.
- It's the usual.

326
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,359
Is it hard to get back into
the workforce?

327
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,789
That's why you should
thank your parents.

328
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:07,099
Why don't you run
the boarding house?

329
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,230
Great idea. I think
you'd do a great job.

330
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,000
Jin Su, you're the witness.

331
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,099
Deal.

332
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:16,470
I'll eat and sleep in my room,

333
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,069
and keep half the rent.

334
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,109
No thanks.

335
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,940
See? You're not interested.

336
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,579
Come on.

337
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,880
Think a little about
why you're doing this.

338
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,279
If you do,

339
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,750
later on, when you wonder
why you do this,

340
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,519
you can convince yourself.

341
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,089
Chang Seob.

342
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,789
Are you moving back home?

343
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,259
You remembered that.

344
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,470
No one seems to care about me.

345
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,099
No one wished me well.

346
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,140
All I got was a lecture about life.

347
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,440
It's my last day here.

348
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,940
- Keep going.
- It's your last day?

349
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,210
Are you dying tomorrow?

350
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,380
How dare you say
it's your last day?

351
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,509
Are you moving back home?

352
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,380
It takes two hours
just to get to work.

353
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,880
I must take a bus,
the subway, then another bus.

354
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,250
Wake up earlier, then.

355
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,119
You don't know how I feel.

356
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,190
This special side dish?

357
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,190
Thank you.

358
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,269
I gave Chang Seob two pieces of
your mom's pickles.

359
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,009
It's his last breakfast here.

360
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:28,750
Well done, Eun Ju.
Chang Seob likes it.

361
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,109
I'm proud of you.

362
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:53,569
Good for you, Uncle.

363
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,470
You ignore calls when you're angry.

364
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,170
Good for you.
You're doing the right thing.

365
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,650
I knew you'd be like this.

366
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,920
I came here to drag you outdoors.

367
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,190
Let's go. We'll get some sun
and eat something tasty.

368
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,329
What is there nearby?

369
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:21,860
Sun Ho.

370
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,800
Let's stop.

371
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,639
Stop what?

372
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,409
You don't have to do...

373
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,610
I have something to say too.
Let's go.

374
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,650
A lot of people mentioned
your recital on their social media.

375
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,849
It was embarrassing,
but you did well.

376
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,090
Enjoy the afterglow.

377
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,690
You prepared for a long time.

378
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,860
I'll send you the good reviews.

379
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,159
Watch them and cheer up.

380
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,460
Is that all you wanted to say?

381
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,500
Meet my uncle.

382
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,570
See him and get everything
off your chest.

383
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,139
I'll help you.

384
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,869
If I see him...

385
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,539
and apologize, will it be over?

386
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,679
See him and ask him that.

387
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,179
"Will it be over if I apologize?"

388
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,949
Do you know what keeps on filling
my head right now?

389
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,949
Did Ha Won...

390
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,789
and Ji Su meet?

391
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,760
Why would you wonder about that?

392
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't know.

393
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,510
It makes no sense,
but I keep wondering.

394
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,179
Ji Su was at that house
in Okin-dong.

395
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,079
I mean, not in person...

396
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,380
She wasn't there.

397
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,920
She never went there.

398
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,550
Really?

399
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,349
Stop thinking about that...

400
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,719
and focus on what you did yesterday.

401
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,730
One, you successfully
performed at a recital.

402
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,329
Two, my uncle.

403
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,130
If you're in pain,
he should be the reason.

404
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,039
This is me.

405
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,969
This is why Ji Su was distraught.

406
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,550
If anything were to change,
it should've changed already.

407
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,780
It's not worth even answering,

408
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,280
but the two didn't meet.

409
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,190
With all your might and willpower,

410
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,659
stop wondering about that.

411
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,559
I'll try.

412
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,030
I just said, "with all your might".

413
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,260
My uncle...

414
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,599
has nothing and nobody.

415
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,039
He was dumped by Ji Su,

416
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,139
his only family, whom he thought
would be family forever.

417
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,239
He went through
all sorts of despair and struggles,

418
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,909
but he stays on his feet
and protects himself.

419
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,849
He doesn't know how to
give up on himself.

420
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,750
That's the meaning of
"all your might".

421
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,460
I watched him for 10 years.
No, 9 years.

422
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,590
I keep adding an extra year.

423
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,929
That is what...

424
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,570
he went through...

425
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,170
for nine years after...

426
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,510
he was left alone
because of what you said.

427
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,659
(From Kim Ji Su)

428
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,829
(From Kim Ji Su)

429
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:42,260
Grandma. Tell uncle to eat at home.

430
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:45,829
He's having a rough time.
He might die.

431
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,230
You tell him.

432
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,369
You tell him for me.
I can't face him right now.

433
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:52,070
I mean, I won't.

434
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,469
It's a bit awkward.

435
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:56,170
Still, call him.

436
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,789
I arrived a little early.

437
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,260
The engineer's a lady.

438
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,059
Oh. I'm not an engineer.

439
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,289
Is that so?

440
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,260
I'll wait upstairs.

441
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm...

442
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:43,219
(Device: Voice)

443
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,889
"Voice"?

444
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,210
100 testers.

445
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,139
I'm number 100.

446
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,639
I'm the last one.

447
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,579
Right. Tests.

448
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:15,750
The voice...

449
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,750
Yes.

450
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,750
A communicative device with
that person's personality,

451
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,719
emotion, and voice.

452
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,230
The air here is too dry.

453
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,099
Do you have any water?

454
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,570
Yes. Just a moment.

455
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,150
What is broken?

456
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,730
What's that?

457
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,900
My bag toppled over.

458
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:09,869
How does that friend know
the place sounds nice?

459
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,269
Because she's been there.

460
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,909
Oh. To be exact,
she wasn't there.

461
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,679
I must be crazy.
I even hear things now.

462
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,550
We also receive projects
from a large corporation.

463
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,989
They collect people's voices.

464
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,059
A communicative device with
that person's personality,

465
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:27,719
emotion, and voice.

466
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Ji Su.

467
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,469
It was Ji Su's device.

468
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:42,940
Didn't you tell me
that your studio gets requests...

469
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,070
from a large company
to record people's voices?

470
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,210
That's what you said to me
when I told you...

471
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,340
that I heard someone's voice.

472
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,110
You told me you get requests
from a big company.

473
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,820
What's the name of the company?
Why do they do that?

474
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,119
Sun Ho, this is important.

475
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,460
- This is...
- It's not important.

476
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,489
I thought you called
to apologize...

477
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,860
or tell me that you must've been
out of your mind to...

478
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,500
It was the day
I thought I had lost my mind.

479
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,500
- That's when I heard...
- You really are crazy.

480
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,369
Sun Ho.

481
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,469
Can you just tell me
the name of the company?

482
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:31,119
We're all done now.

483
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,030
Thank you.

484
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,769
By the way, your manager
is very unfriendly.

485
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,440
The manager was here?

486
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,210
I got here early,
so I opened the door.

487
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:51,840
Great work.

488
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,690
(Manager Moon Sun Ho)

489
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,800
(Han Seo Woo)

490
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,510
I wish someone would water me...

491
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,780
and help me get some sun.

492
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,090
When did you get a license
to become a caregiver?

493
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,199
I was always busy
preparing for the future.

494
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,429
But I should've spent...

495
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:52,070
more time with my daughter instead.

496
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:54,500
What are you talking about?

497
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,510
She loved seeing you work.

498
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,239
I read her comments.

499
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:01,579
Your daughter really liked
how hardworking you were.

500
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,880
She was really proud
saying you spend your entire day...

501
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,719
working really hard.

502
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:10,889
Every second of the day
was precious to her.

503
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,389
And she liked
that you also thought the same way.

504
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,960
By the way,
I love your daughter's name.

505
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,130
I fought so much with my in-laws
because of her name.

506
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,829
- What?
- They were totally against it.

507
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,269
They told me not to name her that.

508
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,039
They were totally against her name.

509
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,670
What's wrong with Eun Ju?

510
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:31,469
People who are named Eun Ju...

511
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,179
tend to live happy lives.

512
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,809
- You gave her a great name.
- Don't say her name out loud.

513
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:38,309
In the end, you came to Eun Ju's.

514
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:41,949
So live a happy life.

515
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,150
Live twice as happy
for the sake of my daughter.

516
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,119
Don't worry.
I'll be four times as happy.

517
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:47,420
You'd better keep your word.

518
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,690
I'm going to be really kind...

519
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,260
for the following week...

520
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,230
so that you'll never be able
to forget about me.

521
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,900
Everyone forgets so easily.

522
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,070
They all act like this place
is the best only while they're here.

523
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,239
But I won't let you do the same.

524
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,940
Don't try too hard.
I put my past behind me very easily.

525
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,510
That's how I'm barely
able to get by.

526
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,909
I'm going to make sure
I'm very hard to forget.

527
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,650
Shouldn't you be
saying that to Chang Seob?

528
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,690
You just wait and see.

529
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:19,460
You'll never be able to forget me.

530
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,940
It's here?

531
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,940
Let's see.

532
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,110
Where is it?

533
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,010
My goodness, I found it.

534
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
What is it?

535
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,150
I didn't know we had that here.

536
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,250
See? I told you it would be here.

537
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,489
You must want to exercise.

538
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,989
Here.

539
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,159
You should've hit it back.
My goodness.

540
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:01,260
- There.
- My gosh.

541
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,260
There.

542
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,769
You need to move a little.

543
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,840
My gosh.

544
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,070
Get ready. Here we go.

545
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:16,010
- Gosh, this is boring.
- It's boring?

546
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,449
You want to have fun?
Is that what it is?

547
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,750
Fine. I'll make this fun.
I'll give you what you want.

548
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,989
Get ready.

549
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,159
Here we go.

550
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,059
- What are you doing?
- Look. I'm...

551
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,300
Hey, Jin Su. Do you know
how to play badminton?

552
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,329
Of course. I'm really good.

553
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,630
You need to be better than good.
You need to make it fun.

554
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,769
I don't know about fun.
But I'm really good.

555
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:43,170
- Then go ahead.
- Come on.

556
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,650
You think that was funny?

557
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:53,679
Just a second.

558
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,190
Seriously? That was funny?

559
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,820
Let me try one more time.

560
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,360
- Gosh, wait.
- My goodness.

561
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,460
What's wrong with me?

562
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,300
Uncle, Koreans should eat rice.

563
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,110
(From Kim Ji Su, To Consul Moon)

564
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,239
I recently found out
that you have two addresses.

565
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,809
The fact that you haven't been
reading my letters...

566
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,710
must've made me feel relieved
and sad at the same time.

567
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:35,980
So I write you one last letter.

568
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,219
After having gone through
a hard time,

569
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:42,519
I've finally come to a conclusion.

570
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,400
My husband regrets what he did,
and that hurts me.

571
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,469
His tears give me pain.

572
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,099
I want to tell him that it's okay...

573
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:56,769
and that he shouldn't
suffer anymore.

574
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:01,010
I want to be able to give strength
to my husband.

575
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,210
And now that I've come
to a conclusion,

576
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,889
I'll be able to talk about this
with a smile on my face...

577
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,719
once time passes by.

578
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,090
I'll contact you again
once that day comes.

579
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,760
Consul Moon,
I hope you stay healthy.

580
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,159
From Kim Ji Su.

581
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:31,670
If we want
that person's personality,

582
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,840
we need to connect it
with the device.

583
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:39,880
Then we need to create
the right kind of situation.

584
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,579
Each personality reacts
to different situations,

585
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,320
and that's how people will be able
to feel something.

586
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,690
But isn't it
supposed to be an illusion?

587
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:48,920
No.

588
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,530
We need to make them believe
that they're touching something.

589
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,199
We stimulate their nerves...

590
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,860
by triggering different elements.

591
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,170
So they'll be able
to feel something.

592
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:00,099
You seem tired,
so I'll just ask one last question.

593
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:03,269
The device needs to recognize the
situation and do this on its own.

594
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,280
And everyone has different memories
of what it is they want to feel,

595
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,079
- so it's going to be random.
- Jin Hwan.

596
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,480
Let's stop.

597
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,179
Get some rest.

598
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,170
There were two pairs of rain boots.

599
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,570
Mine and Ha Won's.

600
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:54,050
Mom.

601
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,340
Mom...

602
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,420
Mom...

603
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,269
Mom...

604
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,070
Mom...

605
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,920
(Han Seo Woo)

606
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:58,170
I was trying to access my music,
but it's password protected.

607
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:14,360
If this is uncomfortable for you,
I can work alone.

608
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,429
It's my job though.

609
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:18,989
Personal emotions
should be set aside.

610
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:27,940
Ji Su...

611
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,369
When I found out
that you had known her,

612
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:36,510
it terrified me to think
that you could know something.

613
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,719
I made Ji Su's life miserable...

614
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,989
by being in agony
over the little things.

615
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,659
I've done enough damage as is.

616
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,460
Anyway, I'll work alone today.

617
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,429
That would be for the best.

618
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,369
Did Ji Su...

619
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,369
ever come by the recording studio?

620
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,110
Yes.

621
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,349
Why?

622
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,820
To see me.

623
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,090
Just once?

624
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,289
Then did she...

625
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:26,429
I'd rather not talk about her.

626
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,699
It's too painful.

627
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,619
Voice files... Where are they.

628
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,090
Voice files.

629
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:06,170
Mount Baekdusan is worn away

630
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,900
The national anthem, seriously?

631
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,170
It's definitely a melody
from a ballad, right?

632
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,579
I doubt it's one
by Kim Kwang Seok though.

633
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,110
Is that the only artist you know?

634
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,280
Why must we figure out the song?

635
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,880
Because it's all that Ha Won's
been able to think about.

636
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:25,150
I can't get the melody
out of my head now.

637
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,190
With a smile

638
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,130
You said to me

639
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,239
Even the littlest things in life

640
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,639
Bring tears to my eyes

641
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,710
- You're right.
- That's it.

642
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,809
Isn't that the one?

643
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,480
This song...

644
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,480
was actually a favorite
of my patient's.

645
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,150
I didn't know a doctor
could sing this well.

646
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:56,579
I'd love to go to a karaoke bar.

647
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,519
Let's not get carried away, okay?

648
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,469
Just sing the song instead.

649
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,269
Gosh, no.
I can't really carry a tune.

650
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:18,909
Goodness.

651
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,590
I was wondering who it was.

652
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,219
You should head down there.

653
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:35,659
Seo Woo sent me up here to get you.

654
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:30,780
With a smile you said to me

655
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:38,920
Just a like a bird

656
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,820
I wish to fly far away

657
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:11,650
Bravo!

658
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,159
What about the second verse?

659
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,519
Yes, please.

660
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,400
I wanted it to sound good.

661
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,260
I'm sorry for
not recording that properly.

662
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,070
It was a gem.

663
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,269
Seriously?

664
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:28,039
Well,

665
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:30,909
you weren't as good as me,
but still...

666
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,679
Based on the amount of time
I had, I think I'm better.

667
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,079
I can't accept that.

668
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,019
I'll practice hard,
and record it for you.

669
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:45,949
Take it with you to Oslo.

670
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,219
You can come with me.

671
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,199
I want to...

672
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,929
go somewhere
neither of us have been.

673
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,969
Seo Woo.

674
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,179
I love you.

675
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:21,260
Is that such a sad phrase?

676
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,489
No.

677
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,400
My self-esteem bounded back.

678
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,010
Let's go together.

679
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:42,679
We'll go to Oslo,

680
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,079
and my hometown.

681
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:48,119
Let's travel together.

682
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,570
How lovely.

683
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:17,309
I get some sun
and I can water myself.

684
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,280
I must do it.
No one can do it for me.

685
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,840
(Moon Sun Ho)

686
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,739
(You have 3 missed calls.)

687
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,539
(Moon Sun Ho)

688
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,920
Hey, so...

689
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,489
Grandma called, didn't she?

690
01:01:57,849 --> 01:01:59,119
I told her to.

691
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:03,519
It's not like I wasn't
worried about you at all...

692
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:06,190
You startled me.

693
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,900
I thought you wouldn't pick up.

694
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,730
- Should I not?
- No.

695
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:18,039
- Sun Ho.
- Are you all right?

696
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,380
Would I be?

697
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,550
I'm sorry.

698
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,119
I want a detailed list of
what you're sorry for.

699
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,789
Are you teasing me?

700
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:36,260
You need to show true remorse.

701
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:38,789
"I'm sorry for so-and-so reasons."

702
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,360
I'm sorry for everything.

703
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,929
I guess I was crazy.

704
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,900
You finally came around?

705
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:50,300
I lose track of everything else
when I fall for someone.

706
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:53,739
You are being remorseful
right now, aren't you?

707
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:54,780
Yes.

708
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:56,940
I'm the one with the problem.

709
01:02:57,409 --> 01:02:59,309
You mean so much to me.

710
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:02,619
But still,

711
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,690
I love having you around.

712
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:09,360
How could someone like me
have an uncle like you?

713
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:12,090
That's too much remorse.

714
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,760
- Don't die before I do.
- Stop.

715
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,030
You know,

716
01:03:19,699 --> 01:03:22,699
when Grandma told me to
meet the people...

717
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,469
she was sponsoring,

718
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,469
I refused.

719
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,280
They all had terrible histories,

720
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:32,909
but if they were more upright
than me, I thought I'd feel bad.

721
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:38,219
But, for some reason,
I agreed to meet you.

722
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,590
Now that I think about it,

723
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,059
it was the best thing I ever did.

724
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:02,210
- Uncle?
- Sun Ho.

725
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:10,650
Wait.

726
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,519
You got dumped
as soon as you returned?

727
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,789
You met up after years apart...

728
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:17,829
and got ditched?

729
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,500
Gosh, I'm tearing up.

730
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:24,130
What if I hadn't
bought you that gimbap?

731
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,630
Would you be here today?

732
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,340
Not at all.

733
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,599
Then I did...

734
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:34,179
something worthwhile, didn't I?

735
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:36,510
Sun Ho.

736
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:39,809
To me,

737
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:43,750
you are family that can
never be replaced.

738
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,489
You are...

739
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,559
more than just worthwhile.

740
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:07,480
Ji Su.

741
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,690
Were you here all night?

742
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,570
Ji Su's device.

743
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:38,670
Do you have it?

744
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,579
Ji Su brought this plant here.

745
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,110
You recorded her voice.

746
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,150
Her personality...

747
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,320
and emotions were put into a device,

748
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,719
and tested.

749
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,559
That's how she knows
Ha Won's house...

750
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,090
sounds good when
she was never there.

751
01:05:58,429 --> 01:06:00,860
Kim Ji Su was never there in person,

752
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,159
but you heard her opinion.

753
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:05,869
Because you can communicate.

754
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,469
Is that it?

755
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,039
If that is the case,
if you have Ji Su's device...

756
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,110
I don't.

757
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:19,179
How dare you?

758
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,880
- How dare you record her...
- Mr. Kang.

759
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,250
Let me talk to her.

760
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,590
You don't need it
if you're trying to forget her!

761
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,820
I don't have it.

762
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,090
Han Seo Woo!

763
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,369
Just hand it over.

764
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:19,010
I'm the only one who can have
Ji Su's device.

765
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:21,579
- I don't have it.
- You do. Hand it over.

766
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,940
I don't have it. Now get out.

767
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,949
I believe you would understand me.

768
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:30,320
You must because you're
caught between Ha Won and Ji Su.

769
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,190
I don't.

770
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,659
Just once.

771
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,829
For just once,
I want to listen to Ji Su.

772
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,860
If she really...

773
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,869
I want to hear her true thoughts,

774
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:50,599
what she really feels.

775
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:56,480
When she told you thousands of times
that she was suffering,

776
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,909
you ignored her.

777
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,480
What do you want to hear now?

778
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:03,380
You don't have the right.

779
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,050
Here's some advice.

780
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,659
Between Moon Ha Won and Kim Ji Su,

781
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,289
no one can cut in.
Don't think you can.

782
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:11,429
I don't.

783
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,630
I have seen, heard, and believed
too much for that.

784
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,670
I feel exactly what's going on.

785
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,270
I don't distort things like you.

786
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,539
I don't do what you did.

787
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,340
(Moon Sun Ho)

788
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:02,180
(Moon Sun Ho)

789
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:06,710
Where are you?

790
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,479
The recital's over...

791
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,020
and you didn't talk to In Wook?

792
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,619
I told you to do
what you want afterward.

793
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,090
What's going on?

794
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:19,729
He says that no one can get
in-between you and Ji Su.

795
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,100
In front of Seo Woo.

796
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,239
Where is he?

797
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:18,810
(A Piece of Your Mind)

798
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,180
Do you know what you've done?

799
01:11:22,619 --> 01:11:24,079
We can't let her drink.

800
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,590
Give me some strength.

801
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,890
Seo Woo, I love you a lot.
And I care so much about you.

802
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,329
Will you please get rid of me?

803
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,560
Let me leave in peace.

804
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,729
Don't make such a big fuss about it.

805
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:38,529
Don't worry!

806
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:39,800
Be brave!

807
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,939
Let's be apart from each other
for just a little while.

808
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:46,810
I'm back.
