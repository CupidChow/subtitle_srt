1
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:13,912
Seo Woo, come here.

2
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:18,223
Give me your opinion.

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,091
People that my grandmother sponsors...

4
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,662
send letters of appreciation,

5
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,533
so I put them in Uncle's
and my addresses.

6
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:34,472
I never read them, so I didn't know,

7
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:38,273
but Kim Ji Soo had
written to that address.

8
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:45,012
It's okay.

9
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,512
I guess you don't read the letters.

10
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:53,993
If you had, you would've
called right away.

11
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,423
Ms. Moon.

12
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,093
I found out why Won's mom died.

13
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,902
It wasn't the blizzard.

14
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:08,603
My husband was involved.

15
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:12,943
I became miserable,
but I didn't call him.

16
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:15,171
I won't. I will never.

17
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,213
Do you know why? Because...

18
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:19,943
My husband...

19
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:23,213
He made a mistake.

20
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,622
It's too much to bear on my own.

21
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:30,253
I want to tell the world,

22
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,062
but I can't.

23
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:37,163
That's why I'm writing you like this.

24
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:41,932
With the assurance
that it will never be read.

25
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:43,872
What should I do?

26
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:47,272
Does your uncle know about this letter?

27
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,342
No, he doesn't.

28
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:53,382
Only that Ji Soo knows
something about his mom's death.

29
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:56,982
She must have sent a lot of
letters. Seriously, that girl...

30
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,892
One. Catch Ji Soo's
husband and kill him.

31
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:05,223
Two. Two...

32
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,163
He can't find out.

33
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,893
Why do you think that?

34
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,863
Ji Soo didn't tell him,
so he shouldn't find out.

35
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,372
She did tell him.

36
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:17,972
She wrote it.

37
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,323
Ji Soo.

38
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:37,122
You found out but hid it desperately,

39
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:41,333
so I won't try to find out.

40
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,432
What did you find out that
made you so miserable?

41
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:47,502
Tell me...

42
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,803
much later when we meet again.

43
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:54,713
If we can't cry together,

44
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:57,213
let's stay ignorant as you wanted.

45
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,382
I'll do my best not to find out.

46
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,622
(A Piece of Your Mind)

47
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,023
(Episode 10)

48
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:16,662
No. He has to know.

49
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:20,262
I really think Uncle should know.

50
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:21,872
We can't keep quiet about this.

51
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,842
- Seo Woo.
- Your uncle...

52
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,882
can never find out.

53
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,483
I feel sick.

54
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,162
Seo Woo, are you okay?

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,162
When I first saw Ji Soo,

56
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:54,032
she was barely surviving day to day.

57
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:58,173
As though everything would
be fine if she endured it.

58
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,643
She made her decision
and worked hard to stick to it.

59
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,942
We should respect that.

60
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:07,882
Are you saying you'll keep
that secret for her now?

61
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:11,323
Do you like my uncle even
after you got to know Ji Soo?

62
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,952
It's such a small world.

63
00:04:15,953 --> 00:04:17,523
And the studio is even smaller.

64
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:21,133
Still, I'm glad it's you.

65
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:31,172
It's just as I said.

66
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:34,912
Mr. Kang's wife passed away,

67
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,713
and so he blamed himself.

68
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,542
He said she was on a trip and whatnot.

69
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,111
He hid it, was sad and miserable...

70
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,412
all by his lonesome, which
was why he fell into a slump.

71
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,221
He didn't want to believe it,

72
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:47,022
so no wonder he didn't
want to talk about it.

73
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,421
I think I'm the only one he told,

74
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,862
but you need to know.

75
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,862
That way, you can understand him.

76
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,933
I thought I should watch
him pull off everything...

77
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,532
from his music video to his recitals...

78
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:02,732
to eventually returning to
being a classical pianist.

79
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,372
It was quite rewarding...

80
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,102
to help him get over his slump.

81
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,033
It has been a while
since life felt worth living.

82
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,782
By any chance...

83
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:19,852
Do I have feelings for him?

84
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,592
You're in no position
to worry about me.

85
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:25,463
I think I already have
something to worry about.

86
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:27,532
Just find my uncle.

87
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,383
I think Ha Won may come.

88
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,592
I finally get to see you.

89
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:14,123
So you worked at a hotel.

90
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,193
I've never slept at a hotel before.

91
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,503
Don't make me laugh.

92
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,853
You went on a trip to Jeju Island
with your family in middle school.

93
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:24,801
You went around
in the hotel slippers...

94
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,703
and bragged so much about it.

95
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,612
Right, right.

96
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,642
What about Chang Sup?

97
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,251
I don't care how he's doing.

98
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,083
I'm not curious how he's doing.

99
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,252
Is it over?

100
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:45,053
Never mind if you
don't want to tell me.

101
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:50,362
There was a girl whom I
wondered how she could bear living.

102
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,602
But seeing how well she endured,

103
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:55,903
I looked at her every
time life got too hard.

104
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,602
I thought of how brave she was.

105
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:05,381
Compared to her, my
struggles were nothing.

106
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:06,482
Is that girl Han Seo Woo?

107
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:08,913
- No comment.
- Goodness.

108
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:13,823
I felt sad...

109
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:16,793
and wronged.

110
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,022
I felt sad again.

111
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,732
Then I was fine.

112
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,862
I tell myself, "Right, this isn't
a matter of life and death."

113
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:28,703
That's where I am right now.

114
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,512
What was your daughter's name?

115
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,653
Never mind if you don't
want to talk about it.

116
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:47,283
Min Jung.

117
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,063
You went through so much.

118
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:55,033
You did well.

119
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:05,742
From now on,

120
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,272
when things are hard,

121
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:10,742
think of Han Seo Woo...

122
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:14,142
and remind yourself, "Even
Min Jung is hanging on."

123
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:17,512
It will give you energy.

124
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,352
Come on.

125
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,073
I got different kinds of beer.
Will you let me join you?

126
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,402
Alcohol.

127
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:41,443
You're silly.

128
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:43,452
Did you hear what she said?

129
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,512
- Say that again.
- Alcohol!

130
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:50,683
My gosh, it wasn't there
when I went to the store.

131
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,052
- Really?
- This one is good, isn't it?

132
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,751
Hey! Don't drink
without eating anything!

133
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:57,453
This is why you got dumped.

134
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,573
This should be good enough.

135
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:19,512
I'll make sure...

136
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,582
to see you fall asleep before I leave.

137
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,713
Why don't you live here?

138
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:28,222
Come here after work.

139
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,323
I'll be here when you return.

140
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:34,833
When I come, you'll be here.

141
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,153
I don't want you to stay in
that semi-basement room alone.

142
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:41,933
I don't want...

143
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,842
to come here alone, sit anywhere,

144
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,313
and toss and turn all night either.

145
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:51,641
If we keep doing this,

146
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:52,813
you might do something rash.

147
00:11:58,283 --> 00:11:59,653
If you need time,

148
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,022
- from tomorrow on...
- From...

149
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,323
now on.

150
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:23,213
I need to tell Eun Joo in person.

151
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,913
She'll be very hurt if I just text her.

152
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:27,842
I'll let her know first,

153
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,683
and I'll take my spoon,
lounge clothes, and...

154
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,382
What else do I need to bring?

155
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:36,793
- Are you sure you can tell her?
- Of course.

156
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,423
Eun Joo supports this kind of life.

157
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,703
What if you can't come
back within the count of 10?

158
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:47,602
- Then?
- Come tomorrow.

159
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,302
I'll be right back, so count to 10.

160
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,742
Ready. Set.

161
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,142
Go.

162
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,022
You said you couldn't make it.

163
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:11,122
Come join us quickly.

164
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,491
- Hurry.
- Come here.

165
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,922
- Five.
- Hurry up.

166
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:15,032
- Come on.
- Hurry here.

167
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,563
We just started. Actually,
we started a while ago.

168
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:18,833
Hurry up.

169
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,632
Six.

170
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:22,303
Five.

171
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,803
Five.

172
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:29,913
Five.

173
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,722
It's like a party inside.

174
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,663
You can come in.

175
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,362
Come tomorrow.

176
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:21,022
I was going to do
something, but I'm too short.

177
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,663
That broke the mood.

178
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:56,362
What are you doing?

179
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:10,872
Cheers.

180
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,982
- Cheers.
- Welcome.

181
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,481
Eun Joo.

182
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:20,322
You know the frying
pan that you don't use?

183
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:22,092
I put it at his place.

184
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,792
The eggs get stuck easily.

185
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,762
Because it's cast iron.

186
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,862
You have to put some cooking
oil on a cloth and wipe it gently.

187
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,102
I guess you can't afford
to buy a frying pan.

188
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:41,841
I shouldn't have given you
scorched rice that morning.

189
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:43,371
Can I see your hand?

190
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:45,182
Oh, please.

191
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:48,381
She's just on the hunt...

192
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,852
for some special hands. Don't mind her.

193
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,653
Eun Joo.

194
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,362
Well...

195
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,261
I have something to tell you.

196
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,333
Go on.

197
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,132
Seo Woo...

198
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,933
is going to stay at my
place often from now on.

199
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,073
We want to ask if that's okay with you.

200
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,871
Why ask me?

201
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,813
Because this is Seo Woo's home.

202
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,112
Home...

203
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,722
Come on.

204
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,463
Is that it, Seo Woo?

205
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,132
Min Jung...

206
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,672
Did I say something wrong?

207
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,742
No.

208
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,112
Why are you crying?

209
00:16:57,752 --> 00:16:58,881
Let's drink.

210
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:00,882
Cheers. Welcome.

211
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:03,923
Bottoms up.

212
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:09,792
- It's sweet.
- Nice.

213
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,443
You can take your time.

214
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,372
It's dark.

215
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:59,482
Don't. Turn the lights off.

216
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:12,963
Eat properly.

217
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,932
It's none of your business.

218
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,162
I'm trying...

219
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,163
What?

220
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:22,633
You're trying what? Trying to be nice?

221
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,072
If you want to be so nice, move out.

222
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,981
You see, I've thought so hard...

223
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:34,012
about what I want to say to you.

224
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,751
If I should cling to you, beg you,

225
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:39,652
or have a big, messy fight with you.

226
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:40,782
I wondered...

227
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:44,322
what in the world I want to do...

228
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:47,562
for me, not you.

229
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,863
And this is it.

230
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,163
Move out of this house.

231
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,971
Let's call it even with
the month's rent you owe.

232
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,472
It's profitable for you.

233
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,282
I can't move out right away today.

234
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:10,453
Give me two days.

235
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,032
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,883
(Eunjoo Homestay)

237
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:48,222
I packed some pots
and stuff that I don't use.

238
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:50,251
Why did you pack so much?

239
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,022
You'll need all of them.

240
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,423
You...

241
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:58,632
aren't moving in there
completely, are you?

242
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,502
I can't do that. I'll come and go.

243
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,971
We will have an extra room,
so tell him to come live here.

244
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,672
I'll give him a discount on rent.

245
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,203
We don't have vacant rooms.

246
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:09,311
Chang Sup.

247
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,981
He said he'll move out once he's ready.

248
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,282
I told him to move out.

249
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:15,853
Did I do well?

250
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,282
Yes, good job.

251
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,123
- You're doing well too.
- Thanks.

252
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:44,271
The venue isn't that great.

253
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:46,512
It looks half-hearted.

254
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:50,481
When will you change its
title from "Number One"?

255
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,842
No one's going to watch it anyway.

256
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,652
Not many people listened to it anyway.

257
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,722
Did you check the number of streams?

258
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,222
Kang In Wook.

259
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,423
I didn't think you'd do that.

260
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:05,363
Give it some thought. I'm
sure you'll find the right title.

261
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:13,772
Seo Woo.

262
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,042
Yes?

263
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,142
Give it to me. I'll
drive you to the studio.

264
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,511
It's okay. I'm going somewhere else.

265
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,581
I can just take a taxi.

266
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:22,581
- Give it to me.
- Gosh, your hands.

267
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,213
Be careful with your hands.

268
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,492
Well...

269
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:35,292
I'll get off here.

270
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:44,772
- Thank you.
- Bye.

271
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,113
Take care.

272
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,193
(77-41 Wokin 4-Gil)

273
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,572
Let's call it a day. Let's all go home.

274
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:18,742
Okay.

275
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,172
What was that?

276
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,482
He never says hi or bye.

277
00:22:58,272 --> 00:23:00,282
She packed so much.

278
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,722
It's almost like we
were her garbage can.

279
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:18,362
This is vintage.

280
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,532
I like it.

281
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,943
I think Min Jung put that in there.

282
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:33,312
Open it.

283
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:39,222
I got you a floral print.

284
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:42,252
Where's mine?

285
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:44,593
What? I need to buy his too?

286
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:47,992
Buy him one.

287
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,302
It looks good.

288
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,782
I can't stop thinking about you.

289
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,443
Fine.

290
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:17,551
I'll relieve your frustration...

291
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:20,923
and my uncle's unsolved curiosity.

292
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,002
Come to the studio for a minute.

293
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:34,633
It's very important.

294
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:53,883
I'm here.

295
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:56,552
I've been waiting and just stepped out.

296
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:58,522
Wait there.

297
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,423
What were you watching?

298
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:02,633
Mr. Kang's video?

299
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:04,272
I want to use it for publicity.

300
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,032
That was hard to get. Don't touch it.

301
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,782
My wife has never
been to a recital like this.

302
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:05,353
- How's this?
- Good.

303
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:08,423
My uncle must be waiting.

304
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,721
I have to go. I'll call you.

305
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,822
Okay.

306
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,492
(Mr. Kang)

307
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,173
Someone's waiting for me,

308
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:30,843
so I'll stay for five minutes.

309
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,713
- I'll have to eat quickly.
- Eat slowly.

310
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,981
You're having kimchi stew.

311
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,412
You look like you wouldn't eat kimchi.

312
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:39,222
Uncle, wait five minutes.

313
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:41,123
I can't eat without kimchi.

314
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,893
I used to make kimchi in Germany too.

315
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:45,593
You used those hands to make kimchi?

316
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,232
Oh, no. He wants to meet another time.

317
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:54,702
I'll eat with you.

318
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:56,633
Excuse me. One more kimchi stew please.

319
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:10,552
Seo Woo is crazy strong.

320
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:13,052
I drove her home
with all her stuff today.

321
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,393
Seo Woo's home?
Do you mean the homestay?

322
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:17,752
In Wokin-dong.

323
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:20,693
Wokin-dong?

324
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:24,433
It's a sentimental town.

325
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:28,903
It has a sentimental
meaning for my uncle and me.

326
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:30,603
Your uncle?

327
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,103
- Your uncle?
- Are you curious?

328
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:38,812
Well... I think this is the first
you've spoken of your family.

329
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:42,482
My grandmother adopted him.

330
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:45,883
We're about the same
age. He's like my best friend.

331
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:49,022
Maybe it's his house.

332
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,722
Why would Seo Woo
go to your uncle's house?

333
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:53,363
The thing is...

334
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,663
- they're going out.
- I see.

335
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:59,732
I thought she never dated
before. She had me fooled.

336
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,872
I only recently found out myself.

337
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:04,972
I saw Seo Woo every day,

338
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,603
and I was closer to my
uncle than anyone else.

339
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:10,772
But they're what? I was mad at first,

340
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:13,982
but I liked it.

341
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:17,653
It made me happy once I found out.

342
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:19,582
That's what matters.

343
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:23,791
The person you see every day
has a life you are unaware of.

344
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,393
It's totally possible.

345
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,693
I guess my wife could've had one too.

346
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:40,572
Soon Ho.

347
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,343
I have yet to give a
recital that I truly wanted.

348
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:48,713
And I never will.

349
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,653
This upcoming recital...

350
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:56,752
is the most humiliating.

351
00:30:58,353 --> 00:30:59,363
Why?

352
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,532
I'm doing it to thank
you for all your hard work.

353
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:11,703
Once you receive the
applause, the support,

354
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,143
and finish the recital,

355
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:17,812
you'll grow to love the
piece that you wrote,

356
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:19,883
your recital,

357
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,153
the hard times, everything.

358
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:28,383
You can do it.

359
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,332
(From Kim Ji Soo)

360
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:50,012
Ji Soo, I guess it's not time yet.

361
00:31:58,012 --> 00:31:59,123
It crumbled.

362
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:02,383
The promise I wanted to
keep with all my might...

363
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:04,792
crumbled...

364
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:07,163
to pieces.

365
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,062
What will you do?

366
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:15,332
Kang In Wook.

367
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,002
I'll have to ask Kang In Wook...

368
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,683
whether he had something
to do with my mom's death.

369
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,883
Do you think he'll tell you?

370
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:32,953
I'll have to ask even if I
end up wasting my time.

371
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:58,311
(Messages, Before Dawn)

372
00:32:58,312 --> 00:32:59,413
There's no one here.

373
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:17,163
- I'm here.
- Where?

374
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,343
I can't even find my seat in
theaters once the lights are out.

375
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:22,433
You haven't changed.

376
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:24,703
Found you.

377
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,703
I found you.

378
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:31,642
Do you have to go to the studio?

379
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,741
I can't for a few days.

380
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:36,683
A friend asked me to help
out here, so I have to be here.

381
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:38,653
That's a relief.

382
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:40,153
A relief?

383
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:44,822
Did you come here just to ask me that?

384
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:47,693
That's part of the reason.

385
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:51,232
I'm going to be very
busy for a few days.

386
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,403
So much that I can't go to the house.

387
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:55,802
It's unacceptable.

388
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:59,133
I'll go to you whenever I have time.

389
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,673
And...

390
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:06,213
even if you fight with
Soon Ho, don't quit.

391
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:10,613
You got that job with your skill.

392
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:14,082
Don't budge even if she pushes you out.

393
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,053
Why are you saying that?

394
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:19,022
Don't let little things affect you.

395
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:33,142
(Uncle)

396
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:40,081
Sorry about yesterday.
Kang In Wook suddenly came.

397
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:41,443
Did you wait long?

398
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,251
Did you make progress with him?

399
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:46,582
Yes. Why?

400
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,252
Do you know much about him?

401
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:54,392
Do you know Seo Woo?
Is that why you like her?

402
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:57,732
I know enough.

403
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:03,001
I know all of his weaknesses,
flaws, and anxieties.

404
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:04,473
I like him anyway.

405
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,072
What if I'm against it?

406
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,473
If you're against it?

407
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:12,982
Then I wouldn't pursue it. I listen.

408
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,712
So go ahead and oppose.

409
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:18,052
Insist, complain, and
whine. Go ahead and do that.

410
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,622
Like you'd ever.

411
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:25,022
I'd like to meet Kang In Wook. Alone.

412
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,622
That would be too awkward.

413
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:30,292
Isn't he going to the studio today?

414
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,732
He'll probably come tomorrow evening.

415
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:36,633
I'll introduce you formally.
You can't meet at the studio.

416
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:39,371
I'll meet him alone first. We
can all meet again another time.

417
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:42,842
I see. You want to act
like my uncle, is that it?

418
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:44,243
Goodness.

419
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:48,113
Hey. Do you have a house in Wokin-dong?

420
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,113
Yes.

421
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,653
So it was your house.

422
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,092
- Why?
- Nothing.

423
00:35:57,093 --> 00:35:59,723
I may ask for a favour next
time if I need something.

424
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,493
(Mr. Kang)

425
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:07,002
Uncle, I have a call. Bye.

426
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,372
At the studio tomorrow evening.

427
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:19,842
Seo Woo.

428
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:23,351
Mr. Kang says he wants to use
the studio. Do you have time?

429
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:26,351
I have an evening performance,
so I'm free in the afternoon.

430
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,882
I'll go right now.

431
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:29,153
Thanks.

432
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,022
Did you tell him...

433
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:33,622
about the letter?

434
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:37,662
Not yet. But I should
when the timing is right.

435
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:39,232
Don't do it.

436
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,061
I'm sure it'll be hard for
my uncle when he finds out,

437
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,132
but he'll find out what he needs to,

438
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:47,443
destroy Ji Soo's husband,
and move on right away.

439
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,242
He's tougher than you think.

440
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:51,613
Seo Woo. Don't worry.

441
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:03,792
It looks okay.

442
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:09,431
You brought the mattress,
so you can take it with you.

443
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:11,732
There's a fee to throw it away.

444
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,263
And...

445
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:14,732
I'll take it with me.

446
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:19,473
I'll call a moving truck and
two men to come tomorrow.

447
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:22,542
You should go to work.

448
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:34,682
What if I leave and...

449
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,351
- What if...
- I don't want what-ifs.

450
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:40,521
I'm not interested in events
that may or may not occur.

451
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:42,693
I have too much to do right now.

452
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,132
Are you bored?

453
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:46,702
Then you can call the movers yourself.

454
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:49,673
You're so cool about this.
Good for you.

455
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:06,152
What are you looking at?

456
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:09,752
What? Min Jung's posts.

457
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:13,061
They're all pictures
of food. Take a look.

458
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:14,162
What about me?

459
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:17,692
You've been eating
well and living it up.

460
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,463
I'm jealous. Look at this.

461
00:38:22,263 --> 00:38:24,101
They're from places...

462
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,202
that my daughter looked
up and told me to go to.

463
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:32,142
She was always in the hospital,

464
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:35,743
so she loved it when I ate good food.

465
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,783
I'd go and take a picture
of myself enjoying the food,

466
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:41,122
and my daughter would post comments.

467
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,553
She'd like them and...

468
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,162
she'd be happier if
others liked them too.

469
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:52,132
(It looks so good! Eat up
and have a good day at work!)

470
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:57,431
I want to go here too. Take me.

471
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:58,502
So...

472
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:01,502
I want to eat things like this too.

473
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,541
I want to be taken out too.

474
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,473
No. It's expensive.

475
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,013
My treat.

476
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:11,752
I saved last month's allowance.

477
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,553
Change. Let's go.

478
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:30,403
Scones or madeleines
go well with things this tea.

479
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:32,731
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

480
00:39:32,732 --> 00:39:33,802
I like it.

481
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:35,072
Should we take a picture?

482
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,141
No, I don't want to.

483
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:37,372
Come on.

484
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:40,442
Slide over. Let's do it.

485
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,243
Okay.

486
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:44,013
Here we go.

487
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,723
1, 2, 3.

488
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,153
One more.

489
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:50,722
- Again.
- Okay.

490
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:53,763
Make a cute face. 1, 2, 3.

491
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:55,962
Thanks, Jin Soo.

492
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:57,033
My pleasure.

493
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,101
People with inner rage issues...

494
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:05,502
scream if you press there
lightly with just a finger.

495
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,173
Don't hold it in. Just scream.

496
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,442
Don't mind others.

497
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,082
I can handle this much.

498
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:21,423
That felt good.

499
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:27,463
That's probably about Chang Sup, right?

500
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,363
Seriously...

501
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:45,112
Did you finally think of a title?

502
00:40:45,113 --> 00:40:47,142
It's a title that my wife liked.

503
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:48,443
It fits.

504
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,352
Is that house with good acoustics
the house in Wokin-dong?

505
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,723
Yes.

506
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:56,451
It was my friend who
said it had good acoustics.

507
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:58,553
- But yes, that's the house.
- Your friend.

508
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:01,892
Was that friend...

509
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,662
the one who gave you that plant?

510
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,633
Yes. You remembered.

511
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:16,811
How does she know the
house has good acoustics?

512
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:18,243
She has been there.

513
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:23,082
Well. To be exact,
she wasn't there herself.

514
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:25,752
She didn't go, but...

515
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:28,451
She has been there,
but she wasn't there?

516
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,951
No, she hasn't been there.
That's right.

517
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:32,752
How is that possible?

518
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:34,892
It's possible with us.

519
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:37,232
I'd like to go there.

520
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,533
May I go to the house
that your friend said...

521
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,803
had good acoustics?

522
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:49,002
That will be hard.

523
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:54,482
Mr. Kang, I'm downstairs.

524
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,882
Hey, Soon Ho.

525
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:58,952
About your uncle's house in Wokin-dong.

526
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,152
I hear it has amazing acoustics.

527
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:03,223
Do you think I can see it?

528
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,562
I thought I'll check it
out and meet your uncle.

529
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:13,202
If it has good acoustics and
looks nice, we can film there.

530
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:17,202
Give me a minute. I'll
take care of it right away.

531
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,743
Uncle, can we go to the
house in Wokin-dong?

532
00:42:23,912 --> 00:42:26,943
Mr. Kang and I'll just see
if it's a good spot to film.

533
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:36,152
Come now. I'll text you the address.

534
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,252
Yes.

535
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:55,541
My uncle said yes.

536
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,013
We can go today.

537
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,743
The house that Ji Soo
said had good acoustics.

538
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:02,383
- Seo Woo.
- Yes?

539
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:04,181
Sorry, but something urgent came up.

540
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,653
But...

541
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:21,032
- Hello?
- Seo Woo.

542
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,731
I left my score.
Can you see if it's there?

543
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:25,202
Yes, it is.

544
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:28,602
Okay, as long as it's there.
Just leave it. Don't touch it.

545
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:31,173
Okay.

546
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,383
I haven't been to Wokin-dong in ages.

547
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,443
- Mr. Kang.
- I'll call you later.

548
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:38,952
- Who was that?
- Seo Woo.

549
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:40,723
Let's go.

550
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:47,092
(Sunset)

551
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:48,963
Is the title "Sunset"?

552
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:22,122
To the right.

553
00:44:23,392 --> 00:44:24,392
Hold on.

554
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:27,162
Is that it?

555
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:44,581
(Sunset in Misiryeong)

556
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:45,682
Misiryeong.

557
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:50,952
It's a title that my wife liked.

558
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:55,493
It's a picture I took
in 2012 in Misiryeong.

559
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:57,662
Please cherish it.

560
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:08,403
It can't be.

561
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,272
I heard you got this plant as a gift.

562
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:14,283
Who gave it to you?

563
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:18,113
Are you alone?

564
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:21,053
Someone was here.

565
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:24,292
Was that friend the one
who gave you that plant?

566
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:26,593
May I go to the house
that your friend said...

567
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:28,863
had good acoustics?

568
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,133
The house.

569
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:36,463
(Before Dawn)

570
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,272
(Han Seo Woo)

571
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:53,622
The person you have reached...

572
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,763
Awesome. This is it. It is.

573
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:01,403
It's a historical place.

574
00:46:01,932 --> 00:46:05,173
I first met my uncle nine
years ago in front of this house.

575
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:08,093
You met your uncle for
the first time nine years ago?

576
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:10,743
- What's his name?
- Moon...

577
00:46:11,113 --> 00:46:12,272
That must be him.

578
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:15,712
Excuse me.

579
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,182
You can't go there.

580
00:46:21,852 --> 00:46:24,593
You can't go into that house.

581
00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:27,193
It's Kang In Wook.

582
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:28,863
Stop overreacting, Seo Woo.

583
00:46:29,062 --> 00:46:31,262
I'm going to drop in
and take some pictures...

584
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:32,863
- and check out...
- Kang In Wook...

585
00:46:33,903 --> 00:46:35,662
is Kim Ji Soo's husband.

586
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:48,911
Ha Won and Kang In Wook can never meet!

587
00:46:48,912 --> 00:46:50,912
What proof do you have
to say such a ridiculous...

588
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:53,383
Don't you get it? He can't go there!

589
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:56,283
That can't be.

590
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:05,363
(Han Seo Woo)

591
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:20,142
The person you have reached...

592
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:27,723
Don't go in.

593
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:32,953
Soon Ho.

594
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:37,033
Soon Ho.

595
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:41,533
What's wrong?

596
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:45,573
He said not today.

597
00:47:47,403 --> 00:47:50,042
He said definitely not. Not today.

598
00:47:50,613 --> 00:47:51,812
What a punk.

599
00:47:52,743 --> 00:47:54,142
We're here already.

600
00:47:57,682 --> 00:47:59,982
- We're here already!
- This isn't it.

601
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:02,153
I had the wrong address.

602
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:04,223
That's not it.

603
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:16,732
As long as no one died.

604
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:18,372
What if someone did die?

605
00:48:34,323 --> 00:48:35,782
(Ms. Moon)

606
00:48:35,783 --> 00:48:37,323
Send me proof within 30 minutes.

607
00:49:08,122 --> 00:49:09,153
Ji Soo.

608
00:49:45,122 --> 00:49:47,823
What was your wife's name?

609
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:52,763
I'm curious.

610
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:55,662
It's none of your business.

611
00:49:57,903 --> 00:49:59,533
Just tell me her name.

612
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,343
Just her name.

613
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,523
Why did your uncle
say we can't go today?

614
00:50:26,903 --> 00:50:31,533
(Han Seo Woo)

615
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:04,732
- Is your uncle's name...
- I like you a lot.

616
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,343
I like you...

617
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:10,673
very much.

618
00:51:16,013 --> 00:51:17,783
Why would you like someone like me?

619
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:21,852
Because it's me.

620
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,302
If Ji Soo didn't tell him,

621
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:37,732
he shouldn't know.

622
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,002
But Ji Soo,

623
00:51:42,073 --> 00:51:44,943
is there something you
want to tell Ha Won?

624
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,743
The letters. The pictures.

625
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,613
Why...

626
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:53,412
Why...

627
00:52:04,263 --> 00:52:05,962
Here. Eat this.

628
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:08,552
You know my mom sends it
every year around this time.

629
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:10,732
I didn't tell her I was moving out.

630
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,772
It's heavy. It must be meat.

631
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:20,642
You know my mom...

632
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:24,082
Radishes?

633
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:26,553
What's wrong with my mom?

634
00:52:30,993 --> 00:52:34,662
It's sweet. Radishes aren't
usually sweet in the spring.

635
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,593
It's delicious.

636
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:39,962
What?

637
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:42,062
Okay.

638
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,513
What? Do you regret it?

639
00:52:54,013 --> 00:52:57,653
I feel like I messed up. Should I beg?

640
00:52:58,283 --> 00:53:01,982
Eun Joo is a great girl. Why did I...

641
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,622
She's so nice.

642
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,192
Should I get on my knees?

643
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:09,863
Chang Sup. Heed my words.

644
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:12,662
It's too late.

645
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:25,613
Get to work.

646
00:53:26,772 --> 00:53:28,081
What will you do?

647
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:31,053
What else? I'll have to
prepare what I have been.

648
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:35,081
Ji Soo didn't tell him,
so he shouldn't know.

649
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:36,082
Those were your words.

650
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,953
We shouldn't waste the
effort Ji Soo put into it.

651
00:53:39,122 --> 00:53:41,922
That was when we didn't
know who Kang In Wook was.

652
00:53:41,923 --> 00:53:43,932
More the reason since we do know.

653
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:46,961
You want to keep up the charade?

654
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:48,932
Regardless of who Kang In Wook is?

655
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:51,371
Exactly.

656
00:53:51,372 --> 00:53:53,232
Why did you come here?

657
00:53:55,973 --> 00:53:57,613
Keep your personal
life out of your work.

658
00:53:58,473 --> 00:54:00,112
Keep preparing what
you've been working on.

659
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:02,212
Don't let these little
things distract you.

660
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:04,682
Then...

661
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:08,282
tell your uncle everything you know.

662
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:11,993
And let your uncle take
care of everything. And...

663
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:14,962
if you still want to do
what we've been preparing,

664
00:54:15,392 --> 00:54:16,462
go ahead.

665
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:18,133
You two can do it.

666
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:20,462
You stay out of it.

667
00:54:20,863 --> 00:54:22,703
I'll keep doing what I have been.

668
00:54:26,403 --> 00:54:28,002
I know better than you do...

669
00:54:28,303 --> 00:54:31,573
just how sickening this situation is.

670
00:54:31,843 --> 00:54:34,283
Please. For the next few days,

671
00:54:34,582 --> 00:54:36,181
just do what I tell you.

672
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:38,513
I'll tell him everything
once this recital is over,

673
00:54:39,182 --> 00:54:40,482
so please.

674
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:43,153
Let's not tell my uncle for a few days.

675
00:54:45,093 --> 00:54:46,352
Please do that for me.

676
00:54:51,493 --> 00:54:53,732
I do have the time, but...

677
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:57,572
Ms. Moon put in an enormous
amount of work, so please.

678
00:54:57,573 --> 00:55:00,743
It would be good for you
to do the recital by yourself.

679
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:02,372
I know.

680
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:04,912
Why don't you want to do it?

681
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,982
Because Mr. Kang is despicable.

682
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:11,953
He's despicable. I'm
furious. I'm going crazy.

683
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:14,383
I'm losing my mind and am
dumbfounded. That's why.

684
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:19,121
How could you call me despicable
to my face? What else was there?

685
00:55:19,122 --> 00:55:21,062
You're going crazy.

686
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:45,652
He's back to playing classical music.

687
00:55:45,653 --> 00:55:48,022
He's back to his old self.

688
00:55:50,283 --> 00:55:51,693
Back to his old self.

689
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,522
You can do the recital, right?

690
00:55:54,763 --> 00:55:57,662
I think it's only right that you do it.

691
00:55:57,993 --> 00:56:01,203
You understand Mr. Kang as he is now.

692
00:56:02,602 --> 00:56:04,432
I may ruin it.

693
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:07,343
No.

694
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:10,002
Should I ruin it?

695
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:12,073
I'll do it.

696
00:56:14,013 --> 00:56:15,843
Why did your friend go to that house?

697
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:20,352
That house with good acoustics.

698
00:56:21,223 --> 00:56:23,022
I almost went,

699
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:24,792
but couldn't.

700
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:29,121
Okay. I see.

701
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:32,232
You said your friend went inside.

702
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:34,102
I corrected my statement...

703
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:37,533
and said my friend never
went into that house.

704
00:56:38,832 --> 00:56:40,703
You clearly said she had been there.

705
00:56:44,013 --> 00:56:46,712
How can she check the
sound without going inside?

706
00:56:48,812 --> 00:56:52,482
Ji Soo never went into that house.

707
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:03,474
Ji Soo never went into that house.

708
00:57:09,043 --> 00:57:11,883
That's my friend's name. Kim Ji Soo.

709
00:57:12,483 --> 00:57:14,054
She's older than I am.

710
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:28,143
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

711
00:58:34,204 --> 00:58:36,204
Let's not tell my uncle for a few days.

712
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:38,133
Well...

713
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:42,074
It's really nice out.

714
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:45,273
Did you know? You really need to know.

715
00:58:56,483 --> 00:58:58,293
It really is nice.

716
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:01,193
I almost missed it.

717
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:04,333
You actually played along.

718
00:59:04,594 --> 00:59:05,693
How nice.

719
00:59:10,563 --> 00:59:13,173
I need some powerful healing.

720
00:59:13,603 --> 00:59:16,003
Can we do a half-look?

721
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:19,173
Where are you?

722
00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:46,874
Briefly and affectionately.

723
00:59:55,114 --> 00:59:56,713
I guess this is why.

724
00:59:57,383 --> 01:00:02,284
I feel like I am very strong lately.

725
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:06,894
It must be because
someone is staying with me...

726
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:09,223
and I feel safe.

727
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:10,463
I'm glad.

728
01:00:12,094 --> 01:00:13,793
See you tomorrow night.

729
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:16,534
I'll be done by then.

730
01:00:17,503 --> 01:00:20,704
I'll stay with you non-stop
starting tomorrow night.

731
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,914
I'm charged 70 percent.

732
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:34,583
85 percent.

733
01:00:37,523 --> 01:00:38,994
100 percent.

734
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:49,403
There will be two recitals.
At 4pm and 7pm.

735
01:00:50,103 --> 01:00:53,304
Ticket sales for 4pm
recitals are usually very low.

736
01:00:53,374 --> 01:00:57,003
The 7pm recital is the real one.
The 4pm one is more like a warm-up.

737
01:00:57,914 --> 01:01:00,113
Okay. Where's the
video for the preview?

738
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,283
I didn't get it yet.

739
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:02,812
I sent it.

740
01:01:02,813 --> 01:01:06,053
We can use the old one.
That looks nice.

741
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:07,284
What was that?

742
01:01:10,423 --> 01:01:11,724
Is this it?

743
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:14,724
Yes, that's it.

744
01:01:26,304 --> 01:01:28,803
My wife has never
been to a recital like this.

745
01:01:28,804 --> 01:01:30,704
The page-turner must be his wife.

746
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:33,574
Do you want me to upload this too?

747
01:01:33,874 --> 01:01:35,614
No, just the front part.

748
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:37,483
The part where Ji Soo can't be seen.

749
01:01:37,554 --> 01:01:38,883
Who's Ji Soo?

750
01:01:39,483 --> 01:01:41,153
The woman next to him.

751
01:01:45,153 --> 01:01:46,423
Did Uncle...

752
01:01:47,423 --> 01:01:48,563
see this?

753
01:01:52,963 --> 01:01:54,403
Did you meet Kang In Wook?

754
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:59,003
Soon Ho...

755
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,074
didn't tell you there was another
letter from Ji Soo, did she?

756
01:02:04,344 --> 01:02:07,113
I read it and gave it to her.

757
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:10,543
She seemed to struggle about
whether or not to show it to you.

758
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,713
There was a connection...

759
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:16,824
between Ji Soo's husband and your mom.

760
01:02:21,224 --> 01:02:22,764
Go to Kang In Wook.

761
01:02:24,733 --> 01:02:25,894
Go and ask him.

762
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:45,883
Rehearse in Mr. Choi's
studio today instead of ours.

763
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:48,023
Something came up.

764
01:02:48,483 --> 01:02:50,223
Do not come to the studio.

765
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,653
(Do not come to the studio.)

766
01:02:59,764 --> 01:03:00,793
Hey.

767
01:03:03,764 --> 01:03:05,924
I guess Kang In Wook will
be here to rehearse tonight.

768
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:08,344
He cancelled.

769
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,583
Why didn't you come to the house?

770
01:03:20,014 --> 01:03:21,454
Something came up while I was going.

771
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:28,764
You did it on purpose.

772
01:03:29,523 --> 01:03:30,923
Did you tell me to come on purpose?

773
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:33,633
Because of Kang In Wook?

774
01:03:35,063 --> 01:03:37,434
- Why?
- He's Ji Soo's husband.

775
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:43,542
You weren't interested
at all in her husband.

776
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:44,713
I only need a minute.

777
01:03:45,744 --> 01:03:47,144
Tell me when he's coming here.

778
01:03:47,543 --> 01:03:49,014
I can explain.

779
01:03:49,684 --> 01:03:51,090
I don't want to hear anything from you.

780
01:03:51,114 --> 01:03:52,752
I don't know what you found out,

781
01:03:52,753 --> 01:03:54,233
- but that's not all of it.
- Enough.

782
01:03:56,483 --> 01:03:57,954
Call me when he comes here.

783
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:01,463
He won't come.

784
01:04:16,204 --> 01:04:17,344
Ji Soo's letter.

785
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:20,414
I don't have it. I ripped it up.

786
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:24,713
- Soon Ho.
- What?

787
01:04:25,313 --> 01:04:26,554
Do you want an apology?

788
01:04:26,684 --> 01:04:28,253
I don't want a stupid apology.

789
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:31,124
Do you...

790
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:34,893
- not know why I'm being like this?
- I do. I do, but...

791
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:35,994
I need...

792
01:04:37,324 --> 01:04:38,664
Soon Ho, I need...

793
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,704
to know exactly what happened that day.

794
01:04:44,773 --> 01:04:48,144
Whether I lost everything simply and
nonsensically because of a blizzard.

795
01:04:50,874 --> 01:04:52,673
It's driving me crazy.

796
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,284
Did something happen?

797
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:57,883
Once I find out the truth,

798
01:04:59,414 --> 01:05:01,224
I'll never see that jerk again.

799
01:05:02,684 --> 01:05:05,923
Apologies? Resentment?
All of that is meaningless.

800
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:11,994
He won't come today.

801
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:15,633
He won't come tomorrow.

802
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:19,503
He won't come here.

803
01:05:54,403 --> 01:05:55,443
What's that?

804
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:58,313
Was Mr. Kang here?

805
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,243
(Moon Soon Ho)

806
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:02,014
Do not come to the studio.

807
01:06:14,994 --> 01:06:16,022
Uncle!

808
01:06:16,023 --> 01:06:17,223
(I'm already here)

809
01:07:16,483 --> 01:07:17,523
Move.

810
01:07:21,693 --> 01:07:25,433
Seriously. I'm sick and tired of love,

811
01:07:26,063 --> 01:07:29,063
and the morons who live and
die because of it are pathetic.

812
01:07:31,534 --> 01:07:34,074
I locked myself in
the farm for nine years.

813
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:37,043
I was holed up there...

814
01:07:37,044 --> 01:07:38,414
to avoid seeing a jerk.

815
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,544
But...

816
01:07:42,284 --> 01:07:44,244
even if I roam around near him,

817
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,134
I won't run into that jerk
that I avoided for nine years.

818
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:48,754
So why...

819
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,193
Why is everything getting so tangled?

820
01:07:52,994 --> 01:07:54,353
I'm going crazy too.

821
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:55,864
Only he knows...

822
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,824
the answer to the question
I've asked all my life.

823
01:08:01,093 --> 01:08:02,334
Only he knows.

824
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:06,834
It may be nothing to him.

825
01:08:08,044 --> 01:08:10,473
That's not true. He...

826
01:08:10,773 --> 01:08:12,114
I'll be done in five minutes.

827
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:18,784
He...

828
01:08:19,853 --> 01:08:24,223
overcame it and can
finally perform again.

829
01:08:28,124 --> 01:08:29,193
He overcame it?

830
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:33,933
He overcame it?

831
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,034
- Soon Ho.
- I know.

832
01:08:38,704 --> 01:08:40,334
I know how you feel, but...

833
01:08:42,143 --> 01:08:43,303
Just one day tomorrow.

834
01:08:45,843 --> 01:08:47,574
Leave him alone for
just one day tomorrow.

835
01:08:48,084 --> 01:08:49,114
Soon Ho.

836
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:52,454
How could you...

837
01:08:55,023 --> 01:08:56,124
How...

838
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:58,523
could you...

839
01:09:00,454 --> 01:09:01,563
How is this...

840
01:09:03,763 --> 01:09:05,063
How is this happening?

841
01:09:07,494 --> 01:09:08,563
Please.

842
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,103
No.

843
01:11:01,784 --> 01:11:02,813
Ha Won.

844
01:11:23,834 --> 01:11:25,834
Seo Woo. Are you okay?

845
01:11:26,803 --> 01:11:28,544
Have you seen Ha Won?

846
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,143
No, I haven't.

847
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:42,874
(A Piece of Your Mind)

848
01:13:43,273 --> 01:13:45,013
The first recital sold out.

849
01:13:45,374 --> 01:13:46,614
Uncle?

850
01:13:47,544 --> 01:13:48,883
Tell me about my mom.

851
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:49,982
Were you crying?

852
01:13:49,983 --> 01:13:52,453
His niece is causing him grief.

853
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:55,783
I used to feel at peace
after looking up like this.

854
01:13:55,784 --> 01:13:57,652
Your daughter has an awesome name.

855
01:13:57,653 --> 01:13:58,794
Don't say it.

856
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,493
I want to hear it.

857
01:14:00,494 --> 01:14:01,722
Mom.

858
01:14:01,723 --> 01:14:02,963
Aren't you afraid?

859
01:14:02,964 --> 01:14:04,692
I thought I'd forget.

860
01:14:04,693 --> 01:14:06,133
He wants to ask just one question.

861
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:07,994
- Please leave him alone.
- Get out of my way.

862
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:09,364
Stop it!

863
01:14:09,365 --> 01:14:10,433
Kang In Wook.
