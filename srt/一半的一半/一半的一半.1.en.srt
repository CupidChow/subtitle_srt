Do you remember this song?

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
"Je Te Veux" by Erik Satie.

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,730
Written in 1891...

12
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,730
Enough.

13
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,939
Stop playing music.

(Ha Won)

15
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,480
Who are you?

16
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,049
I'm Hawon.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,420
No, that's not it.

18
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,219
What would the real Ha Won say...

19
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,890
if I asked him who he was?

20
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,689
"Is there something
wrong with your head?"

21
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,459
That's what he'd say.

22
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,500
But all you say is "I'm Hawon"?
Seriously?

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,469
You listen to me.

24
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,669
You're a chatting device...

25
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,639
modeled off of Ha Won's
personality and empathy.

26
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,509
That means you should
be more like him in a way.

27
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,080
Right now, you're worse than Siri.

28
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,810
Did I hurt your pride?

29
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,979
Well, mine is hurt just as much.

30
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,849
We've been like this for days now.

31
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,189
Please ask only
one question at a time.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,990
I've had enough.

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,330
My gosh. What is it?

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,389
Wasn't that the boss's voice?

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,759
Well, he's over there.

36
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,099
That device seems new.

37
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,669
Are you two working on
a secret project again?

38
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,270
When will you share it with us?

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,569
It's still pretty crappy,
so not any time soon.

40
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,710
Now, get to the meeting.

41
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,840
Big data.

42
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,009
By connecting
the field of DNA and medicine,

43
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:54,650
we launched a new field
known as network medicine.

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,110
- Here you go.
- AH...

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,819
- is a leader in establishing...
- Good job.

46
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,750
an advanced
medical research platform...

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,719
that utilizes
artificial intelligence.

48
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,889
Pause right there.

49
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,020
Omit my photo.

50
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,629
But the hospital requested it.

51
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:08,860
I want it gone.

52
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,199
Then I'll change it
to Mr. Kim instead.

53
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,169
An advanced
medical research platform...

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,039
It looked better with his photo.

55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,069
A sense of trust
still comes through though.

56
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,080
What's the accuracy
of our psychology consultation tool?

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,710
It's 93 percent.

58
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,620
An AI medical consultation with
an accuracy rate of 93 percent...

59
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,379
equals to the best in the world.

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,289
What? Your personality and empathy?

61
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,289
Unbelievable. Not even close.

62
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,300
Hear me out.

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,099
Up until now,

64
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,300
computers collected data about
emotions of the majority of people,

65
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,199
turned them into patterns,
and applied them to individuals.

66
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,509
Meanwhile, you put a pattern
of an individual's emotions in here.

67
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,310
What you achieved
is quite remarkable,

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,180
but I can't get through to it.

69
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,479
Talking to it will get us there...

70
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,650
which is why I turned to you
since I can't solve it.

71
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,189
It doesn't work for me either.
For four straight days,

72
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,289
I've been talking to it nonstop.

73
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,889
What we're missing
is the trigger point.

74
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,560
Then what on earth
is its so-called trigger point?

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,800
When, how, and at what moment
will it finally talk like you?

76
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,329
What will make this device
the same as you?

77
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,370
The device will figure that out.

78
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,040
If you can't find
its trigger point, then...

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,540
it's a failure.

80
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,779
Good luck to you.

What do you want?

84
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,110
I was drawn by the music.

85
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,750
The landlord wants
to make more money...

86
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,589
and will get rid of the studio.

87
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,529
Let's try again from here.

88
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,879
Goodbye.

89
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,110
Leave it open so that at least
one more person can hear it.

90
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,779
It's the last piece recorded here.

91
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,420
Goodbye.

92
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,470
It's raining.

93
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,279
I'll stay for a little longer.

The forest on the way home.

101
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,559
A dark afternoon.

102
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,529
Do you remember?

103
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,039
Ji Su got scared.

104
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,419
By the time we reached the woods
on the way home from school,

105
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,460
it would be 3:20pm.

106
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,500
It got dark in no time.

107
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,460
What did Ji Su name it?

108
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,970
- A night-like afternoon.
- "A night-like afternoon."

What's the trigger point?

111
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,220
- Lightning.
- Light...

112
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,789
What trigger point is that?

113
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,690
Here you go.

114
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,389
You see...

115
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,500
- You see, Ha Won...
- Hoon.

116
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,600
What do you want to say?

117
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,879
Since you reached that level,
I'll ask what I'm dying to know.

118
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,350
Do you still miss Ji Su?

119
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,259
AH fuses math, medicine,
science, and literature...

120

123

I'm still yearning for her,
but in a different way...

124
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,669
and feeling empty inside.

125
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,769
Other than that,
nothing else has changed.

126
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,730
Mr. Park.

127
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,259
- The trees are in great condition.
- I know, right?

128
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,129
The trees are
getting better every day.

129
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,070
Oh, gosh. My goodness.

130
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,070
Are you okay?

131
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,539
Yes, I'm okay.

132
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:56,139
My gosh, you guys.
You guys aren't okay, are you?

133
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,480
My goodness gracious.
I must be crazy.

134
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,309
Why did I fall?

135
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,820
You guys. My gosh. Get up.

136
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,519
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

137
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,450
I'm so exhausted.

138
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,919
Hey, Uncle.

139
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:41,620
What?

140
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,690
When did you come?

141
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,169
Until when did Grandma live in Oslo?

142
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,370
From 1997 to 2005.

143
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,210
My gosh.

144
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,110
Oh, gosh.

145
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,179
Grandma's still in Africa.

146
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,620
And there's always
so much work to do.

147
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,620
The UV radiation here is really bad.
Do you know that?

148
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,389
It penetrates everything.
Melanin is completely useless.

149
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,889
My gosh, the reason I look pretty
is because I have good skin.

150
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,460
Don't sit on the threshold.

151
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,330
I'm completely out of luck anyway.

152
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
How many years has Sun Ho
been working at the farm?

153
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,009
- 8 years.
- 9 years.

154
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,610
How could you reduce it by a year?
I've been here for nine years.

155
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,490
Uncle, do you need me
for anything in Seoul?

156
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,649
I want to leave this place.

157
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,190
I thought this was the only place
you ever wanted to be.

158
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,759
That was all in the past.

159
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,799
I think I have a job for you.

160
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,129
What? Where?

161
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,169
Why did you buy a recording studio?

162
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,639
It's the best place
to collect voices.

163
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,509
I want to test
another person's voice there.

164
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,610
Yes, you should keep yours a secret.
I guess that's kind of obvious.

165
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,950
This one needs to be
kept confidential as well.

166
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,179
Who is it?

167
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,799
You want me to meet Kim Ji Su?

168
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,140
Okay.

169
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,240
I'll slap her as soon as I meet her
and ask her this.

170
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,809
"How does it feel to miss your shot
with the Mark Zuckerberg of Korea?"

171
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,980
I'll say that and make sure to take
a photo of the look on her face.

172
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,180
Sun Ho, that is a horrible metaphor.

173
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,750
And I'm worried
you might really slap her.

174
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,190
I'm the perfect person
for this job.

175
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,390
What will I get in return?

176
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,160
There's someone I think that will
get along well with Ji Su.

177

(For sale and rent)

178
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,250
Excuse me.

179
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,890
- Here.
- No, it's okay.

180
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,829
Who are you here to visit?

181
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,299
I'm here to drop by
the second floor.

182
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,700
I left the cactus
that always used to be there.

183
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
But I figured it'd get thrown away
as they get rid of the studio.

184
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,069
So I came to take it with me.

185
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,039
Oh, you used to work
at the recording studio?

186
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,210
Where should I put this?

187
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,579
Oh, over there.

188
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,910
What did you do at the studio?

189
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,950
I was an audio engineer.

190
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,690
There's someone I think that will
get along well with Ji Su.

191
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,630
I love how an empty space smells.

192
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,730
It's rare to find a recording studio
for classical music.

193
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,630
So I don't get
why it's shutting down.

194
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,400
It only recorded classical music?
I wonder why.

195
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,869
But who says it's shutting down?

196
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,269
No way...

197
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,009
It's not going anywhere.

198
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,809
I'm the new manager.

199
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,450
I can't believe this.

200
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,579
You can't believe what?

201
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,380
I thought it was the end,
but you're telling me it's not.

202
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,319
That's what this means, right?
I can keep working here, right?

203
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,619
What did you major in?

204
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,920
- Data processing.
- My gosh.

205
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,529
How do know classical music?

206
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,730
I studied music on my own,
and an audio engineer needs to...

207
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,960
How old are you?

208
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,329
29 years old.

209
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,799
That's a problem.
29 year-olds are the worst.

210
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,539
They're always so worried.

211
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,279
They think they have it worse
than 39 or 49-year-olds.

212
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,240
They think they're the only ones
who are aging.

213
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,450
They think turning 30
is the same as turning 60.

214
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,519
Can I continue to work
at the recording studio?

215
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,819
Let's talk about that later.

216
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,119
Gosh, my back hurts.

217
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,890
Can you buy me some bowls?

218
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,130
(Eun Ju Boarding House)

219
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,730
Why does she want you to buy bowls?

220
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,799
Why can't she buy them herself?

221
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,069
It's so weird.

222
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,470
- Thank you.
- Sure.

223
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,910
It's not a big deal.

224
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,940
What about your job?

225
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,140
Can you keep working there?

226
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,980
Thank you for the meal.

227
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,180
She never asked me to quit.

228
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,019
- Thank you.
- No problem.

229
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
Hello?

230
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,630
Yes.

231
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,430
What?

232
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,630
I'll be right there.

233
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,900
Hey, just a second.

234
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Why?

235
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,640
How strange. The person who sells
the bowls came here herself.

236
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,309
- Who's that?
- Kim Ji Su.

237
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:38,740
- Do you know who it is?
- Of course not.

238
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,990
What's today's soup?

239
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,519
Bean sprouts soup.

240
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,420
Did you add tofu or not?

241
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,960
I don't know.

242
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,160
- What?
- Gosh, get out of the way.

243
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
It was nothing.

244
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,390
It was just a stranger
walking up the hill.

245
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,720
But for some strange reason,

246
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,599
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

247
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,220
Ms. Kim Ji Su?

248
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,950
I felt really grateful.

249
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,059
And I was worried
the bowls might shatter.

250
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,819
Here are the bowls.

251
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,059
Great.

252
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,569
You can keep them.

253
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,339
- Why?
- Sometimes,

254
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:49,240
life surprises you
with unexpected events.

255
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,339
But I guess she really exists.

256
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,109
Kim Ji Su really exists.

257
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,509
Do you know her?

258
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,619
She's just someone
from my imagination.

259
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:04,390
I've been imagining her
for the past nine years.

260
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,619
Why?

261
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,130
Because I've heard about her
for nine years.

262
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,130
And?

263
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,259
That's it.

264
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,230
Anyway, I'm not interested
in those bowls.

265
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:20,700
You treat them like they're nothing,
but she packed them with care,

266
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,710
carried them on the bus, and brought
them all the way up to my place.

267
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,079
Then she sincerely thanked me
at least a hundred times.

268
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,880
Don't treat those bowls
like they don't mean anything.

269
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:30,849
Here.

270
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,980
What's this?

271
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,690
Apparently, you'd know. It's
the booking calendar for the studio.

272
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,359
I don't recognize any of the names.

273
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,619
Must you know the musicians
to let them record?

274
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,359
- No.
- So you'll be busy.

275
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,359
That's right.

276
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,759
I'll do my best.

277
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,680
Hi, guys!

278
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,329
Hello to you two as well.

279
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Hi.

280
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,170
- You're here.
- I can't believe it.

281
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,569
I thought the studio
would close forever.

282
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,710
Me too.

283
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,460
- Lower the cello's mike.
- Sure.

284
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,769
Hold on.

285
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,170
What happened?

286
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,509
What is all this?

287
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Again?

288
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Again?

289
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Not again.

290
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:23,390
To Mr. Dawn.

291
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,390
Please clean up
before you head home.

292
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,660
(To Mr. Dawn. Please clean up
before you head home.)

293
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:33,400
(To Mr. Dawn. Please clean up
before you head home.)

294
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,089
A night-like afternoon.

295
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:00,660
(A night-like afternoon)

296
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,029
Fine, I'll do it.

297
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,339
I'll clean up.

298
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:31,420
I'm sorry, but who are you
and why are you in there?

299
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,390
Is it morning?

300
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,839
Are you kidding me?

301
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,509
The spacing...

302
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,950
He's Mr. Dawn.

303
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:11,130
- What on earth is this?
- Is there...

304
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,529
Gosh.

305
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,329
I meant to clean up, but I forgot.

306
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,940
Let me clean up.

307
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,670
Didn't you rent this place
during the night?

308
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,769
Yes, until 4am.

309
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,480
Look at the time now.

310
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,250
I'm busy as it is.

311
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,319
I get to work at 8:30,

312
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,920
so please clean up before then.
Got it?

313
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,089
8:30am.

314
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,440
Leave it open so that at least
one more person can hear it.

315
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,240
Seo Woo!

316
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,809
I see you didn't get lost.

317
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,410
We have a recital today.

318
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,549
- Let me help.
- It's fine.

319
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,950
My grandmother cared
for these trees for 30 years.

320
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,660
All by herself? That's incredible.

321
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,660
She devotes her time and love
to every living being.

322
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,200
How many will be here today?

323
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,829
The floor will be filled...

324
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,470
and the yard can
accommodate more people.

325
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,339
I didn't expect this to be
such a grand event.

326
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,809
Consider it as a family event.

327
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,480
During her days as a diplomat,

328
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,710
Grandmother sponsored children
who were gifted in music...

329
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,349
and held a recital for them.
She must have liked doing it.

330
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,390
She did something remarkable then.

331
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,150
Tell me about it.

332
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,819
The money she contributed
could've bought me a building.

333
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,099
Grandma insists
we're one big family,

334
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,569
but how can I accept that?

335
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,529
Only my uncle is family to me...

336
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,500
and the others are mere strangers.

337
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,809
Why is your uncle your only family?

338
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,740
Because he's handsome and competent.

339
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,450
Don't tell me you believed that.
I was only joking.

340
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,980
My uncle and I
share an emotional story.

341
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,160
I've never met anyone
who sponsors others before.

342
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,960
Your grandmother is an inspiration.

343
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,559
So how about it?
Do I seem more trustworthy now?

344
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,529
That being said...

345
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,240
Can you record
some of Kim Ji Su's words?

346
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,369
- But why?
- How should I know?

347
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,680
I don't even know
what this device is for either.

348
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,480
With this,

349
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,619
the voice will sound like
it's coming from right next to you.

350
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,690
Yes, he must want
a vivid recording of her voice.

351
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,549
I will only do this
after you tell me...

352
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,220
what it's for and who asked of this.

353
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,559
Well, this someone...

354
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,660
- yearns for her.
- Who does?

355
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,900
That's all you need to know.

356
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:38,529
How can I record her voice
when we're not even friends?

357
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,940
Who says you have to
be her friend to do that?

358
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:43,470
Buy more bowls from her
and meet her in the process.

359
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,839
Chat about meaningless things
for a while,

360
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,180
tell her she has a nice voice,
and get her to record something.

361
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,950
Who records someone's voice
because they like the tone of it?

362
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,519
This isn't like getting
someone's number.

363
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,220
"I think you have a beautiful voice.
Could I please record it?"

364
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,259
Just do what I ask.

365
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,220
A record player?

366
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,150
That looks really old.

367
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,859
Does it work?

368
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,819
What does he have with Kim Ji Su?

369
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,619
Children like islands.

370
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,090
Who?

371
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,719
You asked about me and Kim Ji Su.

372
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,860
How long have you known each other?

373
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,130
The only two Korean kids
in Norway...

374
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,429
met when they were young.

375
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,429
They went to middle school,

376
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,739
and then high school.

377
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,769
They met as soon as the sun rose,

378
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,599
and parted when the sun set.

379
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,309
During the white night,
they were together for 24 hours.

380
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,550
They thought it a pity
when the sun set.

381
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,849
- Ga.
- Gya.

382
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,519
- Geo.
- Gyeo.

383
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,789
- Go.
- Gyo.

384
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:28,820
- Gu.
- Gyu.

385
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,800
"A single leaf,"

386
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,329
"without a sound,"

387
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,699
"landed softly on my shoulder."

388
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:42,539
"The universe
put a hand on my body."

389
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,869
- "It's so light."
- "It's so light."

390
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,650
Their own language became a secret
and brought them close.

391
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,079
They like islands.

392
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,219
Who are you?

393
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,989
Introduce yourself first.

394
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,000
Then I'll explain our relationship.

395
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,699
Why are you hiding?

396
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,570
Why do you need
a recording of her voice?

397
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,380
Are you not going to meet Kim Ji Su?

398
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,320
What about what I asked?

399
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,619
I don't know.

400
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,449
She might do it,
but then she might not.

401
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:33,360
Why did you ask me
to do such a thing?

402
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Why do you even want a recording?

403
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,360
A recording is enough.

404
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,530
I just need...

405
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,000
I just need...

406
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,030
a piece of Ji Su.

407
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,840
Where are you right now?

408
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:53,940
Find me.

409
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,159
I just need a piece of Ji Su.

410
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,409
Hello.

411
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,039
Hi.

412
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,710
Are you done?

413
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,480
No, my eyes are tired.
The light's not working.

414
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,090
It just takes a few slaps.

415
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,400
I'll tell the manager later on.

416
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,010
Oh, dear.

417
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:48,989
Gosh.

418
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,960
I can't see in the dark.

419
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,199
I can't find my way even in cinemas.

420
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
- Can you see?
- Yes.

421
00:39:57,969 --> 00:39:59,369
I'm used to the dark.

422
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,409
- Come this way.
- I see that much.

423
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,280
Find me.

424
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,050
Excuse me.

425
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,860
From what time
did you rent the studio?

426
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,789
I heard it was empty,
so I came early.

427
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,389
At about 7pm?

428
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,530
You were here all evening, then?

429
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,929
Yes.

430
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,599
I thought I heard a similar voice.

431
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,210
He was hiding,
so I didn't see his face.

432
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:41,409
- Hiding?
- Yes.

433
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,309
The manager's farm.

434
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,349
I was there because
she asked me to record something.

435
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,250
It was a room
with an old record player.

436
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,789
There was no room to hide,
but he hid when he talked to me.

437
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:54,019
Until when did Grandma live in Oslo?

438
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,690
From 1997 to 2005.

439
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,230
What did he say?

440
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,260
He told me to find him.

441
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:05,099
What did you say
that made him say that?

442
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,500
I asked where he was
and he told me to find him.

443
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,969
Why did you ask where he was?

444
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,869
Because he was talking to me
from a hiding place.

445
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
How strange.

446
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,349
It was very strange.

447
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,980
So many strange things
happen these days.

448
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,519
People I don't know
make way into my life,

449
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,389
and ask for strange favors.

450
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,730
You have to work.

451
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,260
Time is money here.

452
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,699
Goodbye.

453
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,010
Do you understand...

454
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,139
someone who wants a voice recording
because he misses someone?

455
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,980
It's not common,

456
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,019
but I kind of understand.

457
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,389
Keeping a photo
and keeping a recording.

458
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:02,119
I don't see the difference.

459
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,329
Goodbye.

460
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,110
- I could do it.
- Don't do it.

461
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,519
The woman's weird.

462
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,190
Why would a woman sell bowls?

463
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,389
- Get her recording.
- Don't.

464
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:33,960
It's all a con.

465
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,130
Seo Woo's the idiot
for getting involved.

466
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,730
Give her your name.

467
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,699
Who's the guy? One of
my classmates who married...

468
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:42,769
Darn you.

469
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,329
Put your dirty bowls in the sink.

470
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:47,269
I finished doing the bowls.
My gosh.

471
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,710
Should I record her voice or not?

472
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,380
A piece of a piece
of a piece of a piece

473
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,449
A piece of a piece

474
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:13,530
You should open the windows
once in a while when the sun is out.

475
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,900
Don't keep the curtains closed.

476
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,199
Did it also rain all day there?

477
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,739
The nearby mill
got flooded with water.

478
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:23,769
And the same happened
with the boiler room and farm.

479
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,610
We're the only ones who are okay
because we're located up the hill.

480
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:32,179
Seo Woo,
I saw a lot of young people...

481
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:36,090
taking photos and enjoying
their trip today. They looked happy.

482
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,650
You should also date someone.

483
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,719
You should date while you're young.

484
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,559
Okay.

485
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:53,969
You should open the windows
once in a while when the sun is out.

486
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,340
Don't keep the curtains closed.

487
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,639
Did it also rain all day there?

488
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,309
The nearby mill
got flooded with water.

489
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,349
And the same happened
with the boiler room and farm.

490
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,420
We're the only ones who are okay
because we're located up the hill.

491
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:12,219
Seo Woo,
I saw a lot of young people...

492
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:16,090
taking photos and enjoying
their trip today. They looked happy.

493
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,860
You and I are supposed to be
the only ones...

494
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,429
who can have
a conversation with this.

495
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:25,500
Either there was an error,
or it got hacked.

496
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,199
What is the matter with you?
Why can't you keep it to yourself?

497
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,369
Are you serious?

498
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,840
I told you it can't be used
four counseling...

499
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,480
if you can't block others
from accessing the machine.

500
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,150
I changed the settings.
It won't get hacked.

501
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,090
Try using it
and see if you can hack it.

502
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,590
Does that mean it's hackable or not?

503
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,429
Whatever.

504
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:18,949
- My gosh.
- Send me an address in Seoul...

505
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,090
where I can receive the parcel.

506
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,789
- I'll do what you asked.
- Gosh, that's so complicated.

507
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,659
Why can't she just use the address
she used last time?

508
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,309
Hey, send me an address in Seoul.

509
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,340
Then Seo Woo will do the mission.

510
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,760
What are you staring at?

511
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,889
The green leaves over there.

512
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:02,130
I feel comfortable
whenever I look at anything green.

513
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,900
You won't be able to see it
if I sit here.

514
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,139
- Should I sit here instead?
- No, it's okay.

515
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,909
Do you work nearby?

516
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:14,840
Yes, it's only a few bus stops away.

517
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,949
I called to make
an additional order.

518
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,250
Do you like the bowls?

519
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,820
The bowls go well with Korean food.

520
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,789
Should I send them
to the same address?

521
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:29,630
No, it's not there.

522
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,659
Don't bring them yourself this time.
They're heavy.

523
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,329
Let me check the address.

524
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,199
What was the address again?
I'm getting them for a friend.

525
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,329
I'll write down the address.

526
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,070
(Prescription)

527
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,789
(Prescription)

528
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,559
It's a prescription.

529
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,860
Yes, I know
what kind of medicine that is.

530
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,599
I also visited a psychiatrist once.

531
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:11,400
These days, it's very common
to see a psychiatrist.

532
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:18,610
Where should I write it down?

533
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,380
I'll send it to you via text.

534
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,719
Oh, right.
Why didn't I think of that?

535
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,119
Every time I feel frustrated,

536
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,159
I go to the highest place
in the neighborhood.

537
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,659
It feels better
when you look down at the view.

538
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:41,760
They say astronauts come back with
a different view of the world...

539
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,530
once they return from outer space.

540
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,099
I heard their worries
becomes so minuscule.

541
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,610
That's why I sell bowls.

542
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,880
After I saw a psychiatrist,

543
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,110
I felt like I should do something.

544
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,619
So I uploaded
a few of my best bowls.

545
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,420
And when I delivered
those bowls to you,

546
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,420
it was my first time coming out
in three months.

547
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Just a second.

548
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,230
What?

549
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,039
You need the alphabet.

550
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,539
Consonants, vowels, and sentences.

551
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:27,179
What kind of sentences?
You need to be more clear.

552
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,610
I'll send you an email.

553
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,550
I probably won't get it.

554
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,719
Hey, just check your email.
Then you'll get what I mean.

555
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,590
Refer to the email
before you record her voice.

556
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,659
What was that?

557
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:14,380
Let's go outside.

558
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,889
Ha Won, look at the ceiling.

559
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:32,460
It'll make you feel at ease.

560
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,369
Come in.

561
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,840
Stand in front of the microphone.

562
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,980
Me?

563
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,619
Say whatever you want.

564
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,820
- And then what?
- I'll record it...

565
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,059
and sell it at an expensive price
to whomever that misses you.

566
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,989
No one misses me.

567
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:10,630
I'm sure there's always at least
one person who misses us.

568
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,610
- I'm not sure.
- Just think of it comfortably.

569
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,110
You don't need to do it
if you don't want to.

570
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:25,550
Will you show me how to do it?

571
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,420
First, you can begin
with the alphabet.

572
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,989
You can start
once I give you the signal.

573
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,929
Ga.

574
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,070
Gya.

575
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:49,739
Geo.

576
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:51,570
- Gyeo.
- Gyeo.

577
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:53,840
- Go.
- Go.

578
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,780
- Gyo.
- Gyo.

579
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,150
- Gu.
- Gu.

580
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,550
- Gyu.
- Gyu.

581
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,050
I told her to start
with the alphabet.

582
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,690
Let's try saying
a longer sentence this time.

583
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:11,929
Let me tell you what to say.

584
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,460
A single...

585
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,530
leaf,

586
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,769
without a sound,

587
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:26,039
landed softly...

588
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:28,909
(A single leaf, without a sound,
landed softly on my shoulder.)

589
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,309
landed softly on my shoulder.

590
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,179
The universe...

591
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,750
put a hand on my body.

592
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:42,820
It's...

593
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,030
so light.

594
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,730
It's...

595
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,800
so light.

596
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:07,420
It seems as though
you had those phrases memorized.

597
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:10,050
While living in Norway,
I studied Korean...

598
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,090
by reading Korean poems and novels.

599
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,690
I'll send you the bowls
once I get home.

600
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,530
Right, the address.

601
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,400
Wait, this is near the cafe.

602
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,369
I haven't been to
my friend's house before, you see.

603
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,079
(Select recipient)

604
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:36,980
I just sent it.

605
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:42,480
I'll get going then.

606
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,460
(From Han Seo Woo,
47-341, Okin-dong, Jongno-gu)

607
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,389
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

608
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:23,630
Is he the one who orchestrated
this whole deal?

609
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,860
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

610
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,170
Is he the one who orchestrated
this whole deal?

611
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,869
I don't know who that is.

612
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:38,340
The address you just sent me.

613
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,880
Only Ha Won and I know it.

614
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:55,820
I don't know who that is.

615
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,630
What about this address?

616
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,130
Who lives here?

617
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,829
My manager.

618
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,199
What's this manager's name?

619
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,929
Moon Sun Ho.

620
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,099
I guess I was wrong.

621
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,469
Well, even I find it absurd too.

622
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,510
My mind just
jumped to a conclusion...

623
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,579
when it doesn't make sense.

624
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:19,250
Are you all right?

625
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,719
Good luck then.

626
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:49,710
Seo Woo.

627
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,909
Who was that?

628
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,650
My heart halted just now.

629
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,980
This is terrible.

630
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,250
The number of lies I told today...

631
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,519
would equal to the number
I'd say in a lifetime.

632
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,420
Who was that woman?

633
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,119
Kim Ji Su.

634
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,800
What? Are you insane?

635
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,300
Why did you bring her here?

636
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,300
The answer is Ha Won.

637
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,110
He just told her who he was.

638
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,809
After seeing the address, she
asked if he had put me up to this.

639
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,980
Apparently, only the two of them
know about that address.

640
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,110
Oh, dear.

641
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,280
The phrases Kim Ji Su
fully memorizes...

642
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,179
and the address
she clearly remembers.

643
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:31,590
It's as if he's begging her
to figure out who he is.

644
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:36,119
Anyway, it's about time
that guy showed up.

645
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,559
Where is he?

646
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,599
Why would you bring her here though?

647
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,570
Who on earth is Ha Won?

648
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:45,599
Why do you ask?

649
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,000
He wants me to find him.

650
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,269
Ha Won said that to you?

651
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,769
I can't believe this.

652
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,480
No wonder you brought her here.

653
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,480
Gosh, unbelievable!

654
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,349
What an idiot.

655
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,789
That's it. I'm done.

656
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:05,989
I'm done doing
any more of your favors.

657
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,460
A single leaf,

658
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,059
without a sound,

659
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,300
landed...

660
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,570
I'll be done
right after I send this.

661
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,139
softly on my shoulder.

662
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,809
The universe...

663
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:25,969
Her tone has dropped slightly.

664
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,679
- put a hand on my body.
- Sorry?

665
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:29,909
It's at about 195Hz...

666
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:32,309
and 55dB.

667
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,750
It's...

668
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,119
so light.

669
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,550
A depressed tone.

670
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,820
That's right.

671
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:46,559
Just give me a logical answer.

672
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,929
This recording studio
is connected to a man named Ha Won.

673
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,570
From everything
including the recording sessions,

674
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,869
he had it all planned out
for some time now,

675
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,610
but he keeps himself in the shadows.

676
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:02,610
I'd call him meticulous.

677
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,179
Everything about him
points to a woman named Kim Ji Su.

678
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:07,750
He misses her a lot.

679
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,750
However, she's suffering
from depression.

680
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,050
That being said,

681
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,590
what if...

682
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,630
I let those two meet?

683
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,599
No, I'm just sticking my head into
where it doesn't belong,

684
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:26,670
right?

685
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:29,369
I rarely get involved
in others' business like this.

686
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,869
Why do you wish
to bring them together?

687
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:37,449
I bet you don't remember...

688
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,880
the first impression
you had of everyone.

689
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,349
Probably not.

690
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,150
Same here. I don't either.

691
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,059
But with some people,
even though it was only in passing,

692
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:51,059
you remember
how they opened the door,

693
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:54,500
if they were seated or standing,

694
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,070
and how you first
began your conversation.

695
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:01,099
With them,
that memory is always vivid.

696
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:06,510
Like how she walked up the hill...

697
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:12,579
Those are the people
I rarely forget about.

698
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:15,750
That's how I felt about Ji Su
which is why I want to help her.

699
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:30,300
Do you always stare
at people like that?

700
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,030
Was I staring?

701
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,139
I found your reason intriguing.

702
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,400
It made sense too.

703
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,610
Did it?

704
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,440
The reason why one's heart moves?

705
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,679
You don't know why,
but it just happens.

706
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,849
It's probably due to afterimages
that are stacked upon each other.

707
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:52,789
Your first impression approach
never occurred to me.

708
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,130
I remember the first time
I saw you though.

709
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,909
Me too.

710
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:12,969
We met here.

711
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,639
You were in the booth
while I was out here.

712
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:31,590
I see you don't remember.

713
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,489
I guess I was someone
only you passed by then.

714
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,500
Should I let them meet?

715
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:44,809
But what if
they both end up suffering?

716
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,139
That's their burden to share.

717
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,130
You should open the windows
once in a while when the sun is out.

718
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,500
Don't keep the curtains closed.

719
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,829
Did it also rain all day there?

720
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:47,670
The nearby mill
got flooded with water.

721
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,440
And the same happened
with the boiler room and farm.

722
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,550
I don't speak with people
who don't know music.

723
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,050
Sir. The thing is...

724
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,750
Here's the music person.

725
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,989
Since when were you a music person?

726
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:10,420
You're here. What happened is...

727
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,130
I don't care for the reason.

728
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,230
All you had to do was send a text
saying the recording's canceled.

729
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,800
Am I wrong?

730
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:23,039
The studio was closed down,

731
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,309
and we assumed all
previous schedules were canceled.

732
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:26,409
I heard someone reopened it.

733
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:28,239
Other recordings
were scheduled instead.

734
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,710
Oh, so you'll do those jobs
but not this?

735
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,250
I'll call Mr. Choi right now.

736
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,949
Sir. Sir. Will you just...

737
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,590
Let's do just one take.

738
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,920
I must do it?

739
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,820
Talk to Jin Moo about the mixing.

740
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:46,659
- Let's cancel today and...
- I'll do it.

741
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,969
I'll discuss the mixing
with Mr. Choi,

742
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:52,900
- and if it's dreadful...
- Delete the track.

743
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,869
There will be no pay.

744
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:04,880
This hurts my pride.

745
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:08,480
Coming back
hurts my pride even more.

746
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,059
Hello.

747
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,269
My goodness.

748
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:42,809
What?

749
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,579
I'm off to meet Kim Ji Su.

750
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,719
You said you wouldn't do anything.

751
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,590
Tell Ha Won to be there.

752
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:55,059
Hey. Are you sure about this?

753
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,130
What's gotten into her?

754
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:01,429
Hey. There's a call for you.

755
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,199
- What?
- Sun Ho wants you to call.

756
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:10,139
You don't pick up
at this time of day.

757
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,769
She freaked out at me,
so it must be urgent.

758
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,840
(Han Seo Woo)

759
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,079
Welcome.

760
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,210
(Han Seo Woo)

761
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,349
Are you looking for someone?

762
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:56,250
I don't think she's here yet.

763
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,150
Then will you order first?

764
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,159
Sure.

765
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,170
Ji Su.

766
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,110
- Ji Su?
- Yes, Seo Woo.

767
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,539
I think I'll be a bit late.

768
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,010
Where are you going?

769
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,309
I think I saw someone.

770
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,949
Someone I should never see.

771
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:36,159
Is it really someone
you shouldn't see?

772
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:39,789
Is it Ha Won?

773
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,599
- If you see him...
- I can't ever.

774
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:50,940
Don't turn around.

775
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,090
Run.

776
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,949
It was nothing.

777
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:38,619
It was someone I met
for the first time,

778
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,890
but he just...

779
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:45,390
dug into my heart.

780
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,000
(A Piece of Your Mind)

781
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,109
I shouldn't have done anything.

782
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,239
Is there something
you want to ask Ha Won?

783
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:36,939
I want to see him from afar.

784
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:39,710
I won't run away next time.

785
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,350
What next time?

786
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,520
If I can apologize...

787
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,050
There's nothing to apologize for.

788
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:47,119
I told you already that
it's too much for me.

789
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:51,090
What do you think
got him through those 10 years?

790
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,689
Let's go tomorrow.
