I'll do it for you too.

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,590
I'll be the person you need.

11
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,829
The person next to you.

Gosh, that's hot.

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,510
They sell delicious dried laver,
you know.

16
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm making these
to enjoy them myself.

17
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,780
Want a beer?

18
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,909
Sure.

19
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,489
What about the others?

20
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,299
Jin Su won't be back
until past midnight...

21
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,669
and Min Jung goes to bed
once the TV show ends.

22
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,099
I wonder what she does
during the day though.

23
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,110
You must've been exhausted
over the past few days.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,819
Well,

25
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,659
I've thought about it,

26
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,060
and I feel burdened in a way.

27
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,560
In what way is that?

28
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,469
Because this will end up
leading to a serious relationship.

29
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,400
It's odd how things change
for oneself.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,599
I didn't realize it
when we dated in secret,

31
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,009
but it's different
now that everyone knows.

32
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,509
I can't just plainly like you
and it's confusing me.

33
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,780
You like whom you like.
Isn't that how it is?

34
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,509
Not for me.

35
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,490
How far along down the road
must one think about then?

36
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,919
Do we think about marriage...

37
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,789
or do we go further
as to parenthood?

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,060
How can one...

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,169
think and worry about those things
right now?

40
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,500
You build a relationship
with the one you love...

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,199
and that will then lead to marriage.

42
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,909
Of course one thinks
about the next stage.

43
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,710
Then what stage are we in?

44
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,810
The stage where we must think
about our next stage.

45
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,409
What's with all the stages...

46
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,009
It's frustrating!

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,180
Don't these worries
come naturally to you?

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,590
They don't.

49
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,060
Cut to the chase.

50
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,259
Don't beat around the bush.

51
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,129
Set your worries and
the other nonsense to the side...

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,169
and just get to the point.

53
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,969
Let's end this.

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,580
It's all I've been thinking about
for the past few days.

55
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,810
I'm sorry, but I feel burdened.

56
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,990
I'm home.

57
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,699
This has been a while.

58
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,740
On that note,
I'll get out of your hair.

59
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,910
Don't drag your chair!

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,569
Unbelievable.

61
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,000
It was awesome.

62
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,040
I can't believe you're here.

63
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,350
It is my place, you know.

64
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,649
I'm glad you're here.
Let's talk. Have a seat.

65
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,529
The lease on this house
ends next month.

66
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,230
Can you have it extended in my name?

67
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,899
You're going to leave anyway.

68
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,500
- Says who?
- You.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,629
You said you were
only staying temporarily.

70
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,699
You came here for Kim Ji Su anyway.

71
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,339
Sorry about that.

72
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,810
That wasn't the only reason.

73
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,079
Will you stay then?

74
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,649
Yes, I want to settle down.

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,079
I didn't expect that. Why?

76
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,889
I've been getting good sleep.

77
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,089
Right, of course.
What reason do you need...

78
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,459
to stay where you've been staying?
I'll move in with you.

79
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,129
No. It's uncomfortable.

80
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,199
Then you'll stay elsewhere.

81
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,699
Unbelievable.

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,500
You always end up
letting me have my way.

83
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,410
Are you sure about
living in Seoul though?

84
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,370
Yes, I like what I've been doing.

85
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,579
Recently, I pulled a musician
out of his slump.

86
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,980
If his career takes off...

87
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,920
It's unlike caring for plants.

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,350
It's extremely rewarding.

89
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,319
I must like people who I can help.

90
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,000
- What?
- I just...

91
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,430
noticed a few things
that are strange about you.

92
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,639
Moon Sun Ho...

93
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,000
I know he's married.
There's a wife in the picture.

94
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,040
But she suddenly
left on this trip...

95
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:45,879
and hasn't returned yet.

96
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,810
That's what Mr. Kang said so far.

97
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,379
What do I care?

98
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,220
They could've split up long ago.

99
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,120
- Forget about it.
- Don't worry.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,620
I'm not mad enough to date him.

101
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,720
I'll weigh out my options
and angles...

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,060
and date someone without issues.

103
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,259
It's been a long time
since I felt this way.

104
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,629
I feel like I have some value.

105
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,800
- When should I move out?
- Take your time.

106
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,199
My dear uncle.

107
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,300
High-five.

108
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,970
Thank you.

109
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,569
It's not about the location.

110
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,980
Are you going to work?

111
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,920
How are you?

112
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,759
Eun Ju and that guy.

113
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,129
They broke up.

114
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,350
Eun Ju, I'll have lunch at home.
Let's eat together.

115
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,659
My gosh.

116
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,700
You're here early.

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll be here until evening.
Are you free?

118
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,169
Yes. I just have to
go out for lunch.

119
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,000
Play yesterday's recording.

120
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay.

121
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,549
Seo Woo, where are you going?

122
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,950
I have to go home.
I'll just have lunch.

123
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,350
- Weren't you working?
- I have to go.

124
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,340
This is your recording
from yesterday, isn't it?

125
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:49,460
It's nice.

126
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,360
If you hadn't dragged me
out of the car,

127
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,200
I couldn't have played.

128
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:10,919
My goodness.

129
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:18,990
You really came.

130
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,960
I said I'd eat with you.

131
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,529
I'm so out of breath.

132
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,240
I cooked just one ramyeon.

133
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,899
We can add rice later.

134
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,679
I cooked some dried lavers.

135
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,049
I can eat two bowls of rice
with your dried lavers.

136
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,720
- Eun Ju.
- Yes?

137
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,590
You and Chang Seob. What's going on?

138
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,899
Chang Seob broke up with me.

139
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,330
That crazy...

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,500
It's not crazy. It's common.

141
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,269
And you. Are you okay?

142
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,610
I am. I don't feel a thing.

143
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,350
What about work?

144
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,950
I left halfway because
I was worried about you.

145
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,620
Eat up quickly and go.

146
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,669
Can you come home early today?

147
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,039
I'll get some octopus
to make a lovely octopus soup.

148
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,179
I need an energy booster.

149
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,009
That sounds good.

150
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,019
My tummy hurts.

151
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,559
(Have a safe trip.)

152
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,340
Did you sleep well last night?

153
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,009
It's not about the location.

154
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,409
You didn't?

155
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,350
I'll look for another reason.

156
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,750
What could there be?

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,029
If we bring the hand into play,

158
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,529
will it help reduce anxiety?

159
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,070
Anxiety is usually caused by...

160
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,799
the increase of
certain neurotransmitters.

161
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,909
Shouldn't the focus be on
medicines to tone them down?

162
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,340
Anxiety is caused by...

163
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,279
as many things as there are people.

164
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,909
Supportive therapy would help.

165
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,679
In what way?

166
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,120
- Let them hold hands.
- Whose hand?

167
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,789
The hand of the person they miss.

168
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,190
Wow, you want to make a hand?

169
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,429
- I agree.
- No, by training.

170
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,929
Patterned training.

171
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,000
A certain pattern and pressure...

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,860
can make the device
sense it's a hand.

173
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,799
We can model it
to conform to the training.

174
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,899
Like a phantom pain.

175
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,039
In medicine, phantom pain...

176
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,309
is when an amputee senses a pain...

177
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,549
- in a missing limb.
- Yes, it's similar.

178
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,809
So basically,

179
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,419
we approach as if it's
about the brain, not the fingertips.

180
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,779
Even if there's no hand,

181
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,889
we can make them think
they're holding a hand in midair.

182
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,620
- We can make a hand.
- No.

183
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,460
Just the texture.

184
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,159
If we use this with a conversational
program at a care home,

185
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,070
it would help dementia patients.

186
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,600
Just holding a hand...

187
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,799
offers them a huge amount of
emotional stability.

188
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,710
- I'll have a cappuccino.
- Okay, one cappuccino.

189
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,009
The others will have Americanos.

190
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,809
Send me more papers on anxiety.

191
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:00,840
Okay.

192
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,649
Thanks to you guys,
in a short while,

193
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,519
that will pour me drinks
depending on my mood.

194
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,289
That will happen.

195
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,389
We need a hand and texture.

196
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,799
Why just the texture?

197
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,100
You can make what you want
if you join another team.

198
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,399
It got faster.

199
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,070
You're doing well.

200
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:27,870
It's delicious.

201
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,110
- Hey.
- Good job.

202
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,580
It's time Min Jung uploads something
on her social media.

203
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,710
- She always does at 1pm.
- Really?

204
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,610
This isn't it.

205
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,419
Mr. Kang, how about
you take a break?

206
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,870
You got this plant as a gift.

207
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,039
Yes.

208
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,340
From whom?

209
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,450
A friend.

210
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,950
What kind of friend?

211
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,090
A friend that
only I think of as a friend.

212
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,559
She doesn't think of me that way.

213
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,899
Why is it just you?

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,370
Because I know how I feel.

215
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,840
I don't know how she feels.

216
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,110
She went far away.

217
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,509
So there's no way for me to find out
what she thinks.

218
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,720
Mr. Kang, instead of releasing
an entire album,

219
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,960
you could just release
1 or 2 soundtracks.

220
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,940
Why is it so quiet?

221
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,580
We're back to square one.

222
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,950
Mr. Kang, that was nice.

223
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,730
Should we keep going?

224
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,829
Shouldn't we collect data
regarding the neural canal?

225
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,400
Make sure to request them
to gather more data.

226
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll look into the algorithm
a bit more.

227
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,700
Okay, great.

228
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,069
Let's take a break.

229
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,339
What is he doing?

230
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,250
What...

231
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,730
- Are you done?
- Yes.

232
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,460
Great work.

233
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,759
I'm proud of you.

234
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,349
Are you going to stay here?

235
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,089
No.

236
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:14,359
Do you always need
Seo Woo to be here when you play?

237
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:17,359
I guess she brings out my best.

238
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,930
Hey, Eun Ju.

239
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,259
Yes, I'll be home.

240
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,930
I think I'm on my way.

241
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,200
You want to know where I am?

242
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,980
Eun Ju, I'll be right there.

243
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,619
You're on your way?

244
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,589
My gosh.

245
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,259
Did you spray something
on the blanket?

246
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,819
I fell asleep so easily.

247
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,890
You can sleep here.

248
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,190
No, it's okay.

249
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,230
I dropped by because I wanted
to keep you company.

250
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,599
But I need to go now.

251
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,410
But you just came.
You can't leave already.

252
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,380
Did you get some sleep?

253
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:15,109
I tired myself out today,
so I'm hoping I'll get some sleep.

254
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,519
Eun Ju is going through something,
so I need to be with her.

255
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,890
She's not doing very well.

256
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,119
I'll come back next time.

257
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,519
I'm so popular these days.

258
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,329
Everyone needs me.

259
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,859
Even Mr. Kang wants me to keep him
company when he plays the piano.

260
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,339
Kang In Wook is married.
You know that, right?

261
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:39,799
Yes.

262
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:49,309
Why did you just emphasize
the fact that he's married?

263
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,880
No way.

264
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,980
- No, it's not that.
- My goodness.

265
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,220
No way.

266
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,619
Did my 1 percent become 20 percent?

267
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,789
No, it's just that...

268
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,559
Sun Ho also keeps talking about him.

269
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,329
So I'm worried he might be
giving people the wrong message.

270
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:08,000
That's another 5 percent.
It's 25 percent now.

271
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,430
No, that's not...

272
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:21,950
25 percent?

273
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,420
Hey, Eun Ju.

274
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,220
Chang Seob just came home,
and it's driving me crazy.

275
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,789
We've broken up,
so he shouldn't be home.

276
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,230
And why would he eat something
that I cooked for myself?

277
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,660
I'm not okay! I'm not okay at all!

278
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,410
I didn't eat dinner,
and I had a truckload of work today.

279
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,779
I took a short nap,
but I'm still exhausted.

280
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,420
Tell me what's going on,
but keep it short.

281
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,450
I'm thinking about what to do.

282
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,920
You're not really
going to break up, are you?

283
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,130
No, it's not that.

284
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,799
I'm thinking about
whether to stay here or leave.

285
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,730
I haven't made up my mind yet.

286
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,930
Shouldn't you have
thought that through already?

287
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,500
Hey, I may have broken up with her.

288
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,799
But that doesn't mean
I want to move out of this place.

289
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,440
I thought I should end it first...

290
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,670
What are you talking about?

291
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,339
Gosh, I'm starving.

292
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,779
I'm too tired
to even fight with you.

293
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,150
Go and eat the rest of the soup.

294
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,579
Eun Ju's octopus soup is amazing.

295
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,990
You should leave. There's no need
to think about it. Just move out.

296
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,920
Eun Ju is going through something,
so I need to be with her.

297
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,420
She's not doing very well.

298
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,589
I finished everything.

299
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,859
Do you know what I was looking for?

300
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,200
It wasn't because I was tired.

301
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

302
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,019
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

303
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,700
Why are you
bringing your stuff here?

304
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,039
Because it's my place.

305
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,240
No, it's not.

306
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,740
I told you that it'll be mine soon.

307
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,640
Let's go.

308
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,980
So these...

309
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:21,920
Come on in.

310
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,049
Sun Ho!

311
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,700
- Sun Ho?
- Yes.

312
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,299
I had it changed to my name.

313
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,130
It was someone else's before.

314
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,869
My uncle has finally
decided to move on.

315
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,980
He probably...

316
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,640
hoped for a chance
to see Kim Ji Su again,

317
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,109
but he can't now.

318
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,049
I thought he'd leave Seoul,
but he's going to stay.

319
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,789
He's not like
how he used to be before.

320
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,789
He no longer seems to be wandering.

321
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,130
But hearing how...

322
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:07,430
he's finally over Ji Su
made me upset though.

323
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,630
Why?

324
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,299
All I've seen are those
who are cold-hearted...

325
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,369
or overly passionate
when it comes to love.

326
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,440
But my uncle
was of a different kind.

327
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,180
He was a breath of fresh air,

328
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,880
so I guess
I rooted for him in a way.

329
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,210
As if that's anything to root for.

330
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,509
What?

331
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,779
Root for what he has going for him.

332
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,720
What are families for?

333
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,250
Gosh.
It's like you're a fan of his now.

334
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,160
I agree that he's unique.

335
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,359
- Do I just put these up here?
- Yes.

336
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,640
Jisu?

337
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,079
- And the device?
- I got rid of it.

338
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,220
Jisu...

339
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,589
- Seo Woo?
- Oh, right!

340
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,859
Hawon?

341
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,339
Let's go.

342
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,710
Mr. Kang has been
bombarding me with texts.

343
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,009
I only ask because I don't know.

344
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,079
Does he need you
for practice sessions too?

345
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,549
Not really.

346
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,579
He's been
requesting you nonstop though.

347
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,769
Why on earth did I take this?

348
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:26,599
Still,

349
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,970
Ji Su...

350
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,009
Where are you right now?

351
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,849
Is it possible?

352
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,720
That'd be amazing.

353
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,579
Taking one's hand...

354
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,049
calms you down, right?

355
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,789
It's even worse in hospitals.

356
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,920
Even a checkup
can be nerve-wracking,

357
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,190
so it'd be nice
if someone holds your hand.

358
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,029
That's exactly
what I'm going to try to do.

359
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,130
Feeling one's touch
without physical contact.

360
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,809
Do this for me.

361
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,750
Close your eyes.

362
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,519
Don't open them.

363
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:10,710
Didn't you feel anything?

364
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:13,380
I'm not the sensitive type.

365
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,650
Open your eyes.

366
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,480
This is what...

367
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,750
I'm going to do.

368
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,559
Now, close your eyes again.

369
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,250
It's because you acknowledged it.
You know the pattern now.

370
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,779
It's as if we were holding hands.

371
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,519
No, that'd be this.

372
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,750
Are you listening to music?

373
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,460
Sounds good.

374
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,990
It's scary...

375
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,430
but also beautiful.

376
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,339
It's the last song...

377
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,339
Ji Su heard.

378
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,349
It's not because of the location...

379
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,989
and it's not because I'm tired.

380
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,059
I think I'm sleeping well...

381
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,300
because someone's been by my side.

382
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900
Could you...

383
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,170
be here for me?

384
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,949
I miss you.

385
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:03,840
I'll try again.

386
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,550
Ms. Han?

387
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,320
Ms. Han?

388
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,099
Ji Su,

389
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,630
if...

390
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,599
If...

391
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,940
Ha Won does move on from you,

392
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:38,940
I'll make up for it...

393
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,110
by remembering you that much more.

394
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:44,929
You should've told me
you're going out.

395
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,039
Ms. Han.

396
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,409
It shouldn't fall.

397
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
It fell on the ground.

398
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,860
Let's focus.

399
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,639
Something urgent came up
at the studio and I couldn't leave.

400
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,949
Are you at the studio?

401
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Yes.

402
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,800
Then it's fine.

403
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,980
I'll text you soon. Sorry.

404
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,519
It's okay.

405
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,130
You can take your time.

406
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,659
Why are you sighing?

407
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,000
Eun Ju.

408
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:02,469
Even when I'm stuck in my room,
I can hear Chang Seob.

409
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:07,179
I hear him walk,
open the door, drink water, pee.

410
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,380
You pay just half the rent,
so half of this room is mine.

411
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,550
Eun Ju.

412
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,920
About love.

413
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,789
Shut up. Don't mention love or life.

414
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:24,829
I've had enough.

415
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,829
I've been drinking and emptying
my guts for tomorrow's health check.

416
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,099
I feel so weak.

417
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,710
Talk about yourself.
Why did you sigh?

418
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,239
Go on. Talk.

419
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,150
Maybe it's because
nothing ever worked out for me,

420
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,349
but whenever I think
something's going well,

421
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:51,550
I come up with 100 reasons it won't.

422
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,260
That's so typical of you.

423
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,489
You always have a story
that'll make you feel down.

424
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:01,030
Tell me just 1 of the 100.

425
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,699
I feel as if...

426
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:08,670
I stole the love
one should feel for another.

427
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,340
Hey. Are you seeing Chang Seob?

428
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,710
Are you crazy?

429
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,610
Your hair...

430
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,610
I had it done with
the coupon Su Ji gave me.

431
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,780
The stylist gained
so much weight in just a year.

432
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,590
When I said so, she went on to say
she wouldn't honor the coupon.

433
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,619
I bet she was ticked off. So?

434
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,789
I said I got dumped
and she felt bad for me.

435
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,090
She did it right away.

436
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,400
Good for you. Well done.

437
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,570
What does he look like?

438
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,530
Your 100 reasons.

439
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,340
100 reasons.

440
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,469
Won. Your shoulders...

441
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,639
Do this with your shoulders.

442
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,909
Yes, nice and square. That's it.

443
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,619
Part your fringe to the side.

444
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,780
- My fringe?
- To the side.

445
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:57,920
That's it.

446
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,420
You must show
your full face, like me.

447
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,789
Passport photos...
The corners of your mouth.

448
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,000
Yes. Something like that.

449
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,300
It's not a passport photo.

450
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,469
Then what is it?

451
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,300
Why take a photo
if it's not for a document?

452
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,269
Someone asked me to
send a photo of my face.

453
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,880
Who is it?

454
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,750
You said you were busy
and you really were busy.

455
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,920
Who would ask you for a selfie?

456
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,190
Oh. A selfie.

457
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,800
I... I don't have
any photos of him. At all.

458
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Then why are you looking for one?

459
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,400
Is it time?

460
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,409
I need to go to the toilet. Darn it.

461
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,860
I went to all the restaurants
you told me to go to.

462
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,969
I went through the list.
I cleared it.

463
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,909
Mom ate everything.

464
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:27,980
That's done.

465
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,219
They're 4 to 5-minute pieces
that I wrote.

466
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,030
You pick one.

467
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:45,260
We can record it.

468
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,300
This one.

469
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,809
I put it on paper.

470
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,780
What you played
in the hall on the spot.

471
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,909
You played it yesterday too.

472
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,170
I liked it, so I recorded it
and put it on paper.

473
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,309
That tune should've disappeared.

474
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:34,340
There's no such thing.

475
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,940
This song is like that.

476
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:40,119
To someone, when they were
really struggling,

477
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,820
this song could've been
a great help.

478
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:48,420
Music saves the world? Is that it?

479
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,289
Yes.

480
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,400
It saved someone for a few seconds.

481
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,900
For a few seconds,
it definitely did.

482
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,239
Hand it over.

483
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:07,079
I'll play it.

484
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,159
An unseen sense of touch
that will reduce anxiety?

485
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:30,670
I'm sure you'll solve
the technical challenges.

486
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,230
But...

487
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:36,670
who would use that
solely for medical purposes?

488
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,579
It must not be done.

489
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,650
If it's unseen, it'll be
even more likely to get abused.

490
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,590
You'll create something
that isn't there?

491
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,019
You're quite consistent.

492
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,289
I guess I am.

493
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,929
I can't seem to get away from it.

494
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:05,670
I should.

495
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,400
I won't do this.

496
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,340
Can you make
that decision so quickly?

497
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,510
I haven't even started anything yet.

498
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,750
Thank you for everything.

499
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,349
We can't stop here.

500
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:21,349
It's not a serious illness.

501
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:25,789
And you can't tell me what to do.

502
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:28,420
I just came to say goodbye.

503
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,630
I don't want to say goodbye.

504
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,400
Where is Eun Ju Boarding House?

505
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,230
- Does that really exist?
- I appreciate your effort.

506
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:42,239
Why don't we meet as friends?

507
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:45,809
We could meet up and eat together
once or twice a month.

508
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:48,210
I don't have any friends either.

509
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,650
I'm always either at work
or at home taking care of my kid.

510
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,510
I've lost touch with my friends.

511
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,579
I'm sorry.
I don't think I'll have time.

512
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,820
I'm going to leave this place.

513
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:03,929
Oh, well.

514
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:07,230
I'll just have to chat
with your device.

515
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,840
She's exactly like you
except for one thing.

516
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:17,469
What's that?

517
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,579
She's bright.

518
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,610
- Then that's not me.
- It's you.

519
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,550
You're just temporarily
going through something right now.

520
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,119
"Temporarily"?

521
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,230
Can I talk to the device?

522
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,429
The bright version of yourself?

523
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,130
It's against the rules...

524
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,769
to let the patient...

525
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,269
talk to the device.

526
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:51,809
I'd like to hear...

527
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,380
what my bright-self has to say.

528
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,079
I know that.

529
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,050
Can't you just let Min Jung
be an exception?

530
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,420
We need to do it now.
That's our only option.

531
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:04,250
I'm in front of your office.

532
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,070
Come in.

533
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,880
How am I supposed to talk to myself?

534
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,610
I know, right?

535
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,309
You're not here for treatment.

536
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:37,690
This is just a private meeting.

537
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,860
You're no longer my patient.
We agreed to be friends.

538
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,389
So you can drink.

539
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:49,599
He's the guy
who developed this device.

540
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:54,400
I can't do anything
without his permission.

541
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,769
Just ignore him.

542
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,139
How can I ignore him
when he's right there?

543
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,510
Look at him. He's very quiet.

544
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,550
He's not here.

545
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:07,480
Okay then.

546
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:13,090
- Cheers.
- You're going to drink as well?

547
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,119
No, I'm just going to clink cups.

548
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:17,530
I don't drink during working hours.

549
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,159
He really bothers me.

550
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,760
Should I turn it on or not?

551
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,469
Okay.

552
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:35,409
It's on.

553
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,250
There.

554
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,590
Min Jung.

555
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Hello?

556
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,900
Why aren't you saying anything?

557
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,219
Min Jung.

558
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,150
Yes?

559
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:18,789
Why are you so bright?

560
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,059
Why?

561
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,500
Why do you sound so happy
and worry-free?

562
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,099
Seriously.

563
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,769
Why are you bright?

564
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:41,780
How brazen of you.

565
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:46,250
Why? How? Why?

566
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:47,780
My goodness, you startled me.

567
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:55,159
What's your purpose in life?

568
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,460
What's the matter with you?

569
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,429
You can't even run fast enough.

570
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,960
Mom.

571
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,909
Mom.

572
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,420
Mom.

573
00:51:58,289 --> 00:51:59,320
Mom.

574
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,949
Oh, no!

575
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,280
Oh, my dear!

576
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:35,989
My gosh, my baby!

577
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:40,329
My goodness! No!

578
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,570
Open your eyes.

579
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,199
Please open your eyes! I'm here!

580
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,409
I'm here. Please open your eyes.

581
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,380
Oh, my goodness.

582
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,480
What am I going to do!

583
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,949
If I ran a little bit faster...

584
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:11,190
If I ran...
If I was just a little bit faster...

585
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,730
If only I got there
a little bit faster...

586
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:26,469
If I got there fast enough
to hold her hand...

587
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,579
If only I got to hold her hand...

588
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:35,920
If only she got to hold my hand...

589
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,559
She was holding her hand out
just like this.

590
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,489
But I got there too late.
If I only I got there fast enough...

591
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:38,179
Thank you.

592
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,619
I went home once or twice a month.

593
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,090
I was too busy with work,
and my life was so hectic.

594
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,059
- Welcome.
- I booked a room.

595
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,389
What's your name?

596
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,530
My daughter checked
my Instagram page...

597
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,429
every morning
as soon as she woke up.

598
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,400
She liked seeing
a lot of likes on my posts.

599
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,099
If I didn't eat properly,
she'd tell me off.

600
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,739
And the next day,
I'd eat what she recommends...

601
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,039
and take photos of it.

602
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,409
That's all I ever did for her.

603
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,849
I realized something
after she passed away.

604
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:19,619
That without her,

605
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:22,090
nothing means anything in this life.

606
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,030
There's no reason to
throw myself at my job...

607
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,329
and even to stay alive
for that matter.

608
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,730
I just can't forgive myself.

609
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,570
If only I could've
held her hand once more.

610
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:28,619
Didn't someone
take my hand earlier?

611
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,860
It saved me.

612
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,039
Ms. Kim, your purse.

613
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,369
Right.

614
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:49,210
- Bye.
- Thank you.

615
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,349
I was here visiting someone.

616
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,920
Where are you off to next?
Can I join you?

617
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,320
I have somewhere to be.

618
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,989
Can I please come with you?

619
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,690
I don't want to be alone right now.

620
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,699
Go by yourself and stop whining.

621
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,070
The hand wasn't a woman's.

622
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,280
What are you listening to?

623
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,710
- Mr. Kang's music.
- Of course.

624
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:27,250
How does it feel...

625
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,820
to be with Kang In Wook
in the studio all day?

626
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,449
What do you mean?

627
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,190
I'm just curious, that's all.

628
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,690
You don't feel
other emotions, right?

629
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,860
I don't.

630
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,690
All right then.

631
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:42,400
When I'm at work,
it's all I focus on.

632
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:43,800
I get it.

633
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,630
There's someone I like though.

634
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,000
When did you have time
to start dating?

635
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,809
I'm not dating anyone.
He's just someone I like.

636
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:53,010
Isn't that the same thing?

637
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,980
Oh, I get it. A one-sided love?

638
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:59,110
I have romantic feelings for him...

639
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:03,449
and he thinks of me
as a nice person.

640
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,719
It's similar but totally different.

641
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:07,219
Like chalk and cheese.

642
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:09,190
I am not sure if it's
that different.

643
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,929
It doesn't seem one-sided to me.

644
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,530
You're not the most intuitive type,

645
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,300
so it can't be one-sided
if he has you confused.

646
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,900
How come?

647
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,539
That's not something
even I was able to think of.

648
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:26,170
I just randomly spat it out.

649
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:29,510
It's not like I could tell you
to quit on him.

650
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,780
Consider it as a morale booster.

651
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,619
You always say things
you don't mean.

652
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:34,719
Did you like it though?

653
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,329
(Mr. Dawn)

654
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,070
Hello?

655
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,869
Do you know "banbogi" is?

656
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,510
"Banbogi"?

657
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,780
Does it mean
to see half of something?

658
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,710
When studying Korean,

659
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,179
I looked up dictionaries
and Korean maps.

660
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,920
That's a word I learned
from the dictionary.

661
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,190
When a married woman...

662
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:13,619
missed her mother,

663
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:16,320
she'd travel home but stop halfway.

664
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,659
That's what the word means.

665
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,789
Then it's an archaic word.

666
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,730
It's not used these days.

667
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,099
We should...

668
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:24,530
do that too.

669
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:28,570
Walk 10 minutes
from where you are...

670
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,440
and I'll drive for 10 minutes
from where I am.

671
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,010
That'll bring us to the footbridge.

672
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,579
We'll see each other there.

673
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,510
I'm at work,
so I can't stay for long.

674
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,079
That's the beauty of it.

675
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,119
Let's keep it short
and heartwarming.

676
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,010
Your hand, please.

677
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:19,920
Short...

678
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,219
and heartwarming.

679
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,469
There.

680
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,440
You're probably busy tonight, so...

681
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,309
I'm not.

682
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,469
Then I'll see you later.

683
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,480
No, this wasn't the feeling either.

684
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,889
He asked me to be with him.

685
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:28,019
Be there for me.

686
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,719
And I said I'd be there for him.

687
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,260
I need to be there for him.

688
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:36,599
Then that's what I should do.

689
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:40,099
He asked me for help,
so all I have to do is help him.

690
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:43,070
I can't though
because I dropped the device?

691
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:47,440
What kind of story
am I writing in my head?

692
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,800
(Baked sweet potatoes)

693
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:20,340
I cleaned up the place.

694
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,079
I cleaned.

695
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,059
You do it well
if you put your mind to it.

696
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:42,960
Did you sleep here?

697
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,570
I've been staying here
from time to time.

698
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,400
It must be uncomfortable.

699
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,440
I've never been one
to sleep properly.

700
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,840
Well,

701
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,949
I'm here because
you needed help sleeping.

702
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,820
So...

703
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,820
Let's set things up first.

704
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,789
Where was I?

705
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,360
In the room.

706
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,559
Right, I was in the room
and you were on the couch.

707
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,659
You should
put down your purse first.

708
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,070
The door was open, right?

709
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,039
Let's recreate the scene.

710
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:31,579
This is exactly
where I was that day.

711
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,880
So the angle we were at...

712
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:40,820
You were there
and I slept on the couch.

713
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,659
That's right.

714
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:46,730
Let's get some sleep then.
Good night.

715
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,929
When do we eat this though?

716
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,489
Where is that thing?

717
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,059
- "That thing"?
- Yes, that thing.

718
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:20,329
That... That thing. The...

719
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,300
I don't have it, so let's just eat.

720
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,670
Okay.

721
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,539
A frying pan.

722
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,139
That's what I was trying to say.

723
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,760
I once went a month
without sleeping.

724
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:50,829
Why?

725
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,230
It was before I left Oslo.

726
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:21,320
Others might find it strange,

727
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:26,460
but not sleeping and
not eating at the right times,

728
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,460
and sleeping in any room you want.

729
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,630
And not settling somewhere.

730
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:35,440
I'm used to that.

731
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,739
It's the same bed linen.

732
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:46,949
You said that's why you slept well.

733
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,449
That new ones have a sound.

734
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:55,389
In the spring and fall,
on a sunny day,

735
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:58,389
Eun Ju and I put out
all the bedding to air in the sun.

736
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,900
That night, I sleep so well.

737
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:09,039
I should hang a clothesline
in the garden.

738
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:12,809
Let's do that.

739
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,579
I'll leave as soon as
you fall asleep.

740
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,050
I have to go.

741
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,829
The boarding house
suddenly got busy.

742
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,530
It's a bit...

743
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,900
It's working. You should sleep.

744
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,500
Let's go before I get too sleepy.

745
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,510
I'll take you home.

746
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:00,389
No one else will use that bedding.

747
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,519
Come whenever
you want to sleep well.

748
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,429
I can't sleep in your room.

749
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,840
I can hear what you're thinking.

750
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,239
What you're thinking.

751
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,940
You're right.

752
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:53,969
- Hey.
- What?

753
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:57,309
Tell me one more of
the 100 reasons it won't work.

754
01:07:57,309 --> 01:07:59,349
(Epilogue)

755
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:04,519
This. You won't let me go out.

756
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:06,289
You want me too much.

757
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:08,820
It's just today. I need you
just for tonight.

758
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,289
Not from tomorrow.

759
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,730
I don't want to be alone tonight.

760
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,460
It gives me the shudders.

761
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:25,640
Thumb's up.

762
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,569
(A Piece of Your Mind)

763
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:58,840
Suddenly, one day,

764
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,840
you have 100 reasons
you can't like that person.

765
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,109
Was that deliberate?

766
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,979
Turning back and
staying only for a while.

767
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,010
Yes.

768
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,050
What was your daughter's name?

769
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:10,079
You know, hanging from the ceiling.

770
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,750
Don't!

771
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,020
Ji Su?

772
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,960
Someone was in here.

773
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,529
I'll make an exception
and listen to you.

774
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,289
It's fine as long as no one dies.

775
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:20,899
What if she died?

776
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:23,500
Wanting to see and be with someone.

777
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:26,130
It's never been two-ways
for me before.
