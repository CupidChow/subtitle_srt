(A Piece of Your Mind)

2
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,253
(77-30 Wokin 4-gil,
Old: 47-341 Wokin-dong, Jongno-go)

3
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,784
Do you remember what you said?

4
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,792
That you thought I may meet Ha Won.

5
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:22,793
Yes.

6
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:24,523
That you thought I had already met him.

7
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,834
You were right.

8
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:29,232
It was someone I knew.

9
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:33,332
It was that person who rents
the studio early in the morning.

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,873
I thought so. And?

11
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,784
Do you...

12
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:51,884
want to try talking to Ha Won?

13
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,123
- Maybe...
- No.

14
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:56,763
- What?
- Don't you remember?

15
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:59,693
I ran away once I knew Ha Won was there.

16
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:02,163
That was why I got mad at you.

17
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:05,104
Why do you remember that?

18
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,042
Think about it one more time...

19
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:20,483
Don't just turn it off.

20
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,483
You just turned it off
suddenly the other day.

21
00:01:25,923 --> 00:01:29,724
Say something before you
do, so that I can get ready.

22
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,593
What would be good?

23
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:34,664
That's it.

24
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,563
"Ji Soo, I'll let you rest now."

25
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:43,004
Okay.

26
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:56,823
Ji Soo, I'll let you rest now.

27
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:58,724
Okay.

28
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:08,063
I think it'll be hard for
you to converse with her.

29
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:11,334
I know. I heard.

30
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:25,883
Don't look at me like that.
I'm sensitive about that.

31
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,253
"What should I say to her?"

32
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,924
It's obvious you're trying to comfort me.

33
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:38,264
I never talk about my family.
I don't know why I told her.

34
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,613
Does it have something
to do with the picture...

35
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:42,633
that Ji Soo left?

36
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,163
My hometown is near there.

37
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,744
I didn't go back since the accident.

38
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:53,304
And she left it there.

39
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:55,473
You talked about Misiryeong...

40
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,544
in the studio, didn't you?

41
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,524
Like I said, we shared secrets.

42
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:06,383
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

43
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,193
Wait, Misiryeong is Ha Won.

44
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:14,663
So it does have something to do with you.
Satisfied?

45
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:16,494
I don't think it does.

46
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,334
The studio.

47
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:21,633
The picture of Misiryeong.

48
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:25,473
To Ji Soo, all of them...

49
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,514
lead to you.

50
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,063
No.

51
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:49,163
Ji Soo's point of reaction is my crush.

52
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,964
My feelings for you.

53
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:56,533
Thus, it's you,

54
00:03:58,044 --> 00:03:59,174
Ha Won.

55
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:09,683
(A Piece of Your Mind)

56
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,753
(Episode 4)

57
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,293
Goodbye.

58
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,173
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

59
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:30,443
- The man who just left.
- What about him?

60
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,603
Why did he come again?

61
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:34,472
He wanted to buy the same
thing he bought last time.

62
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,084
How was I supposed to
remember what he bought?

63
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:43,454
Do you have fertilizers?

64
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,033
How have you been?

65
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,213
Did you listen to the recording...

66
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,042
that I mixed?

67
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,714
I told you I did.

68
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,883
Ms. Moon said you came
by our studio to play.

69
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,313
She was so amazed.

70
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,383
She didn't hear anything
because I had the doors closed.

71
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,483
Amazed, my foot.

72
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:22,793
She said your passion made her
feel like she could hear it.

73
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:46,384
By the way, who sent you to Seo Woo?

74
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,084
My gosh, Mr. Choi.

75
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,652
My gosh, Ms. Moon.

76
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:57,793
What brought you to my shabby studio?

77
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,063
In Wook wanted to see me here...

78
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,732
because he knows a lot
of people in my studio.

79
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,533
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

80
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,934
We'll be discussing some
negative things, you see.

81
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,802
His skills are looking good lately.

82
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,342
He recorded an album for the
first time in his career.

83
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:14,243
Everything was great.

84
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,673
But then he lost his motivation.

85
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:19,243
Hello.

86
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,084
Hi.

87
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:24,384
Mr. Kang will be here soon after a beer.

88
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,593
Something seems to be going
on between him and his wife.

89
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,493
His wife was good at supporting him.

90
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,123
She kept his performance
suits in a separate container.

91
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:36,764
She made different kinds of
tea depending on his condition.

92
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:39,764
She knew music and they
had a good relationship.

93
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,243
But he doesn't bring his thermos anymore.

94
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,173
How can someone do that every single day?

95
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,842
Maybe his wife is overly eager.

96
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:49,343
No, they were different.

97
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,813
She wasn't overly eager.

98
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:54,884
She cared about her
husband in a quiet manner.

99
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,254
I see.

100
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,282
Why are you staring at him?

101
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,153
You'll burn a hole in his face.

102
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,824
How impressive.

103
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,463
The way he observes them is different,

104
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:07,670
which is why his understanding
of performers is so different.

105
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,163
I mean, who else would've
noticed his thermos?

106
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,934
This must be why renowned
players have their faith in him.

107
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:17,574
- I have a long way to go.
- You'll be like that soon.

108
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,173
Mr. Choi, we...

109
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:30,084
Good day.

110
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,314
It stands out.

111
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,183
You sound totally different
before and after your slump.

112
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:04,184
In what way?

113
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:07,353
How is it different? Tell me in detail.

114
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:17,334
The cello is playing the melody,

115
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:21,473
and the piano sounds a bit rough.

116
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,043
It's noticeable even to her.

117
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:28,412
I know it's upsetting, but we have
to talk about your condition now.

118
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,013
It'll only get harder for you otherwise.

119
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,233
I need to know the situation
in order to take action.

120
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,684
Let's talk alone.

121
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:45,223
- Why are you coming out?
- I was told to leave.

122
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:48,834
Hey, where are you going?

123
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,804
Why didn't you tell me before?

124
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:05,383
I mean,

125
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,784
why did she go to Norway alone
and have that happen to her?

126
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:16,223
You two got along so well.

127
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,093
We did.

128
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:23,294
So I thought she'd understand,
and told her recently.

129
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:24,863
Told her what?

130
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,373
In the past,

131
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:32,103
someone precious to Ji
Soo got into an accident.

132
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:35,174
Because...

133
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,383
of a childish lie I told.

134
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,424
Ma'am.

135
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,424
Ma'am.

136
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:53,163
I had kept it to myself, then I told her.

137
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:54,534
Ma'am!

138
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,794
It tormented her. That's why she went.

139
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:01,872
Because of me...

140
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:04,103
Don't get any stupid ideas. Stop it.

141
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,904
There's no need to bring up the past.

142
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:11,613
- I'll explain to the others...
- Don't.

143
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:16,353
I'll get past this somehow.

144
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,054
Don't tell them.

145
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:22,794
I'll rearrange the schedule,

146
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,493
but will you be ready by then?

147
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:30,133
I have to be.

148
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,914
If she had understood me,

149
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,714
she wouldn't have gone all the way there.

150
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,113
Why couldn't she understand me?

151
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,353
Why was she worried only about him?

152
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,294
Sorry. I'll be there soon.

153
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,393
I'm close by, so wait.

154
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,404
In Wook, let's go now. You're drunk.

155
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:08,633
I called a taxi. Let's get up now.

156
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:13,373
My wife had...

157
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,684
someone like family.

158
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:22,113
Someone like family?

159
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,223
Family? Give me a break.

160
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,454
He liked my wife.

161
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:30,054
I'm sure of it.

162
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,694
He was studying in the States,
so why did he come to Seoul?

163
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,863
Gosh, whatever.

164
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:48,914
There was...

165
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:52,113
no place for me between them.

166
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:56,584
I was...

167
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,022
going crazy out of jealousy.

168
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,353
Hello? Soon Ho, watch him.

169
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:03,954
Okay, be right there.

170
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,103
They were...

171
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:14,034
friends, but like family...

172
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,873
ever since they were little.

173
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,444
I was no match for that.

174
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:22,944
Mr. Kang.

175
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:25,983
Are you okay?

176
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:33,954
Drink some of this.

177
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:35,454
Here.

178
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:40,023
Get up.

179
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,464
Gosh.

180
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,563
Goodness.

181
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,233
Hold me up.

182
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,674
I am holding you up.

183
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:51,103
The moment we share this,

184
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,674
the world will be turned upside-down.

185
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:58,383
Arrange the sharing
schedule with the hospital.

186
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,982
We should talk to Jin Sun in private.

187
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:01,983
Right.

188
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,924
Why does it feel so strange though?

189
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,892
Whenever we finish something,

190
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:11,392
there are only you and me left.

191
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:13,623
Our company has become bigger,
but it's still the same.

192
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:18,133
I used to be all excited and stuff...

193
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,464
when we developed something.

194
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:23,534
But it's not as exciting now.

195
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,373
After you heard about the forest fire,

196
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,973
you said location-tracking is
necessary in all situations,

197
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:33,683
so we cranked it out. We were so
moved when we finished, you know?

198
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:36,253
At that time... Where are you going?

199
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,554
We were in the middle of talking.

200
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,593
What are you doing?

201
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,693
Do you collect cell phones too?

202
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,733
(2013)

203
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:58,632
I'm currently in front
of the village hall...

204
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:01,472
where people have evacuated from the fire.

205
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:03,732
- So where are you now?
- Goodness.

206
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,503
- Where?
- Oh, dear.

207
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,742
- Really?
- Dad, where are you?

208
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,142
Thank goodness.

209
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,343
How fortunate.
I thought you were near the fire.

210
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:14,613
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

211
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:18,023
My hometown is near there.

212
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:20,522
I didn't go back since the accident.

213
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:22,794
And she left it there.

214
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:55,446
It's been so long since we
all ate dinner together.

215
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:57,744
Seo Woo isn't here.

216
00:15:57,745 --> 00:15:59,086
Is she not here?

217
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:01,086
Seo Woo exists too, you know.

218
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:02,854
What's wrong with you?

219
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:04,485
Tell her to come eat.

220
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:06,555
You do it.

221
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,494
- Goodness.
- Leave her be.

222
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:09,696
She'll come on her own.

223
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:14,025
Gosh, I just can't stand this.

224
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:15,935
I didn't care when I didn't know,

225
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,064
but now that I know, it's such a sight.

226
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:19,166
Know what? Share with us.

227
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:24,146
That you slept with Eun Joo?

228
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:25,406
Shall I share it with you?

229
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:28,844
Since when?
How long has this been going on?

230
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:30,675
- That's enough.
- The chair under the streetlamp...

231
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,345
is your special chair, isn't it?

232
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,356
I smashed it on my way in.

233
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,656
Why do you have so many secrets?

234
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:40,025
- What's with you two?
- What did you say...

235
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:41,855
you did to the chair?

236
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,656
I smashed it.

237
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:49,234
Get up.

238
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:50,795
Get up right now.

239
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,966
Come out. Now.

240
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,535
Let's go.

241
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:57,845
Get over here.

242
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,646
Go find it.

243
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:02,314
I don't care where it went!

244
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:03,415
Put it back.

245
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,545
What's going on?

246
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,555
Find the chair and put it back.

247
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:10,655
The chair?

248
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,455
Don't change the subject.

249
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,395
If you're ashamed of
your secret relationship,

250
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:17,226
just say so. This is ridiculous.

251
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,865
Why should I be ashamed?

252
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,695
- Why?
- What's going on between you two?

253
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:22,235
Just say it.

254
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,936
I like Chang Sup. Satisfied?

255
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:29,535
Don't make me laugh.
You're still covering for him.

256
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:31,544
Hey.

257
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:34,004
Put the chair back, or I won't let you in.

258
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:35,844
I won't go back. I won't live there.

259
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,685
Your betrayal struck me deep.

260
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:39,415
You shouldn't have done this.

261
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,456
You were like a mom to me.

262
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,785
Living in Seoul, I...

263
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:46,955
Look what you've done.

264
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,494
Who am I supposed to trust now?

265
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:49,726
Soo Ji.

266
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:06,045
What should I say first?

267
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,686
Right, let's start with the chair.

268
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,085
My mom put it there.

269
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,366
- Ma'am.
- Eun Joo.

270
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,405
What's all that?

271
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,706
No, it's okay. I'm strong.

272
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:35,834
Let's go in.

273
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:38,505
Go ahead. I'll wait until Seo Woo comes.

274
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,675
What's this chair?

275
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,844
Someone threw out a perfectly good chair,

276
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,515
so I brought it here.

277
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:49,456
It's dangerous at night,
so I'm going to sit here like this...

278
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:50,886
and stand guard.

279
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:07,565
Mom.

280
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,275
Seo Woo.

281
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:13,305
What's going on?

282
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:16,875
When did you come?

283
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:18,915
- A little while ago.
- Weren't you cold?

284
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,544
You should've waited inside.

285
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,585
I wanted to see you come.

286
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:35,196
Ma'am.

287
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:36,535
Mom.

288
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,564
Slow down. You might trip.

289
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:41,834
- When did you come?
- A little while ago.

290
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,205
- Ta-da.
- Gosh.

291
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,645
You didn't have to bring this.

292
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,244
- You like pickled thistle.
- Gosh.

293
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:48,445
Gosh. Seo Woo, hold this for a second.

294
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,446
When she came to Seoul,

295
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:53,116
she sat there and waited for me.

296
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:54,886
Under the streetlamp...

297
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:58,055
as if she was saying,
"There's someone here."

298
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:05,595
Do you know why my parents
have the same memorial date?

299
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:08,095
They passed away on the same day.

300
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:11,035
In a fire. Overnight.

301
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:13,965
Who would do such a thing?

302
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,235
Who?

303
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,416
Because it was dry and windy.

304
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:25,344
I'm currently near the scene
of the fire in Inseo-ri.

305
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:28,115
As you can see,
the buildings are still ablaze...

306
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:30,284
as if they had been bombed.

307
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:33,584
It seems the fire started
from the mountain...

308
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:35,926
that's around 1.8km from here.

309
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,765
- At that time...
- Seo Woo.

310
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:40,466
Are you okay?

311
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,995
Do you want to go to your house with me?

312
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,906
No.

313
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:49,706
I won't go.

314
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,946
I don't think I can.

315
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,275
Wait here. I'll get you some water.

316
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:02,554
Move swiftly.

317
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:03,754
Hurry.

318
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,926
About 50 people in the village...

319
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:10,455
To the inside.

320
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:13,765
(Village Welfare Hall)

321
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:19,335
Where I lived.

322
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,976
The yard. The rooms.

323
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,745
My parents.

324
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,545
They all disappeared overnight.

325
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:04,886
Seo Woo...

326
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:11,255
Seo Woo.

327
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:17,495
You poor thing.

328
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:39,216
Hello.

329
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:41,785
I'm Choi Soo Ji.

330
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,784
Hello, I'm Shi Yun.

331
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:46,126
- I'll bring that in.
- Thank you.

332
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:52,726
Seo Woo.

333
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,334
Hello, I'm Seo Woo's college friend.

334
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,106
Hello. I'll take that.

335
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:01,535
How old are you?

336
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:04,805
I'm a few years older than you.
You can consider me your sister.

337
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:06,745
You look more like my aunt.

338
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,115
You never told me that.

339
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:15,915
It's not like...

340
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,186
I could say, "My parents died
yesterday," as soon as you came.

341
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:22,255
There's more that I didn't tell you.

342
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:57,255
Seo Woo!

343
00:23:57,755 --> 00:23:59,825
Why didn't you get the bean sprouts?

344
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,465
I was getting the potatoes...

345
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:03,295
and you were getting the bean sprouts.

346
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:09,335
She says we have no soup.

347
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,845
You know I can't eat without soup.

348
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:14,915
You swore the food here was good.

349
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,075
How could you do this?

350
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:18,386
You are so irresponsible.

351
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:24,956
Irresponsible?

352
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:52,116
(Oral Medicine)

353
00:25:00,156 --> 00:25:02,926
I never left Seoul since.

354
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:05,095
I'll never go...

355
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:07,325
to Gangwon Province.

356
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:11,466
I have bad insomnia,

357
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,805
and I run right upstairs if I get scared.

358
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,244
What's wrong? Where are you going?

359
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:20,505
To her. She's coming here.

360
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,754
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

361
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,325
Go to sleep. Sleep. Sleep, okay?

362
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,995
What else did I not tell you?

363
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:45,565
I don't drink anymore since.

364
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:48,105
I stay on my toes...

365
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,335
and live a full life for my parents too.

366
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:55,146
I'm too scared that I'll
think bad thoughts if I drink.

367
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:58,984
What else did I not tell you?

368
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:00,716
- Hey.
- I couldn't...

369
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:02,886
tell you.

370
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:06,555
There's no other reason.

371
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,396
Same goes for Eun Joo too.
Be understanding.

372
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:28,446
You know where the chair is, right?

373
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,116
Would you tell me?

374
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:34,985
It's precious to me.

375
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:41,626
I should've brought it inside.

376
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,305
Why am I thinking of him now?

377
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,476
This is nice.

378
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:00,106
This is what a crush is all about.

379
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,176
Like a secret treasure.

380
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,824
(1 New Email)

381
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:19,125
About Misiryeong.

382
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:22,535
Seriously. He's so persistent.
What more does he want to know?

383
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:29,005
I stayed near your
hometown a long time ago.

384
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:32,145
This is a picture I had taken back then.

385
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:34,245
(This is a picture I had taken back then.)

386
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:46,985
Thank you.

387
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:53,126
Thank you for the photo.

388
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:58,366
I really wanted to see the town
from back when it was okay.

389
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:03,206
I should've gone in March...

390
00:28:04,106 --> 00:28:06,906
for my mom's birthday, but I couldn't.

391
00:28:07,976 --> 00:28:09,515
I regretted it so much.

392
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:15,416
I'll help you as much as you want
if you want to converse again.

393
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,055
Whenever you want.

394
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:26,896
Are you just leaving?

395
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:30,235
I have to go somewhere.

396
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:31,535
At this hour?

397
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,305
Of course. Goodnight.

398
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,616
Good morning.

399
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:47,446
You said you'd help whenever I want.

400
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:01,466
Let's begin.

401
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:13,906
See you tomorrow.

402
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:18,616
Goodness.

403
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:22,216
I stopped by on my way home from work.

404
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:26,285
You want to converse again?

405
00:29:29,295 --> 00:29:30,325
Ji Soo.

406
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,126
What took you so long?

407
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,465
I've been a bit busy, and...

408
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,995
Busy with what?

409
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:39,804
You have a lot of time to kill.

410
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,606
I'm busier than you think.

411
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:44,075
I have to work at the studio,

412
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:46,805
study mixing on my own,
go to the concert hall...

413
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:49,116
The concert hall?
I went up a few times too.

414
00:29:49,545 --> 00:29:50,844
Not for my own recital,

415
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:53,216
but for competitions and as an accompanist.

416
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:58,754
You must have looked pretty.

417
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,355
Everyone looks pretty
sitting at the piano...

418
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:02,726
in a dress.

419
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:04,726
I can't get used to this.

420
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,366
Your voice sounds so cheerful.

421
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:09,196
I like that, but...

422
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,866
Friendly, cheerful,

423
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:14,866
and curious about life.

424
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:16,835
That's how I usually am.

425
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:19,146
You're in the studio, right?

426
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:21,106
That's right.

427
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:24,616
I remember it clearly.

428
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:26,386
The window,

429
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,216
the cactus, the piano.

430
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:31,885
Did you put the picture I
gave you in the studio too?

431
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:33,126
It's in my room at home.

432
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,755
I used to keep it in my diary.

433
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:39,466
- Did you go recently...
- I don't go there.

434
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,035
Me neither.

435
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,106
I haven't gone since 2012.

436
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:50,606
I just couldn't.

437
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,406
- Are you...
- Are you...

438
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:24,235
You're okay, right?

439
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:36,555
Did you see the fire too?

440
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:39,255
No.

441
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,025
I heard about it the next day on the news.

442
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,095
The house that's half in your picture...

443
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:49,696
looked just like ours,
with radish leaves hanging to dry.

444
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:53,505
Our house stood out because we
always had classical music on.

445
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:59,244
My mom left the radio on whenever
she dried peppers and radish leaves.

446
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,575
On the classical music station.

447
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:03,676
She said the vegetables liked it.

448
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,284
She didn't know anything
about classical music,

449
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,716
but she said she could tell.

450
00:32:10,156 --> 00:32:11,515
True.

451
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:14,726
All the houses there looked the same.

452
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:22,196
We talked about Korea a lot
while we were in Norway.

453
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,206
We were curious and imagined it.

454
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,976
How it would smell,

455
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,706
how the air would taste.

456
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:38,315
Since every country has its own feel.

457
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,216
That town in the photo... Your town...

458
00:32:45,555 --> 00:32:48,055
It was exactly the town...

459
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:49,626
and the sky...

460
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:51,926
I had imagined.

461
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:56,436
It was peaceful and warm.

462
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:58,966
It felt like a town like that
would only exist in Korea.

463
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:01,835
It was nice.

464
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:10,175
I guess...

465
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:13,916
my town was peaceful back then.

466
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:19,456
How nice.

467
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:28,595
That's my bus.

468
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,206
Goodnight.

469
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:39,245
I'll take you home.

470
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:41,635
You should go. It's right there.

471
00:34:56,215 --> 00:34:58,115
Do you look down from here at times?

472
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:02,125
Seoul is hilly,

473
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:05,126
so isn't it lucky to live somewhere
where you can look down from?

474
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:10,896
Is that right?

475
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:15,276
Actually, I've said something similar.

476
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:19,976
I said something in passing before.

477
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,875
That if you're frustrated,
you should go somewhere high up,

478
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:26,884
like a mountain or even an
overpass, and look down.

479
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:30,614
You know, how when
astronauts return from space,

480
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,725
all the stresses of life dissipate.

481
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,356
The overview effect.

482
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,166
She did as I suggested.

483
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:42,995
She looked down.

484
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:47,765
Let's look at the picture again.

485
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,845
That's right. She looked down.

486
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:00,146
- It's obviously...
- From an overpass.

487
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:10,055
This building...

488
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:12,566
I can't quite make it out.

489
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:15,765
I'm sure I've seen it before.

490
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,526
Ji Soo.

491
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:51,265
Is it a coincidence that
Seo Woo is between us?

492
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:54,765
Knock, knock.

493
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:57,236
Knock.

494
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:01,606
Knock, knock.

495
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:07,046
Did you leave me a message too?

496
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,436
You should eat first.

497
00:37:24,796 --> 00:37:28,066
We're just going to go.
Take care of yourself.

498
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,776
What should we do about the deposit?

499
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:38,745
I'll transfer it to your account.

500
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:40,714
I'd appreciate that.

501
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,155
Why should you give her the deposit?

502
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:45,214
She's the one breaching the
contract by moving out early.

503
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:48,285
Does the lease say it's a
violation if the landlord dates?

504
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:53,425
Just send me half since
it's partly my fault too.

505
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,436
I'll do that.

506
00:37:57,436 --> 00:38:01,035
Shouldn't I call your mother?

507
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:05,845
You remind me of my grandma in Tongyeong.

508
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:10,375
She's stubborn,
insecure about being uneducated,

509
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:13,816
just gives and gives,
and picks on her daughters.

510
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:18,785
Even my mom doesn't do that.
You're such a granny.

511
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:21,324
What 35-year-old does
that in this day and age?

512
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:24,154
Eun Joo, you're only 35.

513
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:27,526
You're young. You have your whole
life ahead of you. Be confident.

514
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:30,836
Don't let others boss you around.

515
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:34,365
Thanks for your concern.
Do you have a place...

516
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,236
to stay?

517
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:40,545
If you're leaving because you're
mad, find a new place first.

518
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:42,614
If I don't leave when I'm
mad, when would I leave?

519
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:45,376
Hey, you. You look down on Eun
Joo, don't you?

520
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:46,884
Don't take it out on her.

521
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:51,186
You. If you bail on her after dating
her, I'll kill you.

522
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:02,435
She's such a drama queen.

523
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:05,634
How did we betray her?
Why is this life-and-death for her?

524
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,365
Stop it.

525
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:21,014
It's out in the open now,
so why don't you two get married?

526
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:23,284
I don't have the money for that.

527
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:25,014
Then just register your marriage.

528
00:39:25,015 --> 00:39:27,486
We've been dating for less than six months.

529
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:31,626
This isn't our newlywed home.
It's a homestay.

530
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,525
Think before you talk.

531
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:34,965
I'm off to work.

532
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,506
Why are you going there?

533
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:49,876
To clean.

534
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:58,256
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

535
00:39:58,285 --> 00:40:00,526
Here's D2, which we finished testing.

536
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:06,626
We said we wouldn't attend
the developer conference.

537
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:08,726
Team R2 is in the middle of their test.

538
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:21,706
You posted a comment to R2.

539
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:24,375
Why did you do that? They're going crazy.

540
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,245
If it has the same character,

541
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:29,215
the device will hide the same
thing the patient wants to hide.

542
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:31,714
We'll have to test it on the patients.

543
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:33,985
- Okay.
- Narrow it down...

544
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:37,155
to those who consented to the
test among those using our data.

545
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:38,756
Okay.

546
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:40,965
Let's get to it then.

547
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:43,296
- Show it to me.
- Show what?

548
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:48,305
You must have tested it
already on someone you know.

549
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,675
It was probably one of you.

550
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:55,075
Whom did you use for the prototype?

551
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:58,715
Your character and voice.

552
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:01,815
I want to see that
incredible device with you.

553
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:04,255
I'll show you as soon as
we have the test version.

554
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,924
- It's you.
- We're going to do it now.

555
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,086
Now.

556
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:10,655
Sure. You don't have one.

557
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:13,095
It would be dangerous if you did.

558
00:41:13,526 --> 00:41:15,264
No. Even if you made it,

559
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,341
you would've gotten rid of it
after trying it a few times.

560
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:18,666
Of course.

561
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:20,135
And you should.

562
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:23,135
Yes, you should. I mean,

563
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:25,804
our hospital would be in trouble
if your brain were to get hacked.

564
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:29,316
Drink this.
You should drink it as you speak.

565
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,415
I'm going crazy between working
with you and my hospital work.

566
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,514
Don't go crazy on us.

567
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:36,055
Anyway, what's the program called?

568
00:41:38,555 --> 00:41:41,026
- The D-Program.
- D? As in, A, B, C, D?

569
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:43,425
- That.
- I see.

570
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:46,296
But that's not a "D".

571
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:50,095
I said to draw her home,
and she drew a moon. A half-moon.

572
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:52,865
She's totally fine.

573
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,865
She just sits there and smiles.

574
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:57,436
She never talks about her problems.

575
00:41:58,776 --> 00:41:59,944
She came here...

576
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:02,226
because she heard about us
from your consultation system.

577
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:04,715
Her daughter's final wishes.

578
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:14,726
When a woman hits the age of 50,

579
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:16,396
pomegranates are good.

580
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:18,995
Pomegranates are the best for menopause.

581
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:22,534
If it's too hard to eat,

582
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:25,836
you can grind up beets, carrots,
or apples, and eat that.

583
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:30,776
Did you go shopping yourself?

584
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:33,445
Yes. It was so nice out today,

585
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:35,305
I took a two-hour walk.

586
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:39,015
- Am I doing this right?
- Yes.

587
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:42,486
Come in.

588
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:45,514
Doctor, the director wants to see you.

589
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:47,924
Okay. Min Jung, I'll be right back.

590
00:42:47,925 --> 00:42:48,925
Okay.

591
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:41,006
Why isn't she calling? That brat.

592
00:43:58,925 --> 00:44:00,026
My gosh.

593
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,166
Stay right there, okay?

594
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:06,606
Oh my gosh.

595
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:11,075
Yes.

596
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,245
I think I caught a cold.

597
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,015
I came home early.

598
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:19,986
Chang Sup.

599
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,186
Hey. What's wrong?

600
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:28,956
Hey. Hold on. Hey.

601
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:35,995
Eun Joo.

602
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,135
Just a minute.

603
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:44,106
Just a minute.

604
00:45:10,365 --> 00:45:11,695
I was given this address.

605
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:17,836
The room.

606
00:45:19,905 --> 00:45:21,805
The room. This way.

607
00:45:35,995 --> 00:45:38,396
There's no cohesive style.

608
00:45:41,226 --> 00:45:43,035
It's all hodge-podge.

609
00:45:48,865 --> 00:45:50,605
There's nothing decent to wear.

610
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:52,706
What did the owner wear
and where did she go?

611
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:54,744
She went on a date.

612
00:45:54,745 --> 00:45:56,575
I guess everyone but me is enjoying life.

613
00:46:09,995 --> 00:46:13,095
Why did two people move
out at the same time?

614
00:46:14,726 --> 00:46:16,396
No particular reason.

615
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,135
I guess something did happen.

616
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:25,215
Give me the room at the
end if I decide to move in.

617
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:36,015
Did you make your decision?

618
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:40,555
The landlord went out on a
date and left the house empty.

619
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,985
I didn't get to see her.

620
00:46:41,986 --> 00:46:44,525
Can't a landlord go on dates?

621
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:45,965
What is her name?

622
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:48,026
I'll tell you if you move in.

623
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:51,635
- Do you eat breakfast?
- How old is she?

624
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:53,505
34.

625
00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:57,006
No. She was 34 last year, so she's 35 now.

626
00:46:57,675 --> 00:46:58,736
She's 35.

627
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:01,405
Her cooking is amazing.

628
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:03,574
Her mom passed the homestay down to her,

629
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:06,086
so she has a sense of duty,
and she can't stand clutter.

630
00:47:06,445 --> 00:47:07,615
She's clean,

631
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:10,385
and she's surprisingly naive.

632
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:13,256
She laughs so hard when she cracks up.

633
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:15,995
She isn't negative at all.
Everything rolls off her back.

634
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:19,126
So she's dense. Enjoy your date.

635
00:47:27,405 --> 00:47:28,465
Over here.

636
00:47:47,186 --> 00:47:48,426
She went to check out the room.

637
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:50,495
I set it up.

638
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:53,924
What if Soo Ji comes back?

639
00:47:53,925 --> 00:47:56,166
She won't. Don't take her
back even if she does.

640
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:04,836
It feels different seeing you outside.

641
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,574
I know. Why did you want to meet outside?
What a waste of money.

642
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:11,645
We only see each other at home.

643
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:13,515
We should eat other people's food too.

644
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:15,816
What's wrong with being home?

645
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,416
Seeing you here,

646
00:48:18,785 --> 00:48:20,885
I feel like I ran into
my mom at a restaurant.

647
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,026
You know,

648
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:30,994
what you said is incredibly offensive.

649
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:34,305
No, no. I meant you're comfortable.
I didn't mean anything bad.

650
00:48:34,736 --> 00:48:35,904
If I see my mom outside...

651
00:48:35,905 --> 00:48:37,825
after only seeing her at
home, it feels awkward.

652
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:42,245
Someone you're comfortable with
suddenly feels awkward to be with.

653
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:47,845
- Eat up.
- Okay.

654
00:48:57,526 --> 00:48:59,595
(Your mail has been sent.)

655
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:04,296
I'm going to look for the overpass.

656
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,606
Are you going to search all of Seoul?

657
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,416
No, it may be in Gyeonggi-do.

658
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:18,944
Should I ask Ji Soo?

659
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:20,086
(Should I ask Ji Soo?)

(Before Dawn)

669
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:09,094
Listen to the project
presentation for 15 minutes,

670
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:10,534
10 minutes on the 5th floor,

671
00:50:10,535 --> 00:50:13,006
then 35 minutes next door.

672
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,134
Our schedules are the
same up to that point.

673
00:50:15,135 --> 00:50:16,736
- Then you...
- I'm free.

674
00:50:17,106 --> 00:50:18,236
Free of what?

675
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:20,706
Why didn't I think of that?

676
00:50:21,646 --> 00:50:22,646
Of what?

677
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:27,515
(Studio)

678
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:30,555
It's near the studio.

679
00:50:37,756 --> 00:50:39,825
Why are they closed already?

680
00:50:42,066 --> 00:50:43,095
Darn it.

681
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:45,436
Oh my gosh.

682
00:50:46,606 --> 00:50:47,805
Hello.

683
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:50,805
They usually stay open until 10, but...

684
00:50:52,006 --> 00:50:53,546
That was a eucalyptus plant.

685
00:50:56,675 --> 00:50:58,316
I heard you asked for the name.

686
00:50:58,715 --> 00:51:01,845
What you bought that time
was a eucalyptus plant.

687
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:05,285
The gift you got for your wife.

688
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,385
Do you want to get another one?

689
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:11,226
Sure.

690
00:51:11,227 --> 00:51:13,594
It's better if you get the same kind.

691
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:16,095
Your wife knows her stuff.

692
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:21,905
What's his problem?

693
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:15,955
If I could apologize...

694
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:16,956
To whom?

695
00:52:16,957 --> 00:52:18,856
What if I could apologize to Won?

696
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:23,736
You don't keep in touch with him.

697
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:15,364

00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:42,621
There's an overpass near the
studio, isn't there?

702
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,669
Well... I think there was
one if you walk a bit.

703
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,440
There is one. I'm going to go there.

704
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:52,411
Now?

705
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:54,210
I'm on my way now.

706
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,281
Let me know if you find it.

707
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,610
I will.

708
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:43,980
How did you live without
knowing about this love?

709
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:52,750
He loves you so desperately.

710
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,851
How did you get in?

711
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:02,690
You always leave the gate open.
Close it properly. It's dangerous.

712
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,590
Did you find the overpass?

713
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,031
She went to the overpass after she met
you, then the airport.

714
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:16,701
I wonder what she was
thinking when she was there.

715
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,610
So that's why you look down.

716
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,810
I thought you'd be happy
once you found the overpass.

717
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:31,520
It's nice to learn something
more about the person you like.

718
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:41,060
Do you not need me to converse with her?

719
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:45,071
I do.

720
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,340
She won't know where we are if we use this.

721
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:02,121
Ji Soo.

722
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:05,390
You must be having a good day.

723
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:07,520
I can tell from your voice.

724
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,531
A good day?

725
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:15,230
Not particularly.

726
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:17,000
Where are you?

727
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:19,930
Home. I'm home.

728
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,701
You must be using earphones.

729
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,440
That's right. Is it different?

730
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,411
It feels like we're talking on the phone.

731
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,081
Do you see Won regularly?

732
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,020
Well... Now and then.

733
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,649
Here and there.

734
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:38,891
Does he know?

735
00:59:40,051 --> 00:59:41,519
What?

736
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,959
You were talking about Won in the studio...

737
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,661
when you drew me out.

738
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,571
We were talking about
Misiryeong back then, remember?

739
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,971
No, we weren't. I guess Won doesn't know...

740
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,940
that you like him.

741
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,960
Hey.

742
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:20,360
You shouldn't talk about
things like that so simply.

743
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,931
- Let's stop...
- You said you liked seeing him.

744
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,201
To be more precise, it's unrequited love.

745
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:41,321
That's because...
I was a bit emotional that day.

746
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,570
Do you not feel that way anymore?

747
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,460
Well...

748
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:04,310
I like him.

749
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,980
I really like looking at him.

750
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,451
The way he cherishes you,
the way he misses you,

751
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,951
the way a person gives his
all for another person...

752
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:22,690
I like it all.

753
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,790
Won doesn't know how you feel, does he?

754
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:29,761
No.

755
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:32,670
I don't want him to know.

756
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,571
You had no idea how much
he cherished you either.

757
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,520
I hope...

758
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,391
he won't know either.

759
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:18,310

(A Piece of Your Mind)

762
01:03:49,641 --> 01:03:51,340
What do you mean, you like looking at me?

763
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,109
- I'm fine with how things are now.
- I'll say I don't know.

764
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,880
Don't do anything. Not a thing.

765
01:03:57,551 --> 01:03:58,850
Did I do something wrong?

766
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:00,150
Whom are you seeing?

767
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,280
You shouldn't know...

768
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,649
if she didn't tell you.

769
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,920
Let's stop.

770
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:07,960
You should've stopped long ago.

771
01:04:09,321 --> 01:04:10,420
Call me.

772
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,331
I like you to make myself happy.

773
01:04:13,931 --> 01:04:15,400
I'm very different from you.
