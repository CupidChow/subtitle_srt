00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,660
No relationships are the same.

188
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,880
Relationships are diverse.

189
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,280
People are different. Of course relationships are different too.

190
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,710
We have our own style.

191
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,520
Why be like anyone else?

192
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,350
There are so many people with underground love.

193
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,540
Three, four, five…

194
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,330
A leaf,

195
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,320
silently,

196
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,970
su…suddenly…

197
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,890
The universe puts its hand

198
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,630
On me.

199
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,450
Is very...

200
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,100
Sister,

201
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,080
No contact, no meeting.

202
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
And didn't even think about meeting.

203
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,560
Living ten years like a stranger,

204
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,830
is there sadder thing like this?

205
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,980
Oh, my god. Is there anyone else like that?

206
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,300
Yes.

207
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,490
There are?

208
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,060
It's rare.

209
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,110
Very are.

210
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,380
So hot!

211
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,240
Mr. Jiang,

212
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,770
Is the studio free?

213
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,540
Yeah it is.

214
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm going to use it. Ten minutes.

215
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,800
Oh that…

216
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
If I can apologize.

217
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,840
To whom?

218
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,630
If I can apologize to Won.

219
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,450
If I could make a phone call…

220
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,100
I told you, no need to apologize.

221
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,890
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,990
No it doesn't matter.

223
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,610
You're Korean?

224
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,150
You never answered me,

225
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,830
I thought you weren't Korean.

226
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,390
The performance was wonderful.

227
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,960
What did you hear?

228
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,010
What's the matter?

229
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,330
I seem to hear something.

230
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,740
Can I upload this to the website?

231
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,030
Yes.

232
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,810
This is that.

233
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,730
If you're tagged @，

234
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,890
no text,

235
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,690
you can upload 7 daily black and white photos.

236
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,170
Have you received @?

237
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,040
Is this it?

238
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,470
The last one is the daily routine of Seowoo.

239
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,010
Where is this?

240
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,260
Is this Seoul?

241
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,540
This is…

242
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,470
Hawon.

243
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,590
[Eunjoo Hotel]

244
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,740
I heard Changseop entered AH.

245
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,530
That's great!

246
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,630
Our classmates, except you and me,

247
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,030
They are all very capable.

248
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,690
Dealing with masters

249
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,620
like  Hawon and Kim Hoon.

250
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,870
Deal how?

251
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,060
I hear they haven't met each other.

252
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,760
It is said that there is a secret research office in the forest.

253
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,930
Isn't that cool?

254
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,100
That's a rumor, too.

255
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,510
Nobody knows where is taekwondo V done.

256
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,880
I was going to have the cabbage soup.

257
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,030
So refreshing!

258
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,680
Where the hell is he?

259
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,150
Could he be at someone else's door,

260
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,750
sitting there straving.

261
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,260
Hello, Hawon.

262
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,440
You left without telling me.

263
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,510
Do you know how worried I was?

264
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,870
That's messed up.

265
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,520
What the hell?

266
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,060
There is no food at all!

267
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,590
There is bread

268
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,330
in the freezer.

269
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,990
I told you, it's fine.

270
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,480
I'll just eat this.

271
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,250
The design of AMI is here.

272
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,990
Final review is under way.

273
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,680
Step function is being

274
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,400
Cross-checked according to the index.

275
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,450
If you need help during the confirming process,

276
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,150
may I help you?

277
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,800
Well sure.

278
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,230
I'll give you the information.

279
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,480
Is Kim Jisoo here?

280
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,450
Not yet.

281
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,080
If I can communicate with her,

282
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,730
Maybe a solution can be found.

283
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,520
Are you wondering if you're in her plan?

284
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,940
I'm not.

285
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,840
That'll be later.

286
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,120
I just want to hear from her now.

287
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,470
Take it out and throw it away.

288
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,700
You're home early.

289
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,690
Why throw things away when they're good?

290
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,650
Look at you. So shabby.

291
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,840
Shall I buy it for you?

292
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,870
Do you realize that today is mother's birthday?

293
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,690
Oh yeah.

294
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,690
Call her now.

295
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,110
Sister, how can you remember all this?

296
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,250
I just can.

297
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,940
What can I do? I just remember these things.

298
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,350
Maybe you love me too much.

299
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,930
I get paid. I do my job.

300
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,830
Come inside.  it's cold out.

301
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,610
Got it.

302
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,090
Take it off and I'll iron it for you.

303
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,230
Well, you worked so hard to get into that company,

304
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,130
and you still look so sloppy.

305
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,700
Don't be sloppy.

306
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,500
You're the star in the family.

307
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,590
Mom,

308
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,250
Happy birthday!

309
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,430
Don't dress sloppily.

310
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,150
You're the star in the family.

311
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,840
Sister, thank you.

312
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,170
You were drinking.

313
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,140
Hey, where are you going?

314
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,710
My sister will punish me later.

315
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,270
Running away from home,

316
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,230
it's crazy!

317
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,700
Hurry and take it away!

318
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,250
I told you to take it away!

319
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,880
To avoid making folds,

320
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,860
I kept this gesture all the way on the bus.

321
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,280
Hurry.

322
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,800
Fool, you chose to do the work.

323
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,210
You forgot to take the uniform.

324
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,900
Eunjoo was so sad.

325
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,790
There should be the dry walleye pollack soup.

326
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,320
Do you know what that means?

327
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,890
Do you know the truth?

328
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,990
There was the dry walleye pollack soup

329
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,070
the day after Changseob drank.

330
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,770
She changed the recipe, so you were mad.

331
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,920
I’m speechless.

332
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,060
There was something else.

333
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,180
You know?

334
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,210
Changseob and Eunjoo are real?

335
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,620
Just leave it alone. Pretend you know nothing.

336
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,530
They just started dating.

337
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,120
Got betrayed again.

338
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,390
The combination of DNA and medicine

339
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,800
with AI and big data

340
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,470
marks the start of WebMed.

341
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,850
The WebMed is a diagnostic program

342
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,660
which can separate the personal experience

343
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,300
into medical record and personal history

344
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,620
and model the psychology.

345
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,020
Kim Hoon.

346
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,590
Following the perfect individual information protection laws.

347
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,300
What does Mr. Early Morning do?

348
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,570
This is a flow-process diagram.

349
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,360
Record some words of Kim Jisoo.

350
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,820
Record other people’s words because of missing.

351
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,730
Can you understand this?

352
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,790
No matter keeping the photos or audios,

353
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,980
I see no differences.

354
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,060
Audios.

355
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,570
Personal experience.

356
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,200
And Hawon could be Moon Hawon.

357
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,130
This is not only about audio.

358
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,230
Who are you?

359
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,160
Introduce yourself first.

360
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,070
Then I will explain our relationship.

361
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,890
Where are you?

362
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,910
Look for me.

363
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,110
Are you going to the studio?

364
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,280
Is that true?

365
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,300
I mean is that true?

366
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,550
It’s Hawon who told me to look for him.

367
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,440
But Hawon was not there, not there.

368
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,220
But it can speak like Hawon

369
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,830
and in his voice.

370
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,600
Tell me it’s not true.

371
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,240
Because you are Moon Hawon.

372
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,380
Because you have the same reason.

373
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,900
So you want the audio of Kim Jisoo, right?

374
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,440
Taxi.

375
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,930
So...

376
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,650
It’s me.

377
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,540
How are you doing now?

378
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,020
Do you remember that coffee shop?

379
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,630
I put flowers there.

380
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,070
Searching... how are you and coffee shop.

381
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,070
Only the audio is Kim Jisoo.

382
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,500
We use it to make conversations.

383
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,360
We will input the audio

384
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,550
after we digitalized Kim Jisoo’s personal experience.

385
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,720
What are you imagining?

386
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,020
To communicate with the real Kim Jisoo.

387
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
What?

388
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,730
I thought there were some installations,

389
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,070
like monitor or something.

390
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,430
There isn’t even gas here.

391
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,420
Isn’t it cold?

392
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,110
It’s cold.

393
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,980
So we are going to stay like this?

394
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,380
So cold.

395
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,510
I need to buy a stove.

396
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,270
Just need to connect the gas.

397
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,260
Call them and they will come.

398
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,560
Okay.

399
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,770
This is the safest place.

400
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,400
No one knows here.

401
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,080
Can you tell what happened the last time you saw her?

402
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,420
She came to the studio before she went to the airport.

403
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,269
After she missed Hawon, she was mad at me

404
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:09,439
and she yelled at me.

405
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,140
Maybe she felt sorry.

406
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,800
There’s no way that Jisoo would yell.

407
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,840
At least not that kind of yelling.

408
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,189
The voice was just louder than usual.

409
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,150
I was trying hard to tell you these things.

410
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,570
I heard she called you at last.

411
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,370
That...

412
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,100
I am scared.

413
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,000
Would you like something to drink?

414
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,170
But I only have water and coffee.

415
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,810
How can you live by drinking this?

416
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,000
You should eat something nice when you are in bad condition.

417
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,820
You are not well, right?

418
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:02,020
If...we meet because of you,

419
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,630
what would she say to me?

420
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,660
If...even there is no if...

421
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,620
If because of my meddling,

422
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,750
you met each other.

423
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,070
Maybe she’d tell you about her misery.

424
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,200
Then she’d feel relaxed and not go to the airport.

425
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,100
About the bowls.

426
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,410
How about the bowls?

427
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,700
What do you have in the bowls? Is it yummy?

428
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,790
She also showed off about how beautiful the bowls were.

429
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:05,540
Then...why have Han Seowoo buy the bowls?

430
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,270
You are a pretty good judge of man. She said that.

431
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,820
It seems I should care the bowls well.

432
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,520
She told me when she was in Norway

433
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,670
that she felt lucky there.

434
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,570
When she was there, she realized that

435
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,380
there was no need to live so hard.

436
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,740
She felt a sense of relief.

437
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,130
She said it was the road that you strolled on together.

438
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,650
Na

439
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,860
Nia

440
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,930
Ne

441
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,970
Nie

442
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,050
No

443
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,950
Nio

444
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,450
Nu

445
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,880
Ga

446
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,110
Gia

447
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,450
Ge

448
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,630
Gie

449
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,770
Go

450
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,150
Gio

451
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:11,330
She said she was happy.

452
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,380
She could live happily.

453
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,600
Jisoo, I only tell him this much.

454
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,210
Why is the weather so bad?

455
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,600
So dark like a night.

456
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,830
The weather was affected by trough.

457
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,140
There will be clouds and scattered showers.

458
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,830
Jisoo.

459
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,530
Yes, I am Kim Jisoo.

460
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,660
Name your demands please.

461
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,940
Would you like to take it?

462
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,210
I can change the audio if you are scared.

463
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,450
It’s okay.

464
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,060
There are no earphones because it is still tested.

465
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,650
You can use wired headsets.

466
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,290
When Jisoo went to the studio the last time...

467
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:29,960
Again....

468
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,870
No, did she take anything?

469
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,480
There was something in the studio.

470
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,210
How? I forgot.

471
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,760
What should I do?

472
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,160
[This is a photo of Arrow Ridge taken in 2012.
From then on, I always take it.
I’m glad to give this to Seowoo.
Hope you keep it well.]

473
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,210
This is a picture of Mi Hwa Ryeong taken in 2012.

474
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,120
I’ve been carrying it with me.

475
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,210
I’m happy to give this picture to you.

476
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,830
Hope you’ll keep it well.

477
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,480
Mi Hwa Ryeong.

478
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,000
Year 2012.

479
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,840
Jisoo, I’ve received the two gifts.

480
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,800
The picture and the flower pot.

481
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,530
I’m doing fine.

482
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,450
Seowoo, you are strong!

483
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,290
It’s no big deal!

484
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,450
I’ve been recognized for all sorts of reasons.

485
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,420
In addition,

486
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,200
many interesting things happened.

487
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,040
I only want to share interesting stories with you,

488
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,160
so I search so hard to find interesting things

489
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,370
in my life.

490
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,950
The most interesting thing happened recently is…

491
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,560
I’ll tell you next time.

492
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,080
What would it be like if I’ve known Jisoo

493
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,660
for a longer time.

494
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,240
Though it’s hard to get to know each other now,

495
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,160
we can always do it later.

496
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,730
Sure.

497
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,300
Do you know this place?

498
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,980
It’s here!

499
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,200
I was standing here back then,

500
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,720
and Jisoo walked toward me from there.

501
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,550
Where’s your home?

502
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,460
Why do you ask?

503
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,030
So that I can find Jisoo’s location.

504
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,310
Come on!

505
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,880
Why are you so curious?

506
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,200
Right, I really am.

507
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,480
Can you see the chair under the street lamp?

508
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,270
Turn left from there and the first house in the corner.

509
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,730
It’s a semi-basement.

510
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,270
[Hotel]

511
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,070
She passed by.

512
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,590
Well… Why would I hide?

513
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,800
Your unconsciousness told  your body acted like that.

514
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:25,980
Here.

515
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,420
I took the picture on my way home after meeting you.

516
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,960
What did she wear?

517
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,120
Why are you asking that?

518
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,120
Well, I’m just curious.

519
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,280
A dress-like coat and knee-high boots.

520
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,010
Jisoo always wears boots.

521
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,560
She also had a pair of brown leather gloves on, though it was not cold.

522
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,320
Maybe just in case that her hands become slippery.

523
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,510
How come you are curious about everything?

524
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,210
This is my way of thinking of her.

525
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,050
Jisoo,

526
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:17,510
he’s curious everything about you.

527
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:25,180
I miss you, I love you, I like you…

528
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,710
These words were all included

529
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,340
in that thing this guy said,

530
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,550
“I’m curious about you. “

531
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,440
Will you come here?

532
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,380
Next to you?

533
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,090
It’s coming out.

534
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,590
That’s it.

535
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,790
Right, this is it.

536
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,580
I’ve seen it when I was little.

537
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,200
I don’t know what it is.

538
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,860
I only want to tell you

539
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,590
that I like to watch him.

540
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,900
I wanna be where you’ve been.

541
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,210
I wanna hear what you’ve heard.

542
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,570
I wanna feel the person that you’ve felt.

543
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,770
I really enjoy

544
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,520
watching him by his side.

545
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,380
I’m so attracted to

546
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,870
this guy who’s curious about you.

547
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,390
What should I call this?

548
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,430
A secret crush.

549
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,330
What did you say?

550
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,790
You have a secret crush.

551
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,900
Secret rush.

552
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,510
What did you say?

553
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,230
You have a secret crush.

554
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,740
You really don’t have other options?

555
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,280
Can’t believe you have a crush on the guy who misses me.

556
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,330
Han Seowoo, how pathetic you are.

557
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,720
What’s wrong?

558
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, who’s this little guy?

559
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,900
Oh no, it’s dying.

560
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,620
It’s dead?

561
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,510
The blue gum is dead?

562
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,470
No.

563
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:14,850
What?

564
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,590
I mean, that blue gum …

565
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,690
Right, our little plant is dying.

566
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,300
It’s really hard to tend.

567
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,600
Can I water it now?

568
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,010
You should’ve done it earlier.

569
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,130
Please save it!

570
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,350
What are you talking about?

571
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,690
Please save it.

572
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,620
So strong.

573
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,900
Now,

574
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,830
this is how it smells.

575
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,210
So nice.

576
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,170
You know if it’s dead by touching it?

577
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,200
Sure.

578
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,480
Water it, now.

579
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,530
It’s been crying.

580
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,030
Starving and thirsty.

581
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,500
That’s how it feels right now.

582
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,920
So miserable.

583
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,720
What can we do? Let’s save it.

584
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,430
When did you get it?

585
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,580
How come I’ve never seen it before?

586
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,770
It’s a gift.

587
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,330
But I forgot about it.

588
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,540
What should I do?

589
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,150
Okay, then let’s save it.

590
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,320
Is it possible to save it?

591
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,730
This is the way they are.

592
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,870
A little care can bring them back alive.

593
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,280
They always make your efforts worth.

594
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,300
That’s why I like them.

595
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,030
I’ll just have to try my best.

596
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,290
Wait.

597
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,000
It was just a gentle pat.

598
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,090
Jisoo is seeking for help

599
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,750
to save that.. that blue gum.

600
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,100
So,

601
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,620
you lent it to me

602
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,400
so that I could keep talking to it.

603
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,860
I called it out.

604
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,800
I didn’t expect that…

605
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,760
You didn’t know that I’d carry it around

606
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,090
and talk all the time.

607
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,120
Think again,

608
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,560
what did you say that made Jisoo come out?

609
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,350
I really talked to Jisoo, right?

610
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,130
Is that true?

611
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,560
Where and under what circumstances?

612
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,270
Could you be specific?

613
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:30,850
Like your conversation…

614
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,570
Is… Is it that thing?

615
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,700
It’s not Kim Jisoo.

616
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,950
It’s just a device

617
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,410
that imitates Kim Jisoo.

618
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,320
Why… Why would this thing be invented?

619
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,700
There are many uses.

620
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,940
It can communicate with people who have mental problems.

621
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,040
It can prevent Alzheimer’s disease.

622
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,500
It also can talk to the people who want to accept the treatment

623
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,950
around the clock.

624
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,670
All for the purpose of treatment.

625
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,900
Who can this cure?

626
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,470
It’s just a kind of test

627
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:04,430
and at least it’s good for me.

628
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,540
Where… Where did you answer it?

629
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,130
In the studio.

630
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,700
This is a crush.

631
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,700
Well…What did I say?

632
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:22,800
Can’t remember.

633
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,500
Forgot that…

634
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,220
Here,

635
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,610
just use your hand

636
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,350
and feel the pulse there.

637
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,610
Try to concentrate,

638
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,240
It’s not a crush.

639
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,380
It’s not …

640
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,510
Why do you want to know this?

641
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,600
This is SAnode principle,

642
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,120
namely heart rhythm principle.

643
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,200
Everything can be called by a single point.

644
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,930
A decisive piece

645
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,930
brings Jisoo together.

646
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,340
Just keep talking.

647
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,860
It will find itself,

648
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,800
which we call it reaction point.

649
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,270
What’s that?

650
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:29,620
What you had said… Just state the situation.

651
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,410
I can guess.

652
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,910
I said lots of things in the studio

653
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:36,850
and then it made some noise.

654
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,140
What’s the meaning?

655
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,500
All kinds of things.

656
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,520
My own business, words in my heart.

657
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,350
It’s my secret.

658
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,720
From which side?

659
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,480
Things belonging to Jisoo and I

660
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,830
continue…

661
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,220
I just can’t help…

662
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,440
I like to keep my eye on him.

663
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,460
I just…just can’t help to

664
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,500
deeply infatuated by him.

665
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,640
A man who is curious about you.

666
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,560
That’s a crush

667
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,690
indeed.

668
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:20,140
You just can’t help…

669
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,760
So you just…

670
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,780
And then you just…

671
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,530
What’s more?

672
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,320
That’s all.

673
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,130
It gives a positive diagnosis.

674
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,420
That’s all

675
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,880
Only three words?

676
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,280
The weather.

677
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,890
Very common.

678
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,580
Ah… You wrote it down.

679
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,180
Why?

680
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,410
No need to know so much.

681
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,650
Our purpose is to meet Jisoo.

682
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,560
I’m worried about it’s because of me.

683
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,050
As for me…

684
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,920
Jisoo is the one.

685
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,390
By thunder and lightning.

686
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,770
At 4 p.m.,

687
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,440
It’s day, but it’s dark.

688
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,910
Oslo, Norway

689
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,270
School woods,

690
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,890
Dark afternoon.

691
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:12,660
Remember it?

692
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,260
Jisoo was so scared,

693
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,490
I’m not sure if I will be…

694
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,020
the reason for her.

695
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,850
Is Hawon a word?

696
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,660
Lightning is for Kim Jisoo.

697
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,660
Can you understand?

698
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,310
We grew up together so I know it.

699
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,320
Nobody else.

700
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,900
What you said accidentally may involve me.

701
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,050
Tell me what you said.

702
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,340
I can parse it out.

703
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,540
Well…

704
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,560
If you are the man,

705
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,690
Then just confirm this point.

706
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,610
You will forget it?

707
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:18,970
Why should I forget it?

708
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,390
Jisoo,

709
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,070
her feelings,

710
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,890
Personality…

711
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,350
To meet her.

712
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,270
Absolutely not.

713
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,460
It will not appear.

714
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:31,800
It’s me.

715
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,080
Knock, knock, knock…

716
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,860
Knock, knock…

717
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,630
Knock…

718
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,730
Seowoo, you alone?

719
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,660
Where is the Eucalyptus globulus?

720
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,760
Can it relive?

721
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,640
Sure, it will.

722
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,370
No furniture there?

723
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,210
How come?

724
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,410
By echo.

725
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,480
The echo in the open space.

726
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,010
I just come early.

727
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,040
Yeah, it’s a bit empty.

728
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,630
Jisoo, your voice is much brighter.

729
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,540
Very different.

730
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,200
I was always cheerful.

731
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,950
I love stay in the studio.

732
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,780
The sound there is also very warm.

733
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,060
A good place for telling secrets.

734
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,640
I love your story.

735
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,130
My story?

736
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,830
Oh, my phone is ringing?

737
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,200
Someone is calling me.

738
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,920
I’ll talk to you next time.

739
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,130
The story of Arrow Ridge.

740
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,140
Everyone makes mistakes,

741
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,290
as well as the nature.

742
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:55,710
My parents encountered a hill fire accident.

743
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,540
I don’t mean to mention this.

744
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,830
Because I don't know what I should blame.

745
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,180
It was painful for a while.

746
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:19,410
The days only I survived.

747
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,610
It’s so painful.

748
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,180
I’m just trying to live now.

749
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,700
It’s my mother’s favorite season.

750
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,930
It’s my father’s pleased afternoon.

751
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,370
Cherish life…

752
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,700
Nature can make mistakes.

753
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,470
It’s OK. Nothing.

754
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,710
Why did you suddenly mention this?

755
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:20,840
You said it last time.

756
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,930
You said I met Won before.

757
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,240
Yeah.

758
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,440
You’re right.

759
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,170
I know him.

760
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:33,380
He is Mr. Early Morning.

761
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,470
I just feel it’s like him.

762
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,480
And then?

763
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,740
Do you want to…

764
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,440
talk with Hawon?

765
01:00:55,464 --> 01:01:05,464
