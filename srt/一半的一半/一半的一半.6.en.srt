Relief supplies, medicine and food,
10 boxes each?

00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,256
Okay. Hurry up and tell me.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,896
I'm busy. I have to go catch someone.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,836
This person was all crazy about using the
recording studio, but he never showed up.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,286
He doesn't even answer his
phone! I have to find him for sure.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,656
Yes. Okay. That's it?

So, when are you coming back, Grandma?

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,006
Do you like it there that much?
You like it better than me?

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,090
How could you be like that?

14

<i>She's old now but still
travels around all the time.</i>

<i>You try and say something!
She listens to you.</i>

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,896
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,766
Okay. I'll try and talk to her.

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,836
Don't worry.

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,903
Why do you have no energy?

20
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:01,484
I'll send you an email
of what grandma needs.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,706
It's so loud! Where are you?

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,316
Outside.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,696
<i>Outside where?</i>

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,596
You know where you're roaming about right?

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,180
Don't space out and go somewhere weird.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,130
Soon Ho.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,176
Why is it so hard?

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,136
You never say things like that.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,180
Han Seo Woo! Where were you?

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,166
<i>I didn't see you there.
Anyway, Kang In Wook is not here.</i>

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,426
<i>- I'll try and call him.
- He doesn't answer any calls.</i>

32
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,076
<i>That guy!</i>

33
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,676
<i>Maybe he has other plans.</i>

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,976
No, no. He just left.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,916
He couldn't wait those few minutes.

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,096
I'm going to catch him for sure.

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,836
Can I go home now?

38
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,370
Yes.

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,650
Something's going on, right?

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,826
Is the recording studio empty?

41
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,230
<i>Yes.</i>

42
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,486
I'll go for a little bit.

43
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,456
Why?

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,106
Recently I've had the best sleep there.

45
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,466
What are you talking about? Okay.

46
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,066
He doesn't need a house.

47
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,426
I need a house.

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,166
I thought you were going?

49
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,426
I'll just open up the recording studio.

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,656
Leave after doing that.

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,666
Kang In Wook! I'm so mad!

52
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,760
I just ran out without even
being able to wash my face!

53
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,956
<i>Stop it.</i>

54
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,250
<i>I'm telling you to end your
long one-sided love right here.</i>

<i>You said you didn't know what ending means,
and</i>

56
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,470
<i>you didn't understand why you had to end,
right?</i>

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,486
<i>My one-sided love has at least 1% chance.</i>

58
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,910
<i>You're probably wondering,
who says I have 1% chance?</i>

59
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,980
<i>It's because he's alive.</i>

60
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,386
<i>You don't even have 1% chance.</i>

61
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,570
<i>So stop.</i>

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,736
<i>I'm sorry, so I"m going to stop too.</i>

63
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,906
<i>I'm going to stop even my
1% chance of one-sided love.</i>

64
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,250
<i>You, should have stopped earlier.</i>

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,870
<i>Did you turn on the music?</i>

66
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,550
<i>The music playing now, are good
music for falling asleep to, I heard.</i>

67
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,260
Sleep well.

You came out to see me in?

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,356
You ate dinner, right?

72
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,636
Yes. You came out knowing I was tired,
right?

73
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,496
This feels nice.

74
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,546
You're having a hard time again?

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,476
Yes.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,770
A roommate is supposed to come in tonight.

77
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,576
Since when were we roommates?

78
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,286
Everyone except you two are roommates.
I don't want to become attached to you.

79
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,736
The word "roommate" doesn't
really have the attached feeling.

80
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh! He's coming.

81
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,830

padded jacket in April.

Do you have anymore stuff?

85
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,126
Concert... I think it's you.

86
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,386
I used to be in a orchestra
unit in medical school.

87
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,176
We asked if you have any more things?

88
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,776
More will be delivered
tomorrow by a delivery service.

89
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,006
Your gown is so dirty!

90
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,426
Take it off as soon as you head in.
I'll wash it for you.

91
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,326
The gown that a doctor
wears should be clean.

92
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm just a student though.

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,652

<i>Something happened to you, right?</i>

97
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,810
<i>You're calling me and reading a letter.</i>

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,510
I got caught.

99

<i>When that happens,
you just have to read anything.</i>

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,836
<i>It will help you.</i>

101
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,516
<i>That's why I had them all
addressed to you and Soon Ho, but</i>

102
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,406
<i>Soon Ho never reads.</i>

103
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,866
<i>I guess she doesn't have
any challenges or heartbreaks.</i>

104
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,296
It's good to not have any.

105
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,476
When will you come?

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,826
Soon Ho worries about you a lot.

107
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,566
<i>I'll go when it's time.</i>

108
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,686
<i>Let her know I'll be
visiting before it gets hot.</i>

109
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,890
<i>If it gets hot here,
it's too much for me to handle.</i>

110
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,770
It's already nice.

I was just curious.

116
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,830
About what?

117
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,400
Kim Ji Soo. Moon Ha Won's fixed point.

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,546
The center coordinate which remains
no matter how things may be distorted.

119
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,914
The sense of urgency which is pushing

120
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,576
Ha Won's technical
skill to its outermost limit.

121
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,950
Perhaps it is this person. If it is,

122
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,856
all research must have
started from Kim Ji Soo.

123
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,596
Testing of Kim Ji Soo device has finished.

124
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,526
The hint regarding the next step is here.

125
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,310
Get rid of it. Discard everything
now when I'm watching you.

126
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,890
Right now. Immediately.

127
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,356
<i>Program deletion in progress...</i>

<i>Deleting the program...</i>

129
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,500
I erased everything.

130
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,976
- I don't understand.
- Of course.

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,546
How frustrating it is to not be able to
understand with that good brain of yours.

132
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,946
So separate yourself.
Go over there.

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,825

134
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:57,486
That's right,
R2 team. You know it well. Join them.

135
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,256
They will be happy to see you there.

136
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,320
I don't want to.

137
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,416
If it's somewhere Moon Ha Won and
Kim Hoon are not, I'm not going anywhere.

138
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,796
Kim Ji Soo? Who is she? Who?
I don't have any interest at all.

139
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,370
Don't have any interest.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,476
Hey that Jin Hwan. The
kid is such a clever bastard.

141
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,256
The fixed point never changes, but!

142
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,606
It should satisfy the conditions
to be the Lefschetz numbers...

143
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:32,170
and it only exist in the condition
interval and Anti-Ha Won interval...

144
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,570
Sit up.

145
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,580
Lean here.

146
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,166
The veins in your eyeballs
are about to explode.

147
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,930
You can't sleep again?
You need sleep though.

148
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,860
Student Jin Soo!
Are you going to have breakfast?

149
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,836
Student Jin Soo!

150
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,900
He must be really tired.

151
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,246
You're sleeping with the
gown on! It's creating wrinkles!

152
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,256
Take it off and sleep!

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,386
What? What's going on?

154
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,296
I'll take it off him!

155
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,406
Let's do it together.

156
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,166
Oh no, Jin Soo!

157
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,966
What's wrong with you?

158
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,070
Look at this. I have to wash it again.

159
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,306
Director, where is Teacher Kang?

160
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,986
I've known In Wook for a long time.

161
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,636
This is the first recording we've
done with a major record label.

162
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,480
Of all times,
he has a slump and feels betrayed.

163
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,936
In Wook is not in the right
sense of mind right now.

164
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,950
He can just do it by himself, then.

165
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,036
That is....

166
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,206
I've never heard that answer before.

167
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,016
We record when we're
performing at our best,

168
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,286
not when we're at our lowest.

169
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,866
Then after setting a goal, he can
just work to bring his skill up to that.

170
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,536
It's easy for you to say.

171
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,746
Let's do it! Let's do that!
Will you do that for me?

172
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,166
If the roots aren't rotten,
then it will live.

173
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,280
Where is Teacher Kang?

174
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,150
In the studio.

175
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,980
Really.

176
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,096
- Hello Teacher Kang.
- Turn the lights off.

177
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,116
You don't have anything to tell me?

178
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,700
About what?

179
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,496
About yesterday.

180
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,079
Are you not the one who
made all the commotion

181
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:09,416
about opening up
the recording studio?

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,346
I ran like a crazy person!

183
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,156
How long did you want me to wait?

184
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,236
- You couldn't wait the 10 minutes?
- I waited for 20 minutes.

185
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,816
This or that. They're the same.

186
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,830
If you weren't going to
wait then at least text me!

187
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,696
Turn off the lights and leave.

188
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,766
I'm just getting started.

189
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,286
In your slump, do you know the
Studio Moon recording room or not?

190
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,836
Record by yourself,
and release an album. What's the problem?

191
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,086
With Han Seo Woo, our recording
studio will help you as much as possible.

192
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,606
All you have to do is have the right mind.

193
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,060
You have my business card, right?

194
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,590
- I gave you my card.
- I have it!

195
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,866
Now you seem like a person
after yelling out like that.

196
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,880
Give me a call!

197
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,627
I found Kang In Wook and
talked business with him.

198
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,126
Did you see the schedule?

199
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,730
No.

200
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,986
Did you sleep at your house in Seoul?

201
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,796
I have a house in Seoul?

202
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,006
The house where you
slept in after drinking.

203
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,546
That house! No.

204
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,276
Wait. No. I can just live there.

205
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,136
But there's someone living there already.

206
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,296
<i>I can just make it mine.</i>

207
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,486
What about the person
actually living there?

208
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,096
<i>It's family matters.
I asked if you saw the schedule.</i>

209
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,316
I'm on my way to take
a look at the schedule.

210
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,140
<i>Don't go. It's a audio recording.</i>

211
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,066
- That...
- Yes.

212
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,906
Like Kim Ji Soo. You don't want to do it,
right?

213
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,216
Let's just check on the time
and give it to someone else.

214
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,565
<i>Since we only need to
lend them the recording studio.</i>

215
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,590
I'll do it.

216
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,520
<i>STUDIO MOON, Seoul Jongrogu Sejongro 12-9</i>

217
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,870
Hello-

218
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,706
Can I take a picture? To put on Instagram?

219
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,496
<i>Someone introduced me to this place.</i>

220
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,040
<i>If I do end up staying here,
save the room at the end for me.</i>

221
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,200
Uh,
your face is showing. It's still showing.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,076
We'll start with simple consonants
and vowels, and then some phrases.

223
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,666
I just have to read this?

224
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,026
Yes. If you want to stop at any
point you just have to stay 'Stop'.

225
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,526
We can record them again.

226
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,866
They say I can really
communicate with myself.

227
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,366
Is there really a device like that?

228
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,416
Have you seen it?

229
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,146
I signed a contract that says I won't
tell anyone about the recordings.

230
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,990
So you've seen it.

231
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,016
Excuse me, that.

232
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,596
You don't have to use this.

233
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,970
But I want to. It looks cool.

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,106
Hello. Hello.

235
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,580
When I give you the
signal you can start reading.

236
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,556
ABCDEFG, HIJKLMN...

237
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,416
- OPQRS....
- Let's try and read a bit more slower.

238
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,086
A, B, C, D...

239
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,450
Sorry. Let's go a little
bit faster than that.

240
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,616
A, B, C...

241
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,236
I was finished,
and the winter was about to end too,

242
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,266
so one day I went to the
southern coast without any plan.

243
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,516
Spring already came over there

244
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,060
so it was the peak season for sea bass,
trouts and blue crabs.

245
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,576
Um, just a moment.

246
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,416
- Shall we take a break?
- I want to put it on Instagram.

247
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,240
I have to post at 1 pm.

248
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,480
It's good now.

249
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,086
We'll resume with the recording then.

250
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,960
Where was the page again..

251
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,010
I can't see the words very well.

252
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,176
- Where is the garbage?
- Give it to me.

253
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,666
Sorry.

254
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,790
I can't do this twice. I'm so tired.

255
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,916
You've emptied the room at the end, right?

256
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,840
Empty it.

257
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,430
Yes.

258
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,920
She remembers.

259
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,516
There was one from Heikin...

260
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,630
Where did it go?

261
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,410
Take it.

262
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,910
<i>Mr. Dawn, the file name for the
voice recording is Kim Min Jung.</i>

263
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,890
<i>Where are you Mr. Dawn?</i>

264
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,610
Me, I'm Mr. Dawn.

265
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,686
So you've missed Mr. Dawn a lot.

266
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,368
That's...

267
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,316
I'm talking to that
person from that time.

268
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,800
Exactly. That person. Is me.

269
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,976
You must be craving coffee since
you just woke up. What would you like?

270
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,070
I didn't sleep! I was just thinking.

271
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,570
Okay.

272
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,600
You're okay with having a cup
of coffee with Mr. Dawn, right?

273
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,920
Why are you glaring at Mr. Dawn?

274
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,646
- You cried, didn't you?
- No.

275
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,690
Your face right now
looks like you were crying.

276
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:46,027
I don't cry.

277
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:48,146
How can a person not cry?

278
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,980
I don't cry.

279
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,506
Oh, I've cried once when my mom
put mustard into my cold noodles.

280
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,260
I don't have any other memory of crying.

281
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,820
It's hot.

282
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,456
I did come earlier than the assigned rent
time, but I'll leave after I drink this.

283
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,640
I'll leave. I'm done.

284
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,080
It's hot!

285
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,980
Are you going to quit?

286
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,250
Don't have to quit though...

287
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,840
Yes, I'm going to show
you the sample of quitting.

288
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,886
I started it for my own happiness,

289
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,900
but now it doesn't matter.
I'm going to quit it for sure.

290
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,936
Because Ha Won, that guy,
isn't an ordinary man.

291
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,740
I told you that he's meticulous,

292
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,770
wait, no, not meticulous, I think.

293
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,060
It's for your own happiness, Seo Woo,
then why should you quit it?

294
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,176
Ha Won is just Ha Won,

295
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,130
so in case of your 1%,
please just leave it alone, free.

296
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,670
Don't pluck it yourself.

297
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,146
Ha Won will do as you told him to do,

298
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,520
so you don't have to show him the sample.

299
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,966
Then, I'll leave...

300
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,306
It's Mr. Dawn's time,

301
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,286
so Mr. Dawn must clean
the room before he leaves.

302
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,023
And don't touch my stuffs
without permission, and...

303
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,284
where is my bag?

304
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,540
Should I leave the door open?

305
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,970
Close it, please.

306
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,980
It was dark,
so I thought you would be scared...

307
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,936
Where is Chang Seop?

308
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,686
He will stay overnight at his parents'
house to take care of something.

309
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,690
What's up with him?

310
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,836
Come home late tomorrow.

311
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,310
Why?

312
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,850
Chang Seop... will take a day off tomorrow.

313
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,676
You're bad at taking a hint, you know...

314
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,926
Ah, I see, okay.

315
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,880
The snug time for two of you only?

316
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,906
As we have a vacant room,
why don't you move up?

317
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:23,736
I'll give you a discount.

318
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,100
Not yet.

319
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,876
Unnie, if I say 1%,

320
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,870
would it be a possibility or a false hope?

321
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,346
If you think of it as "as much as 1%",
it is a possibility,

322
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,320
and if you think of it as "a mere 1%",
then it's a false hope.

323
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,290
What is it about?

324
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,620
One-sided love.

325
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,706
You're doing it by yourself already,
so why don't you keep it to yourself?

326
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,760
I'm going to throw it out there.

327
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,546
I'll throw this 1% over there,

328
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,216
and I'll keep watching how it survives,

329
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,466
if it really survives,

330
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,716
or if it just crawls and falls down.

331
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,186
I'll raise it strongly.

332
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,340
Are you saying to keep doing it or not?

333
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,170
<i>Mr. Kang</i>

334
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,666
Sweetheart! Sweetheart!

335
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,876
Mr. Kang said he would
work with you for his record.

336
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,430
I suggested it. Wow, it's awesome!

337
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,136
<i>Mr. Kang, this is Han Seo Woo.</i>

338
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,176
<i>I heard from Ms. Moon,</i>

339
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,750
<i>I will do my best.
See you later in the afternoon.</i>

340
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,030
<i>Why did Ji Soo have
Han Seo Woo's number...?</i>

341
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,980
Why Han Seo Woo?

342
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,660
<i>Employee - Choi Soo
Ji / NH Nonghyup Bank</i>

343
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,660
What's up?

344
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,692
It was a good time
to get served with

345
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:04,716
breakfast by Eun Joo every morning,
wasn't it?

346
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,586
Have you been doing well?

347
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,786
You're not concerned about me,
so why bother?

348
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,860
I just asked.

349
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,126
Why are you having breakfast here?

350
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,436
Worked overnight.

351
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,176
Are you doing well with Eun Joo Unnie?

352
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,306
You're not even curious about it,
so don't bother.

353
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,820
Never mind, then.

354
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,496
What's wrong?

355
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,696
Seeing you having a
hard time because of me,

356
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,576
- I feel bad. - What?
- Frankly speaking,

357
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,126
you liked me, didn't you?
Isn't that why you were so upset and left?

358
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,226
- Are you crazy?
- These days,

359
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,366
there are a lot of girls
who like me at my office too.

360
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,206
The older I get,
the cooler I become. I'm that type.

361
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,540
My broad chest makes my suit look so great.

362
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,046
As my status gets better suddenly,

363
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,376
now I reflect on me whether
I made a wrong choice too.

364
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,866
You son of... I told you I'm
going to kill you if you break up!

365
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,040
Undies, socks, shirts...

366
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,576
<i>This is the person who made
a contract for the end room.</i>

367
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,346
<i>I'm going to move in today.</i>

368
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,730
C-contract? I haven't made it though.

369
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,606
HEY! You guys even received
my deposit fee. That boy!

370
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,806
Chang Seop or whatever!
How dare you try to con me...

371
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,286
<i>(in informal/rude speech)</i> Hey,
didn't you receive my deposit?

372
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,090
W-W-What did you say?

373
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,635
I did. I've wired that deposit
to your account right away.

374
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,786
Check the balance.

375
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,326
<i>I've selected a person
who wouldn't have breakfast.</i>

376
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,326
Why did you make such a contract?

377
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,556
Why are you making a
fuss when I helped you?

378
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,926
We should see the person's personality
and character before making a decision!

379
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,149
Since when did you check the
character before letting a tenant in?

380
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,536
I've worked so hard for this!

381
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,510
Damn.

382
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,720
Damn it!

383
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,046
Hello.

384
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,520
Earlier... The phone call...

385
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,870
- <i>(in formal speech) </i>Let's go.
- Yes.

386
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,446
<i>(in informal speech)</i> I clearly
said I wanted the room at the end.

387
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,936
When.. did you...?

388
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,050
<i>(in formal speach)</i> I've mentioned several
times that I want the room at the end.

389
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,340
Uh, well...

390
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:52,826
When did you...,
how many times?

391
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,830
I SAID TO THAT GIRL IN
THE RECORDING STUDIO!

392
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,796
Well, since it turns out this way,

393
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,012
please leave,
we already have a tenant in that room.

394
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:04,436
I'll send the
deposit back to you.

395
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,086
<i>(in informal/rude speach)</i> I won't leave.

396
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,440
Until you give me that room,
I won't move a step from here.

397
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,300
I clearly told that girl in the recording
studio about the room at the end.

398
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,360
A girl in the recording studio...
Must be Han Seo Woo...

399
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
Let me check first.

400
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,586
DAMN IT,
WHY THE FUCK IS SHE NOT PICKING UP!

401
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,446
Pick up, pick up the phone,
Han Seo Woo! Han Seo Woo, you...

402
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,506
YOU'D BETTER PICK IT UP!

403
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,086
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up, PICK UP! PICK UP!!!!

404
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,256
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
PICK UP, PICK U~~~~P!!

405
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,870
PICK UP THE PHONE!!

406
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,620
You're here, sir.

407
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,286
Let's have a talk first today.

408
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,706
We can record 3 to 4 songs for a test too.

409
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,030
I should do a good job,
as this is my first time.

410
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,576
Mr. Kang, who is he...?

411
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,070
The engineer who will work with me.

412
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,500
But I heard from Ms. Moon
that you would work with me.

413
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,036
If you could please explain...

414
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,060
I don't recall saying I would
work with you, Seo Woo.

415
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,870
Shut the door and leave.

416
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,366
- Where are you going?
- I'm checking out early.

417
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,256
What do you mean, go?
Where are you going?

418
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,490
- He came with another sound engineer.
- What?

419
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,110
What the heck is she saying?

420
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,170
Come up.

421
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,416
He definitely said that
he'd be working with you.

422
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,990
- He must've changed his mind, then.
- In the span of a few hours?

423
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,656
I've known Teacher Kang from before.

424
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,696
He's not that kind of person.
Plus he's in a slump.

425
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,020
If he's in a slump,
then can he treat other people rudely?

426
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,426
Don't yield to such whim.

427
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,606
Follow me.

428
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,456
I'm fine. Really, Manager.

429
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,676
Are you okay?

430
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,566
Are you stupid?

431
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,656
If I think of such things as yield,
then I can't do anything.

432
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,276
In the process of work, there can be
some misunderstandings and mistakes.

433
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,360
I'm fine.

434
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,350
It's unfair, but why am I not even mad?

435
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,866
Let's hold it in, hold it in.

436
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:55,590
Soon Ho, you should hold it in,
so that you can live in Seoul.

437
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,526
She ran away?

438
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,176
Han Seo Woo ran away,
but... oh, I'm so mad.

439
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,786
It's always the good-mannered
ones who run away first.

440
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,226
Where did she run off to?

441
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,976
I don't know. She was walking away quietly,
but-

442
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,186
I'm so pissed off! It broke my heart!

443
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,276
Han Seo Woo has really
gotten on In Wook's side, too.

444
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,699
She explained to me that
there are a lot of unknown

445
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:23,866
but great talented musicians in Korea,
and...

446
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,680
Kang In Wook, that jerk...
I hate backstabbing the most.

447
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,296
Then it's the fault of
Kang what's-his-name.

448
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,746
What's pissing me off more
is that I'm bearing with it.

449
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,900
Why are you bearing with it?

450
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,376
That's what I'm saying!

451
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,180
He's so freaking immature.

452
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,296
Kang In Wook, you definitely said

453
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,136
that you'd be working with Han Seo Woo,
that you'd try it out.

454
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,856
I heard it, as clear as day.

455
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,490
Han Seo Woo must have felt pretty bad.

456
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,226
There was a situation that called for it.

457
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,656
Mr. Kang, insulting others to
this extent is like a habit for you.

458
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,776
- I'll explain.
- Do it by yourself.

459
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,506
Since you're paying us rent for it anyway.

460
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,366
Using all the time,
you can try your best to explain,

461
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,610
or just pound away at the piano.

462
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,060
I need some powerful healing.

<i>You should've hidden it with all you had.</i>

491
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,306
If you don't know,
then it doesn't mean anything.

492
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,096
As tiring and painful as it was,
you should've hidden it.

493
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,560
- You should've hidden it with all you...
- Why can't you understand me? Why?

494
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,300
You know I didn't even do it on purpose.

495
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,106
I'm telling you it was a mistake.

496
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,250
Just tell me once that it's okay.
If you do that, I can somehow live, Ji Soo.

497
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,600
Is this a good time?

498
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,060
Just a moment is enough.

499
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,420
Alcohol? Dinner?

500
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,906
The manager and Teacher
Kang are there together.

501
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,836
Soon Ho is there?

502
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,406
Why are the two of them together?

503
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:49,936
They're fighting, most likely.
Soon Ho called me because she was mad.

504
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,886
Soon Ho hates when promises are broken.

505
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,706
She did seem to be acting a bit sensitive.

506
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,440
It's more than being sensitive.

507
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,262
Because of that,
she turned her back to the world and

508
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,044
for about 9 years,
she lived in a farm.

509
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,390
No, but...

510
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,936
So you were rejected as soon as you came?

511
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,590
After so many years, she said to
meet up and you met up, then rejection?

512
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,496
Wow, I'm starting to cry.

513
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,190
Wow, what's up with Kim Ji Soo?

514
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,616
Backstabbing is dramatic in every form.

515
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,830
The first time I see you,
Uncle, and I really like it.

516
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,190
Wow, how is this possible?
Birds of a feather flock together.

517
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,927
<i>She was even engaged to her first love,</i>

518
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:14,766
<i>but he fell in love with her best friend,
so they called it off.</i>

519
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:20,826
She took me to a snack bar to console me,
but ended up wailing herself.

520
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,926
After that, she gave up on
Seoul and went down to the farm.

521
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,596
And she became a gardener.

522
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:31,404
Soon Ho is a child
with a very fragile heart.

523
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,390
There aren't a lot of places we can go...
Are you really hungry?

524
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,700
I was worried about you.

525
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,506
Well, now, can you tell me your story?

526
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,146
Wait, if you don't have anything to say,
let me start first.

527
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,576
Please come to the studio as per
the reservation by the end of this week.

528
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,806
As Han Seo Woo said, this can happen
due to some misunderstanding or mistake.

529
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,366
And for the new reservation,

530
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:13,316
I don't care if you do it in another
place with a fresh mind or whatever.

531
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,496
You care for Seo Woo a lot.
Are you two close?

532
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,091
I'm not close with anyone.

533
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:20,846
I'm not an affectional
person to begin with.

534
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,160
Life is originally starting
and ending by oneself, so

535
00:44:23,184 --> 00:44:25,456
I'm planning to live
lonesomely as much as possible.

536
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,906
But why to Han Seo Woo...?

537
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,436
Mr. Kang In Wook,
when a person cares for another,

538
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,425
you're not supposed to
approach it in a way "because

539
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:34,176
one likes the other,
or is close to another".

540
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,646
This is simply about a promise.

541
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,276
You broke your promise,
and Han Seo Woo was sad about it.

542
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,790
And it makes me feel shitty.

543
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:51,346
Seo Woo... did you first
meet her in the studio?

544
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,936
That was the first time I got to know her.

545
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,356
As soon as we started working together,
she helped me with a difficult task.

546
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,346
To buy dishes through on-line shopping,
I didn't want to use my own name.

547
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,276
She bought them for me.

548
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,566
Well, although it can be nothing,
someone might take it suspiciously.

549
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,336
"Why doesn't she buy them herself?"

550
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,680
"Does she have a credit delinquency?"
I would be doubtful too.

551
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,036
Same for your slump too. In different
angles, many would be doubtful...

552
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,990
D-Dishes... Who did you buy them from?

553
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,166
It's selling and buying though
online shops. How would I know that?

554
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,396
Right, even when selling them,
all you need are address and phone number.

555
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,056
You don't have to see the faces either...

556
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,410
Obviously.

557
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,826
I'll work with Han Seo
Woo for my next album.

558
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,900
Are you kidding me?

559
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,390
No, not at all.

560
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,036
Are you enjoying those dishes?

561
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,096
Those are not for me either.

562
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,040
I got that request from another person too.

563
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,350
Life is disgustingly twisted, you know.

564
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,710
By the way, why do you keep laughing?

565
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,010
No, just... I'm just dumbfounded,
that's all.

566
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,540
We ran out of sandwiches, I'm sorry.

567
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,746
Then what about ramen?

568
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,626
Eat here?

569
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,150
Ramen you eat at a cafe is so delicious,
you know.

570
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,190
<i>Close - see you next time</i>

571
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,096
Shall I... testify that
you've waited long time?

572
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,056
<i>- She must not be coming today either.
- She will, one day.</i>

573
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,760
<i>If I meet her, I'll testify for you
how you've been waiting so far.</i>

574
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,000
No...

575
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,490
The person I was waiting
for was someone else.

576
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,530
- I know her too.
- I see...

577
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,550
After that, have you met her?

578
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,356
No.

579
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,936
My cafe is where the waiting
usually ends up with the meeting.

580
00:47:38,961 --> 00:47:41,396
Each cafe has a different energy,
you know.

581
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:45,016
When I saw a person who got stood up,
that made me feel sad too,

582
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,716
but the very next day,
they showed up together.

583
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,020
You will meet her eventually.

584
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,150
I'm sorry.

585
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,160
I shouldn't have brought it up...

586
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:43,590
No, he should've cried already.

587
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:55,520
On that table,
you were with another lady, weren't you?

588
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,996
That lady, she was looking up the
ceiling when she was waiting for you,

589
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,140
so I still remember her.

590
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,740
She was the person.

591
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,370
The one he waited for.

592
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,500
Oh, she came though.

593
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:53,170
<i>Seo Woo, would you please
tell Won not to wait at the cafe?</i>

594
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,986
By any chance, are you the same person
who said has never cried all his life?

595
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,206
I can c-cry too, I found that out today.

596
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,480
Moreover, didn't you come to me
because you're worried about me?

597
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,920
I didn't come to show you this...

598
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,796
It totally cheers me up.

599
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,896
Why do I feel refreshed when
I saw someone else crying?

600
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,466
Let's go.

601
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,906
To where?

602
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,870
Taxi~!

603
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,206
You must feel embarrassed,

604
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,020
why are you waving at the empty street?

605
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,890
Nice to meet you, Ha Won.

606
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,590
So, can I be Ha Won now?

607
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,350
Do you have anything to say to Mr. Dawn?
I guess he won't show up going forward.

608
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:32,080
So,
this is the last moment with Mr. Dawn...?

609
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,380
I can't tell him not to leave though.

610
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,306
Would you please turn around?

611
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,806
Just say it, please.

612
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,320
Since you're Mr. Dawn?

613
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,780
Mr. Dawn, good bye.

614
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,900
I was thankful.

615
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,880
That's it.

616
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,410
Taxi!

617
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,576
Kim Ji Soo!

618
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,736
Make some noise!

619
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,070
Ah, Ji Soo! Turn on some fun music!

620
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,200
What is it? Why isn't the music on?

621
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,260
Kim Ji Soo?

622
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,966
Did he change it?

623
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:02,296
Huh,
you think I won't be able to find you guys?

624
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,370
Genie? Siri?

625
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:18,836
Device?

626
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,800
No, please listen.

627
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,560
This piece... when I first saw you.

628
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,726
<i>I remember,</i>

629
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,731
<i>when I looked outside,
some man was looking around,</i>

630
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:06,126
<i>so I turned it up so
that he could listen.</i>

631
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,600
Oh my, oh my, so it was you, Ha Won?

632
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,646
So you remember the
moment when you first saw me.

633
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,266
It's vivid,

634
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,646
I heard this song,
so I looked up.

635
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,516
And went to the studio
and you were there.

636
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,576
I told you, that the relationship lasts
long if the first impression was vivid.

637
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,436
I must be so impressive then, am I right?

638
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,330
Of course.

639
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,326
But the first encounter I remember was
when you were in the recording booth.

640
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:43,436
It's a different scene. If we remember
differently, that what happens?

641
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,990
Then, keep watching what would happen next.

642
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,146
Are you feeling better?

643
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,880
I told you this story to
make you feel better.

644
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,150
After seeing you crying earlier,
I forgot all about the upsetting work.

645
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,706
Your door looks open.

646
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,136
Oh, stop, stop!

647
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,430
I still have something to talk about.

648
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,966
This can cause a big trouble, you know.

649
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,130
Wait, wait!

650
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,270
It's looks better than
looking at it from the outside.

651
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:46,987
It's warm too.

652
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,107
I live here because
it's not too bad.

653
00:55:49,132 --> 00:55:51,834
Eun Joo unnie doesn't
let me just live anywhere.

654
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,440
- What about the device?
- I got rid of it.

655
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,150
It sounds a bit harsh
to say I got rid of it...

656
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,910
In the past,
it was clear what Ji Soo gave me.

657
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,370
I was happy when I thought
of Ji Soo during difficult times,

658
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:46,350
Ji Soo could comfort me
when I was feeling empty.

659
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,220
There was something that
Ji Soo could correct for me.

660
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:01,180
Now, when I think of Ji Soo,
it's difficult.

661
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,760
It's time for me to stop.

662
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,796
It's ambiguous to say I'm stopping.

663
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:20,690
But I've realized that no matter how
abstract it is, there is a way through it.

664
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,060
Since I've made up my mind.

665
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:33,200
I'm going to find out what and how to stop.

666
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,890
Enough about me,...

667
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,886
it's your turn.

668
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:43,786
You told me.

669
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,140
That you like looking.

670
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,196
I honestly didn't know what that meant.

671
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,366
I never put value in looking
at something for a long time.

672
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,600
I've also believed that emotions
continue even if you've never met.

673
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,780
But now I know,

674
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,790
what it means to like looking at something.

675
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:20,680
It was nice to see even
though it was difficult.

676
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,550
See what?

677
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,490
And,

678
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,620
you didn't quit, right?

679
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,996
You're talking without context again.

680
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,250
It's not even 1% of the time and
I don't do that. At most it is 1%.

681
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:05,850
I 'm really curious how your 1% will grow.

682
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,796
Seo Woo!

683
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,320
- Hey, Han Seo Woo!
- Excuse me.

684
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,640
Han Seo Woo!

685
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:26,176
The student was hanging
around the bus stop for a half hour.

686
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,566
Because I'm going to pick him up
and escort him, you go quickly on up.

687
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,516
I know you're busy, but are you frozen?

688
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,341
Eun Joo is working like the
devil by herself in the kitchen.

689
00:59:32,365 --> 00:59:32,917
Get going!

690
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:35,010
Oh, right!

691
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,024
We are having dinner together
when the new boarder arrives.

692
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:52,286
I completely forgot.

693
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,340
If I fail to show up, Eun Joo will kill me.

694
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,600
There's one more thing.

695
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:14,030
When I made up my mind, I thought it
would be better for you to know everything.

696
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,660
Among the things Ji Soo wanted to tell you,

697
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,290
there is one more.

698
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,740
Ji Soo went to the place
you had agreed to meet at.

699
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,465
Oh. Seo Woo.

700
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,870
Put a little soy sauce
in the japchae. It's bland.

701
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,000
Yes.

702
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,576
This alley is a little confusing.

703
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,086
There's just one butcher shop in the
alley leading to our boarding house.

704
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:02,908
A butcher shop?

705
01:01:02,933 --> 01:01:06,527
Yes. But next to it,
the sweet sour chicken is delicious.

706
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:07,749
Butcher shop.

707
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,700
<i>If I had only turned around.</i>

708
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,020
<i>Ji Soo!</i>

709
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,830
<i>Quitting you...</i>

710
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:40,510
<i>will put a stop my life-long regret.</i>

711
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,116
Welcome.

712
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,910
Feel free to eat as much as you want.

713
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,495
I only ate one roll of
kimbap at 2. I appreciate it.

714
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,636
Eat up.

715
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,066
This household's japchae is amazing.

716
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,636
Our Soo Ji is a japchae wizard.

717
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,616
Who is Soo Ji?

718
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,266
"She is a japchae ghost."
Why are you talking about her again?

719
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,956
You're speaking without honorifics...

720
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,426
That's not it.

721
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,840
Ah. We are dating. Don't be concerned.

722
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,080
This is delicious.

723
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,930
Unni. I'm going to make a
phone call. I left my phone.

724
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,020
Hurry back.

725
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,570
<i>I am not quitting.</i>

726
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:14,400
Having said that does not mean
there is nothing expected of you.

727
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:19,560
Because I will take care
of myself so Mr. Ha Won,

728
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,476
make sure you figure
out what it is. Do that.

729
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,036
<i>I figured it out.</i>

730
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,200
<i>What and how to quit</i>

731
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,860
I did figure them out.

732
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,530
There is something you need to do for me.

733
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,600
All you have to do

734
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:51,560
is to go back and
forth so that I can see it.

735
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,146
You want to see.

736
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:58,140
No way.

737
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:06,086
<i>I can't say now what
sort of feeling this is.</i>

738
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,020
But...

739
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,420
I need you.

740
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:22,050
Can you stay for me?

741
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:57,480
Stay with me.

742
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,626
<i>A Piece of Your Mind Preview</i>

743
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,376
<i>I want to hear it.</i>

744
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,366
<i>I have to improve. You're
going to be so surprised.</i>

745
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,786
<i>At this time of the year,
my heart is pounding. Someone's wife...</i>

746
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,666
<i>You're hiding something, aren't you?</i>

747
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,656
<i>I feel I am being exposed.</i>

748
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,776
<i>I also left something behind.</i>

749
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,700
<i>- Like your heart?
- My bike.</i>

750
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,976
<i>Handsome. Totally to my taste.</i>

751
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,716
<i>The worst already happened.</i>

752
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,606
<i>One of the two must live.</i>

753
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,876
<i>The 1% and one person</i>

754
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,990
<i>You should follow someone
if you want him to stay.</i>
