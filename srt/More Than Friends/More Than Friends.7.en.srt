1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,050
(A long, long time ago,
in a kingdom far away,)

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,050
(a princess was born cursed by a witch.)

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,450
(The curse stated that she'd prick)

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,990
(her finger on a spinning
wheel and die on her 16th birthday.)

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,630
(With the help of a kind fairy,)

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,230
(the princess was gifted with a long sleep
to replace death.)

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,700
(With the prince's kiss,
the curse was broken,)

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,570
(and they lived happily ever after.)

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
The end.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,510
Let's go to sleep, Woo-yeon.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,640
What about the witch?

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,310
What happened to the witch?

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,180
I don't know.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,450
She was probably punished
since she was evil.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,120
Go to sleep.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,120
(If my mom were right,)

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,130
(maybe the curse that was broken)

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,860
(returned to the witch.)

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,070
(Then where did my long-lasting curse go,)

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,280
(now that it was)

21
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,650
(finally broken?)

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,000
=Episode 7: Where Did The Curse Go?=

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,660
(Woo-yeon, you're not still
waiting for me, are you?)

24
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,690
(I told you I had plans.)

25
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,560
(Sorry,)

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,170
(I'm with Mr. On now.)

27
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,570
(I like you.)

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,410
I liked you a lot.

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
I liked you

30
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,550
for a while.

31
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,050
Sorry.

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,050
You're just a friend to me.

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,190
So don't tell me

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
that you like me.

35
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,020
You rejected me. Twice.

36
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,820
Should I say let's go out
just because you like me

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,490
when I don't like you back?

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,770
Hey, stop. Stop.

39
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,080
Did you hurt your head?

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,510
What is wrong with me?

41
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,620
I shouldn't have given you alcohol after
you were hit by a car even if you whined.

42
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,620
Give it back.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,220
Let's go back to the hospital.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,120
The doctor gave me an earful
when you ran out earlier.

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,790
I said to give it back.

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,460
No. I know I respect
people's wishes a great deal,

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,390
but you've lost your sense of judgment.

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,560
No. Let's go to the hospital.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,530
Are you okay? Sorry.

50
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,740
Leave me alone!

51
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,410
Fine, punk.

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,379
But hey. Were you crying?

53
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,950
Okay, fine.
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

54
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,920
Why is a dude crying?

55
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,660
I'm going crazy,

56
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,560
so just leave me alone.

57
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm sorry about today.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,240
I don't want to be someone
you apologize to or thank.

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,110
I want to be someone you like.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,310
Can you do that for me?

61
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
Happy birthday.

62
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,420
Instead of getting mad at me,
you're giving me a gift.

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,890
You're a really strange guy.

64
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,030
I'll keep on only giving you gifts

65
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,960
like a completely strange guy.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
You should go. It's late.

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I will.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,780
(Put these on and come to me.)

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,550
(P.S. These shoes will only take you
one way.)

70
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:15,930
(Woo-yeon, how did it go?)

71
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,200
(Jin-ju)
(Woo-yeon, how did it go?)

72
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,530
(Young-hee)
(Hey, I told you to leave her alone.)

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,130
(I'm so curious!)

74
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,810
(I'm dating Mr. On.)

75
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,810
(Young-hee, Jin-ju)

76
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,010
What is this? How did you call me so fast?

77
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,380
Hey, did you finally come to your senses?

78
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,480
- What do you...
- Of course, she did.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,550
She chose the flower path
instead of the fire pit.

80
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,190
What are you saying?

81
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,290
Anyway,

82
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,390
tell us the whole story.

83
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,090
My speculation was wrong
although I'm smart.

84
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,000
It's shameful, but I'm happy. Tell us.

85
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,170
Did he stand you up
after asking you to come out?

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,170
On your birthday of all days?

87
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,170
What a jerk.

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,810
For something that trivial?

89
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,340
I was clinging onto someone
who didn't have any feelings.

90
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,740
Seriously.

91
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,780
But you went to Soo,

92
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,120
so how did you get together with Mr. On?

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,720
I left after rejecting Mr. On,

94
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,650
and I left although he asked me not to.

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,560
But he was waiting in front of my house.

96
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,060
Oh my.

97
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,430
- Seriously.
- Then I suddenly thought,

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,470
"Yes, I should go to this man."

99
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,700
"That is the right answer."

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
Gosh, it sounds like a drama.

101
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,140
That's how it is between people.

102
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,980
Sometimes your relationships expand,
and sometimes they fold.

103
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,320
Kind of like umbrellas.

104
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,790
- You sound like a book of famous quotes.
- Don't I?

105
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,360
Gosh, I'm the only lonely one.

106
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,960
Woo-yeon.

107
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,890
I miss her like crazy.

108
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,280
Your left wrist ligament was strained.

109
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,910
Refrain from using your left hand
for a while.

110
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,580
You can't drink or smoke.

111
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,520
If you don't take care of it,
the aftereffect will be huge.

112
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,790
You must take good care of it
starting from now.

113
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,940
(You guys didn't forget, right?)

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,180
(Jin Sang-hyeok)
(Today is the first anniversary of "Tonight"!)

115
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,420
(When you finish work, rush over
to "Tonight" right away.)

116
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,180
(Jin-ju)
(We should, we should.)

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,350
(It would be a crime to sit out
on a drinking event.)

118
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,660
(I'm not going.)

119
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,530
(Okay, okay.)

120
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm not going.

121
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,740
(Tonight)

122
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,060
Why won't you let me win this time?

123
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,960
Because this isn't a matter
of winning or losing.

124
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,430
I'd do anything for you.
I'd always listen to you.

125
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,100
That's why I was happy even when I lost.

126
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,570
As long as you're happy, I won't ask you
anything from now on.

127
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,710
Even if I know, I'll act like I don't.

128
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,140
I'll just smile like a fool in front
of you for the rest of my life.

129
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,050
But it's too hard for you.

130
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,050
That's why I can't let this pass.

131
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,350
I'm not asking you to tell me
every little thing.

132
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,020
Nor do I mean I want to interfere.

133
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,260
Just

134
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,590
rely on me.

135
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,630
Please rely on me.

136
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,470
I'll be much heavier

137
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,870
than you think.

138
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
I'll be much stronger

139
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,540
than you think.

140
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,460
I love you.

141
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,500
I love you too.

142
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,330
Hey. Looking good.

143
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,140
I thought you had a fight.
Why are you looking lovey-dovey?

144
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,110
Do you want to see something nice?

145
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,110
Do you want to see it one more time?

146
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,350
Come on.

147
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,620
I want all couples to disappear.

148
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,330
Why are you here?

149
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,270
You came. I thought you weren't coming.

150
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,610
I just came. I had nothing to do.

151
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,980
By the way, what about Woo-yeon?

152
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,680
I'm Woo-yeon's boyfriend.

153
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,650
- Sit down.
- Hello.

154
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,830
Why did he come here?
How dare he come here?

155
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,670
Bring me a sledgehammer.
I can't stand it this time.

156
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,800
There's no need.

157
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,170
When you think about it,
he didn't do anything wrong.

158
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
Are you still taking his side?

159
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,670
It doesn't even make me angry.

160
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,710
I really must not have any feelings
for him now.

161
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,750
Woo-yeon,
did you finally come to your senses?

162
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,220
Gosh. Let me use the toilet.

163
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,290
Okay.

164
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,360
"CEO On Joon-soo".

165
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,930
So you're a CEO.

166
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,700
I know it's our first time meeting,
but can I call you my big brother?

167
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,530
As you please.

168
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,600
Big brother, let me pour you a drink.

169
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,170
I'm sorry, I brought my car.

170
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,140
I see. Would you like a soda instead?

171
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,610
Hey.

172
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,110
Why are you calling him your brother
when you just met?

173
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,750
Don't you know? Every handsome
and rich man is my big brother.

174
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,080
Please step away.

175
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,020
By the way,

176
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,920
how did you end up
going out with Woo-yeon?

177
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,360
It isn't too late, so run away.

178
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,590
What's wrong with Woo-yeon?

179
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Why are you getting worked up?

180
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,470
I'm not worked up.

181
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,300
I like Woo-yeon a great deal.

182
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,740
She is someone who deserves to be loved.

183
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,070
That sounds like a line from a drama.

184
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,510
Did you feel that cold draft?

185
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,910
Would you pass me a napkin?

186
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,250
What happened to your hand?

187
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,790
It's nothing.

188
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,390
Did you get hurt that day?

189
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,490
That day?

190
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,690
He got hit by a car in Namsan Park
on Saturday.

191
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,930
He was unconscious in the hospital
for an hour.

192
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,630
But as soon as he woke up,
he pulled out his IV

193
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,260
and ran out with his arm bleeding.

194
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,600
He looked like the male protagonist
in a drama.

195
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,700
Do you have to go?

196
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm really sorry.

197
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,930
- Really?
- Yes.

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,260
- I'll buy.
- Really?

199
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,360
Yes.

200
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,410
How did he say it?

201
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,910
What do you mean, how did he say it?

202
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,580
Why do girls go to the bathroom together?

203
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,450
Well, it is scary and lonely.

204
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,190
Anyway, there's a world that girls live in

205
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,420
- that guys don't know.
- This tastes good. Try it.

206
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,120
Our smart prosecutor.

207
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,090
Are you afraid of going to the bathroom
at age 28?

208
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
You little thing.

209
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,400
Sang-hyeok, what did this big sister say?

210
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,540
I advised that you should use your mouth
only to eat, did I not?

211
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Chew it well until you die

212
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,440
so you can never open your mouth again.

213
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,310
You must all be very close.

214
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,180
It's nice.

215
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,280
Since we've been friends
since high school.

216
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,680
There's something special
about people who met

217
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,350
during that stage of life.

218
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,290
You can't ignore time. Definitely not.

219
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,690
That's right.

220
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,630
But there's nothing more useless
than time passed

221
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,130
meaninglessly.

222
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,440
Oh no.

223
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,050
Thank you.

224
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,190
May I get a napkin?

225
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,560
- I was upset.
- Woo-yeon.

226
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,870
- I was very upset.
- Let's live happily from now on.

227
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,270
Okay.

228
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,700
Thanks.

229
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,610
Me too. I was very upset too

230
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,240
because I couldn't see you.

231
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,010
- Will you do it again?
- Of course not.

232
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,980
- You jerk.
- "You jerk."

233
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,320
They are Jae-jae and Young-hee.

234
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,419
They're alternate identities that show up
whenever they get drunk.

235
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,899
We don't know them.

236
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,899
Really?

237
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,669
Someone I know also turns into
another person when she gets drunk.

238
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:10,270
I guess she won't be showing up today.
I want to see her.

239
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,210
She won't show up in front of you anymore.

240
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,350
She died.

241
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,580
I sent her away not long ago.

242
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,620
That's not good.

243
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,720
She's the one I fell for.

244
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,890
(Mommy)

245
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,390
Excuse me.

246
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,800
Hi, Mom.

247
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,340
(Tonight)
Hi, Mom.

248
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,510
I didn't drink much.

249
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,910
You'll kill me if I crawl home
on all fours again?

250
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,380
Okay, sure. You gave birth to me
to walk on two feet.

251
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay, I'll be home soon.

252
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,760
Okay.

253
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,170
You didn't leave yet?

254
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,340
I couldn't leave.

255
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,370
I didn't give this to you yet.

256
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,470
What is it?

257
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,710
Happy birthday, Woo-yeon.

258
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,720
Sorry, it's so late.

259
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,850
It's only two days late.

260
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,620
Those two days were too long.

261
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,260
You seem strange today.

262
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,630
Is it because of the hair?

263
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,000
Thanks for noticing.

264
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,240
What happened to your hand?

265
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,910
It's nothing.

266
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,810
Why is everything always "nothing"

267
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
and "nothing serious" with you?

268
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,650
I guess we can't even be friends now.

269
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,680
What?

270
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,950
You said it's rude
to the person you're seeing

271
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,620
to be friends with someone you liked.

272
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,560
Right.

273
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,090
You don't have to go with me
for the shoots if you don't want to.

274
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,660
I'm almost done anyway.

275
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,440
I want to do well on this project.

276
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,470
I have to.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,010
Because it's being published
by your boyfriend's company?

278
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes.

279
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,210
Because people will constantly think
that's why.

280
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,520
I want to show them rather than explain.

281
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,250
I don't want to be humiliated.

282
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,520
So let's go together

283
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,730
to do the shoots.

284
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,500
You stopped me.

285
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
What?

286
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,330
I stopped you.

287
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,170
I was stopped.

288
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,970
That's right.

289
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,340
But can you still shoot
with your hand like that?

290
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,510
I'm going to take a break.

291
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
Call me when it's better.

292
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,990
Bye.

293
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,520
Bye.

294
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,210
Are you done with your call?

295
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,210
Yes.

296
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,350
Let's go back in.

297
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,240
My friends are a bit much, aren't they?

298
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,510
They're normal
when they're with other people.

299
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,140
We're comfortable with each other

300
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,540
because we've known each other
for so long,

301
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,010
Is it like that with the photographer
as well?

302
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,250
You two were friends for a long time too.

303
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Well...

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
They say love is about timing.

305
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,040
Do you know why people say that?

306
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,720
Bye.

308
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Okay.

309
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,830
Hye-won.

310
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
Yes?

311
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,070
- I...
- I like you.

312
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,240
I liked you a lot.

313
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,350
I liked you

314
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,110
for a while.

315
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,020
Sorry. You're just a friend to me.

316
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,490
Joon-soo.

317
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Yes?

318
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,660
You said you wanted to say something.

319
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,260
Have a safe trip.

320
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,230
Is that all?

321
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,540
Stay healthy.

322
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,010
Bye.

323
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,750
(Because it takes courage
to act at that right timing.)

324
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,750
(If you've had opportunities)

325
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,420
(and missed them all...)

326
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,460
If you don't try to reclaim
the timing that was lost,

327
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,860
it means

328
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,360
you lack courage or didn't care enough.

329
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,700
Why are you suddenly...

330
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,100
Just because.

331
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,540
Suddenly just because.

332
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,850
How is my baby so unchanging
after ten years?

333
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,250
Well? Well?

334
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,790
No, I've upgraded.

335
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,960
By the way, what happened to Soo's wrist?

336
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,700
He got into a car accident
near Namsan Tower on Saturday.

337
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,330
What?

338
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,800
What's the matter?

339
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,400
Nothing.

340
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,840
What is it?

341
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,040
Did something happen again?

342
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,780
No, it's nothing.

343
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,550
Young-hee, tell me.

344
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,550
- You should tell me.
- It's nothing like that.

345
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,950
No?

346
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,760
What is it, then?

347
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,200
The thing is...

348
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,600
What?

349
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,500
Why is it always like this for them?

350
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,040
Shouldn't we tell her?

351
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,340
Why? Don't tell her.

352
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,940
Didn't you see Soo?

353
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,010
He was looking so gaunt.

354
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,380
It doesn't matter if he looks gaunt
or if his life is turning into a mess.

355
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,480
Don't get involved
in other people's business.

356
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,850
You're being cold-hearted again.

357
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,420
Soo isn't a stranger.

358
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,860
Yes, he is.

359
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,030
And Woo-yeon is my friend.

360
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,300
I don't want Woo-yeon
to be in bad relationships anymore.

361
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,200
That CEO looked like a good guy.

362
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,770
She finally made up her mind.
I don't want to confuse her.

363
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,680
I don't know.

364
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,780
Woo-yeon is more important to me than Soo.

365
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,790
If he was going to give it to me,
why didn't he give it to me earlier?

366
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,130
I waited for such a long time.

(- Woo-yeon,)
- Hello?

369
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,040
(you're not still waiting for me,
are you?)

370
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,550
What?

371
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,610
(Something suddenly came up,
so I couldn't make it.)

372
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,850
(In case you were waiting...)

373
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,020
I told you

374
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,990
I had plans.

375
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,790
(You didn't go?)

376
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,290
No.

377
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,760
Why?

378
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,860
Why couldn't you make it?

379
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,400
(It's nothing serious.)

380
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,200
(Hello?)

381
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,340
(Woo-yeon.)

382
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,680
It's nothing serious.

383
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,780
Sorry,
I'm with Mr. On now, so I have to go.

- I like it too.

I'm fine. I'm not sleepy anyway.

If you're not sleepy,
should I come over right now?

393

No, you'll get tired.

394

You must not miss me.

395
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,690
I miss you.

I'm a good driver. I'll get there fast.

401
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,140
Fine.

- I told you it's fine.

Sure, it's fine for you.

404

Are you still out of your mind?

If you commit another crime while

You know that, don't you?

Is he the suspect
of the foreign car theft case?

Thank you, and I'm sorry.

Gosh.

439
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,130
I ran out of business cards.
Please give me your phone.

440

How much is he planning to get from me?

It's Tuesday. Is it okay to go shoot?

Yes. It's nothing much.

There you go again.

452
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,330
Now that I think about it,
it's not nothing.

453
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,470
Our shooting schedule was extended
because of this.

454
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,300
You should've been careful.

455
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,470
I like that it'll take longer.

456
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,080
I like that I get to stay longer
in Seoul since I haven't been here.

457

What? It's raining.

You're right.

459
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,540
What do we do? We can't shoot if it rains.

460

Let's wait at a cafe nearby.

461
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,010
It might stop.

462
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Okay.

463
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,519
Hold this for a second.

464
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,950
I don't think it'll stop anytime soon.

465
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:38,749
Let's wait just a little longer.

466
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,120
Okay.

Can you teach me calligraphy?

471

Here.

472
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,330
Someone rude like you

473
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,930
should be written pointy like so.

(Soo)

475
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,070
Ta-da. It resembles you, right?

476
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,470
Didn't I explain it to you already?

477
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,540
I'm not rude.

478
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,140
People often mistake me because
I'm a cold but handsome.

479
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Hey.

480
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,220
Are you okay saying things like that
with your own mouth?

481
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,120
That's why I ask first.

482
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,420
Ask who?

483
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,430
"Dear mirror, who is
the most beautiful person in the world?"

484
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,000
Then the mirror goes,

485
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,460
"You".

486
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Look.

487
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,800
Do you see this line?

488
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,740
Are you ignoring me?

489
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,370
It wasn't worth listening.

490
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,870
Here. Focus.

491
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,850
Take this line as the center
and write your letters.

492
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,820
Press harder where you want
to emphasize like this.

493
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,220
How does it look?

494
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,430
Pretty.

495
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,330
It's pretty, right?

496
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,900
Here, you try it.

497
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,020
Watch me.

498
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,480
Okay.

499
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,050
I'm done.

500
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,050
(I came to Mullae-dong with Kyung Woo-yeon.)
I'm done.

501
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,990
Ta-da.

502
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,320
(I came to Mullae-dong
with Kyung Woo-yeon.)

503
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,660
"I came to Mullae-dong
with Kyung Woo-yeon"?

504
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,060
What is this?

505
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,430
I just want to remember it.

506
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,430
Remember what?

507
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,170
This is a trip for me.

508
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,300
I should take a souvenir from my trip.

509
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,340
Are you leaving again?

510
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,540
The shoot is almost over.

511
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,980
I should go.

512
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,450
It's my job to leave.

513
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,380
Where to?

514
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620
Anywhere.

515
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,890
I no longer have a reason to stay here.

516
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,560
I see.

517
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,470
Who is this?

518
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,070
Hello?

519
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,140
(Am I speaking to Ms. Kyung Woo-yeon?)

520
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,540
Yes, I'm Kyung Woo-yeon.
Who am I speaking to?

521
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,380
(I'm Producer Choi Jung-hyun calling from
Wind Productions.)

522
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,820
The film production company?

523
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,890
I'm Producer Choi Jung-hyun.

524
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,590
I'm Kyung Woo-yeon.

525
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,160
I really liked your calligraphy
for "That Year's In-between Season".

526
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,430
Congratulations on winning.

527
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,770
Thank you.

528
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,040
I already explained briefly
over the phone,

529
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,110
but we would like to ask you
to be in charge

530
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,270
of the title of our film
which is currently in production.

531
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,780
What kind of movie is it?

532
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,440
It's called "The Doll's House".

533
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,480
It's about a doll that gets possessed
by an evil spirit and curses people.

534
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,820
Is it a horror film?

535
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,920
Yes.

536
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,920
Here's the script.

537
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,520
("The Doll's House")

538
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,860
You don't have trouble
watching horror films, do you?

539
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,730
Not at all. I'm a fan of horror films.

540
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,710
That's great.
I look forward to working with you.

541
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,270
Me too.

542
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,890
Woo-yeon.

543
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,130
What?

544
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,330
Didn't you leave?

545
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,860
I figured you'd come out soon.
Where are you going?

546
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,730
I'm going to see Mr. On first.

547
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,800
Get in. I'll drive you.

548
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,940
It's okay.

549
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,710
It's raining. I'll drive you.

550
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,330
(Eunyu Publishing Company)

551
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,510
Aren't you going to drive?

552
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
I am.

553
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,690
Thank you.

554
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,330
Your tteokbokki delivery is here.

555
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,600
You didn't say you were coming.

556
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,940
It's a surprise.

557
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,120
Why aren't you eating?

558
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,080
Actually,

559
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,020
I'm bad with spicy food.

560
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,120
Why didn't you tell me?

561
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,220
It's okay.

562
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,990
I'm full just watching you eat.

563
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,430
My girlfriend is so amazing.
She's going to work on a movie title.

564
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,040
How should I congratulate you?
What would you like?

565
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,210
There's no need to buy me another gift.

566
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,270
You just bought me a pair of shoes.

567
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,680
I have a feeling you don't like the shoes.

568
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,510
You never wear them.

569
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,950
It's not that.

570
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,150
They're too pretty.

571
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm saving them.

572
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,090
Don't save anything.

573
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,890
I can fill anything you lack.

574
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,090
I'm not that frugal.

575
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,300
You tend to be frugal
with giving your heart.

576
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,300
Visit every now and then just like today.

577
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,630
What are you doing two days from now?

578
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,690
I have a shoot.

579
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,500
I see.

580
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,600
Let's go watch a movie after the shoot.

581
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,670
I got tickets for winning the contest.

582
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,240
That's awesome.

583
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,240
How is someone this cool my girlfriend?

584
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,850
You don't hold back.

585
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,420
I wasn't kidding.

586
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,790
- Sorry.
- Just kidding. Eat up.

587
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,590
Okay.

588
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,700
Are you taunting me? It finally stopped.

589
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,020
I said I wanted pork backbone stew.

590
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,720
I have a knife.

591
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,730
Why do you keep buying me food
at places like this?

592
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,060
So you don't panic later.

593
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,600
When you go out with friends in college

594
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,300
or on a date with a girl,

595
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,900
don't be obvious
about not going to places like this.

596
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,270
Don't panic or get intimidated.

597
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,340
So be grateful and eat
when your sister treats you.

598
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,410
You are such a show off.

599
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,120
Why you little twerp.

600
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,850
I'm not a kid.

601
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,590
Look at this runt act tough.

602
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,220
I'm all grown up.

603
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,130
You've done enough, so stop.

604
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,960
Take care of yourself now.

605
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,570
I'm 12 years older than you, punk.

606
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,110
Eat.

607
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,290
Darn it.

608
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,400
It's so hard to make a living.

- Is someone getting married?
- Ms. Kim.

615
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,020
My sister is getting married soon.

616
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,320
With her long-term boyfriend?

617
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,830
With someone else.

618
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:29,100
Actually, he said
he didn't want to get married.

619
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,900
What's wrong with him?

620
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,200
He should've told her
if he didn't want to get married.

621
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,170
My sister had no idea
and just kept waiting.

622
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,800
(This station is Sillim.)

623
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,090
I'm really, really sorry.

624
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,360
I swear I left home on time,

625
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,890
but I dozed off and missed my stop.

626
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,300
I'm really sorry. Are you very angry?

627
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,630
- Why would I be angry?
- What?

628
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,030
Because I'm half an hour late.

629
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,940
It's okay. It happens.

630
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,210
Hey. Just get mad.

631
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,540
You're scaring me.

632
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,510
But I'm not mad. What?
Should I force myself?

633
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,620
Why are you wearing heels?
Won't your feet hurt?

634
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,680
They're low, so it's okay.

635
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,990
I wanted to wear them on my date later
since Mr. On bought them for me.

636
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:02,790
Don't you think about the person waiting?

637
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,990
Why were you late?
You were late by half an hour.

638
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,730
Hey.

639
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,930
Are you forcing yourself to be mad?

640
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,800
Yes, I'm getting very angry.

641
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,810
That little...
He seriously needs to see a doctor.

642
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,610
He has rage issues.

643
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,210
Darn it. That scared me half to death.

644
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,350
My bad.

645
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,420
Why are you so jumpy?

646
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,450
You try being tormented by a ghost
all night long.

647
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,320
Did you become friends with a ghost?

648
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,690
I'm about to.

649
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,560
I'm working on a movie,

650
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,230
and it had to be a horror movie.

651
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,900
Evil spirits that possess dolls.

652
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,530
I'm a scaredy cat.

653
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,740
- Is that funny?
- Yes, it is.

654
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,510
You're so mean.

655
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,600
Just once.

656
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,240
What did you say?

657
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,480
Something useless.

658
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,140
Here you go.

659
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,210
Thank you very much
for letting me install security cameras.

660
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:03,340
You paid for it.

661
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:04,880
I have no reason to oppose.

662
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,410
But why did you suddenly
want to install cameras?

663
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,850
Someone said she was scared
of going to the bathroom.

664
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,650
Your girlfriend?

665
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,420
No, just a friend.

666
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,690
A girl, though.

667
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,020
- Yes.
- So she is your girlfriend.

668
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,190
No, she's just a friend.

669
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,470
Here's your taro milk tea.

670
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,140
You must like taro milk tea.

671
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,740
Yes, well...

672
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,410
It's you, right? The car accident.

673
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,080
You must remember this time.

674
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,380
So you work here.

675
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,680
Did you go to the hospital?

676
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,520
I really wasn't hurt.

677
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:48,790
You didn't hit me.

678
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,760
Still. Go to the hospital.
Call me once you do.

679
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,690
Can I not call you

680
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,230
if I don't?

681
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,030
What?

682
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,070
I'll go to the hospital and then call you.

683
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,600
I promise.

684
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,610
Even cafes work hard
on client management these days.

685
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,450
It's hard to make a living.

686
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,460
(Shin Printing)

687
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,590
Where did you go?

688
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,500
- What are you...
- Stay still.

689
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,570
It's all raw.

690
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,110
That must hurt.

691
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,450
- I'll...
- I'll do it.

692
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,120
Idiot. You didn't even say anything.

693
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,860
I thought I'd hold you back.

694
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,260
Going on a date
and pretty shoes are nice and all,

695
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,800
but you should wear comfortable shoes.

696
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,280
I'm sure he won't want you hurting either.

697
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,490
Why is your heart racing?

698
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,460
It is?

699
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,530
Do you have...

700
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,700
a heart condition?

701
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,100
What?

702
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,270
Yes, well...

703
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,840
It's hereditary.

704
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,350
You have a weak heart, a weak back...

705
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,710
Why are you so frail?

706
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:05,780
What? Frail? Hey. I'm super healthy, okay?

707
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,350
Why are you getting so upset?

708
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,920
Don't. You look sad.

709
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:17,260
If your heart races so well,
why was it so calm with me?

710
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,570
What about you? Why are you so calm?

711
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,610
Do you want to get ice cream?

712
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,440
- Sweetie.
- Yes?

713
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,410
I can't get married right away.

714
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,570
Because we don't have money?

715
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,080
Yes, because we don't have money.

716
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,510
Is that the only problem?

717
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,920
Yes, not having money.
That's the only issue,

718
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,920
but that one issue creates
too many problems when you're married.

719
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,530
I'm sure

720
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,530
you can only guess,

721
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:28,830
but my family

722
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,900
is poor.

723
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,810
A single mom,

724
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,540
a brother who's a sophomore
in high school,

725
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,810
there's a lot that I'm responsible for.

726
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,850
I laid it all out now.

727
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,420
You can run away if you want.

728
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,260
It's not that you want to run away?

729
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,030
What?

730
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,900
Unless you want to run away

731
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,400
because you're afraid you'll be miserable
for the rest of your life with me,

732
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,610
don't say that.

733
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,350
But you want to get married.

734
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,160
I want to marry you.

735
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,800
Living with someone else
for the rest of my life is a punishment.

736
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,600
Don't punish me.

737
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,700
Don't leave me.

738
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,430
Okay?

739
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,410
Okay.

740
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,390
Hello, Mr. On.

741
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,260
(Sorry.)

742
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,860
(I'm having dinner with reporters.
and I think)

743
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,370
(I'll have to drink with them afterward.)

744
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Mr. On.

745
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,100
Aren't you coming in?

746
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,540
I'm coming.

747
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,210
He has an urgent call.

748
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,540
I'm very sorry.

749
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,680
(I'll try to finish
as quickly as possible.)

750
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,580
So let's meet up at least briefly later.

751
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,880
It's okay.

752
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,820
I can watch the movie alone,
so don't worry.

753
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,950
(Sorry.)

754
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,320
I'll call you later.

755
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,520
(Okay.)

756
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,660
(It has been way too long.)

757
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,010
Soo.

758
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,980
I'm going up.

759
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,700
What do you think about this
for the concept?

760
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,900
"When one cycle ends, another begins."

761
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:18,070
What do you think?

762
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,970
Since this town was famous for ironwork
and abandoned factories,

763
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,010
but now people come for different reasons.

764
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,140
Mullae-dong's artists' village,

765
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,780
and the cafes of Seongsu-dong.

766
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,980
Not bad, right?

767
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,620
Are you totally fine now?

768
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,050
About what?

769
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,760
Do you not have

770
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,460
even little crumbs of feelings
left for me?

771
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,700
You thought I'd like only you,

772
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,270
so you're disappointed
that I like someone else, aren't you?

773
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,600
It's not like that.

774
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,540
Don't get mad.

775
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,440
I know

776
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,740
you would never feel things like that
toward me.

777
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,010
I know better than anyone.

778
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,490
Was I...

779
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,590
a big jerk to you?

780
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,660
It wasn't you.

781
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,630
I was the jerk...

782
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:22,700
to myself.

783
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,100
I made myself get used to
watching you walk away.

784
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,870
I added injury on top of injury.

785
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,580
I knew, but I ignored it.

786
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,610
I was hung up...

787
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,620
on someone who would never love me.

788
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:49,960
It's such a relief

789
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,860
that you didn't come that night.

790
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,950
Is he picking you up?

791
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,620
Something came up at work.

792
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,150
You seem disappointed.

793
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,420
What can he do?

794
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,890
He's busy. He's a CEO after all.

795
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,400
You hurt your foot for nothing.

796
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,130
I know, right?

797
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,840
Are you going home? I'll drive you.

798
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,140
No. I got movie tickets,
so I'm going to watch one by myself.

799
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:36,210
I'll drive you there then.

800
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,010
- Do you want to watch it with me?
- Yes.

801
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,620
You sound like
you were waiting for me to ask.

802
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,550
True, you like watching movies.

803
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,890
I do. Yes, I do.

804
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,930
Let's go, fill-in.

805
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,430
What? Fill-in?

806
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,100
If you don't like that,
should I call you "spare"?

807
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,730
That's the same thing.

808
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:02,730
Forget it then.

809
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:06,870
I won't forget it.

810
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:09,970
Let's go.

811
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,180
I don't want to forget it.

812
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,050
That's right. My shoes.

813
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,690
- Leave them.
- What?

814
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,390
You'll lose them if you carry them around.

815
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,230
Leave them there.
I'll drive you home later.

816
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,100
Okay.

817
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,940
She's always careless,
but she doesn't forget his gift.

818
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,980
The movie won't start for a while.

819
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,980
- Do you want popcorn?
- Caramel popcorn and soda.

820
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,750
You sound like
you were waiting for me to ask.

821
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,820
It's the proper setting to watch a movie.

822
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,990
Wait here.

823
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:09,500
Large caramel popcorn and a soda please.

824
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:11,100
Give me a minute.

825
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,610
Thank you.

826
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,210
Mr. On.

827
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,220
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I said I'd call.

828
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,550
I put my phone in my bag.

829
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,360
How are you here?
You said you couldn't make it.

830
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,030
I ran away to go on a date with you.

831
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,560
We're not too late for the movie, are we?

832
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,030
No, we still have some time.

833
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,540
Is this...

834
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,340
I'll get going.

835
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,320
Do you want popcorn?

836
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,490
I need to run to the bathroom.

837
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,630
Woo-yeon...

838
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,520
- Hello?
(- Stop.)

839
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,690
- What?
(- I said to stop.)

840
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,240
Why did you just leave?
How could you leave like that?

841
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,140
You gave me the look to go home.

842
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,180
- That wasn't it.
- If not?

843
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,580
Do you want to go in with me?
And leave him?

844
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,400
Why did you run after me
just to dump me twice?

845
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,440
Like you'd ever be dumped by someone.

846
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,570
I think I would.

847
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,320
- What are you doing?
- Losing him.

848
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,030
- What?
- He's outside.

849
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,500
He won't like it
if he knows you're with me.

850
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,720
Do you really like him?

851
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,790
I asked, do you really like him?

852
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,750
I like you.

853
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,130
(I think your curse
transferred over to me)

854
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,230
(that day.)

855
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,820
I like you. I wanted to tell you that.

856
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,730
Just once.

857
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,470
What did you say?

858
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,940
Something useless.

859
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:44,110
(Tonight)
