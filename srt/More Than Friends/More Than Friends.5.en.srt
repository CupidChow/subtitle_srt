1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,510
Don't go.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,990
Don't go out with him.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,860
I don't want you seeing him.

4
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,870
Do you realize what you're saying?

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,940
I do.

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,850
I'm stopping you from going right now.

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,120
You said you only had
bad relationships because of me.

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,420
You said you can't like anyone else
but me.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,760
You said that's why you're unhappy.

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,260
I feel responsible for what you said.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,130
So don't date just anyone
when you don't even like...

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,770
Who says? Who says I don't like him?

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,770
Who says he's just anyone?

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,670
He's a good man. That's why
I think I might be able to like him.

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,610
So

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,910
you don't have to feel responsible

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,880
nor do you have the right to tell me
whom I can date.

18
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,550
We're just

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,360
friends.

20
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,680
You still have a bad habit

21
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,250
of confusing people.

22
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:56,530
(Prosecutor Han Jin-ju)

23
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,840
(Shin Dong-hoon sent you
a wedding invitation.)

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,710
How could he send me
his wedding invitation?

25
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,350
(Why not?)

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,479
It's not like you two dated.

27
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,990
Were you guys even checking?

28
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,750
Do you think we were friends
because I wanted it?

29
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,260
A relationship is not something
that can be bought with money.

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,790
It needs to be mutual.

31
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,500
Exactly. He was someone you liked once.
So why are you so attached?

32
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,970
There's one thing that makes me
really angry.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,940
While everyone else dates
several people and gets married,

34
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,610
why am I constantly alone?

35
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,610
Why am I always alone?

36
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,040
I tried dating several guys,
and there isn't much to it.

37
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,910
Just look at me. I'm alone now.

38
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,420
Us single people should get a drink.

39
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,850
Right now?

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,050
(Yes. Should I go over to your place,
or are you out?)

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,460
Well...

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,760
I have plans.

43
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,229
(With who?)

44
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,300
(Is it Mr. On?)

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,729
Yes. Why don't you try calling Young-hee?

46
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,640
That's okay. Enjoy your date.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,370
Okay.

48
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,740
And she told me she's alone.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,110
Why are you waiting outside?

50
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,650
To do this.

51
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,410
Are you hungry?
Let's go to eat something nice.

52
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,890
(Objects in mirror
are closer than they appear.)

53
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,960
(I always have bad relationships.)

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,470
I dated just anyone
without liking any of them.

55
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,300
I can't like anyone else
ever since I liked you.

56
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,040
It's too hard for me.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,840
I feel responsible for what you said.

58
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,640
You don't have to feel responsible

59
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,140
nor do you have the right to tell me
whom I can date.

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,850
(We're just)

61
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,080
(friends.)

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
(Unlucky Young-hee)

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,130
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

65
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,300
- Hey!
(- The person you have reached)

66
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,570
(- is not available.)
- Fine, just hang up.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
(Please leave a message...)

68
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,410
(Jin-ju)
Hey, cheers.

69
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,080
By the way, how do you manage
not to fight with your boyfriend?

70
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,650
We're fighting even now.

71
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,850
How do you look so indifferent?
Doesn't it bother you?

72
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,420
We've dated for 10 years.

73
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,450
Our patterns have been fixed.

74
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,490
I know about when he's over his anger,

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,630
and when I should
send a signal to make up.

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,260
Also, I know when I should
just ignore it and get past it.

77
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,970
I see.

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,570
Ms. Kim,
did you fight with your boyfriend?

79
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,400
- No.
- I have ears. I can hear you.

80
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,570
You just said you had a fight.

81
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,910
Your ears are unnecessarily sharp.

82
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,080
This is a compliment.

83
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,210
Yes. I have good hearing, don't I?

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Yes.

85
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,490
You should just apologize to him.

86
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,790
Who would you date if not him?
You've dated him for 10 years.

87
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,890
What do you mean by that?

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,330
Let's be honest.

89
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,560
If you've dated him for 10 years,
you're practically half-married.

90
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,960
Who'd date you?

91
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,500
It'll be hard for you to find someone new.

92
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,970
Don't you agree?

93
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,840
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,040
- My glass is full already.
- Please pour me a glass.

95
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,780
Okay. Cheers.

96
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,280
Let's drink.

97
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,820
Do you not like the food?

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,260
No, it's good.

99
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,530
When we're done, should we
do something that can cheer you up?

100
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,300
What do you like to do, Ms. Kyung?

101
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,150
I think you're a good man.

102
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,280
I hope that will change into
"a man you like".

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,420
If it was me in the past,

104
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,690
I would've dated you.

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,260
I don't dislike you,

106
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,860
and I might get my hopes up
thinking I could end up liking you.

107
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,700
You should get your hopes up
this time too.

108
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,370
But getting my hopes up
always betrayed me.

109
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't want to be
in bad relationships anymore.

110
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,340
It might not
turn out to be a bad relationship.

111
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,080
I won't be able

112
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,880
to have a good relationship.

113
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,880
Then how about doing a test?

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,950
Let's see if you're able to have
a good relationship or not.

115
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,360
I'll be the man you can test on.

116
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:34,600
I won't do something like that.

117
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,200
You said you don't dislike me.

118
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,270
You said you might even have had
your hopes up.

119
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,510
If you're rejecting me for me, I'm fine.

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,010
You already rejected me,

121
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,480
but despite that, I'm the one
who's still clinging onto you.

122
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,620
Any heartbreaks I have to face
is something I'll deal with.

123
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,950
Don't think too much.

124
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,560
If I bring you a good enough reason,

125
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,890
meet with me just like now.

126
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,160
Then at a certain point,
you'll learn to like me.

127
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,430
Because I'll make that happen.

128
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,000
You sound so confident
that I almost trust you.

129
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm just acting like I am

130
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,670
so you'd trust me.

131
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,480
- You should eat.
- Okay.

132
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,190
Can you grab something from the backseat
for me?

133
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,960
Sure.

134
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,260
It's a bribe

135
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,660
to make you like me.

136
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,280
(Tonight)

137
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,750
Gosh. What is it?

138
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,820
I can tell right away
that something's bothering you.

139
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,090
Hey, get that frown off your face

140
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,920
and tell me what's on your mind.

141
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,560
Am I really that unattractive?

142
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,630
- Do I lack a lot?
- What is this?

143
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,400
So many guys like Woo-yeon,

144
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,770
and Young-hee gets overflowing love
from Hyun-jae.

145
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,030
Why am I alone?

146
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,400
Why am I the only one alone?

147
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,000
Why are you blaming yourself?

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,710
You just haven't met the one yet.

149
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,570
It's not your fault.

150
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,640
Also, being single is awesome.

151
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,410
What's so good about it?

152
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,980
It's so relaxing.
You have more time and money.

153
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,290
That's why you're eligible to drink

154
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,650
this top-grade traditional liquor,

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,760
but you don't have to drink it
if you don't want to.

156
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,830
Why are you always so full of anger?

157
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,800
What? Perfect timing.
I would've died if it wasn't for you.

158
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,630
You're visiting often these days.

159
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,770
Is it a trend for you guys to ignore me?

160
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,940
- We always ignored you.
- Is it a habit of yours to ignore me?

161
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm just surprised
you only realized it now.

162
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,110
Darn you.

163
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,210
- Beer.
- I'm not serving you.

164
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,550
Aren't you going back to Jeju Island?

165
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,680
Just go anywhere. Hurry up and leave.

166
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,250
Does she hate me?

167
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,620
I'm just surprised
you only realized it now.

168
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,900
I wonder if Woo-yeon is enjoying her date.

169
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,900
Is she dating again?

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's a really good catch.

171
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,930
His face is... He's got money...

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,740
- He's a speedster. Vroom.
- "He's a speedster. Vroom"?

173
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
Also, he's such a warm person.

174
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,710
They look really good together.

175
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,650
Hey. How could a prosecutor
have no sense of justice?

176
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,080
Save him. Set him free.

177
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,420
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,230
What does he do?

179
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,330
I don't know.

180
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,860
Do you guys think
you can abuse me this way?

181
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm shocked that you just realized that.

182
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,930
Seriously.

183
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,500
"He's a speedster. Vroom."
Is he a racing driver?

184
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,770
(Tonight)

185
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,110
Oh, wait. I don't smoke.

186
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,280
Wait. Hold on.

187
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,150
Has anyone ever bought
concert tickets before?

188
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,390
Haven't you?

189
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,430
I...

190
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,730
What?

191
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,630
From the moment he finds out
you can do it,

192
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
it'll always be your job.

193
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,710
Sir. Didn't you say...

194
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,910
you went to the Red Velvet concert
last time?

195
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,280
You have to be a big fan
to get those tickets.

196
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,680
- Totally.
- You're so cool.

197
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,520
You're so cool.

198
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,620
Really? Then help me.

199
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,460
My daughter is nagging me
to get her NCT concert tickets.

200
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,260
Sure. Tell me the date, and I'll...

201
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay, good. Let's drink!

202
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,330
Yes.

203
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,070
(Jin-ju)

204
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,110
Hello?

205
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,350
You need to get over here.

206
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,450
Hey!

207
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,490
Jin-ju is plastered. She's a total mess.

208
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,060
- She is? Why?
(- Stop it.)

209
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,820
(- No.
- I don't know.)

210
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,590
She's grabbing his collar
and saying not to make you cry.

211
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,760
Okay, I'll be right there.

212
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,960
(Stay still. Hurry up.)

213
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,230
Is something wrong?

214
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,040
I need to stop by somewhere.

215
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,780
Sure.

216
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,080
I can drive you to the door.

217
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,990
It's okay. It's a narrow alley,
so it's easier just to walk.

218
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,250
I'll wait if you're going to be quick.

219
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,120
It's okay. I'm sure my friend
brought her car.

220
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,430
I thought we had become a little closer.

221
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,230
Don't you think you're saying "no"
way too much? No?

222
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,030
Get home safely.

223
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Bye.

224
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,050
When will she come closer?

225
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,380
Good night, sir.

226
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,720
- Good night.
- Good night.

227
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,320
Wait!

228
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,360
Guys.

229
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,760
We should go for round three. Round three.

230
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,500
Round three.

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,630
- Round three.
- Round three.

232
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
- We've been waiting for you to say that.
- Round three.

233
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,300
- Round three.
- Let's go.

234
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,900
Round three.

235
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,540
- Let's go!
- Should we go there?

236
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,770
- There?
- Sure.

237
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,580
How long do we have to stay out?

238
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm tired.

239
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,890
Did you drink a lot?

240
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,860
How did you know I was here?

241
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,630
You texted me to come.

242
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,400
You always go to Kkotsuni's
for pork belly with work people.

243
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,930
And you always go
to the karaoke here afterward.

244
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,870
You're so sly.

245
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,470
I wasn't being sly.

246
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,350
Sorry. I repented a lot.

247
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,180
How much?

248
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,950
Enough not to do it again.

249
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,590
I'll be especially nice
and forgive you just this once.

250
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Okay.

251
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,430
- Sweetie.
- Yes?

252
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,300
Should I go to your place
for some instant noodles?

253
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,000
- Tonight?
- Yes.

254
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,270
Want to?

255
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,370
What?

256
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,700
Let's go.

257
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,180
Seriously, how did you know?

258
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,610
I know everything.

259
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,450
What took you so long?

260
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,720
Where's Jin-ju?

261
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,790
Hey! Jin-ju!

262
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,660
Jin-ju!

263
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,990
Why did you let her drink so much?

264
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,530
What? This girl drinks like a fish.

265
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,500
And how could a prosecutor be so violent?

266
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,230
Do you know how much she beat up Soo?

267
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,570
Take a look when he comes in.

268
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,500
Here he is. Gosh.

269
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,210
Tell your friend that she'll be sitting
in the defendant's seat

270
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,210
instead of the prosecutor's seat tomorrow.

271
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,580
Why are you being so mean?

272
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,350
Jin-ju, wake up.

273
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,890
You. Let go of me.

274
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,560
If you make it hard for Woo-yeon again,
I'll kill you.

275
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,900
If you make Woo-yeon cry again,

276
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,400
as a prosecutor

277
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,640
and as Woo-yeon's friend,
I will not forgive you!

278
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,770
Are you Sailor Moon?

279
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,310
Are you insane? Hey. Get it together.

280
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,050
You have no idea how precious Woo-yeon is.

281
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,450
She's not going to make it.
Put her on my back.

282
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,990
- Jin-ju.
- Put her on my back.

283
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,590
All right.

284
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,660
Grab her phone and bag.

285
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,760
Okay.

286
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,660
Goodness.

287
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,060
Move.

288
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,630
Your head.

289
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,580
I can't leave the bar, so I'll go back in.

290
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,950
Get home safely.

291
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,250
Call me.

292
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,320
Okay.

293
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,450
I'll go with you.

294
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,420
- Why?
- To file a complaint against Jin-ju.

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,610
How was your date?

296
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,210
Good.

297
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,840
Woo-yeon.

298
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,910
Yes?

299
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,580
Did you cry because of me?

300
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,750
Yes.

301
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,380
- What?
- Did you cry because of me?

302
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,090
Jin-ju said earlier

303
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,260
that she'll kill me
if I make you cry again.

304
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,460
What's wrong with you?

305
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,730
Why are you listening to a drunk person?

306
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,440
They say you're the most honest
when you're drunk.

307
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,670
More people say nonsense
when they're drunk.

308
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,510
That's how people are.

309
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,150
What is Soo thinking?

310
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,780
Does he talk about Woo-yeon?

311
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,650
No. You know how he is.

312
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,590
He's always emotionless and quiet.

313
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,320
It's impossible to tell
what he's thinking.

314
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,660
I could never date someone like that.
It would be infuriating.

315
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,630
Here.

316
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,130
Don't worry.
I'll be the last guy in your life.

317
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,770
But do you know something?

318
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,200
You don't talk about yourself much either.

319
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,440
We've been going out for 10 years,

320
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,640
but I still don't know much about you.

321
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,650
Didn't you know? That's my thing.
To be mysterious.

322
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,190
How much more attractive
do you plan to be?

323
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,760
- But Sweetie.
- Yes?

324
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,940
Are we going to be good and only eat?

325
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,670
Can't we do it after we eat?
I don't want to waste food.

326
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,690
Hello, ma'am.

327
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,760
Sorry about this again, Woo-yeon.

328
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,030
Don't be. It's totally fine.

329
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,330
She can't date, so all she does is drink.

330
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,700
She isn't poor, unemployed,

331
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,440
uneducated, or ugly.

332
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,770
Why can't she find a boyfriend at her age?

333
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,780
It's your fault.

334
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,040
My mom told me I could date

335
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,680
people like Gang Dong-won
or Zo In-sung when I go to college.

336
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,520
How is finding a guy

337
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,220
harder than getting into Seoul National
University or passing the bar exam?

338
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,860
She refuses to be set up.

339
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,490
She's impossible.

340
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,890
Now that she's old,
she's causing her mom grief.

341
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,430
You made her that way.

342
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,230
My mom said I could meet guys

343
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,330
like Hyun Bin and Lee Min-ho
if I pass the bar.

344
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,540
I'll get going now.

345
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,910
It's late. Get home safely.

346
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,140
Thank you. Good night.

347
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,210
Bye.

348
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,710
Thanks.

349
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,780
My pleasure.

350
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,690
What took you so long?

351
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,430
What serious conversation were you having
with someone who's passed out?

352
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,760
You didn't leave yet?

353
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,000
How could I?

354
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,270
How else? Hop in a cab.

355
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,270
It's not like I don't know how.

356
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,770
How could I leave you?
It's dangerous at night.

357
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,840
What if something happens to you
after I leave?

358
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,180
I don't want to feel guilty
because of you.

359
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,850
Why does everything have to be
centered around you?

360
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,890
Do you think the earth rotates for you?

361
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,990
Does it not?

362
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,790
Let's go.

363
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,840
(If you make it hard for Woo-yeon again,
I'll kill you.)

364
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,510
(He's a good man.)

365
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,850
(That's why
I think I might be able to like him.)

366
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,300
Right, the bouquet.

367
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,100
Hold on.

368
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,030
Pass me the bouquet.

369
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,840
Do you choose when to be forgetful?
Why didn't you forget this?

370
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,680
I'm using the empty space I have well
after erasing my memories of you.

371
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,710
Thank you.

372
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,430
Why am I getting the chills?

373
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,410
Since when were you standing here?

374
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,080
Are you cheating?

375
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,840
Or did you break up already?

376
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,110
It's not like that.

377
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,180
How did you even see his face
when it's so dark?

378
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,680
His face was shining even when it's dark.

379
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,250
You have such a low standard.

380
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,390
You and I have similar taste.

381
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,290
This is all your fault, then.

382
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,830
Gosh.

383
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,370
She's always taking it out on me
whenever she gets bored.

384
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,070
Goodness.

385
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,800
Goodness.

386
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,410
Why bother when I'm going to wear it soon?

387
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,150
I don't want wrinkles
since you're going to wear it.

388
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,080
How sweet. You're so sweet.

389
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,520
If you find me so sweet,
why won't you take me?

390
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,890
Because I'm scared of making you
work too hard.

391
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,630
I'm serious right now.

392
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,560
I don't want to be serious right now.

393
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,000
Aren't you going to marry me?

394
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,330
If I get married, it'll be with you.

395
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,770
And I'm going to get married.

396
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Then why do you avoid the subject
whenever I bring it up?

397
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm not avoiding it.

398
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,340
Don't you know this year's unlucky for me?

399
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,190
(Prosecutors' Office)

400
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,060
I'd be a dog if I get drunk again.

401
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,790
Prosecutor Han.

402
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,530
Yes. Hello.

403
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
Did you drink a lot yesterday?

404
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,170
Yes, a little.

405
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,430
I mean a lot.

406
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,570
Drink this.

407
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
(Hangover Drink)

408
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,110
Did you drink yesterday too?

409
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,180
No. I had it with me.
It looked like you drank.

410
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,210
Thank you.

411
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,180
Don't drink too much.
You'll ruin your health.

412
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,660
Even the bottle is green.

413
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,170
This is a sign, isn't it?

414
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,640
He's a really awesome guy.

415
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,770
He...

416
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,370
What is this? Why aren't you talking?

417
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,410
You're the one who drank,

418
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
but I'm the one who's sick.

419
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,380
Are you sick? How?

420
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,190
I'm aching all over.

421
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,650
Did you see a doctor?

422
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,220
I can only move my mouth right now.

423
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,630
What about your parents?

424
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,270
(Woo-yeon,
we're going to the southern sea.)

425
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,040
What should we do?
I won't finish until late today.

426
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,070
- Call Young-hee and...
(- Forget it.)

427
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,710
She must be busy too.

428
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,680
I'll feel better after some rest.

429
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,490
Okay.

430
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,460
(Jin-ju)

431
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,470
(What should we do
about this week's shoot?)

432
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,070
(Message from Lee Soo)

433
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,250
(Eunyu Publishing Company)

434
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,220
- Mr. On.
- Yes?

435
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,380
Should we go
to the reunion together today?

436
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,920
I can't go.

437
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,860
Why not?

438
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,420
I'm doing a test.

439
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,330
I see. I'll get going.

440
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,550
(What should we do
about this week's shoot?)

441
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,950
She didn't even read my text.

442
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,150
Ms. Kyung missed work today
because she's sick.

443
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,020
I think she has serious fatigue.

444
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,550
I see.

445
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,190
Thank you.

446
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,620
So many people are looking for her today.

447
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,360
A handsome young man came by earlier
and asked about her too.

448
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,870
I thought he was her boyfriend.

449
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,410
He's not her boyfriend.

450
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,710
Hello?

451
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,980
(I heard you're sick.
Did you go to the hospital?)

452
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,660
Is it evening already?

453
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,490
(You didn't eat or take any medicine,
right?)

454
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,490
I was sleeping.

455
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,370
Come out so we can go to the hospital.

456
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,100
What?

457
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,410
I'm in front of your place.

458
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,570
That's impossible.

459
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,440
I can't.

460
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,650
I know women don't like it when guys visit

461
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,250
without any notice and they don't have
the time to get ready,

462
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,020
but you should see a doctor
and eat some food too.

463
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm okay.

464
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm really okay.

465
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,530
(I'm not okay with it.)

466
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm not okay with it either.

467
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,360
(I won't look at you.)

468
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,030
I'll just look forward and drive,
so let's go to a hospital together.

469
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,480
Wait until she comes out.
She said she would.

470
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,250
I'm saying this because
she still hasn't come out.

471
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,450
If she fainted,
are you going to be responsible?

472
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,790
Yes, I'll be responsible.

473
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,120
Woo-yeon.

474
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,260
Ms. Kyung, are you okay?

475
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,830
What are you two doing here?

476
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,330
- Let's go to the hospital.
- Let's go to the hospital.

477
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,870
Don't you see the driver waiting?

478
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,570
That's why you should take it back home.

479
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,110
I was here first.

480
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,580
Ms. Kyung, are you okay?

481
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,780
- Come with me.
- No, come with me.

482
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,680
Hey.

483
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,350
I'd rather have both of you leave.

484
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,290
I'll take that taxi.

485
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,790
You can't go alone.

486
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,460
He's right. Come with me.

487
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,530
She says she wants to take the taxi.

488
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,100
- That's not what she meant.
- Stop it.

489
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,970
Both of you.

490
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,040
Can you both just leave?

491
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,710
I have a huge headache.

492
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,310
Ms. Kyung.

493
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,680
Jin-ju.

494
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,860
Get your hand off her.

495
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,230
Is that you, Mr. On?

496
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,030
I heard a lot about you from Woo-yeon.

497
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,330
Hello, I'm On Joon-soo.

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm sorry, but I'll take her today.

499
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,070
Okay. Please take good care of her.

500
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,190
What is this combination?
Why are they together?

501
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,060
I don't know either.

502
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,060
Why are you sick? It makes me feel bad.

503
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,990
Because you couldn't boast?

504
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,360
Yes. Today is a historical day.

505
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,700
Why do you have to be sick?

506
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,670
My ears are ringing.

507
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,080
By the way...

508
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,880
Gosh.

509
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,820
I don't know why I'm asking this, but...

510
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,490
Then don't ask.

511
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,990
I thought you two weren't dating yet.
Isn't it overacting

512
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,290
to come to her house?

513
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,530
Don't worry about that.

514
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,130
We decided to have a relationship.

515
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,610
To me, it's you who's overreacting

516
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,310
as a friend.

517
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,650
Or

518
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,820
do you like Ms. Kyung?

519
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,460
No, I don't.

520
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,730
I told you, we're just friends.

521
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,530
Great.

522
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,430
I hope you'll keep your word.

523
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Bye.

524
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,350
Are you better now?

525
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,720
Yes, totally.

526
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,590
How did you manage to come?
I thought you had work until late.

527
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,690
I finished early
because I was worried about you.

528
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,360
Am I the best or what?

529
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,530
You appeared just in time.

530
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,200
Yes. Why were you hesitating then?

531
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,770
You should've left with Mr. On.

532
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,000
I wasn't hesitating.

533
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,670
I just wasn't myself.

534
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,760
It's a bag of tangerines.

535
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,830
I bet Mr. On left them.

536
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,800
He's so caring.
Tangerines are your favorite.

537
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,970
There's some porridge too.

538
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,400
Let me heat it up for you. Let's go eat.

539
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,389
I enjoyed the porridge.

540
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,530
I'm glad.

541
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,130
I'm sorry about earlier.

542
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,900
I showed up without calling,

543
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,329
and I created a commotion.

544
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,599
Don't show up unexpected like that again.

545
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm sorry.

546
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,280
I got too worried that my emotions
got the best of me.

547
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,710
I don't want you to see me

548
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,950
when I'm not ready.

549
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,820
You were still pretty.

550
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,690
You promised not to look.

551
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,690
I couldn't help it

552
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,090
since you're so pretty.

553
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,460
How did you know I like tangerines?

554
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,700
"Tangerines"?

555
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,770
Yes. Tangerines are my favorite.

556
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,640
It looks like

557
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,280
they were from someone else.

558
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,530
- What are you doing?
- You said they're from Soo.

559
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,690
Don't eat them.

560
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,300
The tangerines are innocent.

561
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,570
By the way, he's so strange.

562
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
Those eyes...

563
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,370
They were the eyes of a man.

564
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,710
Don't make the wrong guess again.

565
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,640
You said the same thing 10 years ago.

566
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,540
You told me he likes me.

567
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,880
That's because he acted...

568
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,250
I guess no one knows how he feels.

569
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,020
I guess not.

570
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,920
I don't care. That's enough.
Stop talking about him.

571
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,160
You're the one who started it.

572
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,090
How are things going with Mr. On?
Are you going to date him?

573
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,500
Well...

574
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,100
Yes, for now.

575
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,200
What is that?

576
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,840
What? Why are you suddenly smiling?

577
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,040
Mr. On told me

578
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,240
to test him.

579
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,440
- Do what?
- Test him.

580
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,210
I told him I've only had
bad relationships,

581
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,850
and he said I should use him
to test myself

582
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,120
to see if I can have a better relationship
or not.

583
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,720
Isn't he a strange guy?

584
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,730
He's the ideal guy.

585
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,900
I think he's a good guy.

586
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,770
Yes. Forget about Soo completely.

587
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,010
He's going to leave anyway.

588
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,170
I'll only work with him.

589
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,410
If nothing happens.

590
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,190
How come she won't even text me
after making me leave like that?

591
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,200
(360 Donggyo-ro)

592
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,440
Who parked in front of our house?

593
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,450
Hey.

594
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,460
Get in.

595
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,070
Where did you get this car?

596
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,710
I bought it.

597
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,210
Are you planning to stay in Korea?

598
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,340
For now.

599
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,240
- Why?
- Because I want to.

600
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,380
What's today's concept?

601
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,810
Wait.

602
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,050
Today, we're going to Eulji-ro
and Liberation Town.

603
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,390
As for Eulji-ro...

604
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,960
(Youngjae Lamination)
(There are old printing houses that are still in operation.)

605
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,590
(There are old stores too.)

606
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,330
(Retro cafes and restaurants emerged between them.)

607
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,330
(Snack Bar)
(Eulji-ro became famous because of it.)

608
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,300
(It's the same case for Liberation Town.)

609
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,110
(Sewon Printing House)

610
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,360
That's why today's concept is on
the space where past and present coexist.

611
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
What do you think?

612
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,960
I like it.

613
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,470
Don't joke around today.

614
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,440
I worked hard on my makeup.

615
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,410
I was trying to pick this off.

616
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,310
I wasn't joking around.

617
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,350
I misunderstood.

618
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,010
I thought you were going to
pull my hat over my face again.

619
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,050
- When did I do that?
- "When did I do that"?

620
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,990
The saying is so true.

621
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,330
The aggressor never remembers
hitting the other person.

622
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,890
What?

623
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,590
You said I was ugly.

624
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,600
You said you needed to see
only beautiful things.

625
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So you pulled my hood over my face
and pulled the string.

626
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,570
You did that to me 10 years ago.

627
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,770
Hey! What are you doing?

628
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,340
Stop.

629
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,150
What are you doing?

630
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,290
Because you're ugly.
I should only look at beautiful things.

631
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,860
Hey, that was...

632
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,630
so that you see only beautiful things.
So that you wouldn't be hurt.

633
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,530
You twisted my act of kindness.

634
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,910
Why do you have
so many misunderstandings about me?

635
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,250
Then you shouldn't

636
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,090
make me misunderstand.

637
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,570
Nothing over 20,000 won. Let's go.

638
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,570
He must not want to buy him a toy.

639
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,380
He may really not have money.

640
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,810
There's no toy under 20,000 won here.

641
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,410
I'm sure he knows how much things cost.

642
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,280
He may really not know

643
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,390
if he didn't buy him toys often.

644
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,990
Maybe you're right.

645
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,060
You can't know what's going on
in other people's lives.

646
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,630
Try it.

647
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,860
(Dried Fish)

648
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,340
Thank you.

649
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,370
You always eat things like that.

650
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,140
Look who's talking.
You're a picky eater too.

651
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,540
I'm reasonable about what I don't eat.

652
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,050
She always says she's right.

653
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,380
Keep it up, and you'll get a beating.

654
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,720
Is this not the place?

655
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,260
If we make another lap,
it'll be the tenth time.

656
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,200
Really? Already?

657
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,800
Hey. Isn't this it?

658
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,210
Darn it. It is.

659
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,110
That's a good thing then.
Why are you getting annoyed?

660
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,510
I'm annoyed. We made ten laps,
and it's right here.

661
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,390
It's not the cafe's fault. It's your fault
for not seeing it and passing by.

662
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,690
He has such a bad temper.

663
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,740
(Eulji-ro. Just as emotions
you didn't realize...)

664
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,450
"Just as emotions you didn't realize
appear out of nowhere..."

665
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,980
(Eulji-ro. Just as emotions
you didn't realize appear out of nowhere,)

666
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,250
(if you keep roaming in silence,
you'll find it eventually.)

667
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,660
Why don't you know your own emotions?
Are you stupid?

668
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,300
I'm going to kill you.

669
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,460
Give it back before I get mad.

670
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,900
What will you do if you get mad?

671
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,170
Take it back.

672
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,470
If words don't work,
you have to get physical.

673
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,910
Hey.

674
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,720
It used to be an actual printing house.

675
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,120
That's so cool.

676
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,130
Hey. That day...

677
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,330
"That day"? When?

678
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,900
Who would you have gone to the hospital
if Jin-ju didn't show up?

679
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,610
You?

680
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,610
Why?

681
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,910
I thought you decided to go out
with that CEO.

682
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,090
Exactly. I can't let him see me like that.

683
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,120
You saw me that day.

684
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,220
I couldn't wash up, so I had to
cover my head with a hood,

685
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,790
and wore that beat-up hoodie.

686
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,590
No way.

687
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,200
Is that the reason?

688
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,000
Do I need another reason?

689
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,340
Seriously, you're so...

690
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,080
Finish what you were saying.

691
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,240
Forget it.

692
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,080
What's with him?

693
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,720
Wait for me.

694
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,190
What should we have for dinner?

695
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,690
Pasta?

696
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,330
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,330
Hello?

698
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,600
Yes.

699
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,110
Yes. I understand. Okay.

700
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:21,750
What is it?

701
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,480
Sorry, but I have to go.

702
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,190
What is it?

703
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,920
It's nothing much. I'll call you later.

704
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,590
It's nothing much, so tell me.

705
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,700
Please tell me, Young-hee.

706
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,500
Later.

707
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,170
I'll call you later, okay?

708
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,890
Get in. I won't ask any questions.

709
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,690
You don't have to tell me anything.

710
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,030
I'll go by myself.

711
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,660
Sorry. I'll call you later, okay?

712
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,480
She is impossible to crack.

713
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,010
You need to write the report in detail.

714
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,550
(Police)
You need to write the report in detail.

715
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,380
You have to teach kids like this
a lesson. Okay?

716
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,830
- I'm sorry.
- I wasn't in the wrong.

717
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,960
Today was the first time I hit first.

718
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,730
He harassed me first.

719
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,830
He harassed me since middle school
for being poor and not having a dad.

720
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,030
- So why are you...
- Shut it.

721
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,370
I'm very sorry.

722
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,810
Do you think bowing down will cut it?

723
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,180
What will you do?

724
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,580
What will you do about my son?

725
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,760
I'm very sorry.

726
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,240
(I want five million won to settle.)

727
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,180
(Or your little brother
will end up in jail.)

728
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,810
Sorry, Young-hee.

729
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,720
I'd like to say something warm
like, "Don't worry."

730
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,220
I want to buy you a warm dinner
and say, "It's okay."

731
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,530
But it's five million won.

732
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,030
I just can't be warm.

733
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,080
(Someone once said)

734
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,650
(that the essence of poverty)

735
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,320
(isn't a small, old, bug-infested house)

736
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,390
(or worn-out clothes.)

737
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,130
(It's calls from credit card companies
waking you up demanding payment.)

738
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,160
(Being unable to go to the dentist
when you have a toothache.)

739
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,430
(The guilt from being unable to do things
for the person you love.)

740
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,400
(It's the fear
and the pitiful feeling you get)

741
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,070
(from having to ask friends for money.
That's poverty.)

742
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,540
(Jin-ju, can I borrow some money?)

743
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,010
(That's what poverty really is.)

744
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,450
(You don't understand
unless you experience it.)

745
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,320
(It's useless to talk about it.)

746
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,920
What are you staring at?

747
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,120
Namsan Tower.

748
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,800
Come to think of it,
I've never been up there.

749
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,830
Never?

750
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,000
No.

751
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,700
I saved it to go on a special day
with a special person,

752
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,540
but I never got to go.

753
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,510
Why not?

754
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,640
I haven't met anyone that special yet.

755
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,780
You can go with that CEO guy.

756
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,890
Mr. On?

757
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,080
Why does he keep walking ahead?

758
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,020
(Dried Young Pollack And Draft Beer)

759
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,470
You're worse at walking
than a newborn giraffe.

760
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,900
Do you know why
it's called Liberation Town?

761
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,540
No.

762
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,240
They had temporary housing
for people who returned

763
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,370
after we were liberated
and people who came from the north

764
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,710
to flee religious persecution.

765
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,810
It was created after liberation,
so it became Liberation Town.

766
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,880
Isn't it sad?

767
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,850
Everyone wanted liberation,

768
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,520
but it didn't come the way
everyone wanted it.

769
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,660
That's sad.

770
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,800
You're right.

771
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,230
The deity is mean at times.

772
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,370
The deity is always mean.
So only believe in yourself.

773
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,200
Don't lose the lucky charm.

774
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,010
Lucky charm?

775
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,710
Do you still have the compass
that I gave you?

776
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,580
I threw it away.

777
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,650
What?

778
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,550
I threw it away.

779
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,920
Why did you throw it away?

780
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,020
I felt weird keeping it
after the way we split that day.

781
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,990
I'm not a moron.

782
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,760
Why do you always hold onto bad memories?

783
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,060
Why must you ruin even the good ones?

784
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,470
Was that memory nice for you?

785
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,410
To me, that memory

786
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,180
hurts.

787
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,280
I was mistaken.

788
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,790
I got my hopes up.

789
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,930
And then, I was disappointed.

790
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,870
Am I responsible for your emotions?

791
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,850
You're right.

792
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,090
I laughed and cried by myself
like an idiot.

793
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,490
I really am an idiot.

794
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,040
So why did you have to like
a jerk like me?

795
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:06,970
I feel bad.

796
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,240
(Liberation Town)

797
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,310
(A place where past and present coexist.)

798
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,450
Don't walk away.

799
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,320
Leave me. I have plans.

800
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,490
You do? What plans?

801
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,390
Are you seeing that CEO?

802
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,930
What's it to you?

803
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,770
Get home safely or whatever.

804
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:42,740
We keep seeing each other.

805
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,110
We do. Way too often.

806
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:46,780
Move.

807
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,150
Buy me dinner.

808
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,480
I starved all day because I was working,

809
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,580
sir.

810
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,830
What the...

811
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,360
Sure.

812
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,460
What? There's no need.

813
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,530
Aren't you coming? I'll go by myself then.

814
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,290
Don't you dare say anything stupid to him.

815
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,590
That depends on you.

816
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,190
That jerk.

817
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,110
How long have you been friends?

818
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,150
We're not friends.
We're just high school alums.

819
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,120
Just alums.

820
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,460
I'm sure we weren't just alums.

821
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,860
I'm sure we were very close.

822
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,730
You have a wild imagination.

823
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,840
He moved to the US
to study when he was 18.

824
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,670
I only saw him a few times since.

825
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,440
Those few times were quite intense though.

826
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,580
Woo-yeon and I have
a very special relationship.

827
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,090
Well...

828
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,020
It isn't all that special.

829
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
What?

830
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,130
I liked you.

831
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,130
I liked you as a friend.

832
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,680
I hope your special friendship

833
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,080
stays unchanged for a long, long time.

834
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,620
Let's eat.

835
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,490
Take your time.

836
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,070
Stop messing around.
I won't take it anymore.

837
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,480
Does everything I do...

838
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,580
seem like I'm messing around?

839
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,880
- You are.
- Says who?

840
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,320
Can't you just take what I say
at face value?

841
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,690
No.

842
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,800
I can't.

843
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,100
It's a defense mechanism.

844
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,500
So that I don't get confused.

845
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,310
So that I don't get hurt
by getting my hopes high.

846
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,840
That's why I have to doubt you,

847
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,810
misunderstand you,
and misconstrue your words.

848
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,390
That's what happens
when you're constantly rejected.

849
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,770
What if I say I'm being sincere?

850
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,880
Answer me.

851
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,250
What if I'm being sincere?

852
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,650
What will you do then?

853
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,960
(Objects are closer than they appear.)

854
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,660
(Thus, we must always be prepared)

855
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,990
(for unexpected accidents.)

856
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,030
Stop flirting with me.
