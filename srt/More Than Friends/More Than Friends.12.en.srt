1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,550
Soo.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,780
Yes?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,350
Don't keep anything you love too much
by your side.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,650
Why not?

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,520
Because those will either hurt you,

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,760
or you'll hurt them.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,600
Okay?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,630
Should we break up?

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,550
It's hard, isn't it?

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,560
I'm sorry

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,630
for making you suffer alone.

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,730
For not being able to help.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,200
But don't say that.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,040
Don't dump me.

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,710
(Dad was wrong.)

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,450
(You must stay close
because you love them.)

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,990
My unrequited love is over now, right?

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,260
I don't have to wait anymore, right?

20
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,170
I don't need an answer.

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,870
I won't wait anymore.

22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,629
When will roadside assistance come?

23
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,930
Once we call them.

24
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
I didn't call them.

25
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,370
What?

26
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,840
How do we get home?

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,570
Don't worry. I'll take you home.

28
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,290
What are you doing?

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
I always have everything planned.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Hey, you.

31
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,510
Don't get mad, sweetie.

32
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,030
All done.

33
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,900
Let's go, sweetie.

34
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,170
Stop that.

35
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,340
Why, sweetie?

36
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,040
What's wrong, sweetie?

37
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
Sweetie.

38
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,110
Stop that.

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,050
Sweetie.

40
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,300
=Episode 12: A Wound Deeper Than Love=

41
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,610
You're dating, aren't you?

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,270
No.

43
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,750
You're holding flowers, humming,
and grinning ear to ear,

44
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,980
but you're not dating?

45
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,250
I am not.

46
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,050
It's not like I'll complain.

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,650
Why are you suddenly hiding it?

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,150
Well... I'm not hiding it...

49
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,490
You're young. You should date.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,190
You don't want to grow old alone.

51
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,690
As long as it isn't that jerk.

52
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,060
What?

53
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,830
As long as it isn't that jerk...

54
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,070
Don't tell me...

55
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,740
What? What is it? What?

56
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,440
No, not that jerk. Never.

57
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,940
Why are you calling him a jerk?

58
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,810
- He's someone's precious...
- You idiot.

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,310
You have no self-respect.

60
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,550
Are you really defending the jerk
who made you cry?

61
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,180
It's me who cried.
He's not the one who made me cry.

62
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,250
He had his reasons.

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,660
I told you. Not him. Never.

64
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,930
Goodness.

65
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,270
Goodnight.

66
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,350
(Lee Soo)

67
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,650
One, two, three.

68
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,890
Hello?

69
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,660
("I Love You")

70
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,580
(Lee Soo)

71
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,360
Did you hear how I feel?

72
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,830
What is this?

73
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,830
- Kyung Woo-yeon.
- Yes?

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,640
- Woo-yeon.
- What is it?

75
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,800
Woo-yeon.

76
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,940
Why do you keep on calling me?

77
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,810
It's so nice to do this.

78
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,850
I agree.

79
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,150
Should we talk all night
until we fall asleep?

80
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,790
No, we can't. I snore.

81
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,590
It's okay. I grind my teeth.

82
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,530
What should we do tomorrow?

83
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,900
- Tomorrow?
- We should go on our first date.

84
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,540
We should stay together all day.

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,040
I don't know. What should we do?

86
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,080
What do you want to do?

87
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,450
Will you do everything I ask?

88
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,420
Of course. You can do anything you want.

89
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,900
"You'll break your nose
if you fall backward,"

90
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,630
(The Chicken's Fortune, Today's fortune)
"Nothing will work out today,"

91
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,730
(You need to take extra precautions today.)
"and things will turn out for the worst."

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,940
"You need to take
extra precautions today."

93
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,840
What is this?
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

94
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,450
(You didn't forget about today, right?
We're going on a date today.)

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,050
What date?

96
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,460
- What is this?
- A gift for you.

97
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,830
Only accept flowers from me from now on.

98
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,160
You should only gift flowers to me too.

99
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,230
If you give flowers to another woman,
I'll kill you.

100
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,470
Why do you always talk about
life and death about everything?

101
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,670
So what are we doing today?

102
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,410
Whatever we do, it'll be a good day.

103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,780
Woo-yeon.

104
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,020
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

105
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,090
Are you okay?

106
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,600
Today will be a good day, right?

107
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,480
(Bills)

108
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,980
(Coins)

109
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,090
(Money exchange machine)

110
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,390
What happened?

111
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,860
Why isn't he here?

112
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,000
- Jin-ju.
- Why are you late?

113
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,100
I'm sorry. There was traffic.

114
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,170
- Why are you late?
- I'm sorry.

115
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,810
Why did you put up your hair?

116
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,510
I did my hair since we're going on a date.

117
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,410
It looks strange, doesn't it?

118
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,280
This is not a date. Don't be mistaken.

119
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,820
This is not a date. I'm just repaying you

120
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,120
for helping me last time.

121
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,290
I don't care what it is.

122
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,990
What's important is that we're watching
a movie together.

123
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

124
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,230
Hey, it's Woo-yeon and Soo.

125
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,200
Why are they together?

126
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,740
What?

127
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,210
They'll think it's strange
to see us together.

128
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,110
- Why?
- They'll think we're on a date...

129
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,280
Anyway, I don't want them to mistake us.

130
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,290
That was close.

131
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,600
Do I embarrass you?

132
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
No.

133
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,540
It's not that.
I just don't want to be misunderstood.

134
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,310
I should've studied harder.

135
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
- What?
- I should've gone to a better school

136
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,380
and got a better job.

137
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,350
I should've tried
to become a better adult.

138
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,650
Hey.

139
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,290
Going to a good university

140
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,790
and having a good job doesn't make someone
a better person.

141
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,790
I don't know. It just crossed my mind.

142
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,460
Let's go.

143
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,940
- Hello?
- Hello?

144
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,840
- What?
- What?

145
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,520
How can I be so unlucky today?

146
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,720
How's your forehead?
Do you need any ointment?

147
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,960
Why are you laughing?

148
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,300
- You're strange.
- How?

149
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,340
You're not like the Soo I know.

150
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,010
Forget him. He died.

151
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,580
It's nice to be here together like this.

152
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,150
I'm going to go to the washroom.

153
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Okay.

154
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,480
Gosh.

155
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,120
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,460
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

157
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,360
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Just a moment.

158
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,100
Should we call it a day today?

159
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,600
Yes.

160
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,440
All right.

161
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,940
But aren't you hungry?

162
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,350
- What?
- Well...

163
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,350
We couldn't eat properly
nor watch the movie.

164
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,720
Are you feeling okay?

165
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm feeling okay,

166
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,720
but my outfit...

167
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,760
I'm okay with it,

168
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,290
but you might feel uncomfortable.

169
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,260
Right.

170
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,960
Or...

171
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,800
do you want to go to my place?

172
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,440
We can eat there too.

173
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
We didn't get to have a proper date today.

174
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,220
I guess we could.

175
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,550
I'll drive to my place then.

176
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,660
Okay.

177
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Mr. Kim Jun Yeong
decided to file a suit against you

178
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,270
for the August 8th assault case.

179
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,440
He has footage and a medical report,
so his evidence is clear.

180
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,240
It'd be best to settle.

181
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,580
I have no intention of settling nicely.

182
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,650
You should enjoy the rice with beans
they serve behind bars.

183
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,080
You said it's your favorite, right?

184
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,850
You punk.

185
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,160
Could I speak to you separately?

186
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,630
Sure.

187
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,140
It's too big, right?

188
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,290
What are you doing?

189
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,660
You look so cute.
I need to keep a record of it.

190
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,890
What is this?
I'm not looking my best today.

191
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,300
I'll shoot you more
when you're looking your best.

192
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,270
Let me see.

193
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,200
It looks nice.

194
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,110
You're a pretty good photographer.

195
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,510
You're pretty good at hitting people.

196
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,650
You're so strong.

197
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,550
No way. I'm really weak.

198
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,850
What are you saying? You're strong.

199
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,030
Look.

200
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,440
You were too close.

201
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,510
Give me your wallet.

202
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,540
- Why?
- To put in the settlement money.

203
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,840
- Why are you paying for that?
- Hurry up and hand it over.

204
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,310
Why are you giving it to me in cash?

205
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,180
If I wire it to you,
you'll have to pay 22 percent in tax.

206
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,060
Gosh.

207
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,330
(Kim Jun-young)

208
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,970
Why are you taking a picture of that?

209
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,210
Article 231 of the Criminal Code
states that a forgery

210
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,410
of a private document can get you
five years of imprisonment

211
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,110
or up to 10 million won in penalty.

212
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,810
This student card is that forged document.

213
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,980
"10 million won"?

214
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,520
Unfortunately, you decided to forge
a Seoul National University student card.

215
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,550
Since it's a national university,
this is a state document.

216
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,190
Article 225 of the Criminal Code states
forgery of a national document

217
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,720
can get you ten years of imprisonment.

218
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,530
That's a huge jump. You get twice as much.
Ten years.

219
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,930
Who are you?

220
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,030
Me?

221
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:03,300
(Prosecutor Han Jin-ju)

222
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,530
I'm a prosecutor.

223
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,270
The blankets at the Ministry of Justice
are so thin.

224
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,210
The washrooms are terrible too.

225
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,210
What do you want to do?

226
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,980
Do you want to star in your own
"Prison Playbook" for ten years?

227
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,380
No.

228
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,850
What should you do then?

229
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,190
I should drop the charges.

230
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,190
You're not completely stupid.

231
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
Stand up.

232
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,800
Open the door.

233
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,370
Go and tell them.

234
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,270
I'll drop the charges.

235
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,180
I don't need any settlement money.

236
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,680
(It was my fault.)

237
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,120
She's so cool.

238
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,320
Ta-da.

239
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,560
What is this?
It's not like we were jailed.

240
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,160
Come on. Does it hurt to just eat it?

241
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,660
We didn't get to eat yet.

242
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,570
It's hot.

243
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,310
It's good, right? Is it good? Is it good?

244
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,610
Yes.
Sang-hyeok, you're so good at cooking.

245
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,710
I know.

246
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,480
Why are you so happy
when we went to a police station?

247
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,350
I'm just happy to be with you.

248
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
But you know, our first item we got
as a couple was a complaint.

249
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,000
Are you crazy?

250
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,870
Eat. Please eat a lot, Ms. Prosecutor.

251
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,400
Why are you always dying to feed me?

252
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,670
I don't know.

253
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,170
I just want to feed you and entertain you
whenever I see you.

254
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,040
Are you my mom?

255
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,050
A mom's love is true love.

256
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,810
You'll regret it if you lose me.

257
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,950
What are you saying?

258
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,720
Why did you suddenly start to take
pictures of people?

259
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,590
I suddenly wanted to take them

260
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,530
because of someone.

261
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,460
I don't think I ever looked at people
with affection before.

262
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,870
I don't know how much I missed
because of that.

263
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,300
I wondered how much I'd miss
in the future too.

264
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,240
While thinking about that,

265
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,440
taking pictures of people
started to get fun.

266
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,380
Hey.

267
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,190
What is this? When did you take this?

268
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,260
I couldn't help it
because you were so beautiful.

269
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,370
Since when did you start taking pictures?

270
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,870
Since I was eight.

271
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,500
You started really early.

272
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,440
Were you a prodigy?

273
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,780
I was a prodigy not just in photography,
but in everything else too.

274
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,240
I was good at everything.

275
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,950
You sound like a narcissist.

276
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,950
I had to be a prodigy back then.

277
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,730
Mom and Dad would fight every day.

278
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,860
They'd check if I was sleeping,

279
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,900
then they closed the door before fighting.

280
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,600
I was never asleep.

281
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,800
I always sleep with the door open.

282
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,000
Why?

283
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,370
I don't like closed doors.

284
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,710
I thought it was my fault.

285
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,920
I thought I should be better.

286
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,320
I thought being a better son

287
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,550
would help my parents get along.

288
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
I was stupid.

289
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
(Don't change yourself for others.)

290
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,900
No matter what you do,
those who want to leave will leave,

291
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,360
and those who want to stay will stay.

292
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
I got awards in everything.

293
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,400
I played Go and chess too.

294
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,270
I only did things my parents
would be proud of.

295
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,740
Maybe he felt sorry for me,

296
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,710
but he took me out every weekend
to take pictures.

297
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,920
The owner of the guesthouse.

298
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,120
Do you remember him?

299
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,590
That was the only time I was happy.

300
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,090
Because there are no right answers
or scores with photography.

301
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,900
You must have been lonely.

302
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
I'm okay now

303
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,340
because I have you.

304
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,450
What is it?

305
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,520
Don't you know how to say hello?

306
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,890
Hello.

307
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,920
What is it?

308
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,030
Are you refusing to let an adult
into your home?

309
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,890
Is that what your parents taught you?

310
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
You're my parent.

311
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,800
Give me some tea.

312
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,570
I can't.

313
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,140
Why not?

314
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,510
I guess you can't.

315
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,280
Hello.

316
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,710
I told you I can't.

317
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,250
Nice to meet you.

318
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,820
It was nice to meet you,

319
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,720
and I hope you have a good time.

320
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,740
Punk.

321
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,010
What a man.

322
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,750
Why didn't you listen?

323
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,420
You should've told me.

324
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,160
You didn't give me the chance.

325
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,960
Here.

326
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,860
What is this?

327
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,270
- Peaches?
- Yes.

328
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,800
They're in season. They looked good.

329
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,110
I was reminded of you.

330
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
What's wrong?

331
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,380
Don't you like peaches?

332
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,380
It's not that.

333
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,250
This is the first time

334
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,920
you bought something
because you were reminded of me.

335
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,260
I'm awkward with things like this,

336
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,760
but I'll let you off
since Woo-yeon likes peaches.

337
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,900
Thank you so much
for being so understanding.

338
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,670
I'm leaving.

339
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,280
You were wrong.

340
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,920
About what?

341
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,220
You told me not to keep anything
you love too much by your side.

342
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,320
But

343
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
you must stay close because you love them.

344
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,070
(Soo's Mom)

345
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,780
Hello?

346
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,750
Do you want

347
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,020
to get dinner tomorrow?

348
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,490
- Did he leave?
- Yes.

349
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
He must hate me.

350
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,760
I was with another guy
the first time he met me,

351
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,100
and the second time, I look like this.

352
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,340
It's okay since I like you.

353
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,370
That's what you think.

354
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,710
What should we do tomorrow?

355
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,110
Do you want to meet every day?

356
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,880
Naturally. I'm going to make up
for lost time.

357
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,440
What are you shooting?

358
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,550
You.

359
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,350
From way over there?

360
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,020
I want to see you well from far away too.

361
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,350
What is that?

362
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,690
Why did you want to wear our uniforms?

363
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,990
To fabricate memories.

364
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,930
I'll overwrite all the memories
from when we were 18 until now,

365
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,500
at least ten-years' worth,
with nice memories.

366
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,940
Let's go play, Woo-yeon.

367
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,010
Let's go.

368
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,070
Goodness.

369
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,040
Goodness.

370
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,780
I love you.

371
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,770
(I love you.)

372
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,170
(I love you.)

373
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,490
(Come with me.)

374
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,580
(- It's so nice out.
- It really is.)

375
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,920
It's a boat tour.

376
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,330
Do you want to go on one? Should we?

377
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,900
No, not now. Let's go
during the fireworks festival.

378
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,760
It's impossible to get tickets
for that night.

379
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,600
I can handle that much.

380
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,500
Let's go wherever you want.

381
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,900
Okay.

382
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,330
I love you.

383
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,570
(We spent every moment together.)

384
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,880
(It was as if we've never been apart.)

385
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,780
(It was as if there was never a gap
between us.)

386
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

387
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,030
- I'm really going now.
- Okay.

388
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,700
Let go.

389
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,030
Bye.

390
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,540
(As if we were trying to cover up
all the bad memories with good ones,)

391
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,310
(swearing that if you love one another,
you must be together)

392
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,340
(like it were a religion,)

393
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,750
(we dated with a vengeance.)

394
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,580
(Tonight)

395
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,620
What?

396
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,690
We're going out.

397
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,420
I belong to Woo-yeon.

398
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,790
- Congrats.
- I never even imagined this combo.

399
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,030
It's a combo we didn't want
to even imagine.

400
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,230
It was predictable though.

401
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,470
What? Did you know?

402
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,740
Why are you so calm? Did you know too?

403
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,200
Only you didn't know.

404
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,370
- Where's Young-hee?
- She had to do something.

405
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,340
Hey. Snap out of it. She's a total player.

406
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,050
I have objective proof.

407
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,850
You twerp. You know I can hear you.

408
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,350
You can? My bad.

409
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,920
Then I'll speak comfortably.

410
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,750
- She has 12 ex-boyfriends...
- It's 13.

411
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,220
She took a test to see
what dating type she is,

412
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,190
and she was a player... What was it?

413
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,590
Serial dater.

414
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,760
Think this over.

415
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,200
You may become the next ex-boyfriend.

416
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,530
Seriously, you're testing my patience.

417
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,870
What do you know about my Woo-yeon?

418
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,170
"My Woo-yeon"?

419
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,440
Your Woo-yeon may become
someone else's Woo-yeon.

420
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,910
- Why you...
- This is a weapon.

421
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,380
Want to go to jail for attempted murder?

422
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,640
Hey. Why are you hitting my man's hand?

423
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,710
Are you okay?

424
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,210
That must have hurt so much.

425
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,220
- Yes, it hurt.
- Oh my gosh.

426
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,120
Did you scream at me?
Just because you're obsessed with a guy.

427
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,060
Hey, you lunatic.

428
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,990
Why are you yelling at her?
You're scaring my baby!

429
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,260
Why are you yelling at her?
You'll scare her.

430
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,330
She has ears too.

431
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,100
Do you want to die?

432
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,400
Why are you grabbing him?

433
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,470
Why are you getting mad?

434
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,900
Is he your boyfriend or something?

435
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,170
Are you having a fling?

436
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,370
Please continue.

437
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,810
- Come on.
- What?

438
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,280
Gosh.

439
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,280
Here. Do whatever you want, Woo-yeon.

440
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,880
Kill me. Go at it. Come on. Do it.

441
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,250
What's going on?

442
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,420
Wait. Hold on.

443
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,790
I'm totally having deja vu.

444
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,060
I feel like I stopped someone.

445
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,400
When was I against somebody
going out with Woo-yeon?

446
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,070
Why would you do that?

447
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,530
No. Don't distract me.

448
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm about to remember.

449
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,970
What was it?

450
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,910
On Joon-soo.

451
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,440
I see.

452
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,720
You really should just get beat up.

453
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,160
(Let me return it.)

454
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,630
Are you trying to get rid
of all possible excuses today?

455
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,000
When I really want you to come out
although I have no excuse.

456
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,970
Let me use that excuse then.

457
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,920
Hey.

458
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,830
What's so great about her
that you're hurting so much?

459
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,000
She didn't want you and dumped you.
You should dump her too.

460
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,800
The woman that I like.

461
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,400
- What?
- She isn't the woman who doesn't like me,

462
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,110
but the woman that I like.

463
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,710
Is love your drunken habit?

464
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,050
Switch careers into a lover boy.

465
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,050
Why are you so desperate?

466
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,020
- Another absinthe, please.
- Hey.

467
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,920
Do you think you're Van Gogh?

468
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,190
Why are you drinking
so much of that strong liquor?

469
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,430
You'll get alcohol poisoning.
You'll start hallucinating.

470
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,800
I don't care if I hallucinate.

471
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,360
I don't care what it is.

472
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,300
I want to see her.

473
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,140
I want to at least hear her voice.

474
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,749
(Woo-yeon)

475
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:06,689
Am I hallucinating?

476
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
(May I come see you tomorrow?)

477
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,860
I don't think so.

478
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,410
Gosh. Look how happy he is. Gosh.

479
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,519
What?

480
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,450
I shouldn't drink anymore.

481
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,990
Gosh.

482
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,700
("The Harmless Person")

483
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,600
(How nice would it be
if feelings were that simple?)

484
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,040
(If only feelings
could be blocked and stopped.)

485
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,810
I ordered for you

486
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,010
since you only drink Iced Americanos.

487
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,490
I thought I should return this.

488
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,760
It's my final excuse.

489
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,600
And you brought it to me.

490
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,670
Are you with him now?

491
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,710
Your consideration hurts each time.

492
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,090
You can go, Woo-yeon. I'll stay here.

493
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,320
Don't tell me not to do that.

494
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,990
You can't control your feelings.

495
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,730
You know that better than anyone.

496
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,900
- Mr. On.
- I won't bother you.

497
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,040
I'll just,

498
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,240
as always,

499
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,880
stay right here.

500
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,680
If there's a time when you need comfort...

501
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,450
If you need me,
even if it's not for comfort,

502
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,290
come to me then.

503
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,660
I know that whatever I say will hurt you.

504
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,100
I will save my words.

505
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,600
You should save your heart.

506
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,040
If you give too much
to someone who doesn't accept you,

507
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,620
you'll run out of love
to give to the next person.

508
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,990
Don't you be considerate.

509
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,930
Everything you do to be nice

510
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,060
really hurts.

511
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,620
("The Harmless Person")

512
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,660
(Do you believe in fate?)

513
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,900
(CEO Oh Joon-soo)
(I did it for ten years. Is that so hard?)

514
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,540
(We meet again.)

515
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,770
Hello.

516
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,040
I'm On Joon-soo.

517
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,950
I'll do well on the photo book.

518
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,510
Just so I don't doubt myself,

519
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,050
I'll do really well.

520
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,820
(I like you.)

521
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,620
I'm done for.

522
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,120
I'm sorry.

523
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,090
There are so many reasons to like you.

524
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,160
But even if I go over that long list,

525
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,200
I can't love you.

526
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,270
He keeps getting new opportunities

527
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,440
even after he loses them.

528
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,210
I envy him.

529
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,850
Even if he throws opportunities
and my feelings on the ground,

530
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,780
I keep wanting to put them back
in his hand.

531
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,720
So please stop making me feel bad.

532
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,140
It's pretty in here.

533
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,210
Welcome.

534
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,760
What's he doing in there?

535
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,390
Who was that?

536
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,930
What?

537
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,270
Why did you act like you saw your ex?

538
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,570
I'm hungry. Let's get
something else to eat.

539
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,440
(GGgo)

540
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,310
- Welcome.
- Hello.

541
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,880
Instant seafood pan-fried rice
and stir-fried noodles, please.

542
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,050
Okay. Is it to go?

543
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,650
- For here.
- Okay.

544
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,470
It's good. It's quite addictive.

545
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,600
It is.

546
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,910
Was that really your ex?

547
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,110
I just dated him for a while.

548
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,590
A month or two?

549
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,720
Don't mind him.

550
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,620
Don't make excuses. I don't mind.

551
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,360
You're not jealous?

552
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,830
I don't get jealous, obsess,
or get possessive.

553
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,770
That's good to hear. I'm relieved.

554
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,610
Eat up.

555
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,760
I'm home.

556
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,860
- You're back early.
- Yes.

557
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,990
Did you eat?

558
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes.

559
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,860
Do you see Young-hee these days?

560
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,030
I do sometimes, but I can't call as often.

561
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,870
I'm afraid that I'm bothering her.

562
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,600
You should bother her sometimes.

563
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,210
She'll worry if she has free time,

564
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,680
and she can't survive
if that's all she thinks about.

565
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,850
She should be bothered sometimes
if she's to stop worrying.

566
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,910
She can only get through
if she gets some fresh air.

567
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,850
Get some rest.

568
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,350
Okay.

569
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,530
Kim Young-hee!

570
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,710
What are you doing here?

571
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,140
Get in first.

572
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,380
- What?
- Get in already.

573
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,010
What's the occasion? You even drove over?

574
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,050
I haven't driven in a while,
and I think I'm getting rusty.

575
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,620
And I missed you too.

576
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,320
So, where are we going?

577
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,860
Where do you want to go?

578
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,130
No, don't say. Just trust me.

579
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,760
My gosh.

580
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,800
What are you saying?

581
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,370
Am I bothering you
when you should visit your mom?

582
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,880
She has a caretaker,

583
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,450
and I drop by when I can. It's fine.

584
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,950
It's nice to see you.

585
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,320
I heard you're dating Soo. How are things?

586
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,030
It's nice. Everything's nice.

587
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,230
I don't get jealous, obsess,
or get possessive.

588
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,500
(He trusts me very much.)

589
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,740
(I miss you, Woo-yeon.)

590
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,470
(Should I come over now?)

591
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,480
What?

592
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,210
I'm not wearing any makeup.

593
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,580
(Then we can meet tomorrow.)

594
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,090
Yes. We can meet tomorrow.

595
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,190
(What are you doing?)

596
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,030
Me? I'm just working.

597
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,360
(You'll be busy, then.
I'll call you tomorrow.)

598
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,730
(Sleep well.)

599
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,270
Okay.

600
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
Sleep well.

601
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,700
(Lee Soo)

602
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,970
(He always acts before he speaks.)

603
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,210
Go on inside.

604
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,420
I don't have to go home right now.

605
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,890
It's late.

606
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,550
Okay. Go in.

607
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,890
(He wants to spend every moment with me.)

608
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,170
Why did you push him away
when you'd be just fine?

609
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,540
For fear that his genuine feelings
last only for a moment.

610
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,280
For fear the feelings came from jealousy.

611
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,310
For fear that I misunderstood him.

612
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,250
Feelings like that
might be genuine for a while,

613
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,750
but they disappear soon.

614
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,520
I'm scared even now.

615
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,460
Then why do you date him?

616
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,460
To not waste time.

617
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,160
If it's hard to date him and hard not to,

618
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,400
I think it's best to just date him.

619
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,630
Rather than just suffer,

620
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,200
I'd rather have a good time then suffer.

621
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,710
We took such a long way round.

622
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,850
All that time was a waste enough.

623
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,580
I don't want to waste any more time.

624
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,160
Kyung Woo-yeon's all grown up
and even knows about love now.

625
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,360
I do.

626
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,090
You're all grown up.

627
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,630
(Woo-yeon sometimes said that
when she's with a loved one,)

628
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,870
(it feels as if time wears away faster.)

629
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,570
(She said it means that
time became more precious.)

630
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,310
(I realized what that feels like
only recently.)

631
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,720
(My mom's time is wearing away faster.)

632
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,120
Here.

633
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,420
This is nothing special,

634
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,560
and we're doing it now.

635
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,630
I know. It's nothing,
and we're doing it now.

636
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,830
If I think about it,

637
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,300
I really wasn't a good mom, was I?

638
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,840
Now you realized that?

639
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,540
No. I knew all along,

640
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,840
but I regret it so much now.

641
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,550
Forget it. You said
I wasn't a good daughter either.

642
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,280
You were a good daughter.

643
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,550
If I were you,

644
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,220
and I had a poor family and a sick mom,

645
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,460
I'd have run away long ago.

646
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,890
I have nowhere else to go.

647
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,760
The doctor said that

648
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,830
cancer treatments

649
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,940
make even a saint angry.

650
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,910
I'll become an even worse mom now.

651
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,210
Do you think I won't understand that?

652
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,080
Don't try to understand.

653
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,650
If just one person is understanding,
that person gets sick.

654
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,120
So don't come to see me.

655
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,330
Unless you have to.

656
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,660
You say such sweet things.

657
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,630
I'm your guardian.

658
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,140
It's a nice thing to have a guardian
and be protected.

659
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,870
If the guardian's your child,

660
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,610
as a parent, it really hurts.

661
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,080
It's uncomfortable.

662
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,250
Bear with it, even if it's uncomfortable.

663
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,950
I like being with you,
even if it's like this.

664
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,530
Affection doesn't feel right from you.

665
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,430
I got that from you.

666
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,800
- Gimbap.
- Did you buy different kinds?

667
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,340
Hey. Why didn't you get anchovy gimbap?

668
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,110
Anchovies don't taste good.

669
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,940
You don't eat anchovies

670
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,340
and that's why
you're weak and short like one.

671
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,810
My growth plates can hear you.

672
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,550
Don't upset them.

673
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,380
What?

674
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,290
My gosh.

675
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,490
It looks good.

676
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,460
Do you feel lonely?

677
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,460
Why do you keep inviting me for dinner?

678
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,930
Just because.

679
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,600
To spend time with you.

680
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,780
- Do you know Soo's dating?
- Really?

681
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,550
Who's he seeing? That girl?

682
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,850
Yes.

683
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,120
That's great. He seems to really like her.

684
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,560
There's something
I decided to do once I met you.

685
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,860
It became more like a belief.

686
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,400
I told Soo to do the same.

687
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,040
He's better than me.

688
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,270
What was that?

689
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,210
"Don't keep anything you love too much"

690
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,410
"by your side."

691
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,120
He said I'm wrong.

692
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,950
"You must stay close"

693
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,190
"because you love them."

694
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,600
You're right. Soo's better than you.

695
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,300
Next time,

696
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,440
shall we watch a movie?

697
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,610
Well, you do like to watch movies.

698
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,180
And it's been a while
since we went to a cinema.

699
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,290
I guess we could do that.

700
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,940
Hey.

701
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,220
What did you do today?

702
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,390
I went on a picnic
with my mom and Cheol-su.

703
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,660
A picnic?

704
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,800
It wasn't too special.

705
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,430
We ate gimbap in a nearby park.

706
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,470
Good for you.

707
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,100
I know.

708
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,310
I should've been nicer sooner.

709
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,310
It's not too late yet. It's okay.

710
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,780
Yes.

711
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,850
What about you? What did you do today?

712
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,250
I visited my family.

713
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,630
Do your parents know about my mom?

714
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,970
What did they say?

715
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,640
They're worried and concerned.

716
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,510
They said it must be hard on you.

717
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,710
Is that it?

718
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,810
Yes. That's it.

719
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,250
I see.

720
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,260
Let's swing and the person
who goes higher gets a wish.

721
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,060
Okay.

722
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,700
What?

723
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,340
I give in.

724
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,470
Don't go too high. You'll get hurt.

725
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,450
- Hang on.
- Why?

726
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,790
Why did he ask to drink first?

727
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,260
- Who?
- Soo.

728
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,590
What?

729
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,610
(Did I do something wrong?)

730
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,910
(No, it's not that.)

731
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,550
(I just remembered something.)

732
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:24,550
(Does it still hurt where I hit you?)

733
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,860
(No. It's fine now.)

734
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,630
(But are you really not angry?)

735
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,330
Hey. Did Kyung Woo-yeon punch you?

736
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,600
Hey. Don't you have any manners?

737
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,370
Let me see. Where did she hit you?

738
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,110
She hit me before and it really hurts.

739
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,110
I'll put ointment on for you.
Where was it?

740
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,350
Hey. You can't tell me where.

741
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,180
She hit you somewhere secretive. Like...

742
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,780
Hey.

743
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,390
She really did hit you down there.

744
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,390
That's quite serious.

745
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,260
What must you do to get hit down there?

746
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,760
Girls never hit that part
however angry they are.

747
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:10,930
Unless that part is of no use.

748
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,070
Yes. It's of no use.

749
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,040
Poor you.

750
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,310
- I should just kill you.
- No, don't.

751
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,940
Is Woo-yeon

752
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:23,240
into stuff like platonic love?

753
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,550
There's no way Kyung Woo-yeon's like that.

754
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,320
She loves getting physical.

755
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,650
When did you get here?

756
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,850
That's not important.
The issue is she hit you.

757
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,190
How much did you hear?

758
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,630
So? Why did she hit you?

759
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,730
Gosh.

760
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,630
All my underwear looks like this.

761
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,670
I can't show him anything like this.

762
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,610
I don't know why.

763
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,840
Is she sick of you already?

764
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,750
Hey. We've been dating for
less than a month.

765
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,320
She's like that sometimes.
She never dates one for long.

766
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,620
There's something she always said.

767
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,490
She said she became bitter
because you didn't like her

768
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,460
and that bitterness fueled
the unrequited love for ten years.

769
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:12,930
Maybe it ran out.

770
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,960
I doubt that.

771
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,330
Hold on.

772
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,330
Did she like him for ten years?

773
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,000
Did she tell you that she loves you?

774
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:24,670
What?

775
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,440
That's the most certain.

776
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,180
That's Woo-yeon's rule.

777
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,210
She said she can't tell someone
she loves them if she doesn't.

778
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,050
She said that's her rule.

779
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,650
(I love you.)

780
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,220
(I love you.)

781
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,700
I love you.

782
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,380
Hello?

783
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,650
Woo-yeon.

784
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,650
Are you crying?

785
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,120
Did I

786
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,730
do something wrong?

787
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,730
What? What do you mean?

788
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,730
Tell me if I did.

789
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:27,670
If you don't want to tell me
because I'm drunk,

790
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,640
I'll write it down.

791
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,310
Tell me, and I'll fix them all.

792
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,150
(Woo-yeon, come take your man.)

793
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,080
(He's impossible.)

794
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,520
Okay, I'll be right there.

795
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,500
Did you feed him drinks?

796
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,510
Why are you
making money off of your friend?

797
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:10,210
Hey, you. Your boyfriend drank.
He didn't force it on him.

798
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,150
He was whining that
he thinks you don't like him

799
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,850
and that you never told him
that you love him.

800
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,480
He was unbearable.

801
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,690
What? Did you call me?

802
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,760
The poor guy thinks his name is "Bear."

803
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,160
I thought it was a pet name.

804
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,600
Hey. How could you
kick him there of all places?

805
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,070
You know how important it is.

806
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,770
It was a reflex.

807
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,900
What?

808
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,110
What is it?

809
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,650
Then... You love Soo, right?

810
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,350
Obviously.

811
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,550
Then tell him that you love him.

812
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,460
My gosh. You keep crossing the line.

813
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,360
Pick him up.

814
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,660
Don't scold me
if you're going to order me around.

815
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,700
Hey, get up. Hey.

816
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,730
Goodness.

817
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,470
I'll fix them all.

818
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:33,490
Woo-yeon.

819
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Yes?

820
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,630
Are you up?

821
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,940
Are you playing me too?

822
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,270
What?

823
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,240
Why won't you tell me that you love me?

824
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,580
How many ex-boyfriends do you have?

825
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,030
I don't want to be your next ex-boyfriend.

826
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,870
I couldn't say it
because I was too nervous.

827
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,080
I love you.

828
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,230
Ta-da.

829
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,230
A new menu item?

830
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
With limited availability
only for Han Jin-ju.

831
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,800
What is it?

832
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:24,170
I made it with only things
that are good for you.

833
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,370
Enjoy.

834
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,910
Seriously...

835
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,350
Why are you doing this to me?

836
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,650
I said I'd do my best to win you over,

837
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,590
but I don't know how.

838
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,590
So I'm doing what I'm good at

839
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,060
and like.

840
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:50,970
What?

841
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,830
Do you think doing things like this
will make me like you?

842
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,370
You don't have to.

843
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:00,670
I'd like you to know
how it feels to be loved.

844
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,940
Then you wouldn't like just anyone.

845
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,020
Then your standards will get higher,
and you won't get hurt.

846
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,780
That's my objective.

847
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,390
I don't want you getting hurt.

848
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,190
Hey.

849
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,290
See?

850
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,960
I don't want you getting hurt.

851
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,370
Thanks.

Are you looking for anything
in particular?

856
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,480
I want something very sexy.

857
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,540
Okay. Give me a minute.

858
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,150
How's this?

859
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,850
I think this is the best.

860
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,490
That's so embarrassing.

861
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,190
I'll take it.

862
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:24,860
Okay, give me a minute.

863
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,740
What brings you to my office?

864
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:40,910
I'll be honest.

Thank you.

You can't keep yourself from looking
because I'm so pretty, right?

873
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,490
Excuse me?

874
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:30,960
It's okay.

875
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:32,830
I'm pretty so that people can look.

876
