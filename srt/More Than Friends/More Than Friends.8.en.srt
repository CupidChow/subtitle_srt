1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,500
I like you.

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,170
I like you with him.

3
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,570
I hope it won't be
a bad relationship this time.

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,910
I mean it.

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,420
Thanks.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,950
Later.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,700
Mr. On is outside.

8
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,000
You go first.

9
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,440
Bye.

10
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,589
You held me back
to push me away even farther.

11
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,230
Did you hurt your foot?

12
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,900
It's nothing. I wore new shoes...

13
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,270
Those shoes are so open.
How did they hurt your heel?

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,879
Right?

15
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,850
Did the shoot go well?

16
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes. We have just the last shoot left.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,350
I wish it would end quickly.

18
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,420
Why?

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,490
So you'd stop calling me "Mr. On."

20
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,220
How long will I be "Mr. On"?

21
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,060
What do you want me to call you?

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,830
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

23
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,300
Since you call me "Woo-yeon."

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,400
should I do the same
and call you "Joon-soo"?

25
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,500
Or "sweetie," for simplicity sake?

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,900
Or should I call you my prince?

27
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,580
You seem to like that a lot.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,010
Why are guys always so into titles?

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,180
We like it because the person
we like is calling us that.

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,550
You say you don't want to be "Mr. On."
You're full of contradictions.

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,990
Go inside. It's late.

32
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,020
Look at you changing the subject.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Good night.

34
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,600
Bye.

35
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,890
Mom.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,400
Did you hang this up here?

37
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,830
That's right. Clean up a little.

38
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,140
Stop shoving them in a corner
and buying more.

39
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,140
I came here to give you this.

40
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,380
I don't need this.
I lost the other side too.

41
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,810
I was going to throw it out.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,820
It took a lot to get back to you,
so don't throw it out.

43
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,319
Who knows? The other side
might be somewhere too.

44
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,420
It really came back to me.

45
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,030
(All these photos were telling me)

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,540
(that I had countless opportunities.)

47
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,940
(That all of those opportunities)

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,640
(turned into regrets.)

49
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,580
=Episode 8: Opportunities Lost
Become Regrets=

50
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,660
(Prosecutor Han Jin-ju)

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,660
(Victim)
(I went to the hospital.)

52
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,730
(Send me the receipt.)

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,270
(Send me your account number.)

54
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,780
(Send me your account number.)

55
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,750
(Can't you pay me in person?)

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,920
What's his problem?

57
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,520
Are you a fugitive?

58
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,060
Do you have bad credit?
Do you not have a bank account?

59
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,060
This is my ID,

60
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,790
my school ID,

61
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,730
and my driver's license.

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,370
You can check with the police
if you don't trust me.

63
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,940
Then why did you want it in person?

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,040
That way

65
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,940
I can see you.

66
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,740
I really didn't get hurt,

67
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,180
but you said to contact you
after I go to the hospital.

68
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,520
That's why I went and got a check-up.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,920
I wondered what I should say
so that I could see you again.

70
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,890
I thought long and hard about it.

71
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,400
Ever since I first saw you,

72
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,460
I thought about you

73
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,130
for an entire month.

74
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,710
May I

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
keep contacting you?

76
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,550
A Seoul University student? He's younger?

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,620
Is he cute?

78
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,650
Yes.

79
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,060
He's in!

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,459
How is he in so quickly?

81
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,990
Young, handsome, and smart.

82
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,260
Someone like that is always a good catch.

83
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,100
Stop being so loud.

84
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,400
Are you sure he's not a swindler?

85
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,800
Just look at her. How can this face
be on his mind for a month?

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,140
Her face isn't something that would
glimmer in someone's eyes.

87
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,470
Are you sure it's not a pyramid scheme
or a religious group?

88
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,209
All right, all right.
I just find it strange.

89
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,680
But if he's still a student,
I guess you might feel pressured.

90
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,280
Why? What?

91
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,480
I didn't do anything yet.
Why would he feel pressured?

92
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,920
You're a prosecutor.

93
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,290
Do men find women who have
better jobs hard to approach?

94
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,660
Do you?

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,430
It's not about men or women.

96
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
If the other person is distinguished,

97
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,960
anyone would feel discouraged and small.
It's the same for everyone.

98
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,670
He doesn't know.

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
- Did you say I don't know?
- No.

100
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,420
Hey.

101
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,750
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

102
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,350
Yes, I'm okay.

103
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,360
It was a mistake, right?

104
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,590
I wouldn't say it was a mistake.

105
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,260
I was only trying to tell you
that this seat isn't for you.

106
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,900
- Gosh. Hello.
- Hello.

107
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,500
You're here, Mr. On.

108
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,100
Are you all well? Are you okay?

109
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,810
Are you a gambler?
Why couldn't you just tell me?

110
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,540
Why are your hands faster than your mouth?

111
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,610
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,510
But you just said it's okay.

113
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,880
Why do you always build up to anger?

114
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,650
Hey, just accept it.

115
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,150
He's always angry.

116
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,990
Be quiet.

117
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,690
He's so scary.

118
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,930
Sit here.

119
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,600
What were you talking about?

120
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,070
Just this and that.

121
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,570
A Seoul National University student
who is young and handsome

122
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,670
is chasing her around saying he likes her.

123
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,810
That's good news.

124
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,979
(Tonight)

125
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,830
- Thank you. Please visit again.
- Bye.

126
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,380
Take care.

127
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,620
Right. Do you guys remember
our teacher, Ki-an?

128
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,120
- The teacher who managed our club.
- What about him?

129
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,760
I met him recently.

130
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,260
His wife is the director of an orphanage.

131
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,090
He retired and is managing
the orphanage with her.

132
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,530
He says he needs volunteers,

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,360
so I decided to go help him on Saturday.

134
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,270
I see. That's pretty cool.

135
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,300
Right? That's why I was going
to ask you guys to join.

136
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,440
Do you see this?

137
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,770
There's not a drop of moisture,
so it's dry, tough, and hard.

138
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,310
This is what I'm like.

139
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,050
An office-worker has no humanity
left in them.

140
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,380
I think I kind of understand
since you look like a squid.

141
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,950
- Hey.
- What?

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,550
Why are all of you always ready
to throw things at me?

143
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,820
- Anyway, I'm not going.
- No, no.

144
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,590
I already told him, so you all have to go.

145
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,690
- Hey!
- What?

146
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,000
Would you like to join us too?

147
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,300
Don't bother Joon-soo.

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll go too.

149
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,240
Amazing.

150
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,410
It's okay. You don't have to go.

151
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,110
I'm going because I want to.

152
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
I want to see you.

153
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,710
How sweet.

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,950
- We're all going together, okay?
- Okay.

155
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,250
What time on Saturday?

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,950
I think we can meet at around 11 a.m.

157
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
I look good
although you see me often, right?

158
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,210
Even guys think I'm handsome.

159
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,670
You're right.

160
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,640
We're seeing each other too often.

161
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,420
Whenever I try to see Woo-yeon,
you're always there too.

162
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,780
Kind of like an unwanted free gift.

163
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,920
I believe you're the unwanted free gift
that came

164
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,120
with my relationship with Woo-yeon.

165
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,990
Do you know why people
categorize relationships?

166
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,360
So that you act

167
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,560
within the boundaries of that category.

168
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,200
Just be her friend.
Her boyfriend's position is taken.

169
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,840
- What if I don't want to?
- If you don't want that either,

170
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,210
you can become nothing.

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,240
Her boyfriend's position is taken,
and if you don't want to be her friend,

172
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,310
there isn't anything else you can do.

173
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,980
So just disappear from her sight.

174
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,920
I guess you're not confident.

175
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,490
- Of course, I am.
- It looks like you're not.

176
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,830
If you're so confident,
why are you telling me to disappear?

177
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,530
Because you're shameless.

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
What?

179
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,170
You made her stand
behind your back for ten years,

180
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,570
and now you're idling around her
because you have feelings for her.

181
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,440
Isn't that shameless of you?

182
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,940
I didn't have the right until now,
so I kept it in,

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,110
but I won't let it go anymore.
I have the right.

184
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
Woo-yeon is the best drinker.

185
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,520
No, she can't drink well.

186
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,790
- I already know.
- What do you know?

187
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,390
Right.

188
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,930
I should return that to you.

189
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,070
The thing you took off in my car.

190
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,040
Are you trying to make trouble?

191
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,580
What did I take off in your car?

192
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,950
It's nothing like that.

193
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,420
I'm talking about the shoes.
The shoes from Mr. On.

194
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,570
Mr. On. Please don't misunderstand.

195
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,200
I won't misunderstand.

196
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,340
My glass is empty.

197
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,040
- Should I pour you some?
- Yes, thank you.

198
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,650
Okay.

199
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,980
Did you have to talk about
the shoes there?

200
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,650
(Tonight)

201
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,980
And in that way?

202
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,650
No matter how many times you reject me
and embarrass me in front of others,

203
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,990
I'm okay with it.

204
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,590
But don't turn him into a fool too.

205
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,390
Who are you to hurt him?

206
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,930
Is he that great?

207
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,500
Is he that precious to you?
More than yourself?

208
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,270
Yes. He's precious to me.

209
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,840
- You're too easy.
- What? "Easy"?

210
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,370
How could you cherish something else

211
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,740
more than yourself so fast?

212
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,050
Sure. I'm easy.

213
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm an easy person.

214
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,450
That's why I clung onto someone like you
for ten years.

215
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,650
Did you want to bring that up this badly?

216
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,220
- I didn't mean that.
- You asked if you're bad, right?

217
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,490
Yes, you're bad.
You're nasty to your bones.

218
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,100
You ignore everyone else's feelings,

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,430
and you don't know how to be considerate.
You're a selfish jerk.

220
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,770
That's why

221
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,840
you're always so lonely.

222
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
You must be upset.

223
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,270
We had to walk a lot to shoot,

224
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,210
and the shoes were new
so they were hurting my feet...

225
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,610
You don't have to explain.

226
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,910
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

227
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,650
I don't want to do anything
to be sorry about,

228
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,650
but I keep on having to apologize.

229
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,320
Everything is fine

230
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,390
because it's you.

231
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,930
Thank you.

232
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,740
No, not the big street.
There's an alley beside it.

233
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,070
Just stay there. I'll come.

234
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,550
- Just leave.
- You should stop acting pitiful and leave.

235
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,750
Go home and sleep.

236
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,220
When you wake up, stop bothering Woo-yeon.

237
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,660
Ten years out of 28.

238
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,730
She liked you
for over a third of her life.

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,770
When she got over those feelings,

240
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,940
she had to be strong.
It would've been difficult.

241
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,810
Don't ignore that.

242
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,960
(Tonight)

243
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,510
(Choi Won-jung's Solo Exhibition)

244
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,740
As for this piece,

245
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,440
I was focusing on the volume in this part.

246
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,510
- Especially with the leaves.
- Yes.

247
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,550
Do you see it?

248
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,180
This time, your artwork has changed.

249
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,790
Yes, it has.

250
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,520
There's so much depth to it.

251
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,620
Son.

252
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,330
What happened to your hand?
Did you get hurt?

253
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,000
- Yes.
- You should be careful.

254
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,970
Is everything going well?

255
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,610
Yes.

256
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,750
Are you seeing anyone?

257
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,280
No?

258
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,650
- No.
- Why not?

259
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,260
Do you not like anyone?

260
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,170
You do.

261
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,570
Mom.

262
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,510
Are you just friends with Dad now?

263
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
I heard you used to love each other a lot.

264
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,850
He still...

265
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,620
likes you.

266
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,750
Son.

267
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,930
Do you know what's most important
in long-term relationships?

268
00:16:58,659 --> 00:16:59,730
Memories.

269
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,040
We have many good memories,

270
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,700
but the painful memories are deeper.

271
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,270
I don't think I can

272
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,410
overcome those memories.

273
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,260
What a coincidence running into you here.

274
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
I know.

275
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,960
What a coincidence.

276
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,500
Hey.

277
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,840
- About that day...
- You're sorry?

278
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,870
No, I...

279
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,470
Sorry for being so harsh?

280
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,010
What does your cochlea look like,
that you hear me so well?

281
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,080
I told you, it's pretty.

282
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,690
For the final shoot, I wanted to capture
being loved even after being abandoned.

283
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,330
A train track on which
the train doesn't go.

284
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,160
An amusement park that has been shut down.

285
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,060
Things for which time has stopped.

286
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,530
I don't know.

287
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,040
That's from the perspective of the ones
who abandoned them.

288
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,770
For those locations,
it's neglect and abandonment.

289
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
There was a reason.
They were no longer useful.

290
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,110
There is always a reason for abandonment.

291
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,350
They consider it to be useless,
they got sick of it,

292
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,950
or it hurt them.

293
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,260
Beautifying abandonment,
calling it fond memories,

294
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,260
is a right belonging solely
to the abandoner.

295
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,060
The ones that were abandoned

296
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,160
probably still hurt.

297
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,200
Was that memory nice for you?

298
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,740
To me, that memory

299
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,480
hurts.

300
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,550
What?

301
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,250
Sorry.

302
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,560
For what?

303
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,330
For hurting you.

304
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,360
For mistreating you.

305
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,300
Everything.

306
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,400
Out of nowhere?

307
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,740
Have you finally matured?

308
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,210
Right?

309
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,640
If I were going to mature
out of nowhere like this,

310
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,450
I should've matured sooner.

311
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,590
They say people suddenly mature
right before they die.

312
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,250
But I'm not worried about you.

313
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,890
They say you live long
if people curse at you.

314
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,030
So you'll live a long life for sure.

315
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,080
Don't fall from now on.

316
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,290
(Prosecutor Han Jin-ju)

317
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,970
(Do you want to watch a movie tonight?)

318
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,080
What's wrong?

319
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,150
He wants to watch a movie.

320
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,480
Sorry?

321
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,350
He asked me to watch a movie.

322
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,360
What movie is it, that you're so jumpy?

323
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,470
Hello?

324
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,570
Yes. I was going to send you the proposal.

325
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,580
No. There's no need anymore.

326
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,110
Pardon?

327
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,480
I'd like to know

328
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,690
why I suddenly lost the opportunity.

329
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,960
The person who will be
working on it in your place

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,860
is Calligrapher Han Jin Suk.

331
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,800
You got someone famous.

332
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,130
I assume that answered your question
as to why you lost the project.

333
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,670
He has a lot of experience,
and he is very close to the director.

334
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,140
I had no reason to insist we go with you.

335
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,180
You'll get more opportunities.

336
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,450
Connections create experience,

337
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,950
and that experience adds up
and brings fame.

338
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,920
And that turns around
to create connections.

339
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,590
That's how the world will run.

340
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,990
It's a never-ending cycle.

341
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,030
There's no room for a small chick like me
to break in.

342
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,800
But you're still young,
so don't be too anxious.

343
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,470
It's not about age.

344
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,240
Moving forward is hope
and stopping is despair.

345
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,240
I believe anxious hope

346
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,370
is better than comfortable despair.

347
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,640
That's why I can't stop

348
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,540
my anxiety.

349
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,130
(Wind Films)

350
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,860
Cry. I won't look.

351
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,390
I'm not crying.

352
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,330
I'm not a child.

353
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm glad.

354
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,540
Sure. This is how I live.

355
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,470
Mock if you want.

356
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,770
Why would I mock you?

357
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,240
You must really think I'm a demon.

358
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Here.

359
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,520
Why are you giving me that?

360
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,930
You must really think I'm a child.

361
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,630
When life is bitter,
you should eat something sweet.

362
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,880
Come pick up your shoes later.

363
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,950
Okay.

364
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,580
Come at night. In time for dinner.

365
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,560
Do you have any ideas
for Lee Do Kyung's new book event?

366
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,660
It's a trend on social media
to show pictures of their rooms

367
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,990
or their house right now.

368
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,560
Following that line of thought,
what if people share pictures

369
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,300
of their study or bookcase and we pick...

370
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,440
Just be her friend.
Her boyfriend's position is taken.

371
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,710
I guess you're not confident.

372
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,580
I like it.
It'll be good marketing for the new book.

373
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,350
I agree. That's not bad.

374
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,750
What do you think, Mr. On?

375
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,590
Mr. On. What do you think

376
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,590
about the event
for Lee Do Kyung's new book?

377
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,690
Sharing bookcases. It sounds good.

378
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,690
Let's go with that.

379
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,340
He's good looking.

380
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,750
Did you wait long?

381
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,560
No.

382
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,990
Actually, I did wait a little.

383
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,400
I was excited, so I came early.

384
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,360
(He was excited?)

385
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,470
I'm wearing contacts for the first time,

386
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,370
and I bought new clothes

387
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,140
since it's our first date.

388
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,170
(Date?)

389
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,450
Let's go.

390
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
(Oh my gosh.)

391
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,270
Would candles be overdoing it?

392
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,460
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.

393
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,330
I wasn't giving you a choice.

394
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,860
I didn't say, "Do you want to eat?"
I said, "Eat before you go."

395
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,030
You always do whatever you want.

396
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,600
I'm trying to grab onto you

397
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,470
so you won't fall ten floors down.

398
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,470
What will you make for me?

399
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,170
Seafood ramyeon.

400
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,040
Put in lots of seafood.

401
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,780
What about the noodles?
Do you like them chewy?

402
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,250
- Add lots of chilies.
- Take a seat.

403
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,690
Hello?

404
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,590
I see.

405
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,800
Okay.

406
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,200
I need to go down for a moment.

407
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,970
Someone scratched my car.

408
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,640
Okay.

409
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,520
It's past 6 p.m.

410
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,350
I'm your friend right now.

411
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,790
(CEO On Joon-soo)

412
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,190
I didn't say anything.

413
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,090
Hey. Something happened to you, didn't it?

414
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,790
Don't try to hide it.

415
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,630
You finally started dating the one
you were head over heels for...

416
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,230
and work is going well.

417
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,970
You should look like you're happy
beyond belief.

418
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,940
Why are you spacing out
so often these days?

419
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,470
Did I do that?

420
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,410
Yes, you did that.

421
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,810
You've been doing that constantly,
so just tell me. Come on.

422
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,780
It's normal to be nervous when I'm
holding onto something precious, right?

423
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,890
Yes.

424
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Right.

425
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,790
But if you're always nervous,
when will you become happy?

426
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,100
If you're too nervous, just let it go.
It must not be yours.

427
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,700
I'd rather stay nervous.

428
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,030
You're so stubborn.

429
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,350
Why isn't he back?

430
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,460
Gosh, this won't do.

431
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,300
Was this the washroom?

432
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,100
(So if I ever take a photo of someone,)

433
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,370
(it would mean...)

434
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,300
(I like that person a lot.)

435
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,790
(Joon-soo)

436
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,730
Ouch.

437
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,240
Darn it.

438
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,350
Where did she put the band aids?

439
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,270
I'm home.

440
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,220
Why did you go through my stuff?

441
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,190
- Is that important right now?
- Yes, it is.

442
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,760
I know you gave birth to me,
but we're different.

443
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,930
So is my private life.

444
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,090
So the private life
you wanted me to respect

445
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,560
was this?

446
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,800
You're an unmarried woman.

447
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,770
Mom. I'm 29.

448
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,870
I have a boyfriend I dated for ten years.

449
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,370
- You're overreacting.
- I'm overreacting?

450
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,710
You're not like other people.

451
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,710
Do you know how hard I had to work
so that people

452
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,410
wouldn't look down on you
for being fatherless?

453
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,520
What if you suddenly get pregnant?

454
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,050
What will Hyun-jae's family think?

455
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,820
Can you stop talking about
me being fatherless?

456
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,890
Is it my fault I don't have a dad?
Did I kill him?

457
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,260
Who cares about that?

458
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,800
Why should I cower
when I didn't do anything wrong?

459
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,170
Mom, I want to live normally
like other people.

460
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,510
If you wanted to meddle,
you should've been more responsible.

461
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,410
Why did you let her find them?

462
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,840
You should've hidden them.

463
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,780
No, you should've swallowed them.

464
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
How can I swallow 100 of them?

465
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,980
You sure are a big spender.

466
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,020
Do I have to fight with my mom
about condoms at my age?

467
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,060
We'll forever be kids to our parents.

468
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,460
My dad still nags at me and tells me
to chew more when I eat.

469
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,330
I went to Grandma's on Lunar New Year's,

470
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,100
and she was saying that to Dad.

471
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,440
She told him to chew more.

472
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,940
Isn't it something similar?

473
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,510
Like a baby filter on a phone app,

474
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,010
our parents must have a baby filter
on their eyes

475
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,880
when they look at us.

476
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,620
I wish that were true.

477
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:11,390
What about you?
Why are you acting pitiful?

478
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,200
What?

479
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,880
There's something

480
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,780
Soo said to me before.

481
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,080
So if I ever take a photo of someone,

482
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,789
it would mean...

483
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,820
I like that person a lot.

484
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,890
Why were there my pictures

485
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,860
in his darkroom?

486
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,940
- Woo-yeon.
- Yes?

487
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,550
On your birthday,

488
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,650
Soo went to you.

489
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,550
He got into an accident.

490
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,460
He lost consciousness for an hour.

491
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,870
Why did you tell me?

492
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,270
It's not like I can do anything now.

493
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,110
Not Soo.

494
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,380
I'm talking about you and Mr. On.

495
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,250
You know this, don't you?

496
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,190
If you truly love someone,

497
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,590
you'd never falter no matter what happens.

498
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,240
(The person you have reached
is not available.)

499
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,260
(Lee Soo)

500
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,040
Why would you come back like that?

501
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,840
Who said you could?

502
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

503
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,220
Are you all well?

504
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,350
- Yes.
- Of course.

505
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,190
Sir, you should dye your hair.
You have so much grey hair.

506
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,790
Yes, I should.

507
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,230
Have you been well?

508
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,300
Yes. You two should get married soon.

509
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,430
Pardon?

510
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,670
It's too early for marriage.
We'll date as much as we want.

511
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,970
It's not good to date too long.

512
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,370
What's gotten into you?
You always talk about getting married.

513
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,340
You changed. He changed, didn't he?

514
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,340
He changed.

515
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,550
It'll be hard on Young-hee
when we get married.

516
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,050
I have three older sisters.

517
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,620
You got him under your thumb.

518
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,420
They say getting married is like
getting a husband and his family.

519
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,670
Nice to see you again.

520
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,580
Are you going to ignore me?

521
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,080
Hello.

522
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,550
Hey.

523
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,690
Sir.

524
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,420
You're here.

525
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,430
- You're here.
- Hello.

526
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,090
Are you well?

527
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,800
Of course.

528
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,370
It's nothing big.

529
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,740
I brought some school supplies.

530
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,970
Amazing.

531
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,480
You didn't have to prepare anything.

532
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,410
Soo, you look competent.

533
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,750
You're looking cool, Soo.

534
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,190
Yes. It's all about money.

535
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,420
You need to spend money to look cool.

536
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,290
You bought a good mix of items.

537
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,890
Yes. The kids are going to love it.

538
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,840
Hello.

539
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

540
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,780
(Eunyu Publishing Company)

541
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,040
What are all these?

542
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,310
Our CEO of Eunyu Publishing
would like to donate two sets

543
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,980
of the complete series
of world literature,

544
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,950
three sets of children's books,
and 100 must-read books

545
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,550
carefully selected for youths.

546
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,190
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

547
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,590
That's crazy.

548
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,430
They're refurbished books,
so you don't have to feel pressured.

549
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,530
You were Woo-yeon's teacher.

550
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,630
I should help with what I can.

551
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,040
This is my boyfriend.

552
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,410
Gosh. Nice to meet you.

553
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,510
It's going to take half a day
to just organize.

554
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,850
We'll do the organizing as well,
so you don't have to worry.

555
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,550
Should we move them?

556
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,190
Yes.

557
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,590
- Put it on top.
- What?

558
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,690
Please put some more on top.

559
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,560
There's no need to overdo yourself.

560
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,000
I understand.

561
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
Put more books on top for me.
This is too light.

562
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,070
It looks heavy to me.

563
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,370
More.

564
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,740
What?

565
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,970
- More.
- One more?

566
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,780
One more.

567
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,880
More?

568
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,780
Carry just a bit at a time.

569
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,280
Your back is precious.

570
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,480
I know.

571
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,620
Those people don't know what's precious.

572
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,690
I know.

573
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,490
- More.
- This looks dangerous.

574
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,360
Let's stop.

575
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,300
Why? Is it too much for you?

576
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,870
It's

577
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,970
super light for me.

578
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,910
Are you okay?

579
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,110
- What do we do?
- Are you okay?

580
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,010
I knew you were overdoing it.
These are heavy.

581
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,140
Are you okay?

582
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,370
You can't just send books.

583
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,100
Organizing takes effort too.

584
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,040
I never planned you in the picture.

585
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,140
Were you planning to do this
with Woo-yeon?

586
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,080
Were you going to make her
breathe in all the dust?

587
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,320
You're so inconsiderate.

588
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,520
Why are you talking casually?

589
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,550
You started it.

590
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,130
I'm much older than you.

591
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,200
Yes, sir.

592
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,200
I'll make sure to speak to you formally.

593
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,800
"Sir"?

594
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,750
Did something happen to them?

595
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,090
Gosh. I was going to ask you that.

596
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,420
What's wrong with them?

597
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,570
Are you in touch with that guy?

598
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Yes.

599
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,080
You're smiling so big.

600
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,610
I'm so excited these days.

601
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,120
It's so nice to see his text
when I wake up in the morning

602
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,250
asking me if I slept well.

603
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,550
I love it that someone's asking me
what I did,

604
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,590
what I ate, and what I'm going to do.

605
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,690
That's nothing special.

606
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
It's because this is the first time
someone likes me.

607
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,300
Scrub it properly all the way.

608
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,540
Okay.

609
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,080
Why did you lie earlier?

610
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,780
I didn't lie.

611
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,180
You said you like dating more.

612
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,520
You said it's too early for marriage.

613
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,790
I gave it a thought,

614
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,200
and I thought my dream was to become
your husband.

615
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,960
And?

616
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,300
And

617
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,340
my dream is just Kim Young-hee.

618
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,140
To have Kim Young-hee full,
to have Kim Young-hee smile,

619
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,540
and to have Kim Young-hee happy.

620
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,110
Anything that starts with Kim Young-hee.

621
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,180
What a humble dream.

622
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,420
I'll just live as a man who has
a humble dream.

623
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,940
Kyung Woo-yeon.

624
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,880
Young-hee.

625
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,080
Is there anything I can help with?

626
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,320
Woo-yeon, can you take this over there?

627
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Okay.

628
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,960
- Here. Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

629
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,470
Enjoy.

630
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,070
Here you go.

631
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,510
It's time to eat now.

632
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,610
Do you want more?

633
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,950
Are you okay?

634
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,320
You don't want to eat it?

635
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,390
Enjoy your food.

636
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,300
Now you're running away to dreamland.

637
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,300
I thought I told you
not to cross the line.

638
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,830
I know my hands are beautiful,

639
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,430
but you shouldn't just grab it
whenever you please.

640
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,840
Don't try to talk your way out of this.

641
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,510
What are you two doing?

642
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,850
Woo-yeon.

643
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,450
Now that you're up, let's talk.

644
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,850
Do it here.

645
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,090
- I have nothing to say.
- Then listen to what I have to say.

646
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,860
- I don't want to.
- Listen anyway.

647
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,430
Just once.

648
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,640
Are you always this rude?

649
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,740
She said no, but you won't stop.
I know you're friends, but this is wrong.

650
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,580
Woo-yeon!

651
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,790
What, Jin-ju? You need me?

652
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,520
No, I can do it myself!

653
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,720
Okay! I'm coming!

654
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,360
I said not to grab my hand.

655
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,930
I said not to cross the line.

656
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,920
Soo.

657
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,970
Woo-yeon waited for you that day.

658
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,700
She waited...

659
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,840
She waited and waited,
and then finally left.

660
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,180
Did Soo and Mr. On get into a fight?

661
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,220
- Of course not.
- True, why would they fight?

662
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,790
It's not like Soo likes you.

663
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,960
- What?
- Then why do I see rage in their eyes

664
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,260
whenever they see each other?

665
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,860
What is that?

666
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,500
There's no rage.
I'm sure you were mistaken.

667
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,700
I was not.

668
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,770
Sorry, I have to run to the bathroom.

669
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,680
She's so observant.

670
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,350
She surprisingly has a good eye.

671
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,520
- Sweetie.
- What did you do wrong?

672
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,590
What is it?

673
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,060
Well, it wasn't anything wrong.

674
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,000
- I think...
- Okay.

675
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,670
Misunderstandings
cause bigger misunderstandings...

676
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,130
You told Soo, didn't you?

677
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,700
Can you read minds?

678
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,070
Why did you tell him? It's useless.

679
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,110
Woo-yeon knows he went that day.

680
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,780
But she's going to pretend she doesn't.

681
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,720
It's over for her.

682
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,720
I see.

683
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,590
- How did Woo-yeon find out?
- I told her.

684
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,110
You saw the photos, didn't you?

685
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,880
You waited for me that day, didn't you?

686
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,420
I went too.
I went, but I was in an accident.

687
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,290
I said it was nothing
so that you wouldn't worry.

688
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,790
Soo.

689
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,730
That doesn't change anything.

690
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,930
Why not? You went, and so did I.

691
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,900
This happened to us because of bad timing.

692
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,170
Do you think it was timing?

693
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,980
You had thousands of chances
over the past ten years.

694
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,210
You lost all those chances.

695
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,750
People always resent the last chance
that they missed out on.

696
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,940
Go somewhere.

697
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,210
Leave for a while like you always do.
Please.

698
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,150
Get lost forever and stop confusing me.

699
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,120
Are you confused?

700
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,690
Do you think that's all?

701
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,890
Everything is a total mess because of you.
I'm livid right now.

702
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,600
What? You like me? Now? Finally?

703
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,370
That isn't love. That's a misconception.

704
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,400
You don't want me, but you don't want
anyone else to have me. That's greed.

705
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,840
You thought I'd like you forever,

706
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,110
but now that I like someone else,
you're jealous.

707
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,510
Don't talk like that.

708
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,810
What should I say then?

709
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,580
That's the only way
it makes any sense to me.

710
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,320
I liked you for ten years,
but now of all times?

711
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,460
Now, when I'm with Joon-soo?

712
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,390
This is about you and me.
Don't drag him into our relationship.

713
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,530
No. You stay out of
my relationship with him.

714
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,640
For me, "us" and "we" refer to me
and Joon-soo, not you.

715
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,270
So...

716
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,480
let's end this. Please.

717
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,090
It's exhausting.

718
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,020
Why aren't you eating? Do you not like it?

719
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,460
Yes, I do. It tastes good.

720
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,440
You can't eat chicken feet, can you?

721
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,470
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I only found out today.

722
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,480
I only said I couldn't eat it,
but it's my first time trying.

723
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,910
I found out today.
I can't eat chicken feet.

724
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,520
This is about you, you know.

725
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,520
I'll get used to it.
What else do you like?

726
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,560
I'll practice ahead of time.

727
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,130
Why? You shouldn't eat things
you don't like.

728
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,300
I want to like things that you like.

729
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,430
I should match you.

730
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,310
Just be moved. Don't feel bad.

731
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,110
An egg souffle please.

732
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,470
(Let's finish our shoots.)

733
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,470
What is it? Is something wrong?

734
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,380
No.

735
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,750
We'll be finishing the shoots soon.

736
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,080
Thank goodness.

737
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,820
- For what?
- Just because.

738
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,390
That the shoots will be finished
without a hitch.

739
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,790
I agree.

740
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,540
(Woo-yeon)
(Sure.)

741
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,960
Is it supposed to rain today?

742
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,070
They said it will, but I don't know.

743
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
If it starts to rain while we're working,

744
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,540
- let's...
- Let's finish it today.

745
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,580
Okay, let's do that.

746
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,600
This is so nice, isn't it?

747
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,670
Yes.

748
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,240
Why did they shut down a place like this?

749
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,040
Let's go on the carousel.

750
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,140
Okay.

751
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,390
People are terrible.

752
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,660
They threw it away saying it was useless,

753
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,430
but now,

754
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,400
they want it back.

755
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,400
I'm always doing wrong by you.

756
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,970
That won't happen again.

757
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,980
I'll get lost forever.

758
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,680
Are you really leaving?

759
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,230
Where are you going?

760
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,030
Anywhere.

761
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,000
When?

762
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,230
Anytime. Soon.

763
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,500
So play with me one last time

764
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,670
and smile for me.

765
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,940
Whatever.

766
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,170
We should work.

767
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,650
Soo is leaving again.

768
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,320
It's not the first time.

769
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,220
I think he likes someone.

770
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,090
I guess it didn't work out.

771
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,160
He likes someone?

772
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,030
He won't say, but I think so.

773
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,630
I see.

774
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,200
He runs away when things get tough
just like you.

775
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,770
You're the one who ran away.

776
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:22,740
You threw divorce papers at me
and lived in the US for years.

777
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,810
I left. I didn't run away.

778
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:27,880
How is that different?

779
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,080
It's different.

780
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,420
I left because you kept running away.

781
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,820
If I tried to talk to you,
you worked late and on weekends.

782
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,430
You ran away through work.

783
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,160
That's because...

784
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,470
You don't have to go far away physically
to be running away.

785
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,330
It was able to start anew
because it was abandoned.

786
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,570
If it wasn't abandoned,
it would've remained the same.

787
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,370
If trains kept running
on that abandoned train track,

788
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,380
if this amusement park wasn't shut down,

789
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,810
they would've been a bland train track

790
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,510
and a typical amusement park.

791
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:42,490
"I'm glad I was able to start anew
although I was abandoned."

792
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,230
They may think that.

793
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,180
One, two, three.

794
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:23,130
("I'm glad I was able to start anew
although I was abandoned.")

795
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,200
(Joon-soo)

796
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,200
(What time should we meet later?)

797
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,670
(We're still shooting.)

798
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,040
(I'll let you know when we're done.)

799
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,770
(I'll be waiting.)

800
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,220
I've never seen a carousel
that doesn't move.

801
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,340
Why are you so careless?
You won't let me let go.

802
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,640
I never asked you to hold me.

803
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,740
Exactly.

804
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,550
That's the one thing I'm waiting for,
but you won't.

805
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,920
You found out anyway,
so I don't want to hide it.

806
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,660
The fact that I like you.

807
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:24,730
I told you, you don't like me.

808
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,290
I do too. Why don't you believe me?

809
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,930
I can't because it's you.

810
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,830
I was fooled too many times.

811
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,970
There you go again, being hurtful.

812
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,070
I'm going to go take more pictures
before I get hurt even more.

813
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:48,650
Excuse me.

814
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,420
You dropped this.

815
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,720
That's not mine.

816
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,260
Then it must be your boyfriend's.

817
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,790
Look.

818
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,130
Okay, then.

819
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,370
Excuse me.

820
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,050
I'm sorry to bother you,

821
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,610
but do you mind giving it to him
when he leaves later?

822
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,820
Don't tell him you showed it to me.

823
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:25,850
Please.

824
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,350
Sure.

825
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:40,170
It didn't rain.

826
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,440
The shoot finished without a hitch.

827
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,270
It did.

828
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,310
Excuse me.

829
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,210
I think you dropped this.
It's yours, right?

830
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,950
Yes. Thank you.

831
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,360
Aren't we going?

832
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,560
I think I lost something. Wait in the car.

833
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,560
- If it isn't important...
- It is important.

834
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,760
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

835
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,940
What is wrong with him?

836
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,060
Why isn't he back yet? It's raining.

837
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,890
Looking for this?

838
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,040
What's your problem? What are you doing?

839
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,570
Give it to me. It's mine.

840
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,840
- It's my face.
- I took the picture.

841
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,840
Are you kidding me?

842
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,980
Do I look like I'm kidding?

843
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,910
I wish you were kidding.

844
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:13,090
If you were going to be pathetic
like this, why did you lie to me?

845
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,660
You should've said you couldn't go
because you got hurt,

846
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,890
not that you didn't go.

847
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,140
You keep acting like it's sincere.

848
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,010
That's why I keep going back to that day.

849
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,150
Why do you keep...

850
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,660
Why do you keep acting sincere
and confusing me?

851
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,330
(Opportunities lost become regrets.)

852
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,070
(If there are no more opportunities
for me to lose,)

853
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,340
(I can just create them on my own.)

854
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,630
I'll be the one
in an unrequited love this time.

855
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,530
Just as you liked me...

856
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:33,030
No. Much longer than that.

857
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,140
I'll like you much more.

858
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,340
I'll act like you now.

859
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,910
You act like me.

860
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,180
Then, just as I liked you,

861
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:52,990
like me back.

862
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,760
If this is our cycle,

863
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,100
I'll wait.
