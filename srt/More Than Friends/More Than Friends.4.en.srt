1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,490
Here.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,220
Ta-da.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,160
You did great for the past 30 years.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,260
Thanks.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,700
Dad. Thank you for working so hard
at your job for all these years.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,300
Thank you.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,100
Let me see.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,440
I thought you'd have a stable job
by the time Dad retired.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,650
Don't do that. Let her eat.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,480
Eat.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,130
(Appreciation for Service)

12
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,730
(Achievement Award)
(I didn't think I could end up like Dad.)

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,370
(Only once I started working)

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,600
(did I realize how amazing he was.)

15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,380
(That no matter how hard I tried,)

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,250
(I could never reach where he did.)

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,520
(I also realized that even people)

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,360
(have expiration dates.)

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,090
Sir.

20
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,460
My contract is up next month.

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,260
Can I get my contract extended?

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,770
There will be younger
and prettier applicants.

23
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,700
So why should we?

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,310
Are you really not going to get a job?

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,280
You quit your job almost two years ago.

26
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,850
You won one contest
and act like you've succeeded.

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,450
You talk big and say you're doing well
and not to worry.

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,650
Do you call working at a cafe
"doing well"?

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,820
Come on.

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,760
You'll give her indigestion.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,289
That's why I said we shouldn't let her
major in creative writing.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,030
Darn it.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,530
Do you think life is literature?

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,260
You're not the only one it's hard for.

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,570
Everyone else is enduring too.
Why are you so immature?

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,610
Is it my fault that I can't get a job?

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,740
Is it the fault of the young?

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,740
I mean, they hire two people
to do three people's work.

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,610
And even then, they'll make only one
a full-time employee, if that.

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,220
How can all the young people get jobs?

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,690
The competition is ridiculous.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,690
If you want to get out
and do what you want in life,

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,360
this society treats you like a loser.
Society is the problem.

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,460
Young-hee is an assistant manager,

45
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,430
and Jin-ju is a prosecutor.

46
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,700
Only our daughter is just a daughter.

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,200
Honey. Eat already.

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,970
You too. Eat.

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,010
Eat.

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,750
I'm going out.

51
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,520
Wait. Hold on.

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Here.

53
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,460
Get something to eat with your friends.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,430
I'm sorry I couldn't hang in there longer.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,070
Sorry.

56
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,620
(And I)

57
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,780
(realized my place.)

58
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,350
(Young-hee is an assistant manager,)

59
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
(and Jin-ju is a prosecutor.)

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,160
Only our daughter

61
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,560
is just a daughter.

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,440
(I can blame the times,)

63
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,040
(but I was the one looking pathetic.)

64
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,910
(I became certain.)

65
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,280
(What I must escape from now)

66
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,690
(isn't this twerp,)

67
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,090
(but my pathetic life.)

68
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,160
See?

69
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,260
I'm not running away.

70
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,870
Why are you so energetic?

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,740
Open up your cochlea that you claim
is pretty, and listen carefully.

72
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,180
I'm not interested in
a jerk like you anymore.

73
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,220
And I will never like you again.

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,080
Never.

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,150
Are you confident?

76
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,520
Yes.

77
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,360
(Kyung Woo-yeon)

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,700
(Lee Soo)

79
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,970
What about Seoul's stories?

80
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,410
Like we'll give a subtitle
to each of the towns.

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,410
For example, for Yeonnam-dong
and Mangwon-dong,

82
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,750
whose commercial areas expanded
due to the gentrification of Hongdae,

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,050
we could add "We may be displaced,
but we still live on"?

84
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,160
I like it.

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,690
What do you think, Mr. Lee?

86
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,190
Sure.

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,330
I plan to shoot the eight neighborhoods
I mentioned,

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
abandoned rails near Seoul,

89
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,470
and abandoned playgrounds.

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,670
I'll look at the photographs
and write something accordingly.

91
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,510
You shouldn't look at the photographs.
You should go with me.

92
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,710
Why should I go with you?

93
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,809
This is a work meeting.
You shouldn't be so rude.

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,050
Ms. Kyung.

95
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,890
There's no reason to go together.

96
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,020
- It's not like I need...
- Sensitivity is key for this book.

97
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,890
Writing from a desk, and writing after

98
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
seeing and feeling
the place would be different.

99
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,760
I don't intend on writing from my desk.

100
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,830
I intend on going there separately.

101
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,200
That won't work.

102
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,800
Even if it's the same place,
it'll feel different depending on

103
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,070
the time, the season, and who it is.

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,710
If the pictures and the text are separate,

105
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,740
how could this book feel sincere?

106
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,740
Don't let your personal feelings
muddle your judgment.

107
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,050
- Let's be professional...
- This isn't a work meeting.

108
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,250
Please don't make personal judgments
about me.

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,320
Since you left the writing to me,
it's under my authority.

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,860
I don't want to be forced to feel
and think by the photographer.

111
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,590
That's why I want to go on my own.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,470
I'll let you two decide.

113
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Okay.

114
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,720
(Eunyu's Monthly Literature)

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,920
You're so gullible.

116
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,830
How can you be provoked so easily?

117
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,430
Don't be mistaken.

118
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,200
I'm only trying to work.

119
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,370
This job is more important to me
than you imagine.

120
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,680
I have no reason to give it up
because of a nothing like you.

121
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
"A nothing"?

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,280
I doubt I'm "a nothing" to you.

123
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,350
You're nothing compared to
this opportunity of a lifetime.

124
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,620
Also,

125
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,220
do you know that much about me?
Don't act like you know me.

126
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,790
Of course I know you.

127
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,559
We've been friends for years.

128
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,530
"Friends"?

129
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,800
Fine.

130
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's be friends.

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,510
Whenever you hold out your hand,
it's to tell me to leave or get lost.

132
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,780
It was usually to push me away.

133
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,950
Isn't it hypocritical to push me away

134
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,190
while saying, "Let's be friends"?

135
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,050
I mean we should only work.

136
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,430
In order to do that,
we need to draw the line.

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,790
I don't want to be confused

138
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,960
or get my hopes up.

139
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,430
Being friends
will stop that from happening.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,970
So

141
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,100
let's really be friends.

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,180
I won't do it if it's conditional.

143
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,320
Why is he being so childish?

144
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,530
Woo-yeon.

145
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,330
I wanted to drive you home
since it's raining.

146
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,410
I'm "nothing"?

147
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,490
She never carries an umbrella.

148
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,570
She only glares at me.

149
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm sorry for running out earlier.

150
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,450
It's fine since you came back.

151
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,520
But you'll be sorry about something else.

152
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
What?

153
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,650
The button on my jacket sleeve fell off.

154
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,890
I see. I'm sorry.

155
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,460
I'll compensate you.

156
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,130
I got it mended.

157
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,660
You should buy me a meal instead.

158
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,970
- A meal?
- I thought you were sorry.

159
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,470
Let's make that an excuse to eat together.

160
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,940
What are you doing this Saturday?

161
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,080
I don't have any plans for Saturday yet.

162
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Should we have lunch?

163
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,510
Let's have dinner instead.

164
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,780
You must have plans for lunch.

165
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Right.
You must be busy since you're the CEO.

166
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,490
It's not because I'm busy.

167
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,120
A dinner seems more like a date.

168
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,240
Well...

169
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,610
I'm sorry,

170
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,340
- but is this...
- It's probably

171
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,110
what you're thinking.

172
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,080
But you don't know what I'm thinking.

173
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,790
"Is this man interested in me?
Is he making a move on me?"

174
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,420
Isn't that what you're thinking?

175
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,360
My answer to that question

176
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,190
is yes.

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,270
Just a minute.

178
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,140
Could you pull over for a moment?

179
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,850
Did you offer me the job

180
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,850
because you have feelings for me?

181
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,390
You're so pathetic, Kyung Woo-yeon.

182
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,730
Do you know what upsets me the most?

183
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,830
In that short amount of time,

184
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,900
I thought I should use your feelings
to keep this job.

185
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,640
To me,
this job is something I eagerly want.

186
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,010
I need to gain recognition.

187
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
That way,

188
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,150
I can proudly do what I want to do
without feeling ashamed.

189
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,020
That wasn't why.

190
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,750
How can I trust you?

191
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,690
It's strange.

192
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,330
I don't have anything

193
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,560
and I'm a nobody.

194
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,100
But you're so willing to let me
publish a book.

195
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,300
Why do you think you don't have anything?

196
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,670
Why do you think you're a nobody?

197
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,440
What about the people who could
relate and be comforted by your work?

198
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,110
What does that make them?

199
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,380
When I look at your work,

200
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,520
I feel like your calligraphy
is talking to me.

201
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,290
Do I need to explain more

202
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,160
why I offered you the job?

203
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,980
I processed your discharge.

204
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,080
You must be hungry.

205
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

206
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,920
Did you have plans?

207
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,560
No. He dropped by suddenly.

208
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,290
I didn't know she had a visitor.

209
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,960
I'm not a visitor.

210
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm her guardian.

211
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,640
Won-jung, let's go.

212
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,370
I'll...

213
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,580
That's good.

214
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,250
I have to go back to the office anyway.

215
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,690
Okay, then.

216
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,460
Let's go.

217
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,670
Are you happy?

218
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,110
(Sam Middle School)

219
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,720
Thank you for the ride.

220
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,650
I should thank the rain.

221
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,120
It might rain again later.

222
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,030
No, it's okay.

223
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,090
This is my next excuse.

224
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll do a good job on the book.

225
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,340
I'll do my best so that

226
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,040
I won't get the wrong idea about myself.

227
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,740
You should go.

228
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,690
Relax your hand a little.

229
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,860
Good.

230
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,770
Calligraphy is closer to drawing
than writing.

231
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,800
It stresses character and flexibility.

232
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,740
It's important that you come up
with your own writing style. Okay?

233
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

234
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,540
You have to write a lot
to improve quickly.

235
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,500
Hey, did something happen?

236
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,910
- No.
- What is it? Tell me.

237
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,980
- No.
- Just tell me.

238
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,850
What?

239
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,320
So she's her, and he's him?

240
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,930
Yes. I should tell them first, right?

241
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,290
Why would you tell them?

242
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,900
They'll find out at some point.

243
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
I should tell them first.

244
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,530
Knowing Mr. Lee, he's not
the type to talk about things like that.

245
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,700
If Ms. Kyung didn't say anything yet,

246
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,100
then I guess no one said anything.

247
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,310
Why would you volunteer to bring it up?
And now of all times?

248
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,610
Because I'd be fooling them.

249
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,650
I'm not telling you to lie.
You should just slow down.

250
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,750
What are brakes for?
They're there to avoid accidents.

251
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,960
If you charge straight right now,
it'll cause a huge accident.

252
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Gosh.

253
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,660
You need to build
a good relationship first.

254
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,960
You need a relationship first,
so that she can understand you.

255
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,900
That way, Ms. Kyung won't run away.

256
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,170
This is how you write a happy ending.

257
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,200
Watch your speed, Joon-soo.

258
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
This is making me dizzy.

259
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,410
I got too worked up.

260
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,380
Hey.

261
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,210
When did you last date again?

262
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,450
Before Christ, you jerk.

263
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,050
It's hot.

264
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,850
Gosh.

265
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,259
Why did you want to see me?

266
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,600
Because I have something to say.

267
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,969
I have something to say first.

268
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,100
What's between you and that CEO?

269
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,469
"CEO"?

270
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,040
On Joon-soo of Eunyu Publishing.

271
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,370
Are you dating him?

272
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,540
What are you talking about?
Why are you asking me that?

273
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,110
Answer me. It's the most
important thing for me right now.

274
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,650
What do you mean?

275
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,520
I don't want my pictures
to be used for someone's love game.

276
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,490
There's nothing between us.

277
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,760
You don't have to worry.

278
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,030
Okay. Now tell me what you have to say.

279
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,240
About the shoot...

280
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,770
Do we really have to go together?

281
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,540
The perspective of the photographer
is like a filter.

282
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,910
His feelings will surface through it.

283
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,810
Only my feelings will be shown
in my photographs,

284
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,180
while only your feelings
will be in your writing.

285
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,150
I want them to match.

286
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,690
This is our book after all.

287
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Okay.

288
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,960
Let's group close areas together

289
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,430
and go out once a week.

290
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,330
I work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
and teach Tuesday afternoons.

291
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,970
I'm free otherwise.

292
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,430
You have a busy schedule.

293
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,370
Saturday at 1 p.m.
Meet me at Hongik University Station.

294
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,210
Okay. See you then.

295
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,680
Why are you being so obedient?

296
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,810
You said let's never meet again
just a few days ago.

297
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,980
You were busy running away.

298
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,380
I told you. I said let's be friends.

299
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,680
We were already friends then.

300
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,190
It was a unilateral friendship then,

301
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,250
but now it's bilateral.

302
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,490
Why is everything so difficult for you?

303
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,590
Why...

304
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,730
Why is everything always so easy for you?

305
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,000
If you're done...

306
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,070
I'm leaving. I said, I'll go.

307
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,110
I'll go when it's time.
You don't have to push me away.

308
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,650
If you don't have any lingering feelings,
don't do it.

309
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,090
It's not because of my feelings.
I'm doing it for my future.

310
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,220
I have no experience as a calligrapher.

311
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,330
Do you think I'll ever get the chance

312
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,990
to publish with a big company again?

313
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,630
- But you have to work with Soo...
- No buts.

314
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,130
Leave her. She's living her life.
Who are we to say anything?

315
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,240
You're so cold-hearted.

316
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,710
- Do you even have blood?
- Hey.

317
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,180
Just be careful. He's like a tiger to you.

318
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,120
When you go into a tiger's den,

319
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,850
you have to be on your toes. Okay, kid?

320
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:45,560
=Episode 4: If You Want to Catch a Tiger,
Go Into the Tiger's Den=

321
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,710
You startled me.

322
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,680
What are you doing with the lights off?

323
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,810
Nothing.

324
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,520
Son.

325
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,790
Do you want a beer?

326
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,890
No...

327
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,570
Did Mom get discharged?

328
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,880
I guess.

329
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,880
Your mom

330
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,160
left with Dr. Kim.

331
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,370
Nothing's going right for me.

332
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,340
You got a divorce.
It's wrong to get jealous now.

333
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,270
I'm not jealous.

334
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,280
If this is not jealousy, what is this?

335
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,010
What did the chips do wrong?

336
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,650
Why must the chips be punished
for a person's crimes?

337
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,120
It's not like that. I just...

338
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,460
I'm just humanly disappointed.

339
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,630
She said she hurt her back, so I ran over,
got her hospitalized, took care of her,

340
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,330
and even called her son whom she missed.

341
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,670
I did this much, but she just left

342
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,840
after getting discharged.

343
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,700
That's what your mom did.

344
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,570
Why didn't you grab onto her?

345
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,110
Gosh.

346
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,080
She stared at me to signal me to leave.

347
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,080
After that, she was so friendly
to Dr. Kim as they left.

348
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,990
Why did you even get a divorce?

349
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,960
Because your mom asked for it.

350
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,160
She said that all the time.

351
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,500
That's true.

352
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,600
Then one day, she stopped talking.

353
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,570
She wouldn't scold, cry, or get angry.

354
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,180
I thought she was trying to understand me,

355
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,750
but she was preparing for our breakup.

356
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,020
That's your mom.

357
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,860
Then you should've ended it there.

358
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,930
Why did you remain friends?

359
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,070
I thought it would be a way
to start over again.

360
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,110
I didn't know it was the end.

361
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,980
A man

362
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,820
can be friends only
if he has feelings for her,

363
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,850
but a woman

364
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,860
can only be friends

365
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,360
if she doesn't have any feelings for him.

366
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,840
(I don't have feelings for him anymore.)

367
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,710
That's why

368
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,740
I can be friends with him
and work with him.

369
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,880
Gosh, don't worry.

370
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,320
I'll be on my toes thinking
I'm in a tiger's den.

371
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,950
"A tiger's den."

372
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,960
Do you know where the real tiger's den is?

373
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,180
Many young women these days
don't want to get married

374
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,680
or have any children.

375
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,080
But Young-hee, you're so affable.

376
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,790
When will you two get married?

377
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,320
We should get married soon.

378
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,990
Hyun-jae's a teacher now.

379
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,960
You'll lose him to another woman
if you wait too long.

380
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,060
Stop.

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,130
Just let her eat.

382
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,300
She can't eat comfortably at her in-laws'.

383
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,100
Your mother-in-law should let you rest.

384
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,440
She should ask your husband to help.

385
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,810
Mom. Is there anything I can do?

386
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,910
No, it's okay.

387
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,450
You'll only get in our way.

388
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,120
It's a different world now.

389
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,560
They still think sons-in-law
are precious guests,

390
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,460
while they work daughters-in-law
like slaves.

391
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,530
Gosh.

392
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,630
Mother.

393
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,170
Should I cut the kimchi now?

394
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,510
Yes. Sure. Go ahead.

395
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,280
Okay.

396
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,890
I wonder if the other tiger's den is okay.

397
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,230
- What are you doing?
- It's a nice song.

398
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,770
It's nice only for you.

399
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,990
The way you're swallowing sounds naughty.

400
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,530
Whatever.

401
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,860
- My bad.
- Is this a mileage program?

402
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,560
Why do you keep collecting wrongdoings?

403
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,300
You'll be able to claim a reward soon.

404
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,930
Reward? Whatever.

405
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,810
- Hey.
- Learn how to drive.

406
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,480
- Seriously.
- What...

407
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,210
So you claimed your reward.

408
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,780
I wouldn't take it even if it were free.

409

410
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,510
(Life cycle of the street)

411
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,880
"Life cycle of the street"?

412
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,410
Yes. I heard it somewhere before,

413
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,480
that streets have life cycles.

414
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,480
I didn't understand then,
but I kind of get it now.

415
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,650
Streets are similar to people.

416
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,820
They were pushed out farther and farther
from the center of Hongdae.

417
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,760
But they still do well.

418
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,070
But then again,

419
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,470
they experienced being pushed out,
so they knew how to survive.

420
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,140
I plan to make the subtitle

421
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,240
"We may be displaced,
but we still live on" as I mentioned.

422
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,280
Is that okay?

423
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,040
It's okay.

424
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,570
(Antique Cafe)

425
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,380
This place is cool too.

426
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Did you take a lot?

427
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,130
(We May Be Displaced,
but We Still Live On)

428
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,010
You didn't take any pictures of people.

429
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,550
I never do.

430
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,780
There's no one I want to photograph.

431
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,990
- Why not?
- There was no one

432
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,060
I wanted to look at for a long time.

433
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,130
Didn't you ever have a girlfriend?

434
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,500
I did. Many. A wide variety.

435
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,610
Then you should've taken
a wide variety of pictures of them.

436
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,650
None of them were serious.

437
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,050
So if I ever take a photo of someone,

438
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,160
it would mean...

439
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,400
I like that person a lot.

440
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,880
But

441
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,320
I doubt that'll happen.

442
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,400
What did you mean by that?

443
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,670
- What?
- You said you would never take a photo

444
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,440
of anyone.

445
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm too lazy and fearful

446
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,050
to like anyone.

447
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,420
I'm not confident that I won't change

448
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,120
or that I'll be with them till the end.

449
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,790
It's just

450
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,060
not for me.

451
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,760
Do you speak from experience?

452
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,930
I speak from observations.

453
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,530
Happy endings don't exist around me.

454
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,030
Do happy endings even exist?

455
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,670
All endings are sad.

456
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,870
Exactly.

457
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,640
Not starting at all may be a solution.

458
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,430
I'm tired.

459
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,540
Why are you staring?

460
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,410
It's so pretty.

461
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,510
I'm prettier than both
the girl and the guy.

462
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,610
Not that kind of pretty.

463
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,550
They're not doing anything
but looking at each other.

464
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,420
But they look happy
and keep looking at each other.

465
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,360
Isn't it amazing?

466
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,590
Where do people meet
and how do they fall in love?

467
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
At the same time, too.

468
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,070
Do you have more places to shoot?

469
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,140
I'm done. Aren't you hungry?

470
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,440

Hello?

473
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,620
Mr. On?

474
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,760
Hold on.

475
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,700
Yes.

476
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,240
You went to work on a Saturday?

477
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,840
I thought I'd be efficient.
I'm working while waiting

478
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,710
for our date.

479
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,570
Calling it a "date" is a bit...

480
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,180
If you don't like calling it a date,

481
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,110
let's say you're paying me back.

482
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,610
You said you felt bad
and wanted to thank me.

483
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,660
That sounds better.

484
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,730
When will you be done? I'll come to you.

485

but we'll be done soon.

487
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,940
Then I'll come there.

488
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,270
(- What?)
- See you soon.

489

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,400
You must be hungry.

495
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,430
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- You must be tired.

496
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,030
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

497
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,770
- Happy birthday.
- Hi.

498
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,340
Hi.

499
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,070
Sit down.

500
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,570
- Sit.
- Happy birthday.

501
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,510
Thank you.

502
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,880
Let's eat now.

503
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,180
- Okay. You first.
- Let's eat.

504
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,080
- Eat before it gets cold.
- Everything looks great.

505
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,120
Eat before it gets cold.

506
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,890
Go first. I have plans.

507
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,530
- With whom? The CEO?
- Yes.

508
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,860
You said you weren't seeing him.

509
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,900
So why are you meeting him?

510
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,630
Why would a guy and girl meet
at this hour if they're not dating?

511
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,270
Whom I meet with is none of your...

512
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,410
It's not what you think.

513
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,840
And even if there were something
between Mr. On and me,

514
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,110
it's unrelated to this job.

515
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,650
So there is something.

516
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,150
You'll be the first to know
something does develop.

517
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,250
Happy?

518
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,030
Woo-yeon.

519
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,360
Later.

520
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,230
Don't you see me at all?

521
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,070
I'm too good looking to be invisible.

522
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,440
I apologize. I saw only Woo-yeon.

523
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,140
You must have
a very narrow field of vision.

524
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,040
I tend to see only what I want to see.

525
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,380
Hey. Aren't you leaving?

526
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,990
I'm going. I'll go.

527
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,390
Okay. Bye then.

528
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,760
Okay then. See you next time.

529
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,900
Are his organs made of butter?

530
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,100
He's so greasy.

531
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,550
Did you decide
to visit the places together?

532
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,050
I want to do well on the photo book.

533
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm sure you will.

534
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,670
You must be tired.

535
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
I am.

536
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,180
My mom said she'd take you out to eat
because you worked so hard.

537
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,750
She really thinks of you as a daughter.

538
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,250
I worked nonstop today.

539
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,390
Your eldest sister helped.

540
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,360
Your second sister only ate.

541
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,430
Your youngest sister
came just in time to eat.

542
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,970
If that's what it means
to think of me as a daughter,

543
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,300
I don't want it.

544
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,310
Sorry.

545
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,110
I'll tell my mom
not to contact you anymore...

546
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,450
You should've done that a while ago.

547
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,380
You told me not to.

548
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,350
How could you not,
just because I said not to?

549
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,620
How can I trust a man like this?

550
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,260
You said you liked that I listened.

551
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,360
I didn't know
you'd listen only to what I say.

552
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,130
We were together for ten years.
How could you not know me yet?

553
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,370
You said to ask you before doing anything.

554
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,710
Young-hee. I'm not angry.

555
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,810
Pull over.

556
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,610
No.

557
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,510
I won't say anything,

558
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,350
so just stay.

559
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,660
I'm sure you go to nice places
all the time,

560
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,560
so places like this
are probably beneath you,

561
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,260
but I have no choice.

562
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm still a poor calligrapher.

563
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,500
I was going to pay.

564
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,540
I knew you'd try that, so I already paid.

565
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,340
You like excuses, so it's obvious.

566
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,710
"I bought today, so you buy next time."

567
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
You'd probably make an excuse
to meet again.

568
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,950
You got me.

569
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,020
Do you

570
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,860
believe in fate?

571
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,970
Are you saying

572
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,970
you and I are fated to be together?

573
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,370
I think it is fate.

574
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,650
We only just met.

575
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,750
You can tell a good book
by the first sentence.

576
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,890
How many more excuses will I need

577
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,290
if I want to see you without an excuse?

578
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,710
I wanted to escape,

579
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,780
but I don't think that's right either.

580
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,830
I'm home.

581
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,860
You're home late.

582
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,260
Yes. I'm tired.

583
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,730
Do you feel sick?

584
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,440
Yes. I must have indigestion or something.

585
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,170
My stomach feels uncomfortable.

586
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,510
Want me to prick your finger?

587
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,140
Why are you so foolish?

588
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,480
Don't drink stuff like this
and prick your fingers all the time.

589
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,850
Go see a doctor.

590
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,050
It's just indigestion.

591
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,320
Plus, by the time I'm done
washing dishes, it's nighttime.

592
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,690
When would I go to a doctor?

593
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,460
Go see a doctor now
instead of spending much more later.

594
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,030
Okay.

595
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,660
- Where's Cheol-su?
- I don't know.

596
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,070
I said he can't go to the special class,
so he stormed out.

597
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,230
What did you say that he left?

598
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,510
But then again, it's obvious.
I've been there.

599
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,480
If you're poor, at least be nice.

600
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,910
I'm too poor to be nice.

601
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,750
I'm too busy just trying to survive.

602
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,090
Where are you? Come home.

603
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,360
How much is that special class?
I'll pay for it.

604
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
Woo-yeon.

605
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,410
- I need to tell you...
- That's right. The umbrella.

606
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,120
Let me return it.

607
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,120
Are you trying to get rid of
all possible excuses today?

608
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,320
Yes. I think that's only right.

609
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,460
Next time.

610
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,090
Later, when I have no excuses left,

611
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,430
when I really want you to come out
although I have no excuse.

612
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,470
Let me use that excuse then.

613
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,570
You said you wanted to tell me something.

614
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,210
Well,

615
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,680
actually, you...

616
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,420
Dad?

617
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,020
Mom.

618
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,020
Hi there.

619
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

620
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,460
I'm On Joon-soo.

621
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,600
Don't introduce yourself. There's no need.

622
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,630
But...

623
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
You should go. Go on.

624
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,640
Okay, then. Goodbye.

625
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,070
Okay. Drive safely.

626
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,070
Are you dating again already?

627
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,430
She's popular, that's why.

628
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,700
My daughter is the best. You rock.

629
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,000
Stop it.

630
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,370
Do you hate your daughter dating
that much?

631
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,680
Do you not want to lose your daughter?
Do you cherish me that much?

632
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,380
What family's precious son
are you trying to harass this time?

633
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,220
As a fellow mom, I feel bad. That's why.

634
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,850
Sure.

635
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,390
But...

636
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,390
You'll pay for it.

637
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,030
The pain you cause is a boomerang.
It'll come back to you.

638
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,370
Is she really my mom?

639
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,060
(Crossing the ocean between us)

640
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,910
If there's nothing between you two,
why did you smile like that?

641
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,150
Come in.

642
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,490
Are you never coming back?

643
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,730
You won't even leave a toothbrush behind.

644
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,900
I doubt I'll have a reason to come back.

645
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,600
What are you going to do about all this?

646
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,470
They have good storage services in Korea.

647
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,380
Let's just live together.
Why do you want to move out?

648
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,580
I intend on staying in Korea for a while.

649
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,380
Exactly.

650
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,650
You're here only for a while
and will be gone for a long time.

651
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,560
Will it bother you that much
to stay with your dad?

652
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,530
Yes, it will. Very much.

653
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,270
I'm busy.

654
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,240
If you're done, please leave. Father.

655
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,740
Okay.

656
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,450
Tell me if you need anything.

657
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,850
Here's your bubble tea.

658
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,180
Enjoy.

659
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,520
Hi.

660
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,730
Hey. Can't you look at me
friendlier than that?

661
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,900
The endings are always bad
whenever I'm with you.

662
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,330
It makes me nervous.

663
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,700
How did you know I work here?

664
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,500
Did Sang-hyeok tell you?

665
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,370
Must you be so obvious
that you're unhappy to see me? I'm hurt.

666
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,640
I came here to give you this.

667
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,320
Why did you leave it in my room?
Is it a tip?

668
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,920
I don't need this.

669
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,850
- Why not?
- I lost the other side too.

670
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,890
I was going to throw it out.

671
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
It took a lot to get back to you,
so don't throw it out.

672
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,960
Who knows? The other side
might be somewhere too.

673
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,740
- Did you come here for this?
- Of course not.

674
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,470
I was passing by.

675
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,240
I'm leaving. I'm going to go,

676
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,510
so don't tell me to leave.

677
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,580
I was going to thank you.

678
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,180
Why are you so sensitive?

679
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,650
You always tell me to leave
whenever you open your mouth.

680
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,730
I have a customer. You should go.

681
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,760
You ended up saying it.

682
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,070
I'm leaving.

683
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,640
Welcome.

684
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,570
Gosh. Isn't that you, Kyung Woo-yeon?

685
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,940
Long time no see.

686
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,680
Do you work here?

687
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,320
Are you going to order?

688
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,320
I heard you do calligraphy.

689
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,920
I guess that's just a hobby.

690
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,320
It's my job.

691
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,360
There are so many jobless people
these days.

692
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,930
- These are hard times.
- "Jobless"?

693
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,490
Cheer up.

694
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,500
Call me later. Let's grab food together.

695
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,310
(Samin Securities, Hwang Ji-hyeon)

696
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,950
I'll pass on grabbing food.
I'll send a book to your office though.

697
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,520
- A book?
- Yes.

698
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,650
My calligraphy photo book
will be published soon.

699
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,090
By Eunyu Publishing.

700
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,960
Isn't that a huge publisher?

701
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,520
They're publishing your book?

702
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,730
Yes.
The CEO specifically asked me to do it.

703
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,840
Here's your bubble tea.

704
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,910
Enjoy.

705
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,850
Why is that punk still here?

706
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,990
Woo-yeon. Break time.

707
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,460
Okay.

708
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,040
Welcome. What would you like to order?

709
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,640
One black sugar milk tea
and one black milk tea.

710
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:44,770
Okay.

711
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,240
Why do you look like that?
You made a good comeback.

712
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,580
You're crumpled like a snowman
that got beat up.

713
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,320
No reason.

714
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,020
I just feel out of place.

715
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,820
When someone calls me a writer,

716
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,990
I think I'm going in the right direction,

717
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,960
but when I'm working here,

718
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,190
when I'm with my parents,

719
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,530
or in instances like this,

720
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,200
I question my worth.

721
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,070
I'm always apologetic

722
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,080
To myself and to my parents.

723
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,380
I'm not proud about a single thing.

724
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,380
I think I've become useless.

725
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,620
I don't know why I'm saying this to you.

726
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,790
You don't know how this feels, do you?

727
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,130
You've got everything going for you,
so you wouldn't know how it feels

728
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,100
to be looked down on,
to be nervous, or to lag behind.

729
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,370
How many people do you think
live without feeling that?

730
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,240
My parents fought every day
until they finally got divorced.

731
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,140
They didn't care if I was scared or hurt.

732
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,110
They divorced without thinking about me.

733
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,780
Then one day, I found them
as friends like nothing happened.

734
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,720
That annoyed me so much
that I ran away to the US.

735
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,890
The language barrier was high,
and so was racism.

736
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,190
I thought I was good at photography,
but there were millions of geniuses.

737
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:15,160
That's why I took pictures day and night
like crazy.

738
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,730
I was nervous.

739
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,700
I didn't want to lag behind.

740
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,340
I was scared.

741
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,450
I'm not telling you to stop talking
because I had a hard time too.

742
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,680
I'm just saying

743
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,820
that I'm not as great as you think.

744
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,090
The only great thing about me

745
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,860
is my face.

746
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,190
At times like this,
I realize you're not a complete jerk.

747
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,390
I'm not.

748
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,260
You sound like a friend today.

749
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,000
I am always your friend.

750
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,750
(Eunyu Publishing)

751
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,080
Hello?

752
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,680
Yes, Mr. On.

753
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,750
You have something to say?

754
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,820
Okay, I'll see you later.

755
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,200
Do you have something to say to me?

756
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,600
Could you excuse me for a moment?

757
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,150
You're so frustrating.
Why would you tell her?

758
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,850
It feels like I'm lying to her.

759
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,820
She'll be more upset
if she finds out later.

760
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,320
Joon-soo, Joon-soo, Joon-soo!

761
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,290
This is your problem.
You're too honest about everything.

762
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,990
How much longer will you follow the rules?

763
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:51,690
Still.

764
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,560
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

765
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:58,000
You're starting to get really corny.

766
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,070
(CEO On Joon-soo)
You're starting to get really corny.

767
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,940
I guess friend mode is off.

768
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,880
I'll see myself out, sir.

769
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,480
Please let me know when you're done.

770
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:11,610
Okay.

771
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,660
(CEO On Joon-soo)

772
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,230
Mr. On.

773
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,700
Can you promise me something?

774
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,510
No matter what I say, promise me
you'll keep on seeing me.

775
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,180
I shouldn't be so reckless
about making promises.

776
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,280
Please go ahead.

777
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,650
I changed my phone number a year ago.

778
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,220
And then I received a call.

779
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,290
- It was coincidentally...
- Who's the owner of car number 7364?

780
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,800
Is that you?

781
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,430
Please excuse me for a minute.

782
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,920
Hi.

783
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,130
He acts like he's all that,
but he's so absentminded.

784
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,520
(Woo-yeon)

785
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,480
Sorry. I had to move my car.

786
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,190
You had a call.

787
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,290
I did?

788
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,730
(Woo-yeon)

789
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,660
Woo-yeon.

790
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,730
- Let me explain.
- Don't explain.

791
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,540
It'll make me feel even more humiliated.

792
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,850
Woo-yeon.

793
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,980
At least...

794
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,020
At least hear me out.

795
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,890
Were you having fun?

796
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,460
Did I seem easy to you
because I was sobbing

797
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,230
and clinging to a guy?

798
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,370
How little did you think of me?

799
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,470
Did you throw a few jobs my way
so that you could toy with me?

800
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,570
I first found out at the company dinner.

801
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,910
I liked your calligraphy.

802
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,710
I never once laughed at or mocked you.

803
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,010
I know how you feel.

804
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,110
How could I dare?

805
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,990
I liked someone before.

806
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,720
Very much, and for a very long time.

807
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,360
What you said on the phone

808
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,430
was just like how I felt back then.

809
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,700
That's why I sympathized.

810
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,500
Because it's nearly impossible
to meet someone like me.

811
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,640
And that makes it special.

812
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,910
I don't lose things that are special.

813
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,420
I'm sorry.

814
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,020
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.

815
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,190
I was just embarrassed.

816
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,960
It was the side of my that I despised.

817
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,030
It was something
I couldn't talk about sober.

818
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,460
And you of all people found out about it.

819
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,930
I'm sorry for not telling you.

820
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,410
I feel bad, so let me use that
as an excuse today

821
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,540
to drive you home.

822
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,760
May I

823
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,230
ask you something?

824
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,430
Anything.

825
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,800
So...

826
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,630
Why did things not work out
with that person?

827
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,040
Should I not have asked?

828
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,940
She married my brother.

829
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,680
There's no need to make that face.

830
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,520
If it had worked out with her,

831
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,920
I never would've met you.

832
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,460
You're so forward.

833
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,560
I learned that if you stall and hesitate,
you'll lose out.

834
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:21,970
Bye.

835
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,010
Did you see his face?

836
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,010
- Did you see his car?
- Did you see his body?

837
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:34,610
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

838
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,630
What is it?

839
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,870
You need to share.

840
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,940
I'm getting lightheaded.

841
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,120
So, you called your CEO

842
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,120
- by mistake for a year...
- Wasted and crying,

843
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,550
and he fell for that and is pursuing you.

844
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,860
Something like that.

845
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,390
This is amazing.

846
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,190
Respect, Woo-yeon.

847
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,530
Stop that.

848
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,300
Others would get
restraining orders against them,

849
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,170
but you got a budding romance instead.

850
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,570
Is she fated to date around?

851
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,810
I say she's fated to be humiliated.

852
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,010
Stop teasing me. I really feel humiliated.

853
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,280
That's the point.

854
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,110
Notwithstanding that,
he says he likes you.

855
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,550
This is what you call true love.

856
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,490
Lucky you.

857
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,320
My mom said I could meet guys

858
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,490
like Hyun Bin and Lee Min-ho
if I pass the bar.

859
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,400
I couldn't find a single male ant,

860
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,500
but Woo-yeon has guys come in swarms.

861
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,700
It's not a swarm. It's just one.

862
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,170
Soo is in Seoul too.

863
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,740
Soo actually brought her luck.

864
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,640
That's right.

865
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,410
What?

866
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,410
What?

867
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,380
(Impudent Woo-yeon)

868
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,430
Woo-yeon?

869
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,170
Soo?

870
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,070
Why are you picking up?

871
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,540
He's doing the dishes.
Should I give him the phone?

872
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,140
No.

873
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,510
Hey. Why didn't you tell me
you changed your number? You should've...

874
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,280
told me, then it would've been nice.

875
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,710
Do you have a split personality?

876
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,280
It's rare for two personalities
to show up in a single sentence.

877
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,590
Wait for me there tonight.

878
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,190
You left your sunglasses.

879
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:00,890
Are you coming now?

880
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,990
Yes.

881
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,430
Well, I need to tell you something too.

882
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,430
Okay.

883
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,340
Did you tell Mr. On

884
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,040
that his cell phone number
is your old number?

885
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,280
Why would I?

886
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,680
Good. I'm glad.

887
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,010
Then please don't tell him.

888
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,520
To be more precise,

889
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,490
please don't tell him
that I used to like you.

890
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,190
Please.

891
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,060
Is that what you came here to say?

892
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,160
Well...
I had to return your sunglasses too.

893
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,530
Please, Soo.

894
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,000
Don't talk like that.

895
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,230
Okay.

896
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,310
I'll text you an address.
Meet me there at 1 p.m. Thursday.

897
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,310
What?

898
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,610
That's right.

899
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,950
I just realized that I'm a big mouth.

900
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,520
Hey!

901
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,890
Like I'll actually go?

902
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,900
- You came.
- You said to come.

903
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,270
I didn't know you'd actually come.

904
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,870
Come in.

905
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,480
What is this place?

906
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:43,830
Get started. Work.

907
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,970
Hey. Why would I work for you?

908
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,070
You don't want to?

909
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,370
My mouth got about 0.7mm
bigger than yesterday.

910
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:57,280
These hands are excellent
for manual labor. I bet you didn't know.

911
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,280
Where should I start?

912
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,690
- That.
- Okay.

913
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,860
Where should I put this?

914
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,090
In the bedroom.

915
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,170
Goodness. That slipped.

916
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,370
No, it didn't. You threw that.

917
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,310
Was it obvious?

918
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,820
Don't forget we have a dinner tonight.

919
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,020
Everyone has to be there.

920
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,090
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

921
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,260
Okay.

922
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,100
All we ever do
is go out for company dinners.

923
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,540
(Wifey, are you working late tonight?)

924
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,140
(Work dinner. Pork restaurant.)

925
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,410
What's this?
Did you and your girlfriend make up?

926
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:16,950
You look happy.

927
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,080
I should go to apologize.

928
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,920
You're too whipped.
And you're not even married yet.

929
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,490
I want her to hold onto me
and never let go.

930
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,390
Listen to him. What a lovebird.

931
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,660
Thank you for the compliment.

932
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,210
Sort the books by literature
and non-literature, and by size.

933
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,340
You know to separate poetry
and novels, right?

934
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,560
Don't you have any friends
who can help you move?

935
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,360
I do. You.

936
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,500
I'm paying for my sins.

937
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,000
I must've been committed treason
in my past life.

938
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,920
(Happy birthday, Soo)

939
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,760
(Happy birthday, Soo)

940
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,930
(Happy birthday.
Take us out to celebrate.)

941
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:53,350
(I like you, Soo.)

942
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,020
How many times did I tell him
that I liked him?

943
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,390
And he rejected me each time.

944
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,390
Are you done?

945
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,930
I still have that?

946
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,000
It's so dusty.

947
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,170
Dust is all you gain with time.

948
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,000
All done. I'm finished.

949
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,680
You did it all.

950
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,810
I did what you asked.

951
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,080
- So you have to...
- Do you want to hide it that badly?

952
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,620
What?

953
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,990
Do you hate the idea of that CEO guy
knowing that you liked me

954
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,190
that badly?

955
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,920
It's not just Mr. On.
I don't want anyone to know.

956
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,030
It hurts my pride.

957
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,200
Why does liking someone hurt your pride?

958
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:53,010
I had a crush on one guy for many years.
Yes, that hurts my pride.

959
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,670
It makes me look pathetic.
It makes me look easy.

960
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,880
Just as you thought of me
as a way to kill time,

961
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,970
others may do the same.

962
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,690
None of the things you said
actually came out of my mouth.

963
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,950
Regardless.

964
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,160
You hacked up my pride,
but half of it still remains.

965
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,460
So I want to protect that.

966
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:18,530
You can do that much for me, right? Bye.

967
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,130
Stay for dinner. I'll order food.

968
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,940
I have plans. I'm going out to dinner.

969
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,440
With whom? With that CEO?

970
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,610
Yes.

971
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,620
How do I open this?

972
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:55,760
Don't go.

973
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,210
Don't go out with him.

974
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,360
I don't want you seeing him.

975
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:23,200
(You have to be on your toes
when you're in the tiger's den.)

976
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,700
(This tiger is especially)

977
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,700
(dangerous.)

978
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,380
Woo-yeon.

979
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:45,480
(The promise of 4 hour)

980
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,650
It's break time.
