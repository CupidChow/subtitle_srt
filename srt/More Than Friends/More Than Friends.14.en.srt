1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,480
Get out of my misery.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,920
What?

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,990
Let's...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,020
break up, Hyun-jae.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,290
What do you mean?

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,790
How could we break up?
That makes no sense.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,360
That makes the most sense to me.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,870
My situation...

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,440
keeps wronging you.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,110
Then you feel apologetic toward me
although you did nothing wrong.

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,850
And although I did nothing wrong,

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,080
I feel apologetic toward you.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,690
That angers me.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,990
If you don't like the other person,
you ruin the relationship.

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,030
But if I don't like myself,

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,730
I'll ruin my life.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,770
So...

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,280
let's break up, Hyun-jae.

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,490
No.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,760
No.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,600
You've always let me win.

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,540
Let me win this time too.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,090
(Wear these shoes)

24
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,930
(and go to nice places
and meet a nice person.)

25
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,730
(So that I couldn't even think
about returning to you.)

26
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,700
(So that I couldn't dare hold on.)

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,440
(Meet someone)

28
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,280
(very, very nice.)

29
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,920
What is it?

30
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,790
It's your brother.

31
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,750
Did you study hard?

32
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,520
Stop worrying about me.

33
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,360
Then grow up quickly.

34
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,070
No.

35
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,170
Grow up slowly.

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm an adult,

37
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,240
so you grow up slowly.

38
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,010
Yes.

39
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,120
Want a push?

40
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,330
No.

41
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,430
You're supposed to ride a swing alone.

42
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,370
Yes.

43
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Why do you think
Pinocchio's nose got longer?

44
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,500
Because he lied.

45
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,670
No. I mean, why his nose?

46
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,030
There were other features too.

47
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,070
Like his arms, legs, or maybe his tongue.

48
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,840
I don't know.

49
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,209
Do you want it?

50
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Yes.

51
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,480
Buy it for me.

52
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,690
I don't know about anything else,

53
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,160
but you can use Pinocchio's nose
to legally hit people.

54
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,930
Wouldn't it be better
to snap it off and swing it?

55
00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:03,040
=Episode 14: Pinocchio's Nose
Pushes People Away=

56
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,950
If you have something to say, say it.
Don't stand there all anxious.

57
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,620
Me?

58
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,790
How much water are you drinking?

59
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,940
Mom.

60
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,080
What?

61
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,550
I want

62
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,050
to take a trip.

63
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,120
Where?

64
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,520
Here and there.

65
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,850
Somewhere far?

66
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,690
Around the world.

67
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,830
Around the world? Out of nowhere?

68
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,730
That will take more than a few months.

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
What about your work?

70
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,570
How will you pay for it?

71
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,770
Well, I don't work in a physical office,

72
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,970
so I can continue to work.

73
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,210
As for the cost, I saved up
to open a workshop.

74
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,610
I want to use that.

75
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,880
Did he ask you to go with him?

76
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,680
No.

77
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,050
Well... Yes, we are going together, but...

78
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,090
But it's not because
he asked me to join him.

79
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,340
I gave it a lot of thought
while publishing the book.

80
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,380
I really love calligraphy,

81
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,810
but I still want to write.

82
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,890
I wanted to go on a trip
around the world one day,

83
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,660
and now I have the chance.

84
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,290
I'm also thinking of writing
a travel essay after the trip.

85
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,830
Do what you want.

86
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,440
What?

87
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,440
Aren't you against it?

88
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm not going to live your life for you.
Why would I be against it?

89
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,209
Why are you so cool about this?

90
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,580
It's not like you ever listen to me.

91
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,960
I didn't know that not listening to you
would be so worthwhile.

92
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,230
Not everything I say is right anyway.

93
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,900
Now that I think about it,

94
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,400
I think I was against everything you liked
and wanted to do.

95
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,670
My daughter is doing well,

96
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,340
but my concerns

97
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,740
only brought down your spirits.

98
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,980
I know you were just worried about me.

99
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,290
I would've said the same thing
if I were you.

100
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,560
The book is really good.

101
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,830
You're doing so well. Thank you.

102
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,500
Of course I'm doing well.
I'm your daughter.

103
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,840
Don't forget about contraception.

104
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,540
What?

105
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,910
Mom, I don't want to talk

106
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,680
so freely with you.

107
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,390
- What?
- What?

108
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,290
Gosh, Woo-yeon.
You're putting your life on love.

109
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,430
I'm not just following Soo.

110
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,760
I'm thinking of writing a travel essay
after the trip.

111
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,530
I'll continue to upload my calligraphy
on my social media account.

112
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,770
You have plans, don't you?

113
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,670
If you do, I'm glad.

114
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,140
I'm done. Didn't you both say
you have things to talk about?

115
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,210
Mine is huge, so I'll go last.

116
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,680
You go first.

117
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,490
I broke up with Hyun-jae.

118
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,960
Why are you all frozen?
You're making me feel awkward.

119
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm just looking
for the right words to say.

120
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,240
You don't have to do that.

121
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,570
It's enough that I'm uncomfortable.

122
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,770
Do you want us to comfort you?

123
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Yes. I told him we should break up.

124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,580
Do I have the right to get comforted?

125
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,150
There is no right to get comforted.
You just get it when you need it.

126
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,750
I won't ask for it
since it makes me shameless.

127
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,290
I'll do it anyway.

128
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,890
You can cry if you want.

129
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,660
Yes. Just cry.

130
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,170
Get off me. It's too hot.

131
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,330
- No.
- I don't want to either.

132
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,040
By the way, what about you?
What do you have to tell us?

133
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,240
- Me?
- Yes.

134
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,380
It's nothing.

135
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,750
What is it?

136
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,360
Why did you two break up?

137
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,300
I don't know.

138
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,570
Why didn't you beg her to stay
if you're suffering so much?

139
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,310
I don't know the reason why
we must break up,

140
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,570
but I understand very well

141
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,710
why I can't beg her to stay.

142
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,990
(Tonight)

143
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,110
She seems fine.

144
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,790
Why do you keep coming here every day?

145
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,810
Young-hee and Hyun-jae broke up.

146
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,680
I heard.

147
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,750
- Did you hear it from Hyun-jae?
- Yes.

148
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,120
I wonder how we'll break up.

149
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,950
Why are you already thinking about
our breakup?

150
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm just saying.

151
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,760
After seeing Young-hee and Hyun-jae,

152
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,290
I feel like
nothing ever lasts in this world.

153
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,200
Perhaps we'll break up too.

154
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,940
If there's someone else in your future
instead of me,

155
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,810
you should date him.

156
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,310
But...

157
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,050
I'm not confident
about letting you do that.

158
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,690
You'll always be in my future.
I don't think there will be anyone else.

159
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,630
So even in the rare case we break up,

160
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,430
the one to leave will be you. Not me.

161
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,130
That's not true.

162
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,070
Do you want to bet?

163
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,600
The one who asks to break up
has to grant the other a wish.

164
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,800
What's the point of all that
when we're breaking up?

165
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,770
That's why we shouldn't break up.

166
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,410
Okay.

167
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,150
(Eunyu Publishing Company)

168
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,820
(Is the cover design for the 20th anniversary)

169
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,320
of the complete series
of world literature coming along well?

170
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,660
Yes. We have the draft, and we're
looking for a calligrapher.

171
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,230
Can't we ask Ms. Kyung Woo-yeon?

172
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,430
She's expressive,
and her book is getting positive reviews.

173
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,000
I contacted her already
and she says she isn't available.

174
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,670
She's going on a trip with her boyfriend
for about a year or two.

175
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,150
What is it?

176
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,720
Are you all right?

177
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,890
No, I'm not.

178
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,220
I should be okay, but I'm not.
I'm disappointed in myself,

179
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,660
so I'm not okay.

180
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,330
Are you going to go see Ms. Kyung?

181
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,700
Will she let me see her if I go to her?

182
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,970
There's one thing you're good at.

183
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,010
You're good at going to her
with an excuse.

184
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,910
I don't have a good excuse
to take with me.

185
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,250
It has to be a really good one this time.

186
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,880
"A Daily Occurrence For You,
a Trip For Me".

187
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,090
You know we're reprinting it.

188
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,020
Article 9 Clause 1
of the publication contract

189
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,060
states that we must give notice
when reprinting.

190
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,960
I believe Ms. Jung is meeting

191
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,860
with Ms. Kyung this afternoon.

192
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,410
We didn't know we'd reprint it so fast.

193
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,640
Congratulations.

194
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,110
It's too bad you didn't know. I did.

195
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,120
Thank you for the congratulations.

196
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,220
Did you meet with Ms. Kyung?

197
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,820
She's meeting with someone else.

198
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,960
- With who?
- With our CEO.

199
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,260
Why him?

200
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,330
He said he'll meet with her personally.

201
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,440
Where are they meeting?

202
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,170
It's what publishers have to do.

203
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,880
Under Article 9 Clause 1
of the publication contract,

204
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,980
we're obligated to inform you
about any reprints.

205
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,980
I wanted to congratulate you
on the reprint and also to say hello.

206
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,990
Have a safe trip.

207
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,050
I wanted to tell you that in person.

208
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,530
I was worried when I heard
you rejected our offer.

209
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm glad I wasn't the reason
why you rejected it.

210
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,270
If you have to decline an offer,

211
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,910
I'd be stealing an opportunity from you.

212
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,680
When I look at you,

213
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,810
you're so calm and composed.

214
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,450
I have a lot to learn from you.

215
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,820
You're like a real adult.

216
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,389
I'm not an adult.

217
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,820
I'm struggling to hang in there

218
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,030
because I don't want to burden you.

219
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:05,940
Once you return from your trip
after some time,

220
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,270
and if you're okay with it,

221
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,010
I'd like to be friends with you.

222
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,010
I can act like we were only friends
to begin with,

223
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,610
and act like I only gave you comfort.

224
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,980
I'm confident I can do that.

225
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,120
Don't you have any friends?

226
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,120
Should I become your friend?

227
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,620
Then buy me a meal first.

228
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,490
How did you know I was here?

229
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,060
I followed you.

230
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,860
Why do you like that?

231
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,800
Because I'm beautiful.

232
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,040
All right.

233
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,750
(Tonight)

234
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,620
Was that your jealousy acting up earlier?

235
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,320
No.

236
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,130
Then what was it? Do you like Mr. On?

237
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,390
I like you.

238
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,470
My boyfriend is really cool.

239
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,870
Of course.

240
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,940
You like to keep it cool.

241
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,240
Is there anything

242
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,380
I did to disappoint you?

243
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,380
No, I've never been disappointed.

244
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,420
I like everything about you.

245
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,150
Are you upset about anything?

246
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,460
How can I not be upset about anything
when I'm in love?

247
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,060
You get more upset and hurt
because you're in love.

248
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,530
But it's because of love
you can understand the other person.

249
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,900
Can't you tell me?

250
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,780
I won't tell you. You should make a guess.

251
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Okay.

252
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,550
I'll guess them all.

253
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,520
I'll get the right answers
and I'll adjust myself to you.

254
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,270
You'll drink more, right?

255
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,330
No, I'm going to stop.

256
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,970
I'll drink it then.

257
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,070
Take me home if I get drunk.

258
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,010
Even better if you take me with you.

259
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,210
Will you be okay with my parents?

260
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,020
Now that I think about it,
I should sleep at home.

261
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,350
In my home. On my bed.

262
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,960
(Tonight)

263
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,800
What happened?

264
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,260
What is it, Woo-yeon? What happened?

265
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,870
What is it?

266
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,670
Don't come near me!

267
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,320
I told you I don't want you to get hurt.

268
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,970
Jin-ju and Sang-hyeok are dating.

269
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,040
I know it very well.

270
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,070
I saw them myself,

271
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,610
and you told me 18 times already.

272
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,080
It's just so shocking. Why?

273
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,880
Let's stop talking about other couples.
Should we talk about us?

274
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,920
Like what?

275
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,750
When should I go talk to your parents?

276
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,590
For what?

277
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,360
Don't they know you're going
on the trip with me?

278
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,360
They do. I told them.

279
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,560
Then I should go greet them.

280
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,800
They must be worried about
sending their daughter away.

281
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,400
Is that necessary?

282
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,600
It'll get me brownie points
from my future in-laws.

283
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,670
"In-laws"?
It's not like we're going to get married.

284
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,080
Aren't you going to marry me?

285
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,320
It's not that.
Marriage is something so far away.

286
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,850
Just dating is okay,

287
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,020
but I want to stay by your side forever.

288
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,730
Let's go meet them on the weekend.

289
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,490
Okay.

290
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,520
Hello? Son? Did something happen?

291
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,860
Yes. No.

292
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,230
I just called.

293
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,300
(Hello?)

294
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,900
Why aren't you talking?

295
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,130
(Because I'm happy.)

296
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,930
You called me first when nothing happened.

297
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
This is a first.

298
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,510
Are you free this Sunday?

299
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,940
Of course I am.
Even if I'm not, I should make time.

300
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,050
Then

301
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,380
see you on Sunday, Mom.

302
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,070
(Won-jung)

303
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,340
Yes? Hello?

304
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,840
Don't be shocked and listen to this.

305
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,410
Soo called me and asked to meet on Sunday.

306
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,080
Really? That's great news.

307
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,720
Where should we go?
Should I pick you up from home?

308
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,790
Why would you?

309
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,820
You said Soo wants to meet on Sunday.

310
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,990
Exactly. So why would you?

311
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,400
Didn't he invite me?

312
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
No.

313
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,970
I'll ask him for you.

314
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,370
No, that makes me feel more pathetic.

315
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Should I not?

316
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,140
You should still bring it up.

317
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
Okay.

318
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,050
Why is he discriminating?

319
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,160
Darn it.

320
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,210
Sorry. I was going to leave
after taking my stuff.

321
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,110
I figured you wouldn't be able
to throw them away.

322
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,480
I prayed for the first time

323
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,220
and it was answered.

324
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,790
I should start going to church

325
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,660
if my next prayer gets answered too.

326
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,770
Can't we get back together

327
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,100
even if I beg?

328
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,070
Why would you beg
when you didn't do anything wrong?

329
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,810
If I didn't do anything wrong,

330
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,810
why are you throwing me away?

331
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,140
I told you.

332
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,650
My situation keeps wronging you.

333
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,250
I tried to understand.

334
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,060
I tried really hard to break up
since you tell me it's hard on you.

335
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,260
But no matter how hard I think about it,
I don't get why we have to break up.

336
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,130
I can't understand you.

337
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,330
Are you going to throw me away
if I'm in a difficult situation?

338
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,970
Yes.

339
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,140
I would.

340
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,910
Although we dated for ten years,

341
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,120
you won't be able to understand me.

342
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm really asking you for the last time.

343
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,580
I won't

344
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,240
hold onto you anymore.

345
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,650
Do you still want to break up?

346
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,790
Yes.

347
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,260
I want to break up.

348
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,670
Fine.

349
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,670
Let's do that then.

350
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,300
(Faneuil Hall, Old Corner Bookstore)

351
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,800
(Atlanta, Hartsfield, Jackson)

352
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,450
(The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg)

353
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,350
Are we going to all of these places?
That's going to be a tight schedule.

354
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,790
Not all of them,
but it'll still be a tight schedule.

355
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,390
It'll be fun regardless.

356
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,530
This one's nice.

357
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,270
(King Room, large double bed)
This one's nice.

358
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,100
No. The bed is too big.

359
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,670
I want to sleep right next to you.

360
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,210
This is nice.

361
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,340
- What?
- A single bed.

362
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,790
Mom says to come by six tomorrow.

363
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,790
Okay, I won't be late.

364
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,700
Go in.

365
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,770
- You have to let go.
- I don't want to.

366
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,440
We won't need to say bye anymore.

367
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,450
You're right. It'll happen soon.

368
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,790

369
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,860

(Kyung Woo-yeon's Lee Soo)

374
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,490
(Choi Jung-hyun PD)

375
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,060
Sorry for calling you out on a Sunday.

376
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,000
It's fine. Why did you want to meet?

377
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,270
The main character of our next drama

378
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,800
is a calligrapher.

379
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,600
Don't you produce movies?

380
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,900
We produce both movies and dramas.

381
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,240
I'll be straightforward.

382
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,840
Could you do the drama title

383
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,910
and be the hand double
for the main character?

384
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can.

385
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,990
It's a personal matter.

386
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,960
If it's because of last time,
I apologize again.

387
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,730
I pushed hard for you this time,
and that won't happen again.

388
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,270
It's true that I am still hurt,

389
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
but it's a different reason.

390
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,700
- I'm traveling...
- I know it may sound cold,

391
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,410
but opportunities don't know how to wait.

392
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,280
To be honest, it's a bit of a rush,
so I'd like an answer soon.

393
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,430
(- Hey.)
- Hi, Soo. Where are you?

394
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,170
- I stepped out for a bit.
(- Alone?)

395
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,940
- No. I'm with...
(- Son.)

396
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,640
I see. You're with your mother.

397
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,180
(Yes. Why?)

398
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,550
Never mind. See you later.

399
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,780
Okay.

400
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,650
Oh my gosh.

401
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,750
Girlfriend?

402
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,260
Punk. So that's how he is
toward his girlfriend.

403
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,160
So? What should I get?

404
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,700
You bring this, and it's game over.

405
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,910
This is what I brought
to get permission to marry your mom.

406
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,250
Gosh. We got so drunk that night.

407
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,410
No.

408
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,120
- Why not?
- Grandpa hates you.

409
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,630
I'm meeting my girlfriend's parents.
What would you recommend?

410
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,060
- Let's see.
- He doesn't know anything.

411
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,370
What doesn't he know? My dad hates you.

412
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,910
Check on my place and take my car
for a spin now and then.

413
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,680
He's ordering us around
without putting any money in our hands.

414
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,690
If you get paid, you're a servant.
If not, you're a parent.

415
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,720
Choose. Which do you want to be?

416
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,990
I'd prefer a parent though.

417
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,400
- Thanks for today.
- Are you feeling all right?

418
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,330
I'm trying not to hate you.

419
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,070
Because I have someone
who will adore me now.

420
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,850
I made reservations for you.
Enjoy your dinner.

421
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,890
Thanks, son. I'm sure we'll enjoy it.

422
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,190
I'll buy dinner when I return your card.

423
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,420
Make it something expensive.
I'll bring Woo-yeon.

424
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,160
Our son really grew up well.

425
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,470
You're right.

426
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,770
He grew up well
even with incompetent parents.

427
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,870
I'm so grateful.

428
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,710
- Taste it.
- Okay.

429
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,080
It's good.

430
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,490
Why are you sighing so heavily?

431
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,930
Stop that already.

432
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,620
Daughter. Is something wrong?

433
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,010
("My married daughter and I chatted
about old times over a drink recently,")

434
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,640
("and she said I was so strict,")

435
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,320
("that she was hurt very often
when she was young.")

436
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,640
("I thought all that a parent had to do
was feed them and house them,")

437
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,410
("but looking back, I should've had
more faith in my child back then.")

438
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,960
("I should've comforted her.")

439
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,390
("I should've told her more
that I loved her.")

440
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,430
Do you know what I regret the most
about not being educated?

441
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,970
What?

442
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,640
Being ignorant toward you kids.

443
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,780
Screaming, getting mad,

444
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,780
and yelling at you.

445
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,920
Children knowingly

446
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,620
drive stakes into their parents' hearts,

447
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,120
but parents do it unknowingly.

448
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,830
Although the stake in my child's heart

449
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,560
hurts much more than the stake
in my heart...

450
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,530
But I didn't know.

451
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,740
How many stakes
did I drive into your heart?

452
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,880
You didn't drive a single stake
into my heart.

453
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,480
Liar. I know of dozens
off the top of my head.

454
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,350
It's so annoying.

455
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,690
It's because you remember
things like that...

456
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,160
What's lodged in here

457
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,630
are all shards of glass.

458
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,140
They cut you even if you touch it,

459
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,810
but you grabbed them in your hand
and stabbed my heart with them.

460
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,510
How could you be fine?

461
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,590
You fool. Why couldn't you just
drive stakes into my heart like others?

462
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,830
Why did it have to be shards of glass?

463
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,460
It only tore up your hands as well.

464
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,190
Why hug me?

465
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,490
I have shards of glass.

466
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,200
It's good to see
that you and Soo got closer.

467
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,230
It is.

468
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,440
I forgot.

469
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,210
You like steak.

470
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,080
I love meat.

471
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
After this,

472
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,820
shall we go to a recital?

473
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,600
(Pianist Elliott Son Solo Recital)

474
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,700
I think you liked that pianist.

475
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,480
Is it not him?

476
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,380
It's him.

477
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,680
I asked for

478
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,520
a huge favor to get these...

479
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,260
You remember details now that

480
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,390
you try to remember, don't you?

481
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,290
What?

482
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,030
To be honest, I regretted leaving you.

483
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,710
It's past tense.

484
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,710
I'm not sure if it's present progressive.

485
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,320
But I want to keep it to myself.

486
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,660
It's easier just to
see you sometimes like this.

487
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,290
At our age, we're easily scared.

488
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,830
More than a ghost that might
or might not be in the closet,

489
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,630
we know that our emotions can hurt more.

490
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,580
All I can say is that

491
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,010
I am sorry.

492
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,980
You're not just scared, are you?
You've grown up as well.

493
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,560
But you took too long.

494
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,330
Even when we know the answer,

495
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,230
there's an expiry date.

496
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,100
I forgot about that.

497
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,910
Do you think I'll like you
because you bring stuff like this?

498
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,890
We don't need this.
Just be good to our daughter.

499
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,260
Why are we practicing these lines

500
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,030
when he might come empty-handed?

501
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,100
Don't you know about application?

502
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,630
Should we stick to the period drama tone?

503
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:29,970
Yes.

504
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,970
Okay, do it.

505
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,040
Go and get the kids already.

506
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,110
Right.

507
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,310
I will be right back, then.

508
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,550
Why are you out here?

509
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,660
Soo, the thing is...

510
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,530
What are you doing there?

511
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,760
Come in.

512
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,830
Okay.

513
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,930
Let's not keep them waiting.

514
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,770
Wait.

515
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,810
I have something to say.

516
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,070
Let's talk inside.

517
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,990
(We prepared just the right dialogue.)

518
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,260
(It's perfect.)

519
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,340
Do you think I'll like you
because you bring stuff like this?

520
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,070
We don't need this.
Just be good to our daughter.

521
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,310
I'll be good to Woo-yeon
and to both of you as well.

522
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,950
Open it.

523
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,260
I'll exchange it if you don't like it.

524
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,360
By the way...

525
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,300
- My gosh, this is expensive.
- Hey.

526
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,500
You got us this?

527
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,530
This liquor...

528
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,170
This precious brand...

529
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,410
My goodness...

530
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,470
Hey.

531
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,540
I have something to say.

532
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,480
Let's eat first.

533
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,420
Yes.

534
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,230
I'm not going.

535
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,200
I can't go on the trip.

536
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,020
Did you make up your mind?

537
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,190
Yes.

538
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,640
Are you angry?

539
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,740
Why would I be?

540
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,080
I made up my mind
and notified you without talking to you.

541
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,650
I'm not angry.

542
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,820
I can't give up on my dream,
so how can I get angry

543
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,690
that you won't give up on yours?

544
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,770
Should I not go either?

545
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,150
You should go.

546
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,820
Are you okay being apart from me?

547
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,320
How could I be okay?

548
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,330
But I can't realize your dream for you,

549
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,030
and you can't do the same for me.

550
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,840
If one of us had to give up,
we'd resent the other every now and then.

551
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,870
I don't want to do that.

552
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,550
Are you worried?

553
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,150
That we'll break up?

554
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,490
I'm not worried about that.

555
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,230
What terrible timing.

556
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,010
I don't believe sayings about
love being all about timing

557
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,880
and things like that.

558
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,610
See? We're together right now.

559
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,320
I'll be back soon.

560
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,200
Be back soon.

561
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,930
Don't make me wait too long.

562
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,920
(Departures)

563
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,390
Get back safely.

564
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,190
Take care of yourself.

565
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,700
You might miss your flight.

566
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,500
Go on ahead.

567
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,440
You go first. Then I can go inside.

568
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,650
Call me when you land.

569
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,440
I love you, Kyung Woo-yeon.

570
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,980
I love you too.

571
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,550
(Soo left.)

572
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,300
- Hello?
(- Even your cochlea's pretty.)

573
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,100
(Good morning, Woo-yeon.)

574
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,470
Good morning, my Soo.

575
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,170
I'll go again. Good morning, my Woo-yeon.

576
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,080
(Nothing changed.)

577
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
(My Soo)

578
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,220
Are you brushing your teeth?

579
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,950
- Did you brush thoroughly?
(- Yes.)

580
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,960
I'll call back when I'm done.

581
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,260
(My Soo)

582
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,660
Hello?

583
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,200
I feel so nervous.

584
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,270
Don't be. You're always the best.

585
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,910
I love you.

586
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,040
I love you too.

587
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,670
(Life is truly a boomerang.)

588
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,220
What do you do tomorrow?

589
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,850
I take another flight tomorrow.

590
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,420
(For how long?)

591
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,420
Quite a while.

592
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,260
(A few times a day,)

593
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,430
(- Soo called me.)
- I'm at work.

594
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,300
Look. I have so much to do.

595
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,460
(Life is truly a boomerang.
It gives back exactly how much you give.)

596
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,830
(To wait)

597
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,430
You're just like Samantha.

598
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,700
Who's that?

599
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,300
The AI in the film "Her".

600
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,770
You're stuck in my phone,
so you're like an AI.

601
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,240
(Hello. I'm Soo-mantha.)

602
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,310
(We were still in love.)

603
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,620
I'll get out of here soon.

604
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,920
Kyung Woo-yeon. I love you.

605
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,160
- I love you too.
(- Okay.)

606
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,190
(We overcame all the hardships)

607
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,270
(and lived happily for a long, long time.)

608
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,140
(That's a lie.)

609
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,410
(November)

610
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,910
(Time passed slower than I thought,)

611
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,750
(and it's been just two months.)

612
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,450
(My Soo)

613
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,430
Hello?

614
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,690
Did you just get back?

615
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,660
- Yes.
(- Did you have your dinner?)

616
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,630
- Not yet.
- Oh, dear. You should eat soon.

617
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,200
I thought you were tired and in bed.

618
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,040
I thought you'd be busy.

619
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,340
I waited for your call.

620
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,480
I'm almost home.

621
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,250
Okay.

622
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,120
It's hard to call, isn't it?

623
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,320
- I'm a bit busy.
(- You look tired.)

624
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,590
(You must be tired. Go to bed.)

625
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,030
No, I can talk some more.

626
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,970
Will you be busy again tomorrow?

627
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,570
(He used to call me many times a day.)

628
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,410
(Then he called morning and evening.)

629
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,940
(Some days, he called just once.)

630
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,750
(I was up all night taking photos
and passed out. I'm sorry.)

631
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,320
(That's okay.)

632
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,830
(And some days,)

633
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,790
(we just exchanged short text messages.)

634
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,200
I miss you.

635
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,600
I miss you so much too.

636
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,570
I shouldn't have come.

637
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,740
I should've stayed with you.

638
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,410
You should have.

639
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,980
I'm sorry.

640
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,050
Don't apologize.

641
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,510
It's okay.

642
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,490
(Missing each other
turned into resentment.)

643
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,890
(What did you do today?)

644
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,560
The same as always.

645
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,530
What about you?

646
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,500
Me too, the same.

647
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,000
Is something wrong?

648
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,510
No.

649
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,340
Is everything okay?

650
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,580
Yes.

651
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,950
I'm okay.

652
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,490
(When we ran out of memories to share,)

653
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,990
(we)

654
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,690
(kept our mouths shut.)

655
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,330
Did something bad happen recently?

656
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,300
No.

657
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,540
(I'm just tired.)

658
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,510
Okay. Get some rest.

659
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,980
Sleep well, Woo-yeon. I love you.

660
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,450
Sleep well.

661
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,740
I love you. Stay with me for a long time.

662
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,910
That depends on you.

663

(My Soo)

664
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,800
Hello?

665
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,530
What were you doing?

666
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,130
I'm heading home.

667
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,370
I see.

668
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,210
I'm about to catch a flight.

669
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,080
(I'll be in a remote area
and I might not have a signal.)

670
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,980
That's fine.

671
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,560
(I said it's fine like it was a motto,)

672
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,590
(but never for one moment
was I really fine.)

673
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,030
(Lying became the norm.)

674
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,470
I have something to say.

675
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,900
(Okay. What is it?)

676
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,550
Let's

677
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,280
stop doing this.

678
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,220
I want to break up with you.

679
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,690
(Why?)

680
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,200
Just because.

681
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,540
I think that

682
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,680
if we keep this up,
I'll end up hating you.

683
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,990
It's too hard for me.

684
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,360
(Okay.)

685
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,160
(Let's break up.)

686
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:04,870
(Don't cry.)

687
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,670
(Eat well.)

688
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,810
(And sleep well.)

689
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,510
(Take care of yourself.)

690
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,920

691

(The length of the lies we told)

692
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,940
(pushed us away from each other.)

693
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,940
(Eventually,)

694
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,810
(we broke up.)

(Dajin Bridge)

696
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:49,740
(Dajin Bridge)

697
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,740
Why did you walk with me?

698
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,110
Because I didn't want you
to become a weirdo.

699
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,850
Because at times, it's comforting to know

700
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,050
I'm not the only weirdo.

701
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:13,300
You're just as good at comforting others
as always.

702
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,530
I plan to stay that way.

703
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,340
You can come if you need that.

704
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:23,670
I mean it.

705
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,710
You're still just as good
at making me feel shameless.

706
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,020
Do you remember what I said before?

707
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,690
What you said on the phone
was just like how I felt back then.

708
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,960
That's why I sympathized.

709
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,930
When I looked at you,
I kept seeing myself in you.

710
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,260
I think

711
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,070
I may have liked you

712
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,470
in order to console myself.

713
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,240
I thought if you were happy,

714
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,610
I could become happy too.

715
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,050
What I'm trying to say is this.

716
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,420
If we meet again like today,

717
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,730
and you walk under an umbrella
after the rain has stopped,

718
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,960
I can walk with you again.

(Wishing you many beautiful days)

727
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:14,450
You've worked on the titles
for many dramas and movies recently.

728
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,120
Is there a project in particular
that has stayed with you?

729
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,130
It isn't a movie or drama,

730
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,430
but I once had a calligraphy photo book
published by Eunyu Publishing.

731
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,800
"A Daily Occurrence For You,
a Trip For Me"

732
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,600
That book always stays with me.

733
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,240
Is there a special reason for that?

734
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,310
Before that, I wasn't sure whether
calligraphy was my career or a side job.

735
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,010
But as I worked on that book,
I had conviction that it was my career.

736
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:44,250
(Is there a project in particular
that has stayed with you?)

737
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,580
(The CEO of Eunyu Publishing
was the first person to call me an artist.)

738
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,920
(Since it was the first time.)

739
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,720
(Since all firsts are special.)

(Flight 201 to Incheon
will begin boarding.)

741
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,400
With calligraphy, it's important
to write with your emotions.

742
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:11,440
Ms. Kyung. What are you going to write?

743
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,550
I'm not sure.

744
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,080
"First love is"

745
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,620
"muddy water"?

746
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:24,960
What?

747
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,330
You think it's gone
because you forgot about it,

748
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,360
but if you step on it,
it rises up to the top.

749
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,370
Something like that.

Hello?

01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,590
(What were you doing?)

753
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,030
The class just ended,
so I'm going to work on some projects.

754
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,300
(I was thinking of stopping by.)

755
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,200
(To drop off something.)

756
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,240
Okay.

Woo-yeon.

760

I'm back.

761
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,520
This is how far he is.

762
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,400
I know why Pinocchio's nose grew.

763
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,830
Because if it does,
he can't face the other person.

764
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,840
If you lie, this is how far you get
from the other person.

765
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,240
Don't rub noses with another guy.
I'm getting jealous.

766
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,650
(Let's)

767
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,550
(stop doing this.)

768
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,560
(I want to break up with you.)

769
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,470
Why?

770
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,170
(Just because.)

771
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,770
(I think that)

772
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:35,910
(if we keep this up,
I'll end up hating you.)

773
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,950
(It's too hard for me.)

774
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,400
(I lied.)

775
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,340
Okay.

776
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,170
Let's break up.
