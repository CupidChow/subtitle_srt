1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,550
Did you get new earrings?

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,250
(You are so stupid.)

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,750
Out of nowhere?

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,950
But I like that you're stupid.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,720
JJ, I'll call you later.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,890
I love you.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,260
I love you more.

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,330
Bye.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,700
You'll wear out your rings
before you even propose.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,900
He waited way too long.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,480
I want to show him my love extra
to make up for the times I said no.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,780
Gosh. Talk about
the love of the millennium.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,980
What's your problem?

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,450
Why are you mocking us
just because you broke up?

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,990
It's because I'm patient, that I made
a proposal postcard for someone else

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,360
right after my relationship ended.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,760
Thank you.

18
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,560
Is your exhibit tomorrow?

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,630
Yes.

20
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,900
Will you be okay?
Both Mr. On and Soo will be there.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,670
Why wouldn't I be? It's all over anyway.

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,140
- With whom?
- With both.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,240
When?

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,510
Well, it ended a while ago for me.

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,839
And I haven't heard from Mr. On
or Soo since.

26
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,380
It's over.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,850
Mr. On is one thing,
but Soo said he'd wait.

28
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,210
He's selfish.

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,080
If he wanted to,

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,320
he would've called long ago.

31
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,390
It's over for him too.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,559
Who are you to conclude that?

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,860
Because I understand.

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,960
What?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,330
Because that was me.

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,440
When someone I thought would like only me
started seeing someone else,

37
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,540
and when I saw him saying and doing things

38
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,240
that I thought were only for me
to someone else,

39
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:41,279
I got jealous. How ridiculous is that?

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,150
You don't want him, but you don't want
anyone else to have him.

41
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,320
Like that?

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,090
It's like a moment of burning jealousy.

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,490
Something like that.

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,260
And so, that's how it is for Soo.

45
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,689
Right.

46
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,900
Are you sure

47
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,200
about yourself?

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,430
Do you never misunderstand yourself
in any way?

49
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,370
What do you mean?

50
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,540
I just wonder if the emotion
that you say you're sure about

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,610
really is what you feel.

52
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,510
It's human nature
to misunderstand yourself at times.

53
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,010
Is it possible to understand someone else?

54
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,920
I just wonder

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,850
if it's right when you think
you understand someone

56
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,150
is when misunderstandings form.

57
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,960
=Episode 10:
Misunderstanding Called Understanding=

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,670
Is there a reason why each neighborhood

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,970
has a different letter style?

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,110
Yes. We chose ten neighborhoods to include

61
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,010
in this calligraphy photo book

62
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,150
(We May Be Displaced, but We Still Live On)
and decided on a concept for each.

63
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,950
For example, Yeonnam-dong.

64
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,520
It's known for gentrification.

65
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,320
We decided on "We may be displaced,
but we still live on."

66
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,790
So I made the lettering look like
it was being pushed by the wind.

67
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,860
How did you choose these neighborhoods?

68
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,270
The hot places in Seoul.

69
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,000
Because tourists and residents
coexist in those places.

70
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,070
For me, who lived abroad for ten years,

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,070
Seoul is familiar and unfamiliar.

72
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,010
And it was beautiful
because it was unfamiliar.

73
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,680
That is why I wanted to photograph Seoul,
which was both home and a destination.

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,600
Yes?

75
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,570
- Are you busy?
- No. What's up?

76
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,350
- Hey, Young-hee.
- Yes?

77
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,250
So...

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
You know, I...

79
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,389
Hold on.

80
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,759
Hi, sweetie.

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,560
Now?

82
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,860
Okay. Sure.

83
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,430
Yes? What's up?

84
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,040
Never mind. It's nothing.

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,270
- Was that Hyun-jae?
- Yes.

86
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,540
Yes. He's out front. I'll be right back.

87
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,380
Okay.

88
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,410
You look like you want to say something.

89
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,480
I told you, it's nothing.

90
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,750
Okay, then. I'll be right back.

91
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,990
You seem strange.

92
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,790
Okay, bye.

93
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,830
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,170
Why did you run? What if you fall?

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,410
If I fall, you'll catch me.

96
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,770
Do you trust me that much?

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,180
Yes. Am I wrong to trust you?

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,780
You can never do wrong.

99
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,590
I know.

100
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,560
Hold on.

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,230
Hand it over.

102
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,959
You must have ESP.

103
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,800
Here's my offering.

104
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,140
I love it.

105
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,209
The truck was by my home.

106
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,640
You love these.

107
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,150
You sweet thing. How are you so sweet?

108
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,810
I can only do sweet things.

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,209
No.

110
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
Let's go.

111
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,020
- Young-hee.
- Yes?

112
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,950
Share.

113
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,290
Get over here.

114
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,120
He didn't have to shun me like that.

115
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,320
I felt so awkward.

116
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,459
(I wonder how the exhibit went.)

117
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,959
The exhibit went well.

118
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,160
Something else will probably start now.

119
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,930
Something else? What?

120
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,600
Affection?

121
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,170
Excuse me.

122
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,040
Why did you stop excusing yourself?

123
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,980
Why are you talking to me?
You should've just ignored me like before.

124
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,350
I was flustered earlier.

125
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,209
I didn't know what to say first.

126
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,650
I said I'd wait,

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,820
but if I show up
and act like everything is fine,

128
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,950
I'd be hurting you again.

129
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,690
I guess

130
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,760
you were disappointed that I ignored you.

131
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,800
I was not.

132
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,540
Woo-yeon, let's go eat.
I'll treat to barbecue.

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,370
I'm a vegetarian.

134
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,910
Then do you want to get a salad?

135
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,440
I only eat meat.

136
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,880
You just said you're a vegetarian.

137
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,440
Yes. I have multiple personalities.

138
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,080
Can you ask your other personality

139
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,680
if she hates me too?

140
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,420
One of them must like me.

141
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,790
There you are. Let's go eat.

142
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,190
- That's okay, I...
- I already made reservations.

143
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,690
Our staff is waiting for you.

144
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,860
Let's go.

145
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,750
Is the food not to your liking?

146
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,220
No, it's good.

147
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,690
- You said you're a vegetarian.
- I told you I have multiple personalities.

148
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,500
By the way, what's the relationship
between you two?

149
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,630
There aren't many terms that describe
the relationships between people,

150
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,440
but we use several of those terms.

151
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,640
They went to the same high school.

152
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,580
Our CEO is so caring.

153
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,090
He finds interest in everyone.

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,090
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

155
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,800
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,670
Aren't you going home, sir?

157
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,240
- You should go first.
- All right.

158
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,810
I'll get going too.

159
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,050
- I'll drive you home.
- I'll drive you home.

160
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,750
No. I'll go alone.

161
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,260
I don't mean anything by it.

162
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,860
You did a great job up to now,
and today too.

163
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,860
I'm just thankful.

164
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,500
I have other intentions.

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,670
I'm sorry about today.

166
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,050
Get in.

168
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,310
- I'll get going too.
- Let's go for a drink.

169
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,020
We're not close enough to share drinks.

170
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,050
We exchanged fists, so why not drinks?

171
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,460
You should go in.

172
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,700
I don't want to let you go.

173
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,110
What are you doing?

174
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,310
I'm shooting the back
of Shin Hyun-jae's head.

175
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,820
Are you trying to stab me in the back?

176
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,790
Yes.

177
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,620
You're so smiley I can't hit you.

178
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,260
Would you hit me if I looked gloomy?

179
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,060
That would make it harder
for me to hit you.

180
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,530
I have a soft heart, remember?

181
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Right.

182
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,140
You can look forward to your birthday.

183
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
- Go in.
- Okay.

184
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,750
Let's drink separately.

185
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,480
We're not close enough
to pour for each other.

186
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
I like your suggestion.

187
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,790
I don't want to share anything
with you either.

188
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm on the same page.

189
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,530
- Don't you know you're too late?
- Don't you know you're clingy?

190
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,700
What? "Clingy"?

191
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,570
It's already over between you two.
Why did you hold an exhibition?

192
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,870
You made excuses so she wouldn't
be able to decline.

193
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,370
It's you who's coming on strong
to someone who doesn't like you.

194
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,940
You're pressuring her.

195
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,150
Yes. She could be pressured
by my good looks.

196
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,210
That's why she liked me.

197
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,420
But she says she doesn't like you anymore.

198
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,920
You're a young guy.
Why are you living in the past?

199
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,930
I'm trying to figure out
if she really doesn't like me.

200
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,830
She rejected you several times.

201
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,000
Doesn't it hurt when she says
she doesn't like you?

202
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,970
It's okay to get hurt. I deserve it.

203
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,340
I hurt her more.

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,700
I didn't know how much she liked me.

205
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,470
How could I love her when I don't know?

206
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,310
I was always on my toes.

207
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,810
I endured it over and over again,

208
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,450
and she broke up with me.

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,380
Am I Cinderella?

210
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,950
Exactly.

211
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,090
She's so mean. She's worse than me.

212
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,520
Yes.

213
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,530
That's why you should give up on her.

214
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,490
What? No, no.

215
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,360
You should give up on her.

216
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,870
The thing is,
bad people should date each other

217
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,040
so no one good would be hurt.

218
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,640
You're...

219
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,770
You're too nice.

220
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,580
No, no. Soo. Listen. Listen.

221
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,750
A bad woman. This is a bad woman.
If a bad woman

222
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,290
and a bad man date... Watch.

223
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,120
One of them

224
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,490
will die. They will die like this.

225
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,490
- All of a sudden?
- So?

226
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,300
Are you going to keep on liking
Kyung Woo-yeon?

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,830
Of course.
She'll see when she comes to me.

228
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,240
What are you going to do?

229
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,470
- I'm going to be so good to her.
- Really?

230
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,210
I'll do everything I can for her.

231
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,080
I'll even do things I can't do for her.

232
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,280
Do you know what I mean?

233
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,780
You're so ambitious.

234
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,690
I can do so much more than you,

235
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,060
but she won't come to me.

236
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,970
Sir. Over here.

237
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,570
Can you give us more soup?

238
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,080
What is this?

239
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,250
It's Kyung Woo-yeon.

240
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,790
What's with you?

241
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,290
Is it because I'm drunk?

242
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,830
You look really pretty.

243
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,100
You're so pretty.

244
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,870
I'm so drunk.

245
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,810
Hey. You're really drunk.
How did you get here?

246
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,940
I took a taxi.

247
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,650
I had to pay so much
for the nighttime extra charge.

248
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,610
Good for you.

249
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,780
I'll call a taxi, so hurry up and leave.

250
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,450
Why do you always tell me to leave?

251
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,020
Are you going to sleep here, then?

252
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,730
I'll call a taxi,
so stop with the nonsense.

253
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,230
Woo-yeon.

254
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,800
Can you please like me again?

255
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,340
Don't say it's over.

256
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,400
(What a nice dream.)

257
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,030
My goodness.

258
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,900
Both of them must be up.

259
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,100
Why aren't you surprised?

260
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,500
What could surprise me when I raised you?

261
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,180
But how could
both of them act so similarly?

262
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,320
I'm sorry about everything.

263
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,980
I always held everything in,

264
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,889
so you must have been frustrated.

265
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
If I knew I'd be so clingy,

266
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,960
I should've held onto you back then.

267
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,030
I shouldn't have acted like I was cool.

268
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,040
I was narrow-minded.

269
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,970
I was a fool.

270
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,070
Mr. On.

271
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,250
I can't end it with Woo-yeon.

272
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,280
I don't think I can do it.

273
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,860
Hurry.

274
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,720
Put him down.

275
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,390
- Honey.
- My gosh.

276
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,030
- Oh no.
- Gosh.

277
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,130
- Honey.
- Shift his head over.

278
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,240
- Okay.
- Is that good enough?

279
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,140
Goodness.

280
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,440
Woo-yeon.

281
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,580
I can't end it.

282
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,080
I can't end it.

283
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,820
(Woo-yeon...)

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,390
(Woo-yeon!)

285
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,500
Make room.

286
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,260
- Make room.
- Hurry.

287
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,630
- Gosh. Move him.
- Goodness

288
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,830
Careful.

289
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,010
Are you okay? Honey.

290
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,180
You... Darn it.

291
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
- Honey.
- Careful.

292
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,450
Seriously. You...

293
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,650
"I can't end it."

294
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,680
"Woo-yeon..."

295
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
Goodness. Bring them both out.

296
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,320
Okay.

297
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,160
What's your problem?

298
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,770
Why were you holding my hand?

299
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,730
Hey, punk.

300
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,340
You're the one who held my hand.

301
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,640
This is Woo-yeon's blanket.

302
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,540
This is Woo-yeon's bed.

303
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,710
Darn you.

304
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,560
So? Have you slept enough?

305
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,600
Come out.

306
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,830
Come eat.

307
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,700
Okay.

308
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
Eat up.

309
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,080
Thank you.

310
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,010
Please eat.

311
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,020
Does it taste okay?

312
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,850
- Yes.
- Yes, it's delicious.

313
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,420
I'm glad.

314
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,290
How are you both so good looking?

315
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,200
His face is so chiseled.

316
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,000
You're beautiful too.

317
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,000
That was way back when.

318
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,940
You're so sweet.

319
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Here.

320
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,080
My apologies for disturbing you
last night.

321
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,910
I didn't even introduce myself properly
because of the state I was in.

322
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,980
I'm On Joon-soo,

323
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,380
the CEO of Eunyu Publishing,
which published Woo-yeon's book.

324
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,450
My gosh. You're a CEO.

325
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,760
No wonder. You just exude dignity.

326
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,660
Mom. Let's just eat quietly.

327
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,590
You eat quietly.

328
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,500
What about you?

329
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,930
I'm a photographer. I take pictures.

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,830
A photographer.

331
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,100
Then what do your parents do?

332
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
Mom.

333
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,510
My father is a lawyer,
formerly a head prosecutor.

334
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,810
My mother is an artist.

335
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,380
A man of law and an artist.

336
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,680
That's so impressive.

337
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,180
Have some more eggs.

338
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,350
My father runs a company.

339
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,350
What kind?

340
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,820
It's called Tomorrow And...

341
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,160
They print textbooks and study guides.

342
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,000
What? Isn't that the largest
study guide company in the country?

343
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,100
Really?

344
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,270
Probably.

345
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,540
Okay, let's stop talking
about things like that and...

346
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,070
Here.

347
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,710
You are the CEO of the publishing company.

348
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,680
How do you know Woo-yeon?

349
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,110
We went to high school together.

350
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,810
We worked on the book together too.

351
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,420
- So you're friends.
- Yes.

352
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,120
Then you must know the jerk
who rejected Woo-yeon.

353
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,230
Mom, why are you bringing that up now?

354
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,370
Because my blood boils
whenever I think of him.

355
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,700
Please tell me if you know where he lives.

356
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,270
I want to go and break both of his legs.

357
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,370
That jerk.

358
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,910
I'm not sure.

359
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,910
I think she means you, Mr. Lee.

360
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,010
What?

361
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Sorry. It slipped out.

362
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,800
Dad.

363
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,670
Why are you rolling up your sleeves?

364
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,310
Was it you

365
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,340
who made my daughter cry?

366
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,050
Sir, please calm down.

367
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,850
Honey.

368
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,050
Dad.

369
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,150
Get out of my house!

370
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,070
We got kicked out because of you.

371
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,500
Get your story straight.
We got kicked out because of you.

372
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,610
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't said anything.

373
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,180
This wouldn't have happened
if you had not been a jerk from the start.

374
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Enough already.

375
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,350
Stop it, both of you.

376
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,080
You always stop us when it's my turn.

377
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,950
You each took a turn.

378
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,150
You used up your turn.

379
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,190
Why are you being like this too, Mr. On?

380
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,860
You were an adult.

381
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,990
You were always mature and nice.

382
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,530
How could you act just like him?

383
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,160
Hey. What did I do?

384
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,460
Shut it, immature brat.

385
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,740
I didn't say anything yesterday
because you were both wasted

386
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,540
but don't let this happen again.

387
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,050
I'll put you in an ambulance or a cop car.

388
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,320
- Woo-yeon.
- Woo-yeon.

389
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,030
This exhibit is for your friends?

390
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Yes.

391
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,800
My best friend is a calligrapher.

392
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,100
The photographer is a punk
that I hate the most.

393
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,300
It's like a real-life love and war.

394
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,110
Hey.

395
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Hey.

396
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,350
Why did you tag alone?

397
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,420
I was hungry.

398
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,500
He's just a guy friend.
Don't worry about him.

399
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,730
Guy friend.

400
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,030
Okay.

401
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,780
No, babe. I don't have
any romantic feelings for her.

402
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,050
It's just business.

403
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,850
That's right. She's a rich fool.

404
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,460
Look how she buys me things all the time.

405
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,290
Of course. You're the only one for me,
babe.

406
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,600
(My baby)

407
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,630
(Hello? Babe.)

408
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:47,730
(My baby)

409
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,270
(My baby)

410
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,310
Look at this jerk.

411
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,980
Are you her dad or her boyfriend?

412
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,410
That's not it, sir.

413
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,250
You seem to be mistaken. Let me explain...

414
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,480
Why you...

415
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,490
Where did she pick up
a piece of trash like you?

416
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,290
Hey, you.

417
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,390
Yes?

418
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,660
Talk to Jin-ju
and make sure she doesn't get hurt.

419
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,470
- Tell her the truth?
- No. Want me to kill you?

420
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
"Things are tough right now."

421
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,850
"You're too good for me."

422
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,920
"Sorry, I'm not a better guy."

423
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,520
Make something up
and let her down gently, you jerk.

424
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,820
Your brain worked well when you
conned her. Why won't it work now?

425
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,430
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

426
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,130
Darn it.

427
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,290
My friend left. Something urgent came up.

428
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,560
I see.

429
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,530
Should we go to a cafe?

430
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,130
Jin-ju, I have something to say to you.

431
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
You do?

432
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,840
- He wants to stop seeing me.
- Why?

433
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,440
Things are too difficult for him.

434
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,310
He thinks I'm too good

435
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,880
for him.

436
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,680
He says he's sorry

437
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,150
he's not someone better.

438
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,390
- He's a jerk.
- A total jerk.

439
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,660
Is he trying to create
a beautiful breakup?

440
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,360
He doesn't want to become the antagonist.

441
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,530
Jerk.

442
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Why?

443
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,900
Why are you swearing at him?

444
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,870
What did he do so wrong
for you to swear at him?

445
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,340
Are you crazy?

446
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,310
Let her be. Don't touch someone crazy.

447
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Okay.

448
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,580
Just drink from the bottle.
It's cumbersome to pour.

449
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,220
Okay.

450
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,560
What is this?
It feels so familiar yet ominous.

451
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,160
Are you sleeping?

452
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,430
I'm sorry about everything.

453
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,970
(The person you have reached
is not available.)

454
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,170
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

455
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,570
Please pick up the phone.

456
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,580
Just once.

457
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,110
I'll try to become

458
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,080
less perfect.

459
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,420
I'll become someone who lacks for you.

460
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,420
I think she lacks a lot already.

461
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,360
How does it feel to look at her
like that with a clear head?

462
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,500
Was I like that too?

463
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,070
You were worse.

464
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,140
(The message has been recorded.
Thank you.)

465
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,580
He's no help to my life.

466
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,780
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

467
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,090
One iced americano.

468
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,730
That's 4,100 won.

469
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,230
I want the coupon too. How many
do I have to drink to get a free one?

470
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,630
Ten, sir.

471
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,060
I'll come until I fill up the coupon.

472
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,240
I'll just buy you one, so don't come here
by making the coupon an excuse.

473
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,580
Okay. I'll come tomorrow
for my free coffee too.

474
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,450
Why are you doing this again?
You were quiet for a month.

475
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,890
You didn't call me when I stayed quiet.

476
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,990
There must be a reason why
I don't call you.

477
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,360
Why did you like me?

478
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,700
- Are you arguing with me?
- It's a question. Tell me.

479
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,070
I'll try to show off those charms.

480
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,540
Don't.

481
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,910
Why do you always tell me no?

482
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,980
Is there anything I can do
in front of you?

483
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,140
Yes.

484
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Leave.

485
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,060
Speak to our marketing team leader
for the drama's product placement.

486
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,890
I will.

487
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,260
What is this?

488
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,870
A calligraphy photo book
we recently published.

489
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,940
(We May Be Displaced, but We Still Live On)
Can I meet this calligrapher?

490
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,970
Why?

491
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,210
We need to work on the title
of our new drama.

492
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,080
I was looking into calligraphers.

493
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,710
It would be nice to have this person
work on our title.

494
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,650
- I'll get going.
- Okay, bye.

495
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,770
A good friend of mine is the CEO
of a drama production company.

496
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,740
He happened to see your calligraphy

497
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,880
and wants to ask you to work on
the drama's title.

498
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,080
- Could this...
- It was definitely not

499
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,220
a favor I asked for.

500
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,590
Can you read minds?

501
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,490
I wish I could

502
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,420
so I could read your mind.

503
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,030
I hope another coincidental excuse
will come up again.

504
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,170
What is he talking about?

505
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,670
I hope this excuse

506
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,440
will be the last.

507
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,450
I was just told about our breakup,

508
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,180
and it made me feel wronged,
hateful, and angry.

509
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,480
But in the end,

510
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,390
I still missed you.

511
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,360
I thought about clinging onto you
for a month,

512
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,430
and I also thought about abusing
your apologetic feelings

513
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,700
to make you stay beside me.

514
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,730
I had so many different thoughts,

515
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,970
but I didn't want to torture you.

516
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,670
This was the only way.

517
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,340
So

518
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,910
let me do this at least.

519
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,850
I know you'll decline my offer
to drive you home,

520
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,850
so I'll get going for now.

521
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,420
I'll see you next time.

522
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,570
Why did he come?

523
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,170
Couldn't you hear with those
beautiful cochleae of yours?

524
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,700
How could I hear from over there?

525
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,510
What excuse does he have this time?

526
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,610
Why are you so nosy
about someone else's business?

527
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,240
We're not strangers.

528
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,710
You're not my lover.

529
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,980
I'm chasing you around
so I could become yours.

530
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,150
What have you been doing for ten years?

531
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,920
What were you doing when I liked you?
You're too late.

532
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,630
I regret realizing my feelings too late.

533
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,130
I probably liked you back then too.

534
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,200
Don't manipulate your memories.

535
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,370
I mean it.

536
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,470
The beginning and the time
I became aware was just different.

537
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,310
If I made forks for those ten years,
I'd be a master artisan.

538
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,990
But for those ten years,
all I did was have a crush.

539
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,920
What I'm left with are just wounds.

540
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,180
I'm home.

541
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,580
Mom, are you home?

542
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,520
Mom.

543
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,560
Mom. Mom. Mom!

544
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,930
Mom. Mom. Wake up, Mom.

545
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,330
Mom. Mom.

546
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,650
We're at the hospital.

547
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,249
You fainted in the washroom.

548
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,700
I'll call the nurse.

549
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:26,340
(Kim Chul-soo's guardian,
please come to the front desk.)

550
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,350
(She has stage three stomach cancer.)

551
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,560
She knows her condition well,

552
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,590
and she declined to get a surgery.

553
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,200
The pain must have been severe.
Didn't you know?

554
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
No, I didn't know.

555
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,940
She needs to receive an operation
or chemotherapy.

556
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,640
She'll survive the operation, right?

557
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,240
Usually, the survival rate is calculated

558
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,180
by the number of relapses
within five years.

559
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,080
It's between 25 and 60 percent.

560
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,950
It's 40 to 75 percent.

561
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,590
Her chances of dying are higher
than her survival rate.

562
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,520
I'm afraid I can't deny that.

563
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,080
Why does the checkup fee cost so much?

564
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,420
People who are poor

565
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,120
won't even know what they're dying from.

566
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,890
How can you talk about money at this time?

567
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,790
Being poor is a crime.

568
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,990
When you're ill, the first thing
that comes to mind is money.

569
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,430
You'd be lucky if you have
an insurance plan.

570
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,230
Think of your dad.

571
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,970
He got sick right after
he canceled his insurance.

572
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,770
It was so difficult for us.

573
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,470
What do your children mean to you?

574
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,350
You thought about money,

575
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,380
then the insurance. Didn't you
think about us even after that?

576
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,020
Of course, I thought of you.
You're my daughter.

577
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,860
Then why didn't you tell me?

578
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,160
Why aren't you getting the surgery?

579
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,730
It'd only upset you guys if I told you.

580
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,570
Also, I'd be bedridden for years
if I get an operation.

581
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,170
Do you think I'd be happy about that?

582
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,210
It's worse having a sick person
in a poor family

583
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,940
than having them die. I know that well.

584
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,520
That's why I told you to make sure
you eat properly.

585
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,490
I told you to stop drinking
and to stop eating expired foods!

586
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,860
Why didn't you listen to me?

587
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,590
Why don't you ever listen to me?

588
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,200
You didn't listen to me either.

589
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,170
Gosh.

590
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,840
You weren't a good daughter.

591
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,590
Mom, I'm sorry.

592
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,760
Mom, please don't die.

593
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,800
Mom, don't turn me into an orphan.

594
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,940
Mom. Mom, I'm sorry.

595
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,180
Mom, I'm really sorry.

596
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,550
I'm sorry.

597
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,090
Mom.

598
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,230
Mom, please don't die.

599
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,840
Mom, don't die.

600
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,740
("A Midsummer Night's Dream")

601
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,340
I brought the script of four episodes
as well as the synopsis.

602
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,880
I'm sorry for bothering you.

603
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,050
I thought it'd be important to understand
the mood and the story of the drama.

604
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,420
No. I think it'll lead to a good result,
so I'm looking forward to it.

605
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,630
I hope this isn't bad manners,

606
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,160
but could I ask you why
you chose to use me?

607
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,130
I just liked your work.

608
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,100
Isn't this the case with everything?

609
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,600
When you start to like something,
you don't really know the reason.

610
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,310
Do you have any plans this Saturday?

611
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,040
No, I don't.

612
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,750
Let's have a meal.

613
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,010
Okay, I'd like that.

614
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,890
(This stop is...)

615
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,270
Ready, go.

616
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,710
♪Happy birthday to you♪

617
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,110

620
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,890
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

621
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,200
Hey! Get down!

622
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,300
No, no. I'll listen to you.

623
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,500
Put the gun down. Put it down.

624
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,900
Okay, okay.

625
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,170
I'll give you some treasure.

626
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,980
Hey, where's the gun?

627
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,450
Get down.

628
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,350
Give that to me.

629
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,750
Put the gun down.

630
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,350
See?

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,560
("A Midsummer Night's Dream")

632
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,040
(I was flustered earlier.)

633
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,210
I said I'd wait for you,

634
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,380
so showing up like this
as if nothing happened

635
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,310
would torture you again.

636
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,180
Woo-yeon.

637
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,680
Can you please like me again?

638
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,280
I regret

639
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,520
realizing my feelings too late.

640
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,690
I mean it.

641
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,890
The beginning and the time
I became aware was just different.

642
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,630
But for those ten years,
all I did was have a crush.

643
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,930
What I'm left with are just wounds.

644

(This is Kim Han-soo from HS Pictures.)

645
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,240
(I'll see you on Saturday at 6 p.m.)

646
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,010
(I'm attaching the map of the location.)

647
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,350
(Okay.)

648
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,060
It's past midnight,
so it's not my birthday anymore.

649
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,590
You don't have to worry about
how I feel now.

650

Young-hee.

651
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,500
Look at me.

652
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,440
Come on.

653
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,550
I was right. Something happened to you.

654
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Something always happens.

655
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,490
I'm used to it now,

656
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,460
but this one's too much.

657
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,270
Mom...

658
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,670
is sick.

659
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,480
She has cancer.

660
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Stomach cancer.

661
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,860
It's okay.

662
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,730
It's okay, Young-hee.

663
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,570
Is it really okay?

664
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,440
Of course.

665
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,040
Everything's okay.

666
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,180
I'm talking about you.

667
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,980
I'm poor.

668
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,750
My dad died early.

669
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,660
I have a little brother I have to support,

670
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,390
and now I even have a sick mom.

671
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,630
Are you

672
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,200
okay with someone like me?

673
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,700
Can you

674
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,910
understand someone like me?

675
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,650
Yes.

676
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,410
It's fine.

677
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,020
I can understand.

678
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,560
(His rash answer is probably
a misunderstanding or arrogance,)

679
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,590
(but I don't want to clear
that misunderstanding.)

680
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,430
(I just wanted to leave Hyun-jae)

681
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,530
(to continue)

682
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,670
(misunderstanding for a long time.)

683
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,270
Yes, Dad.

684
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
(Are you coming later?)

685
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,670
Is that a question? Do I have a choice?

686
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,840
(Don't be late.)

687
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,880
(Don't come empty-handed.)

688
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,520
I thought you said you'll be good to me.

689
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,200
(The person you have reached...)

690
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,070
Are you serious?

691
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,470
Enough is enough.

692
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,410
You're too good
to cling to a guy like him.

693
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,010
What do you know?

694
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,210
Something's strange.
He won't pick up my calls,

695
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,650
and he quit his job at the cafe.

696
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,520
I bet something happened to him.

697
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,290
If you're so worried,

698
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,520
you should visit his house
and publish an ad in the newspaper.

699
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,990
Just forget about him.

700
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,430
Half of the world is full of men,
so if you search enough,

701
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,560
- I found it.
- a good man...

702
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,400
Already?

703
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,000
Where are you going?

704
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,270
To his house.

705
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,700
Do you know his address?

706
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,970
I sent a package to his house before.

707
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,870
Gosh, what did you send?

708
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,840
(Sneakers and runners)

709
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,970
Is this the model?

710
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,650
Enter the address.

711
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,880
I feel too bad.

712
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,950
Okay, then...

713
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,120
Still, if you insist.

714
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,600
(What?)

715
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,800
I'm so annoyed!

716
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,140
Oh no.

717
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,750
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

718
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,350
Should I get on my knees?

719
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,060
What about your restaurant?

720
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,900
Why did you tag along? I told you not to.

721
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,000
Why did you come here? I told you not to.

722
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,200
What's your problem?

723
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,870
Don't go.

724
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,880
Don't see that guy.

725
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,980
I don't want you seeing him.

726
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,060
Do you want a rag-slap
on your right cheek too?

727
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,310
I guess my face is the problem,
not the circumstances.

728
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,520
The reservation is under Kim Han-soo.

729
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,020
It's the table by the window.

730
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,450
Thank you.

731
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,190
Woo-yeon?

732
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,730
What... What are you doing here?

733
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,530
I'm here for my mom's birthday. You?

734
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,430
I have dinner plans too.

735
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,140
Do you want to say hi?

736
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,840
- No, I'm...
- Come on.

737
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,120
These are my parents.

738
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,290
Hello, I'm Kyung Woo-yeon.

739
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,020
It's nice to meet you.

740
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,660
It's nice to meet you.

741
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,690
Who...

742
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,630
- I'm a friend...
- She's the girl I like.

743
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,380
Did you come together?

744
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,680
No.

745
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,550
I have plans here and ran into him
by coincidence.

746
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,080
I see. Then you should go.

747
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,520
Sorry for keeping you.

748
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,620
I'll go then.

749
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,820
Happy birthday.

750
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,020
Thank you.

751
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,910
You said she rejected you.
Are you going out?

752
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,340
We will soon.

753
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,620
I have a feeling
that's only what you think.

754
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:48,530
Why are you...

755
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,830
I asked my friend
because I wanted to eat with you.

756
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,370
Was that too underhanded?

757
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,560
You two meet by coincidences so often.

758
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,330
Mostly created by you.

759
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,300
You're right, it's my fault.

760
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,170
I'm going to go.

761
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,940
I think they noticed me.

762
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,010
It would make me look pathetic
if you just leave.

763
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,550
I don't want to make you look pathetic
in any way.

764
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,520
That's about manners.

765
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,690
I get to benefit from him today.

766
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,590
What would you like?

767
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,200
- Let's just go.
- Why do you keep doing this?

768
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,410
- Let's just go.
- Wait in the car.

769
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,580
- Please listen to me. Let's go.
- Just go!

770
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,290
Jin-ju.

771
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,120
You wouldn't answer my calls.

772
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,030
Who is she?

773
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,260
The thing is...

774
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,960
Hey. Who is that woman?

775
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,630
Well...

776
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,340
Why are you stuttering, you punk?

777
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,410
I get it. Is that the rich fool?

778
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,140
Why did she come
all the way to your house?

779
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,810
You said it was just business.

780
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,950
You said you were seeing her because
she bought you everything you wanted.

781
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,550
You said it was over.

782
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,850
Yes, it's over. You know.

783
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,250
- You're the only one for me.
- Listen to that.

784
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,760
Why that little...

785
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,230
A rich fool? Business?

786
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:08,700
Is your business conning money
from women, you gold digger?

787
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,440
- Did you just hit me?
- That's right! What about it?

788
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,510
Do you want to report me? Go ahead.

789
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,710
This must be why I was born
into a wealthy family.

790
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,350
You. Get over here.

791
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,280
Hey! No!

792
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,820
You said it's attempted murder
just by lifting it up.

793
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,120
Oh my gosh.

794
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,360
I guess.

795
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,260
You witch! Who do you think you are?

796
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,300
Hey. Are you okay?

797
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,100
- Unbelievable.
- Give me your hand. Are you hurt?

798
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,100
Hey, you.
You're the moron for being fooled.

799
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,900
- I didn't ask you to buy...
- You scumbag.

800
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,410
A man should be ashamed
to swindle a woman.

801
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,380
How dare you act all arrogant?

802
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,380
Do you think this is acceptable?

803
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,780
I'm going to report you to the cops.

804
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,250
- I'll report you both!
- Go right ahead.

805
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,050
I love prison food.

806
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,030
You'd better report me. I'll be waiting.

807
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,570
Do you even go to Seoul University?

808
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,080
Tell me the truth.
It'll take less than an hour to check.

809
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,540
No.

810
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,780
Okay.

811
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,150
Don't tell me you're crying.

812
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,670
Is he making you uncomfortable?

813
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:53,840
Yes.

814
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,310
A love that can shake the foundation
of a person's life

815
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,080
doesn't come often,
and it doesn't come to everyone.

816
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,580
I acknowledge that he is special.

817
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,650
But if it didn't happen for ten years,
it wasn't meant to be.

818
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,420
If you don't go to him, you'll long to,
but you'll get hurt if you do.

819
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,690
He is not a good person for you.

820
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,100
You can like someone else.

821
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,470
If you can't have a good relationship
with anyone because of him,

822
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,040
just stay with me.

823
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,710
It's not like you dislike me.

824
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,880
That

825
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,510
isn't love.

826
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,880
This is a type of love.

827
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,190
I'll give you anything you want

828
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,590
even before you want it.

829
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,560
I'm fine being someone
you're thankful for.

830
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,260
There are couples like that.

831
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,000
It's like a transaction.

832
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,510
A mutual exchange.

833
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,710
Right?

834
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,850
That's the principle of dating
and marriage.

835
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,680
But you know,

836
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,960
I'm still too naive
to enter into a relationship like that.

837
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,590
I'm still bold in certain things

838
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,400
and passionate about certain things.

839
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,470
That's how I am.

840
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,970
That's why I won't do

841
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,210
something like that.

842
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,080
Stop crying already.

843
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,820
You said you'd go out with Kang Dong-won
or Lee Min-ho.

844
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,260
You went to Seoul University
and became a prosecutor.

845
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,860
You should meet someone at par with you.

846
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,930
Why are you sobbing over
someone like that?

847
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,100
I'm crying because I feel humiliated.

848
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,670
You went to Seoul University
and became a prosecutor,

849
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,640
but I got played by that punk.
I'm crying because I feel humiliated!

850
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:11,810
Why did you go out with him?

851
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,780
What choice did I have?
Where's no one out there.

852
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,040
- You can go out with me.
- I'm out with you right now!

853
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,610
Not like that! As a guy!

854
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,980
Why would I go out with you?

855
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,680
Because I like you!

856
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,880
You should go in.

857
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,550
Yes, I should.

858
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,830
This is my car.

859
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,870
That's right.

860
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,940
Okay, then. I'll go now.

861
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,110
Okay, bye.

862
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,440
Bye.

863
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,130
What's his deal?

864
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,270
Darn it. How humiliating.

865
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:57,410
What a shame. Soo seems to like her a lot.

866
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,480
When you like someone too much,

867
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,420
it may be better to look from afar.

868
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,550
You must have a woman
whom you're just looking at.

869
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,620
I think so.

870
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,530
There is someone I have regrets about.

871
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
What are you doing now?

872
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,200
- I have plans.
- With Dr. Kim?

873
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,600
I'm not seeing him.

874
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,470
Is he busy today?

875
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,770
I'm not seeing him today or tomorrow.

876
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,180
Or in the future.

877
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,680
Why not?

878
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,710
I can't get myself to like him.

879
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,720
You're too into romance.
That's your problem.

880
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,220
If our hearts race at this age
like when we were kids,

881
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,920
we'll develop heart disease and die.

882
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,260
Your heart needs to age concurrently
with the body.

883
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:49,200
I question how you were a judge.

884
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,270
Did I do something wrong?

885
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,070
Forget it. Just drive.

886
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,320
I want to drive you home,

887
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,250
but you'll refuse, right?

888
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,290
I don't think I should.

889
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,590
Good night.

890
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
What is it?

891
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,140
Earlier...

892
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:12,850
It wasn't a date.

893
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,420
Do you like me?

894
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,520
No.

895
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,720
Then

896
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,290
- are you playing me?
- What?

897
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,660
One minute after I introduce you
to my parents as the girl I like,

898
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,660
you made me watch you on a date
with another guy. That was hard enough.

899
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,260
But then you show up at my door

900
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,800
to explain it wasn't a date
all the while saying you don't like me.

901
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,770
How am I supposed to interpret that?

902
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,000
It wasn't...

903
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,410
It wasn't a date.

904
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,710
I came here in case you were mistaken
and thought it was.

905
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,810
Mistaken.

906
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,780
About what am I mistaken?

907
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,320
No matter how hard I try
to understand you,

908
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,690
there's only one conclusion.

909
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,320
Woo-yeon

910
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,460
has no respect for me.

911
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,660
What?

912
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:02,360
It looks like you still don't believe me,

913
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,470
but I really like you.

914
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:07,400
So don't trample on my feelings.

915
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,970
You're being abusive.

916
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,940
You're the one abusing me.

917
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:14,140
You said you'd wait, so wait quietly.

918
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,580
Don't do anything. Just wait.

919
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,110
Don't act like a home shopping host

920
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,980
saying it'll sell out soon.

921
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,450
- What?
- That's what you're doing.

922
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,190
"Either buy it or don't."

923
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,520
"It's your loss if you don't."

924
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:30,320
You're taking a step back and watching
with your arms crossed.

925
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,860
Then what? Should I beg for your love?

926
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,290
Why are you asking me?

927
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,900
Are you trying to get full price
for your unrequited love?

928
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,400
I'm the imbecile for coming here.

929
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,870
You chucked your affection at me,

930
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,110
I let it shake me.

931
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,350
But I just snapped right out of it.

932
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,850
I've regained my balance.

933
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,590
Why are you here?

934
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,330
In case you'd look like this.

935
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,930
You ran off in a rush
and looked like you'd go to him.

936
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,460
And whenever you go to him,

937
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,630
this is how you look afterward.

938
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,870
Why does someone I'm so desperate for

939
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,610
always look like that
whenever she sees him?

940
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,020
(It's risky to assume
you know someone else)

941
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,030
(when you often misunderstand yourself.)

942
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:13,430
(That's why you must ask.)

943
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,800
(You must hear it directly from them.)

944
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,300
Woo-yeon.

945
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,910
Do it. Explain, make excuses, anything.

946
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,580
I'll believe anything you say,
even if it's a lie.

947
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,750
(I'm sorry for rejecting you all those times.)

948
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,320
(This time, I'll be the one to ask you.)
(It was a dream.)

949
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,260
(A dream that I couldn't avoid.)

950
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,790
(I'm sorry for rejecting you
all those times.)

951
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,290
(This time, I'll be the one to ask you.)
