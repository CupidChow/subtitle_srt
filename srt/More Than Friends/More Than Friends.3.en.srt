1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,110
I said I wanted
to keep being friends with you.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,920
I said I wanted to keep seeing you.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,550
I just took it three years ago,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,820
so you just take it from now on.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,520
You still think only about yourself.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,760
Jerks always only think about themselves.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,690
You told me

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,900
to take care of myself before others.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,230
I'm going to put an end to the curse,
you, and everything,

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,770
before I leave.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,500
How will you end it?

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,810
The curse, me, everything.

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,070
The curse...

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,240
is broken now.

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,720
(Ma'am?)

16
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,790
Ma'am?

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,090
Would you put your seat back up?

18
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,040
It's different.

19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,780
=Episode 3: After the Curse Is Broken=

20
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,880
Woo-yeon?

21
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,320
I've missed you.

22
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,720
You won't be here tomorrow.

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,090
Is this your apology?

24
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,660
It's just apple juice.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,270
It's okay to get lost

26
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,400
since it'll show you the way.

27
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,340
I've lost my mind.

28
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,150
Oh, that's hot.

29
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,310
(Woo-yeon. Want to grab a beer?)

30
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,740
(Jin-ju)
(Woo-yeon. Want to grab a beer?)

31
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,979
(Jin-ju)

32
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,050
(Sure. Will call after dinner.)

33
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,690
What was I expecting?

34
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,590
What? Why was he there?

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,160
The owner of the guesthouse
that Sang-hyeok recommended

36
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,760
is Soo's dad's friend.

37
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,700
He found out about it through Soo.

38
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,870
So? You were down.

39
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,900
That's why you made 45 of these candles?

40
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,140
I wasn't down.

41
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,000
I just made them. No reason.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Why are you down?

43
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,810
Is your heart restless again?

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,140
You idiot, pushover, sea cucumber.

45
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm not restless.

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,720
Did you sleep with him?

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,820
Gosh. Come on, Young-hee.

48
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,790
You spent so many nights with him.

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,030
How many suns did you see there?

50
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,130
-  There is only one sun.
-  Anyway.

51
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,960
How is it possible
you two didn't do anything?

52
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,300
Jeju Island is a romantic island.

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,940
What is it? Why are you blushing?

54
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,470
What did you do to make you blush?

55
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,710
I didn't do anything.

56
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,450
Right.

57
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,790
I undid the curse.

58
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,290
How did you undo it?

59
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,660
I told him we should never
see each other again.

60
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,790
I guess we wouldn't have
any chances to meet anyway.

61
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,460
If you could've broken the curse
with your volition,

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,370
would it have taken ten years?

63
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,700
Regardless, the curse was broken.

64
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,370
I'm confused.

65
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,680
Doesn't the witch have to die
for the curse to be broken?

66
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,330
(Whose earring is this?)

67
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,580
What is it at this hour?

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,610
Soo, your mom...

69
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,060
(Every space holds onto memories.)

70
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,030
(To me, Seoul)

71
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,870
(is a place of nightmares.)

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040
Fine! Let's get a divorce!

73
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,080
Your mom and I decided to be friends.

74
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,580
You're still friends after the divorce.

75
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,880
Don't other people's eyes bother you?

76
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,450
(It was a strange country.)

77
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,690
You're wind. You go all over the place.

78
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,830
Then make me a flowery wind.
Something pretty.

79
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,500
Come to think of it, it's mean.

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,870
Why does it come
and knock down all the flower petals?

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sure it didn't come
to knock them down.

82
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,740
It probably came
to look at the flowers too.

83
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,840
(I could go anywhere...)

84
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,809
Come again. It's fun with you here.

85
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,620
I guess I won't be here
even if you come back.

86
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,350
Won't you come to Seoul?

87
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,550
No, I won't go.

88
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,990
I see.

89
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,230
(But this was a city
I never wanted to stay in.)

90
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,170
I thought she was almost dead.

91
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,270
You even made Uncle say that.

92
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,610
We really thought she might die.

93
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,240
She just sprained her back.

94
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,510
Don't you know how important
one's back is?

95
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,750
With everything, if the core breaks...

96
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,390
Mom missed you a lot.

97
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,030
But you two weren't around
when I missed you.

98
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,690
Soo.

99
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,330
I'm leaving. I'm tired.

100
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,160
I'll drive you.

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,740
Don't act so caring all of a sudden.

102
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,270
It's awkward.

103
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,150
I guess we did do him wrong.

104
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,590
Hey, can I borrow your stapler?

105
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,720
Sure.

106
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,230
Did you buy all of that to eat?

107
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,160
I got them for
when my blood sugar level drops.

108
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,030
If you keep eating these,
your appearance level will drop.

109
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,640
You should keep in shape
in order to be loved.

110
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,510
You too.

111
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,610
You shouldn't be complacent
because you have a boyfriend.

112
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,780
You should still work hard.

113
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,750
Instead of getting comfortable
with your long-time boyfriend,

114
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,120
it's good manners to continue

115
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,280
keeping in shape the longer
you've been together.

116
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,290
- Right?
- Sure.

117
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,260
What is this?

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,390
I can't look at bad things all my life.

119
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,330
I need to look at some nice things
once in a while.

120
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,160
They don't look that great to me.

121
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,230
How are they any different from me?

122
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,970
They're a little different from you.

123
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,840
I like these people
even when they don't do anything,

124
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,210
whereas I wish you wouldn't do anything.

125
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,350
I never realized just how witty you are.

126
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,050
Thank you for the compliment.

127
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,340
I've been curious for a while.

128
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,410
Were you born rich?

129
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,420
The only break life ever gave me

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,520
was the break in my arm
during middle school.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,750
I see.

132
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,750
Then how are you always so confident?

133
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,890
I'd be careful if I had a lot to lose,

134
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,930
but all I have is this body and my pride.

135
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,460
Those two are all I have.

136
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,970
I should protect the two I have at least.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,840
And it's not like they pay me
enough to take away my pride.

138
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,910
You shouldn't lower yourself either.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,580
If you do, you'll have to bow your head
and go on your knees.

140
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,520
In the end, you'll end up like this.

141
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,260
She's so cool.

142
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,460
Yes, Mother.

143
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,600
Oh, right. Father's birthday?

144
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
At home?

145
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,380
(It'll be just our family
having a small dinner for his birthday,)

146
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,050
(so don't buy anything.
Just come as you are.)

147
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,120
Okay. What time should I be there?

148
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,480
1 p.m.?

149
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,950
Didn't you just say it's dinner?

150
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,660
Yes, of course.

151
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,090
We should prepare during the day
so that we can eat at dinnertime.

152
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,130
Okay, I got it. Okay.

153
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,470
She meant
I should come in comfortable clothes.

154
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,170
I need to wear work clothes.

155
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,420
(Uncle)

156
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,460
I don't need a traitor like you.

157
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,690
(Don't call me a traitor.)

158
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,630
I did it for you.

159
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,360
You must want me to get along
with my parents.

160
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,770
I just want you to be well.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,940
Then you shouldn't have pushed me
to come to Seoul.

162
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,370
Seoul is nice. It's pretty.

163
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,180
I don't like Seoul. It's boring.

164
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,640
You're not bored. You're lonely.

165
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,720

it'll grow out of control.

It's especially the case for hatred.

168
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,720
It feeds on memories and keeps on growing.

Are you in Jeju right now?

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Hi.

182
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,920
I left the television on at home.

183
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,390
Electricity is expensive,
and the tax can accumulate.

184
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,300
I'll get going.

185

Woo-yeon.

186
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,880
Why did you just leave? I said, "Hi."

187
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,750
Did you come to hear me say, "Hi"?

188
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,450
I don't want to hear it anymore.

189
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,490
Why are you ruining my day?

190
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,450
Why are you ignoring me?

191
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,220
You're the one who ignored me.

192
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,660
I told you
I never wanted to see you again.

193
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,890
By that, I also mean

194
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,300
we should act like strangers
even if we run into each other.

195
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,770
I never agreed to it.

196
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Also, I have something to ask you.

197
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,040
Why did you kiss me that day?

198
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Hey.

199
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,220
How can you talk about that
like it's nothing?

200
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,620
What do you want me to do, then?

201
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,350
Will you answer me if I ask you shyly?

202
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,750
I said, why did you kiss me?

203
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Is everything a joke to you?

204
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,730
It's all fun and games for you, isn't it?

205
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,640
It's not a joke, it's a question.

206
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,740
Sure.

207
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,310
I'll apologize

208
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
for that day.

209
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,640
- What?
- When other people kiss someone,

210
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,610
they ask whether they should apologize
or admit their feelings.

211
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,720
I won't even ask. I'll just apologize.

212
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm really sorry.

213
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,690
I deserve to die for the crime.

214
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,960
You don't deserve to die.
You committed sexual assault.

215
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
You committed sexual harassment.

216
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,070
Hey. How could you call that a crime?

217
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,000
You're the one who said it was a crime.

218
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,170
If you commit a crime,
you should be punished.

219
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,340
You can be punished
by continuing to see me.

220
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,740
I'll decline

221
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,010
your rejection.

222
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,610
Hey.

223

Jerk.

224
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:53,719
He really doesn't feel anything.

225
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,090
I heard you said no
to the blind date again.

226
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,390
Mom's really worried about you.

227
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,360
Blind dates are too uncomfortable.

228
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,930
Honey, why don't you introduce him
to one of your friends?

229
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,340
Should I?

230
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,870
I wonder what type of woman
Joon-soo will like.

231
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,370
What kind of woman was his first love?

232
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,010
- Don't you know, honey?
- What?

233
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,220
You two were friends since college.

234
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,550
I'm not sure.

235
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,820
I like meeting people naturally.

236

Don't tell me you're still waiting
for destiny.

- Hello. - Hello.

328
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,770
Please introduce yourself.

329
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,470
Hello, I'm Lee Yeon-kyung.

330
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,840
What's the message you wanted to relay
through your novel?

331
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,080
Jae-oh is an average guy in his 20s.

332
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm sure we all know a Jae-oh.

333
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,150
Or you may be Jae-oh yourself.

334
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,590
Jae-oh's life

335
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,230
is like walking through an endless tunnel.

336
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,360
When you're in your 20s,
your job and love are both difficult.

337
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,360
It's natural that you're not good at it.

338
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,430
They say the basics of Chinese
are the four tones.

339
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,570
There are

340
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,740
a total of four tones in Chinese.

341
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,340
Depending on the tone with which
you say the word

342
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,610
changes the meaning in Chinese.

343
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,810
Thus, you must learn the tones correctly.

344
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,410
Let's try with the first tone.

345
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,920
Okay.

346
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,920
- Ma.
- Ma.

347
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,950
- Ma.
- Ma.

348
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,160
That's all for today. Thank you.

349
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

350
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,400
Excuse me. Aren't we going to create
study groups?

351
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,710
We don't have study groups in Chinese.

352
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,510
(Late Night Snack Cart)

353
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,770
Here.

354
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,440
Are you two going to date forever?
Aren't you going to get married?

355
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,250
I want to,

356
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,250
but it's too expensive.

357
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,350
I barely paid off my student loans
last year.

358
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,890
Why? Your boyfriend is a teacher.

359
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,890
You get a regular paycheck.

360
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,720
You may not have money now,
but you can save slowly together.

361
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,330
We don't have money now,

362
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,390
and we'll slowly get more debt.

363
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,860
Will you help me?

364
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,170
I don't have money either.

365
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,340
See? She doesn't have money
even at her age.

366
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,080
Money is something you just never have.

367
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,610
If we never have money,
when will we get married?

368
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,380
When we get money.

369
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,150
(I know I'm not good enough,
but please give me a chance.)

370
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,290
(I know I can win you over.)

371
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,420
(Get away from my son.)

372
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,360
(That's how you can win me over.)

373
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,560
(I love Kyeong-min.)

374
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,460
At least check how much is in there.

375
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,170
How much money will it take for you
to leave me?

376
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,070
Maybe 500 million won?

377
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,910
That was quick.
You must think about it often.

378
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,150
It's not easy for an office worker
to save up 500 million won.

379
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,520
I'll be old by then.

380
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,620
I'll give you a billion won.

381
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,760
Marry me.

382
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,360
What?

383
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,700
So? When will I get the billion won?

384
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,940
When will I get the billion won?

385
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,980
Eat.

386
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,010
Why won't you answer me?

387
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,420
Tell me. When?

388
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,150
Your mother said,

389
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,860
"You're coming
on Father's birthday, right?"

390
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,590
Not "Can you come?"
But "You're coming, right?"

391
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,660
She sounded so sure. How could I say no?

392
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,560
Don't go if you don't want to.

393
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,700
Mom probably just called
because she misses you.

394
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,470
Don't feel pressured to go.
I won't do anything you don't want to do.

395
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,870
You said they only went out on birthdays.

396
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,080
But they always cook
ever since I started going.

397
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,210
What could that mean?

398
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,810
What?

399
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,410
"Look and learn."

400
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,380
"This is the family tradition
that you must keep going forward."

401
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,090
Is that what that means?

402
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,660
I set a bad example from the start.

403
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,560
I was too young.

404
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,030
I didn't know that once I went,

405
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,430
I'd have to stay on my feet nonstop.

406
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,870
You idiot.

407
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,940
- Young-hee.
- Yes?

408
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,110
Stop calling what's mine "stupid."

409
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,810
Apologize. Now.

410
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm sorry I'm not doing a good job
as the mediator.

411
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,250
I'll talk to my mom.

412
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,560
You just hide behind me, okay?

413
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,290
I'll take care of everything.

414
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,690
It's okay. Don't.

415
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,800
If her precious youngest son
says things like that,

416
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,700
she'll think I put you up to it for sure.

417
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,930
She will not. She's a lot more aware
of things like that...

418
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,170
Are you a mama's boy?

419
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,910
Why can't you answer me?

420
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,180
Are you really?

421
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,910
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

422
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,720
Thank you for your work today.

423
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,050
- Thank you.
- Wait here for a minute.

424
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Okay.

425
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,290
Sir.

426
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,860
Thank you for today.

427
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,960
I had a lot of fun.

428
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,100
Thank you for the opportunity.

429
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,340
Don't bow down.
You earned it with your skills.

430
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,940
We're all going out to eat.
Please join us.

431
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,210
No. I don't think I belong.

432
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,410
Yes, you do.

433
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,710
It's for the people who worked hard today.

434
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,520
(Tonight)

435
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,820
I could sell tteokbokki thanks to you.

436
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,590
If you went to a Chinese class,
you should've studied Chinese.

437
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,230
Why were you scanning the guys? Bad girl.

438
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:50,330
Shut it. I'm fluent in Chinese.

439
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,340
You can speak Chinese.

440
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,840
What's your deal?

441
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,870
I should've stayed in English class.

442
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,740
I didn't know there were no study groups
in Chinese.

443
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,380
Why would someone who got
a perfect score on TOEIC take classes?

444
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,950
Go on blind dates or something
if you want to meet a guy.

445
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,880
I want to meet him naturally.

446
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,080
I have a feeling

447
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,750
you'll naturally return to nature
while searching for something natural.

448
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,220
But I should stop, right?
I was going to anyway.

449
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm quick at reading the room.

450
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,360
Who's coming?

451
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,830
Young-hee has to work late
and Woo-yeon is busy.

452
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,900
I guess you didn't know. Soo's coming--

453
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,770
How long has it been?

454
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,670
Let me take a look at you.

455
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,740
You didn't age at all.
You look exactly the same.

456
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,580
No way. I got much better looking.

457
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,680
You're exactly as annoying.

458
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,820
Have a seat.
I'll make you a rolled omelet.

459
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,890
What are you doing here? Why are you here?

460
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,020
I had business to tend to.

461
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,660
What business could you have here?

462
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,490
Does Woo-yeon know you're in Seoul?

463
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,730
Yes. I ran into her yesterday.

464
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,000
Hey. Don't see Woo-yeon.

465
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,070
Don't even run into her.
Don't go anywhere near her.

466
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,640
I'm not a bomb.

467
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,810
Yes, you are. A nuclear bomb.
An evil to society.

468
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,870
It's not like I can hit a kid.

469
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,010
Whatever. Come at me. Let's fight.

470
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,010
Seriously. Hey, I want a beer.

471
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,120
Okay.

472
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,760
If everyone filled their glasses,
let's make a toast.

473
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,620
Cheers. Great work, everyone!

474
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,660
Great work, everyone!

475
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,400
Thank you.

476
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,070
Who are you?

477
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,910
I'm Kyung Woo-yeon. I'm a calligrapher.

478
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,310
I have ugly handwriting, so I envy people
with nice penmanship.

479
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,810
Actually, I transcribed
many of your novels.

480
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
Were you a writing major?

481
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,390
Yes. But I don't write anymore.

482
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,060
It's nice to meet you, Woo-yeon.

483
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,690
Thank you.

484
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,460
Let's drink.

485
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,190
- Gosh.
- Thank you for today.

486
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,860
- Sure.
- Thank you.

487
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,340
(Jin-ju)
(Hey, I heard you saw Soo yesterday.)

488
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,440
(He's laughing and having a blast)

489
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,580
(with Sang-hyeok at Tonight.)

490
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,050
My gosh. You must like to drink.

491
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,190
I really like you.

492
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,820
Excuse me, ma'am.

493
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,120
Close your mouth and open your wallet.

494
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,100
- Okay.
- Thank you.

495
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,330
Cheers.

496
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,840
- A ray of light!
- A ray of light!

497
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,840
- Would you like another?
- Let me.

498
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

499
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,880
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

500
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,910
Cheers.

501
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,120
There's no time to eat.

502
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,450
Okay.

503
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,890
Cheers.

504
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,730
You demonic publisher punks.

505
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,730
I heard you chased Mr. Han
all the way to Jeju Island,

506
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,770
brought a laptop, locked him up,
and made him write.

507
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,540
Come on. He was the one in the wrong.

508
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,840
You. Stop pecking at me, will you?

509
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,080
I'll write it in my own time.

510
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,680
Am I a tree? Are you a woodpecker?

511
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,690
Well... You're not a tree, but...

512
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,760
Actually, our CEO says

513
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,030
authors are the most human machines.

514
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,830
What? Machines?

515
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,470
Authors are people too.

516
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,100
He's twisting what Mr. Han said...

517
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,770
Hey, kid. You were wrong.

518
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,970
Why must you talk like that?

519
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,580
You inconsiderate CEO punk.

520
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,410
Beep.

521
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,910
This is a tree.

522
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,650
Beep.

523
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,220
This is a woodpecker.

524
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,490
Beep.

525
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,460
This is a baby demon!

526
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,730
- Ma'am.
- Beep.

527
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,170
This is a demon!

528
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,710
No. That's not how you do it.
Watch me. See the part?

529
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,360
- Beep!
- Beep?

530
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,240
This is a baby demon!

531
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,400
Here. Let me do it one more time.

532
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,550
Beep!

533
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Okay. I'll stop.

534
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,440
Okay, then.

535
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the laugh.

536
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,880
Thank you.

537
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,420
What for? I didn't do anything.

538
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,720
Thank you.

539
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,960
Thank you.

540
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,690
I didn't know Chinese class
didn't have study groups.

541
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,970
Do Chinese people not date
because there are so many of them?

542
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,360
Why don't they have study groups?

543
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,170
I can smell the alcohol
just from the picture.

544
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,310
I can see way too well
why the two of them are friends.

545
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,610
Hey.

546
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,590
You twerp. Get out of Seoul!

547
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,660
Why do you keep telling him to leave?

548
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,090
He only got here recently.

549
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,760
Because

550
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,460
he's evil.

551
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,000
Evil.

552
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,170
Goodness. She is plastered.
Completely plastered.

553
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
- I'm out.
- What? Already?

554
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,470
I should go. See you.

555
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,740
Bye! Get lost.

556
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,080
"I should go. See you."

557
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,990
He's so cool.

558
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,560
Ma'am. I'm not a woodpecker.

559
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,630
I'm a ray of light.

560
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,860
Cheers.

561
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,470
Darn it.

562
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,910
Where are you going?

563
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,970
To beat up a villain.

564
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,180
Peace.

565
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,250
I think you're drunk--

566
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,210
No, I'm not.

567
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,650
I'll come back alive.

568
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,620
- Wait.
- Drink with me.

569
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,790
Darn it.

570
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,290
Why is the floor rocking so much?

571
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,960
Stay still.

572
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,640
Hello? I can't...

573
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,210
(You're always like this.)

574
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,050
I can't talk right now.

575
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,090
- Sorry, but...
- You won't even like me.

576
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,090
So why did you click "Like"?

577
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,560
Do you have that little respect for me?

578
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,160
I said I don't want to see you again.

579
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,030
Do you care that little about how I feel?

580
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm 28 years old, darn you!

581
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,540
I prayed every day.

582
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,880
That it's okay if you don't like me,

583
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,080
but to please

584
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,290
take these feelings away.

585
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,530
- Hello...
(- I must)

586
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,600
(still miss you.)

587
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,940
Who's this?

588
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
(You big jerk!)

589
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,410
Why are you...

590
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,710
(Are you ignoring me now?)

591
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,350
You have the wrong number. Goodbye.

592
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,380
(Hey. You jerk.)

593
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
(I prayed every day.)

594
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,190
(That it's okay if you don't like me,)

595
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,660
(but to please make me stop liking you.)

596
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,400
(I can't sleep because I'm curious.)

597
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,000
(Why did you do that?)

598
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,640
(Then that night
when you walked me home...)

599
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,940
(You didn't hug me, but...)

600
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,540
(Why didn't you hug me?)

601
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,710
(Couldn't you hug me just once?)

602
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,560
Hello?

603
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,870
(Please like me just once.)

604
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,140
(Just a little.)

605
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,510
(Please like me just once.)

606
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,780
(CEO On Joon-soo)

607
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,810
(Please?)

608
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,420
(Is that so hard?)

609
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,670
Sure.

610
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,340
It's silly even if I say so myself.

611
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,640
I call this number
knowing he won't pick up,

612
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,110
and I argue with him by myself.
It's so silly.

613
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,730
Woo-yeon.

614
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,060
What?

615
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,240
Are you the devil?
You showed up because I spoke about you.

616
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,400
Are you a ghost?

617
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,140
Are you back to roam the earth?

618
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,280
Excuse me.

619
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,810
What's wrong with you?

620
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,080
Quiet. There's a pervert following you.

621
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,580
Excuse me.

622
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,090
Hush.

623
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,290
Run at the count of three.
One, two, three.

624
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,230
What was that?

625
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,720
Is it your liver's goal
to become foie gras?

626
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,220
How fat do you want to make your liver

627
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,920
that you drink so much alcohol
all the time?

628
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,720
It's none of your beeswax.

629
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,460
Don't glare at me.
I saved you from a pervert.

630
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,990
Who asked to be saved?

631
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,600
Why did you butt in?

632
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,170
Why did you save me?

633
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,400
Why did you make me see you?

634
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,500
Why are you lingering before me?

635
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,540
Is that my fault?

636
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,640
Of course, it is.

637
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,470
Who said to get drunk
and bring back a tail like that?

638
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,550
Whether I drink or have a tail,
it's none of your business.

639
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,820
Why do you care?

640
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,950
Seeing that makes me uncomfortable.

641
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,850
You always...

642
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,360
have a reason.

643
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,170
I can't even jump to conclusions.

644
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,700
Get up. You'll catch a cold.

645
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,470
You should leave.

646
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,740
I'm going to sit here like this
for a bit before I go.

647
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,150
Are you trying to go to the afterlife?

648
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,350
Did you decide to freeze to death?

649
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,350
Hey. You can't fall asleep.

650
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,390
Woo-yeon. Hey. Woo-yeon.

651
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,830
Did you mean you're going to go
to dreamland?

652
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,440
You're going
to regret this so much tomorrow.

653
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,650
Let's go.

654
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,930
Why are you so heavy?

655
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,110
(Are you the devil?)

656
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,840
You showed up because I spoke about you.

657
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,880
Are you a ghost?

658
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,810
Are you back to roam the earth?

659
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,360
Was that him?

660
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,900
I hate you.

661
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,540
Walk on your own if you're awake.

662
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,010
I can't.

663
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,340
Will you look at that?
You're so shameless.

664
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,080
I hate you.

665
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,120
How can you say that to someone
who's carrying you home?

666
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,850
Still...

667
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,290
I hate you.

668
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,430
Why do I even bother
talking to a drunk person?

669
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,130
Do whatever you want.

670
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,560
(Who is it?)

671
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,160
There's some woman
that passed out in front of your door.

672
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,490
(What?)

673
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,230
You're dead meat.

674
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,730
Help.

675
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,170
- Gosh.
- Help.

676
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,140
You must know you're about to die.

677
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,940
Get up, you brat. Kyung Woo-yeon.

678
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,350
Wake up.

679
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,200
How did I get home?

680
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,410
(I think I hurt my back.
I'm going to sue you.)

681
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,080
(Walk on your own if you're awake.)

682
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,290
I can't.

683
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,620
Will you look at that?

684
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,890
No way...

685
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,730
(Recent calls)

686
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,000
(You won't even like me.)

687
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,570
(So why do you click "Like"?)

688
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,270
Do you care that little about how I feel?

689
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,270
I'm 28 years old, darn you!

690
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,180
(This is On Joon-soo.)

691
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,050
(Are you feeling okay?)

692
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,320
Beep.

693
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,160
This is a baby demon!

694
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,140
Sir, did you look for me?

695
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,440
Did Ms. Kyung Woo-yeon reply?

696
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:08,740
Not yet.

697
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,350
Why did you use my phone instead of yours?

698
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,010
I have my reasons.

699
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,280
Tell me right away if she answers.

700
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,620
How come you only ask her

701
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,190
if she's feeling okay?
You don't care if I'm feeling sick.

702
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,130
You never asked me if I'm okay
after we go drinking.

703
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,360
To be honest, I'm hurt.

704
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,330
You're right. Your liver got really weak.

705
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,000
You called me "CEO punk"
and a" baby demon."

706
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,640
What else did you call me?

707
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,210
- About yesterday...
- It was your liver talking.

708
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,810
Of course.

709
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,980
Sir. We heard from Mr. Lee Soo.

710
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,850
(I think I hurt my back. I'm going to sue you.)
She read it and ignored it?

711
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,520
(Eunyu Publishing Company)

712
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,260
When did you come to Seoul?

713
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,430
Two days ago.

714
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Thank you for receiving me kindly
although I rejected you.

715
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,240
Because you're important.

716
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,740
I don't mind being rejected
multiple times.

717
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,340
I won't reject you again.

718
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,740
Let's work on the photo collection.

719
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,720
This is a good kind of surprise.

720
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,320
Can I ask why you suddenly
changed your mind?

721
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,390
You asked me several times.

722
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,590
I can be won over
if one tries hard enough.

723
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,000
Also, I think I'll be able to find

724
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,400
images of Seoul that aren't cold or cruel.

725
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,440
That's a good reason.

726
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,810
Before that, there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

727
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,910
This is a collection of short stories
with Seoul as the theme.

728
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,710
Originally, I had planned

729
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,480
to condense the text from here
to put into the photo collection,

730
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,450
but I recently met a calligrapher.

731
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,960
(One who's been hurt can't be strong due to the cracks.)
She posts her own writing on social media.

732
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,690
Her writing and her calligraphy are both really nice.

733
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,690
(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)
Her writing and her calligraphy are both really nice.

734
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,130
If you're okay with it,

735
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,070
I'd like to ask her to write the text.

736
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,370
It's just that she's someone new
without much experience.

737
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,570
If everyone looks for people
with experience,

738
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,470
where can rookies build experience?

739
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,710
That's why I hope to help her
build experience at Eunyu Publishing.

740
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,210
Of course, that's only if
you're okay with it.

741
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,350
Yes, sure. I like it.

742
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,490
Then let us proceed.

743
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,000
You're doing something useless, Woo-yeon.

744
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:30,380
Goodness. Did you drink again?

745
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,080
If you were my daughter, you'd be dead.

746
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,210
Even my parents leave me alone.

747
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,090
Can I take this call?

748
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,200
Hello?

749
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,640
Why didn't you reply?

750
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,040
- Who is this?
- It's On Joon-soo.

751
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,480
Hello?

752
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,320
Yes. Hello.

753
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,250
Can I see you today?

754
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,520
Why? Did I do something?

755
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,720
What?

756
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,330
I drank too much last night.

757
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,730
If I made any mistakes,

758
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,330
I'm really sorry.

759
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,670
I don't want to see you.

760
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,440
It's not that. It's about work.

761
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,570
"Work"?

762
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,750
I'm sorry

763
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,210
for making you come here.

764
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,450
It's okay.

765
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,220
I'm the one asking for a favor,
so of course I should come.

766
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,890
I'll get right to the point. I'm working
on a calligraphy photo collection.

767
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,890
I'd like you to be in charge
of the text and the calligraphy

768
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,960
that'll go into the book.

769
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,160
Would it be okay for me
to come up with the text?

770
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,130
I'm not a professional writer.

771
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,670
I saw your writing.

772
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,170
I've never seen
such a pretty diary before.

773
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,750
That's why I really want you
to take the job.

774
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:18,720
I'll do it. I want to do it.

775
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,420
I didn't even tell you
who the photographer is.

776
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,490
It doesn't matter who it is.
I still want to do it.

777
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,230
It's a good opportunity for me.

778
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,160
Next time, you shouldn't be

779
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,130
so hasty in saying yes.

780
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,500
Then

781
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,330
maybe I should think it over...

782
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,210
I wanted to pretend to think about it,

783
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,480
but I don't think that's necessary.

784
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,980
It's Eunyu Publishing.

785
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,110
The best in the industry.

786
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,880
And above all else,

787
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,390
it came to me.

788
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,360
I sold personalized calligraphy
that was constantly returned

789
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,290
and at most,
filled in for other people at events.

790
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,800
But this time, it's really my work.

791
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,430
I like that.

792
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,340
I look forward to working with you,
Ms. Kyung.

793
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,310
I look forward to working with you,

794
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,010
Mr. On.

795
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,510
Are you going home? I'll drive you.

796
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,580
It's okay.

797
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,980
I'm okay too.

798
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,920
Come out. I'll get the car.

799
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,530
You know how words have roots?

800
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yes.

801
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,140
The words traitor, tradition,

802
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,670
and trade all share
the common root "trado".

803
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,440
This is because they all

804
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,780
involve handing something over.

805
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,150
Okay.

806
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:57,720
There's a reason for everything.

807
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,920
There is nothing you can't figure out
if you question it.

808
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,820
If you still can't find the reason
notwithstanding that,

809
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,190
it may be best to just let go.

810
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,260
I wrote that.

811
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,900
Was I out of line just now?

812
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:16,770
No.

813
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,400
You know,

814
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,110
you're good at comforting people.

815
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
I do know.

816
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,750
So come whenever you need me.

817
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,230
I can drive you to your door.

818
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,430
The alley's narrow.
It's easier just to walk.

819
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,700
Thank you for the ride.

820
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,600
Get home safely.

821
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,770
Woo-yeon.

822
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Yes?

823
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,640
Do we have no reason to meet
if it isn't about work?

824
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,680
- Sorry?
- You said earlier

825
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,380
that you wouldn't meet me.

826
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,160
Actually, I black out way too often.

827
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,960
I'm always nervous the day after I drink.

828
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,430
That's why I was afraid and embarrassed
I may have done something bad.

829
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,600
Why?

830
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,640
Did I

831
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,010
do something?

832
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,710
I did.

833
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,980
I did. Yes, I did.

834
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,050
I really did it.

835
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,880
You didn't do anything.

836
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,720
So don't be afraid or embarrassed,

837
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,220
and sleep well tonight.

838
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,460
Goodnight.

839
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,330
Bye.

840
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,620
Hi, Woo-yeon.

841
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,090
Caught you.

842
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,830
You ignore my text
and you run away from me.

843
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,730
You know I'm running away,
so don't stop me.

844
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,900
Don't show your face in front of me.
Just...

845
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,100
Just get lost.

846
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,010
Why are you so mad at me?

847
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,440
- Like you don't know?
- No, I don't.

848
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,710
I was happy to see you on Jeju Island.

849
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,550
I was upset that you suddenly disappeared.

850
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,280
Why are you so upset?

851
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,180
Because even now,
you only think about yourself.

852
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,790
You rejected me. Twice.

853
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,450
Then what? Should I say let's go out

854
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,390
just because you like me
when I don't like you back?

855
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,590
Isn't that worse?

856
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,660
Fine.

857
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,960
You did nothing wrong.

858
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,360
I'm the one who was wrong. I'm very sorry.

859
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,400
Now that I apologized,
let's never meet again.

860
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,470
I'm begging you.

861
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,570
No.

862
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,310
I will see you again.

863
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,510
Because I've decided to keep seeing you.

864
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,110
That won't happen.

865
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,820
Yes, it will. Why don't you believe me?

866
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,150
See you soon.

867
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,420
Hey...

868
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,460
Don't you dare show your face again.

869
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,130
- I'm warning you!
- It was nice seeing you too.

870
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,000
(I'll never see you again.)

871
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,370
(Never.)

872
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,600
(For the girl who cared about looks,)

873
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,210
(the girl who only slept,)

874
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,610
(and the girl who nearly died
from an apple,)

875
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,610
(there was one solution.)

876
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,680
(A kiss.)

877
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,390
(The curse was broken.)

878
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,960
(So what are you)

879
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,630
(doing here?)

880
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,300
Say hello.

881
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
He's the photographer, Lee Soo.
She's the calligrapher, Kyung Woo-yeon.

882
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,570
The two of you will be working together.

883
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,410
Hi.

884
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,410
Do you know each other?

885
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,550
- We're friends.
- I'm sorry.

886
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,550
I'll call you later.

887
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,890
- Woo-yeon.
- I guess we'll have to reschedule.

888
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,490
Bye, then.

889
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,710
No.

890
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,410
I will see you again.

891
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,510
Because I've decided to keep seeing you.

892
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,850
Hi.

893
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,250
What's his deal?

894
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,580
He knew?

895
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,290
That...

896
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,890
Is running away your thing?

897
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,090
You knew, didn't you?

898
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,230
And yet, you didn't tell me.

899
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,970
You didn't ask.

900
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,770
I'll ask you why you keep running away.

901
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,800
Because I don't want to see you.

902
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,970
I ran away because I hate you.

903
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,280
I hate you.

904
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,850
You're a good liar.

905
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,520
What?

906
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,450
There's no way you hate me.

907
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,590
Get over yourself...

908
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,730
I don't know what I said that night,

909
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,600
but I don't remember a thing.

910
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,460
I tend to say things I don't mean

911
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,430
whenever I get drunk.

912
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,340
It's just nonsense. It means nothing.
It's garbage.

913
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,040
So forget everything

914
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,970
from that night.

915
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,980
(I hate you.)

916
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,750
Why do I even bother
talking to a drunk person?

917
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,520
Do whatever you want.

918
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,050
I can't though.

919
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,120
They're my feelings,
but I can't do as I wish.

920
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,300
Even if I cover it up and ignore it.
Even if I push it down.

921
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,870
Whenever I see you,
they come back to life.

922
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,970
So

923
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,010
don't show up in front of me.

924
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,180
Please let me live.

925
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,390
(I had forgotten)

926
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,360
(that the witch)

927
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,630
(can always cast a new curse.)

928
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,340
You want me to let you live?

929
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,870
But I don't want to.

930
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,610
(Eunyu Publishing Company)

931
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,980
(And this witch)

932
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,550
(doesn't want to let me live.)

933
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,220
I can smell the alcohol
just from the picture.

934
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,260
I can see way too well
why the two of them are friends.

935
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,800
Get out of Seoul!

936
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,810
Why do you keep telling him to leave?

937
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,640
He only got here recently.

938
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,380
(Pocha Kingdom)

939
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,550
He's evil.

940
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,850
Evil.

941
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,850
Goodness. She is plastered.
Completely plastered.

942
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,880
I'm out.

943
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,190
(Pocha Kingdom)

944
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,580
That pervert.

945
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,180
Woo-yeon.

946
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,750
What?

947
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,390
Are you the devil?
You showed up because I spoke about you.

948
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,090
Are you a ghost?
Are you back to roam the earth?

949
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,060
Excuse me.

950
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,400
What's wrong with you?

951
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,760
Quiet. There's a pervert following you.

952
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,970
Excuse me.

953
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,740
Run at the count of three.
One, two, three.
