1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,500
(Just because the flowers faded,
it doesn't mean I ever forgot you.)

2
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,110
(Just because the flowers faded,
it doesn't mean I ever forgot you.)

3
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,560
=Episode 1=

4
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,060
I'd like to thank you all for coming today

5
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,760
to Eunyu Publishing Company's
20th-anniversary celebration.

6
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,670
We'll hear a few words from the CEO,
Mr. On Joon-soo.

7
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,930
(20th Anniversary
of Eunyu Publishing Company)

8
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,050
This year is our publishing company's
20th anniversary.

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,520
It is all thanks to your support.

10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,620
They say that until someone reads it,

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,850
it isn't a book, but rather,
a collection of letters.

12
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,760
And thus, selling books
is a publisher's role.

13
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,390
Breaking through the industry attitude
that we don't want to advertise

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,830
in order to sell books...

15
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,300
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,640
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

17
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm sorry. Clean that up.

18
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,939
I hope you liked the sound effects.

19
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,450
Eunyu worked hard for the past 20 years

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,690
for literature that you want to possess,
literature that you can grab

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,260
if you reach out your hand.

22
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,360
It is all thanks to you accompanying us.

23
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,229
We won't forget our conviction

24
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,700
and will do our best
so that authors and readers

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,040
can be as close as possible.

26
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,310
Thank you.

27
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,290
What is your job, Woo-yeon?

28
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,500
(I work at a cafe on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays.)

29
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,530
Enjoy.

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,640
(On Tuesdays, I teach kids
in an afterschool program.)

31
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,640
(When I need cash,)

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,540
(I do single-day gig jobs.)

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,780
(Love that pours down on me)

34
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,680
(Happiness is always by our side)

35
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,390
(During the remaining times,
I'm a calligrapher.)

36
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,290
I know, right?

37
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,729
What am I doing right now?

38
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,070
Would you like it wrapped up?

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,370
Yes, please.

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,370
It's 2,000 won each.

41
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,080
Wrap just that one.

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,820
Please make the ribbon look pretty.

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,900
Can she be any crankier?

44
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,280
- Yes?
(- What are you doing?)

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,010
Me? Nothing much.

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,780
(You must have been busy.
What did you do today?)

47
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,650
You don't have to know.

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,350
What are we doing tomorrow?

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,030
(Happy 100th day, thank you)

50
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,650
Finished.

51
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,190
- Woo-yeon.
- Yes?

52
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,720
I love you.

53
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,900
- I said, I love you.
- Okay.

54
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,410
Let's break up.

55
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,020
We should break up.

56
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,320
Okay, then.

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,710
(Happy 100th day, thank you)

58
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,030
Hold on.

59
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,070
There we go.

60
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Look at that tummy.

61
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,670
- No, focus.
- Focus.

62
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,970
Wait.

63
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,010
All right.

64
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,550
Isn't it hot?

65
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,380
Hold on.

66
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,920
(Hey, I broke up with my boyfriend.)

67
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,890
Is she crazy?

68
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,960
Is her hobby collecting ex-boyfriends?
Why did she break up again?

69
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,290
It can't be helped.

70
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,559
No, it can't.

71
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,930
Please finish it in a hurry.

72
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,400
What about Woo-yeon?

73
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,800
She has Han Jin-ju too. Come here.

74
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,980
That feels good.

75
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,309
Thanks to you, I got to come
to a nice place like this.

76
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,980
It's really nice.

77
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,620
You worked really hard
on Baek Chun-sik's Drug Case.

78
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,350
I didn't do much.
You worked even harder, Ms. Han.

79
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,420
I personally think...

80
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Well, you're younger than me,

81
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,860
but you're beautiful and competent too.

82
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,970
I respect you down to my bones.

83
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,030
I respect you.

84
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,040
How did the blind date go?

85
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,570
I decided not to go on it.

86
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,410
Why not? Didn't you say
he's a handsome doctor?

87
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,140
Yes, he is,

88
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,150
but there was a twist.

89
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,380
The man is 30 years old,

90
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,950
but my goodness,

91
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,720
he has never dated before.

92
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,990
- What's wrong with that?
- What do you mean?

93
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,790
If he hasn't dated for that long,

94
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,660
there must be something wrong with him

95
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
or maybe there's a problem.

96
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,770
If not, how could he have never dated
for all those years?

97
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,910
What I just said wasn't about you.

98
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,550
Is it too late to apologize? I'm sorry...

99
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,150
It's okay. Why are you sorry?

100
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,020
I'm happy.

101
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,960
Can I get some water?

102
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,830
Your phone has been ringing for a while.
You should check it.

103
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,840
(Hey, I broke up with my boyfriend.)

104
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,010
(Can you come out? Please...)

105
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,180
(Are you a psychopath?)

106
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,650
(You even bought a gift for the 100th day.
Why did you break up?)

107
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,480
(He dumped me.)

108
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,820
(Should we drink tonight?)

109
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,860
Isn't he crazy?

110
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
How can he dump me on our 100th day?

111
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,130
It's as if he was waiting for this day.

112
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
I bet he was waiting.

113
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,630
Is he a pervert?
Why would he wait 100 days to break up?

114
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,400
He probably waited 100 days
for her to love him.

115
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,810
Gosh. I'm sorry, we just closed.

116
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,020
It looks like you're still open.

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,680
I can see people inside.

118
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,590
They're not people. They're monsters.
Alcohol monsters.

119
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,920
If you come back next time,

120
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,030
a rolled omelet is on me.

121
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,190
I see. Okay. We'll get going.

122
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,960
Okay. Sorry about that.
Please visit us again.

123
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,500
How does it feel to break up?

124
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,930
I hear other people get so sad
they can't even eat.

125
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,270
- I like it because you eat well.
- Woo-yeon.

126
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,770
Rude Kyung Woo-yeon.

127
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,210
I had to turn away my precious customers
because of you.

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,980
Hey. Why do you keep breaking up?

129
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,210
Yes, stop breaking up.

130
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,010
Do you think I want to break up?

131
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,680
If you have 12 ex-boyfriends,
I think you might be one of those people.

132
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,520
An ex-boyfriend collector.

133
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,720
Gosh. I broke up with my boyfriend,
and no one will comfort me.

134
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,390
It's been too many times.

135
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,530
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

136
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,170
I wish I could break up too.

137
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,940
I wish I could cry from being dumped.

138
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,640
Ms. Prosecutor,
you should lower your standards.

139
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,180
There are no Gang Dong-wons
or Zo In-sungs in real life.

140
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,610
If I lower them now,

141
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,950
all my efforts to get into SNU
and pass the bar will be wasted.

142
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,120
Who will compensate me
for all those years?

143
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,480
Who will compensate her?

144
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,190
Do you date to get compensated?

145
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,720
Even if you're head over heels,
dating is hard. You're so immature.

146
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,390
Do you get it now?

147
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,090
Yes. You should mark her words.

148
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,830
I'm saying this to you too.

149
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,730
You should stop doing that.

150
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,270
What did I do?

151
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,040
Don't date someone just because

152
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,340
you think you might like them later.

153
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,970
It's unfair
to you and the other person too.

154
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,080
Should I make soft tofu stew
or fish cake soup for you?

155
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,350
Yes, a fish cake soup.

156
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,650
I'll make it when this is finished.

157
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,880
(You shouldn't date.
You don't know how to love.)

158
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,390
What is it?

159
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
What? Nothing.

160
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,630
I need to go to the restroom.

161
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,260
(Tonight)

162
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,050
(You shouldn't date.)

163
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,110

(I don't know how to love.)

165
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,990
(That's the curse I have.)

166
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,960

They say, "Out of sight,"

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,390
"out of mind."

174
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,530
Then why

175
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,600
is it only getting clearer?

176
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,230
You jerk!

(Summer 2015)

178
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,640
Why do I still like you?

179
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,480
It's so annoying.

- What is this?
- A handsome young man.

192
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,380
Your shoelace is untied.

193
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
Gosh.

194
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,090
Someone must be thinking of me.

195
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,490
If our shoelaces get untied
every time someone thinks about us,

196
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,990
mine would always be untied.

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,700

(Flowers are in bloom,)

200
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,840
and the unwelcome yellow dust

201
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,870
and spring fever came with them.

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,340
Dear students of Jinha High,

203
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,550
are your plans for the semester faltering?

204
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,980
I'm sure some of you
have heard this saying.

205
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,320
"This too shall pass."

206
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,420
This saying originated in "Midrish",

207
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,260
a Jewish commentary.

208
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,960
One day David gave an order...

209
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,900
He's so good looking.

210
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,270
He told them to engrave a phrase on it.

211
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,200
A message that will bring me joy
in times of victory...

212
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,610
I thought you'd be a delinquent
since you got a special admission,

213
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,040
but you always win awards.
I'm glad I excused you from study hall.

214
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,180
A message that also brings courage
in times of defeat.

215
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,380
"The above student"

216
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,320
"has won the National High School
Yi Sang Essay Contest"

217
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,690
"and is thus presented with this award."

218
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Hey.

219
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,240
You forgot the award.

220
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,110
Isn't she so weird?

221
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,340
She's so odd.

222
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,620
That concludes the assembly.

223
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,100
Please.

224
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,070
Soo. I made this orange tart.

225
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,510
- Yes!
- What about mine?

226
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Ji-hyeon!

227
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,310
Here.

228
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,280
I got a copy of "Gossip Girl 3".
You said you wanted to watch it.

229
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,590
Nice. Thank you, thank you.

230
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,620
That's great. First period is ethics,
so I would've been mad bored.

231
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,020
You're going to watch during class?

232
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,530
It's okay. I won't get it confiscated.

233
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,430
Woo-yeon.

234
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,370
Where's your head?

235
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,370
Or what? Were you throwing it away
because you have too many awards?

236
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,270
I thought I was missing something.

237
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,070
Here. Eat this.

238
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,310
What is it?

239
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,440
Orange tarts. You like oranges.

240
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,380
I like oranges too.

241
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,150
So? Are you going to snatch this
from her too?

242
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,550
Just like the video player?

243
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,490
- She gave it to me--
- See you.

244
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,720
Let's share.

245
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,460
You're so annoying.

246
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,530
Oh no.

247
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,240
Sorry.

248
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,940
Here.

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,170
Hey, Woo-yeon.

250
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,250
I like orange tarts too.

251
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,850
Here. Come on.

252
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,560
No.

253
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,120
You use it. Let's go.

254
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,969
Let's walk together. Where are you going?

255
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,170
I'm going toward the intersection.
Past Binggrae Tteokbokki.

256
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,710
You know it's a crime to mention
tteokbokki and not eat any.

257
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,980
I know that. Let's go. My treat.

258
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,850
You're a good kid.

259
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
What do you mean?

260
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,290
You're the first person
to offer to buy me anything.

261
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,390
Let's go.

262
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,430
Binggrae's really good.

263
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,270
Hey. Were you waiting for me?

264
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,210
Did you know I didn't have an umbrella?

265
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,410
Let's go.

266
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,550
I'm treating with my award money,

267
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,650
so eat up.

268
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
When did our daughter grow up,
that she's buying us beef?

269
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,630
I'm about to cry.

270
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,430
I'll become a super famous author
and buy you a cow farm.

271
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,630
We don't need a cow farm.
Just go to college.

272
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,070
I'm going to major in creative writing.

273
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,940
I got lots of awards
so that I can go to college.

274
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,310
What if you decide
you don't want to be an author?

275
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,470
You can't get a job
if you major in creative writing.

276
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,810
Did you major in pessimism at Harvard?

277
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,310
You're the absolute best
at killing someone's mood.

278
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,080
Shut your trap before I...

279
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,820
It's not a trap. It's a meat shoot.

280
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,320
Honey. Let's just enjoy the food
on a day like this.

281
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,060
Hey. Here. Eat.

Woo-yeon, that freak. She's so annoying.

285
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,240
That loser is such a busybody.
It's mad annoying.

286
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,340
She acts like she's an angel.

287
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,010
I can't stand how she acts all pretty.

288
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,910
I can't stand her.

289
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,240
Right?

290
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,950
I hate her.

291
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,280
Clean up well.

292
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,720
Don't go anywhere else,
and go straight home.

293
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,120
Yes, sir.

294
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,830
Woo-yeon.

295
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,660
I have plans today.
Can we switch cleaning schedules?

296
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,770
- What?
- Woo-yeon.

297
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,730
Let's go.

298
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,600
We have our club meeting.
The others are there already.

299
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,640
Sorry.

300
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,940
Why are you sorry?

302
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,250
There's no one here.

303
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,150
Don't you have any friends?

304
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,260
What?

305
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,030
Why do you let those nobodies
string you along?

306
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,560
Why do you kiss up to them
like some moron?

307
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,800
Watch your language.

308
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,500
- What do you know?
- What don't I know?

309
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,470
It's clear that you're a moron,

310
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,270
and that those jerks
are vampires feeding on your self-worth.

311
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,210
Why can't you see that?

312
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,610
What's it to you?

313
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,480
It bothers me.

314
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
- What?
- It bothers me.

315
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,030
What's going on?
Why did your class finish so early?

316
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,630
Our class always gets out last.

We have to gather by 9 a.m.
for volunteering tomorrow.

319
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,240
I have a supplemental class
at my academy tomorrow,

320

so I have to be back before dinner.

321

Why is a building owner's daughter
so hardworking?

322
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,850
Let the peasants get a chance
to be the top of the class.

323
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,280
No matter how little I work,
you'll never get a chance,

Why do you know my rank?

You're interested in me, aren't you?

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,460
You're not stupid, you're sick.

329
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,100
She's interested in me.

330
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,660
Focus. We should finish before dinner.

331
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,430
Both of you shut it. Okay.

332
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,600
Dress comfortably. It'll be hard labor.

333
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,870
Next. We have to decide
who will be in charge of snacks.

334
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,970
Who wants to do it?

335
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,710
You should've just put it in whole.
Why did you bother chopping it?

336
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,270
I can't chop you up.

337
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,080
Of course not.
This is a carrot and I'm a person.

338
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,960
Young-hee told me to do it.

339
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,640
Excuse me! Can someone
please move the food trays?

340
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,470
Okay. She'll do it.

341
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,180
Food trays are heavy.
What if I hurt my back?

342
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,010
Okay, I'll do it.

343
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,460
Woo-yeon, you scoop the soup.

344
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,390
- Why?
- It's hot.

345
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,890
What if I get burned and get a scar?

346
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,840
- Young-hee.
- Yes?

347
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,940
Look over there.

348
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,910
I'm so jealous. They're sweet together
even when they're old.

349
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,910
Does that make you jealous?

350
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,850
It scares me.

351
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,050
- Come this way.
- Enjoy.

352
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,760
If you order me around again,
I'll kill you.

353
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,660
- That was good.
- What?

354
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,170
If anyone mistreats you,
yell at them like that.

355
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,210
You seem to have some idiotic belief
that everything will be peaceful

356
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,570
if you just take it and suffer a little
by yourself.

357
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,010
But stop it.

358
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,310
If I just take it

359
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,610
and suffer a little, nothing will happen.

360
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,250
No one else will be upset or hurt.

361
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,890
Is that so bad?

362
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,520
Yes, it is bad. For you.

363
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,690
If you don't care about yourself,
why will anyone else?

364
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,430
Hold on.

365
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,160
Hey!

366
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
Let me help you.

367
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,470
This broke.

368
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,740
Get on my back.

369
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,400
- What?
- Get on my back.

370
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,640
- I'm too heavy.
- It's okay. Get on my back.

371
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,340
Goodness. Thank you.

372
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,830
I know I'm excessively good looking,

373
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,130
but you shouldn't stare like that.

374
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,760
You're embarrassing me.

375
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,170
Whatever. I was surprised, that's why.

376
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,800
Why?

377
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,440
I thought you were a selfish jerk.

378
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,910
I tend to be kind of cold,
so people get that misconception.

379
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,110
You have no friends, do you?

380
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,220
I do too.

381
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,180
Sure. Jin Sang-hyeok?

382
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,090
I have another one.

383
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
Who?

384
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,690
Kyung Woo-yeon.

385
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,570
(Are we really friends?)

386
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,270
(If you don't care about yourself,
why will anyone else?)

387
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,550
(Friends.)

388
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,080
(I don't think we're friends.)

389
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,860
Over here.

390
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,160
- This way.
- Here.

391
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,430
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

392
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,830
- Are you okay?
- This is awesome.

393
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,330
- Are you okay?
- Shouldn't we get the nurse?

394
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,900
She seems badly hurt.

395
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,570
Oh no. She fainted.

396
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,710
Are you all right?

397
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,250
(I knew it. We're not friends.)

398
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,320
Woo-yeon, are you okay?

399
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,120
I heard it was that jerk Soo.

400
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,490
I'm fine.

401
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,690
No. It hurts.

402
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,430
Oh no.

403
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,100
Seriously. How do you even get
a bruise like that?

404
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,070
Serves Woo-yeon right.

405
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,170
I couldn't stand what a busybody she was.

406
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,300
Right?

407
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,240
We let that loser hang out with us,
and she thinks she actually our friend.

408
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,410
Let's just go.

409
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,150
We're not going anywhere.
Why should you avoid them?

410
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,820
- Should we cut Woo-yeon out?
- Definitely.

411
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,950
Hey! Why you cheap little twerps.

412
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,060
If you want to badmouth her,
say it to her face.

413
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,760
Why are you talking behind her back?

414
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,760
Jin-ju.

415
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,390
Hey. You're really naughty.

416
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,730
Were you eavesdropping?
Have you got no class?

417
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,170
Class? Give me a break.

418
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,340
And talking behind someone's back
is classy?

419
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,670
In a public place, of all places?

420
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,010
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.
Let's go, Jin-ju.

421
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,110
Why should you pretend
not to hear something you heard?

422
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,410
You're not going anywhere. Apologize.

423
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,980
Why should I? Was anything I said wrong?

424
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,420
Hey, you. You tell me.

425
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,050
Was anything I said wrong?

426
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,660
Stop it.

427
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,360
What if I don't?

428
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,190
Will you curse at me? Will you hit me?

429
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,460
I said to stop it.

430
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,400
I won't take it anymore.

431
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,900
No. You have to keep taking it.

432
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,270
That's your thing. That's your specialty.

433
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,740
You act like you're so nice.
Like you're the only good person.

434
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,010
It's because you keep acting like
you're a good person

435
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,780
that I look like a villain.

436
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,950
You make me sick.

437
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,060
You're good at acting like you're good.

438
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,300
Why you little...

439
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,710
I said to stop.

440
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,670
I said I won't take it.

441
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,440
You witch!

442
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,310
How dare you gang up on her?

443
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,350
Hey!

444
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,620
Young-hee.

445
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,590
Can't a girl poop in peace?

446
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,730
Why won't you apologize?
She said to apologize.

447
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,040
The World Cup will start next month.

448
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,610
As we wish our Taeguk Warriors victory,

449
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:41,140
here's Trans Fixion's "The Shout of Reds."

450
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,920
Hey, something must be happening.

451
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,790
Is there a fight?

452
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,990
Woo-yeon and Jin-ju got into a fight
with Ji-hyeon's girls.

453
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,560
What? Jin-ju can't even fight.

454
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,630
Hey. Aren't you going to stop them?

455
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,000
Why should I? What if I hurt my face?

456
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,970
You smart punk.

457
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,170
Hey.

458
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,540
Excuse me.

459
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,490
(Don't eat, just look.)

460
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,240
Freeze. Freeze!

461
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,210
You brats. What do you think you're doing?

462
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,280
Tell me!

463
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,450
Look at your hair. Is this a war?

464
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,050
What are you doing there?

465
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,490
You brats.

466
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,460
Jin-ju. Why is the top student
here like this?

467
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,100
Can't the top student get in trouble?

468
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,400
Sorry.

469
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,040
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

470
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,310
Hey. How could I not do anything
when my friend was being disrespected?

471
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,910
I just felt like fighting today.

472
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,720
That psycho who called the dean.

473
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,790
I hope his fingernail comes off.

474
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,579
(Text Message)

475
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,700
What is it?

476
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,230
Is your face a canvas?

477
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,130
It was blue this morning,
and now it's red.

478
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,170
You're the one who painted it blue.

479
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,780
Why are you giving this to me?

480
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,349
Do you not know its effect,
or do you not know how to use it?

481
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,980
I ask because I don't know your intention.

482
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,210
It's for you to get better soon.

483
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,820
You're already ugly, so this color
is making you look worse.

484
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,020
This is precious.

485
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,120
Do you think I'd buy anyone ointment?

486
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,900
Why are you nice to me?

487
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,500
Because you keep standing out.

488
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,470
What?

489
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,770
For two years, we've been in
the same class, club, and neighborhood.

490
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,270
I keep seeing you.

491
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,610
Since I see you so often,

492
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,510
I felt bad for you.

493
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,450
So you're pitying me.

494
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,280
More like a sense of kindship.

495
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,390
Don't try to change yourself for others.

496
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,090
No matter what you do,
those who want to leave will leave,

497
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,420
and those who will stay will stay.

498
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,970
(Medicine)

499
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,210
(It's a confession.)

500
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,480
How did you come to that conclusion?

501
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,610
"Those who will stay will stay."

502
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,680
So, I will stay.

503
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,350
He means, let me be
the only one who stays beside you.

504
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,190
How can an aspiring writer not know
what the speaker means?

505
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,860
How would she know? All she does is study.

506
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,290
Then do you?

507
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,300
I know more than the girl
with no dating experience.

508
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,230
I'm not the only one.
She never dated either.

509
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,770
It looks like she'll start dating soon.

510
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,640
No, it's not like that.

511
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,440
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
This is how everyone starts.

512
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,410
How did you
and your boyfriend start dating?

513
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,980
I think it was

514
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,720
the first day of a new semester.

515
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,090
Flip it over, flip it over.

516
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,490
(He says he saw a halo behind me.)

517
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,100
What's with this reaction?

518
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,130
By the way, why don't you date?

519
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,770
My mom told me I could date

520
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,570
people like Gang Dong-won
or Zo In-sung when I go to college.

521
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,710
Should we keep on plucking weeds?

522
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,110
We should pluck out her vain hope instead.

523
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,210
Anyway, it's for sure Lee Soo likes you.

524
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,620
Come on.

525
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,170
(Does he really like me?)

526
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,590
(At first,)

527
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,500
(I thought it was ridiculous
as I watched him.)

528
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,380
(But he's mature...)

529
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,010
Lee Soo.

530
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,890
What are you doing here?

531
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,020
(And sweet.)

532
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,830
Kyung Woo-yeon.

533
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
What are you doing?

534
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,510
Hey! Stop. Hey.

535
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,940
What are you doing?

536
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,710
What are you doing?

537
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,950
Because you're ugly.

538
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,120
What?

539
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,750
I should only look at beautiful things.

540
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,490
I kept noticing him worrying about me.

541
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,460
I started to like him.

542
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,300
How disgusting. Hey.

543
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,800
Has love turned you blind?

544
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,870
How can that rude jerk
be sugarcoated like this?

545
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,280
He looks coldhearted,
but he's a really sweet guy.

546
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,780
- No.
- You don't know anything.

547
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,380
Anyway,
let's go to a concert this Saturday.

548
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,250
Dad bought me tickets
since our exams are over.

549
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm busy on Saturday.

550
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,750
Why?

551
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,690
Are you meeting Lee Soo?

552
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,190
No, it's the day of the second round
for the Daesun Youth Literary Awards.

553
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,230
Right.

554
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,430
If you win, you'll get into pretty much
any creative writing program, right?

555
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,560
That would be so awesome.

556
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,800
What if you become a star writer?

557
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,470
Ms. Kyung, can I get your autograph?

558
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,210
Gosh, what autograph?

559
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,210
Where do you want it?

560
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,950
- Here.
- There? Okay.

561
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,850
- Do you want a receipt?
- Please check the order.

562
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,980
- Here you go.
- Customer number 17.

563
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,920
(Young-hee,
let's go to a concert this Saturday.)

564
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,120
(My dad got me VIP tickets.)

565
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,120
Han Jin-ju,

566
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,960
I hate you just a little bit today.

567
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,340
What?

568
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,830
Good work. You must be tired.

569
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,500
No.

570
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,000
"No"?

571
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,100
(Late Night Snack Cart)

572
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,210
It's been a while since you two came.
Did you do well on your exams?

573
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,440
Why would you ask that?
It makes us uncomfortable.

574
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,840
We did okay.

575
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,080
It's okay, you don't have to do well.
You're still young.

576
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,820
It's not okay.

577
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,490
If we don't do well,
we can't go to university.

578
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,360
If we can't go to university,
we can't get jobs.

579
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,190
If we can't get jobs, we'll be poor.

580
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,160
If we're poor,
our children will resent us.

581
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,160
I'll die a lonely death
after having my children resent me.

582
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,760
There you go again.

583
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,200
Don't worry and just eat.
You didn't have dinner.

584
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,300
Okay.

585
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,440
Eat slowly or you'll get indigestion.

586
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,680
Is there anything you want to do
now that the exams are over?

587
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,480
Should we go to an amusement park?
You don't have to work on weekends.

588
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,750
I can't on weekends.

589
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,690
Jin-ju asked me to go
to a concert with her, but I told her no.

590
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,160
What do you do on weekends
that keeps you so busy?

591
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,430
Do you have a man?

592
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,160
What?

593
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,880
You should take a good look at Dad's face.

594
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,020
So that

595
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,820
you'll be able to remember him
even after many years.

596
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,230
Did you put the beef in the fridge?

597
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Yes, I did. Do you need it?

598
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,500
Yes. I'm going to make some soup with it.
Take it out.

599
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,070
I'll put this in.

600
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,410
Son.

601
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,410
Are you going somewhere?

602
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,220
I bought groceries
so I could make you dinner.

603
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,120
I have plans.

604
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,350
We should have some family time
on a day like today.

605
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,660
Since it's a day like today,

606
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,890
- I feel more comfortable with friends.
- Hey.

607
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,260
You won't get to see your mom for a while.

608
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,500
Sure. Friends are a priority at your age.

609
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,440
Have fun.

610
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,340
Is it still like that at your age?

611
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,740
You're still friends after the divorce.

612
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,010
Don't other people's eyes bother you?

613
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,880
You two can enjoy dinner on your own.

614
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,650
I have plans.

615
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,660
- You punk.
- Leave him.

616
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,930
What he said is right.

617
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,070
Since when were they so close?

618
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,610
The literary camp will be for three days
in Goseong, Gangwon-do.

619
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,840
The writing contest will start tomorrow
at 10 a.m.

620
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,350
We'll get going now.
Let's get on the bus.

621
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,880
- Kim Sung-jun.
- Yes.

622
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,920
Kyung Woo-yeon.

623
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,120
- Thank you.
- Shin Min-seok.

624
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,560
(Lee Soo)

625
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,570
Hello?

626
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,340
(Where are you? Let's hang out.)

627
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,940
I can't today.

628
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,540
(- I'll buy you barbecue.)
- I really can't today.

629
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,710
I'm off to a writing contest--

630
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,680
Hello?

631
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,180
Hello? Lee Soo?

632
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,380
Hello?

633
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,540
(The phone is turned off.)

634
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,370
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

635
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,710
Excuse me.

636
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,220
Hey, kid. Kid!

637
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,450
Excuse me, is there a student
named Lee Soo in the emergency room?

638
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,620
Just a moment.

639
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,990
There is no such patient.

640
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,000
(The person you have reached
is not available.)

641
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,440
We have a traffic accident patient.

642
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,850
Is he conscious?

643
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,120
Sir. Did you fall?

644
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,380
Kyung Woo-yeon.

645
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,120
How could you hang up the phone like that?

646
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,680
I...

647
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,790
A motorcycle suddenly ran over
and crushed my phone.

648
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,720
What are you doing here?

649
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,890
I thought you were hurt.

650
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,130
You didn't answer your phone either.

651
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,100
I thought something happened to you.

652
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,230
Why did you weep so loudly?
Now people are going to misunderstand.

653
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,860
Misunderstand what?

654
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,400
I bet everyone passing by
thought the same thing.

655
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,370
That distinguished young man
must have made a girl cry.

656
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,100
What a bad guy.

657
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,500
I must be crazy.

658
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,740
Do you know what I gave up because of you?

659
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,810
Of course I don't.

660
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,580
But it's okay for you to come to me today.

661
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,980
It's my birthday.

662
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,250
Don't lie.

663
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,250
I know your birthday is on December 28th.

664
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,090
That's just when my birth was registered.
Today is my real birthday.

665
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,890
By the way, did you memorize my birthday?

666
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,160
I'm good at memorizing people's birthdays.

667
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:01,030
You don't have to remember mine.

668
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,070
I hate birthdays.

669
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,870
Why?

670
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,540
Just because.
I don't feel happy about being born.

671
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,590
(Happy birthday, Lee Soo)

672
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,000
Do you know why they cut
birthday cakes into halves?

673
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,300
Why?

674
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,400
They say it's to split the days

675
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,440
you've lived so far,
and the days you'll live from now.

676
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,010
Here.

677
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,750
(Happy birthday, Lee Soo)

678
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,720
You should push anything bad

679
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,420
into the days you've lived so far
and cut them away.

680
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,760
Isn't it superstitious?

681
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,160
Whether it is or not,

682
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,130
you should act like you fell for it
and try it.

683
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,370
(Happy birthday, Lee Soo)

684
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,340
Happy birthday.

685
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,770
When did you learn how to do this?

686
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,510
I taught myself. It hasn't been long.

687
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,440
You're good.

688
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,780
How do you know if I'm good?

689
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,280
You must be good if the receiver likes it.

690
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,050
I like this.

691
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,590
I made sure to celebrate your birthday.

692
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,330
You better not forget mine.

693
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,430
For your information,
my birthday is on May 23rd.

694
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,140
What are you doing on Christmas Eve?

695
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,110
Why?

696
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,940
(Why do you think? He wants to confess.)

697
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,710
How can he not confess after
asking you out on Christmas Eve?

698
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,080
How can he not confess
after acting so sweet?

699
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,750
A meaningless tenderness is a crime.

700
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,420
Even baby Jesus won't forgive that.

701
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,190
Gosh, he's not going to confess...

702
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,190
Then should I answer him right away?

703
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,930
Or should I ask him to give me some time?

704
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,130
No, don't say anything.

705
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,870
- Don't say what?
- Just act like you don't know.

706
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,140
No! Just do it another time.

707
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,540
(Date with Soo)

708
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,120
Perfect.

709
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,490
Hey, did you just see that guy?

710
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,790
- Did you see him?
- He's like a model.

711
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,000
- I wonder if he has a girlfriend
- I'm sure he does. Look at him.

712
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,310
Woo-yeon.

713
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,340
What?

714
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,180
(You couldn't focus on the movie.)

715
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:03,790
Me?

716
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,720
You were too busy looking at me.

717
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,690
I was not.

718
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,930
It's okay. That's the natural response.

719
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,530
I draw your gaze
even if you try to fight it.

720
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,760
I want to have a quiet life.

721
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,170
Why did my mom give birth to me like this?
It's such a bother.

722
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,370
Maybe I should really shoot.

723
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,940
What?

724
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,480
Are you in?

725
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
I'm in.

726
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,130
Hold this.

727
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,720
Step aside.

728
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,490
Hey. This isn't something
you can do well at--

729
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,470
Did you

730
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,710
serve in the army?

731
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:36,980
I surrender.

732
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,850
I'm going to win that teddy bear today.

733
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,890
(1040 points in shooting
or 6 points in archery)

734
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,710
Here. I'll give you one.

735
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,410
Aren't they both mine?
I paid for the game.

736
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,210
You didn't hit a single target.

737
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,550
How can a person be good at everything?

738
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,780
Even as is,
I have way too much going for me.

739
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,690
How could you say things like that
so nonchalantly?

740
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,020
I'm not wrong.

741
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,800
Merry Christmas.

742
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,870
They don't sell prizes no matter what.

743
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,610
How did you buy it?

744
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:41,040
I begged him. I said I needed
to tell the girl I like how I feel.

745
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,610
I'm so quick on my toes. I applaud myself.

746
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,090
Woo-yeon.

747
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,290
I have something to tell you.

748
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,330
What is it?

749
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,830
I wanted to tell you for a while.

750
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,770
Sorry it took me so long.

751
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,400
It's okay.

752
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,910
Go ahead.

753
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,810
Actually...

754
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,920
I'm leaving for the US tomorrow

755
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:23,820
to study.

756
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,460
What?

757
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,560
I can't celebrate

758
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,230
your birthday with you.

759
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,390
It's on the other side.

760
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,790
On the other side of Earth.

761
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,630
Let's go shopping.

762
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,430
Do you want anything?

763
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,300
A typhoon or a blizzard.

764
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,270
Bad turbulence
or deteriorating weather conditions.

765
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,910
So that planes can't take off.

766
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,810
If they can't take off today,
they'll take off tomorrow.

767
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,250
You can't lock down a plane.

768
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,790
You can't lock down a plane.
but you can lock down a person's heart.

769
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,830
If you want to say something,
say it before he leaves.

770
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,030
Or you'll regret it.

771
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,020
I'm sorry.

772
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:36,190
Woo-yeon.

773
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,170
What are you doing here?

774
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,400
I wanted to tell you something.

775
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,540
I felt like I'd regret it forever
if I didn't tell you,

776
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,310
and that it'll get me sick.

777
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,180
I thought about it all night long
after we split last night.

778
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,650
I didn't sleep a wink.
All I did was think.

779
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
But...

780
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,990
But I'm okay with it all.

781
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,260
I'm okay if you go
to the opposite side of Earth.

782
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,530
I don't care if there's a 12-hour
time difference.

783
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,630
I...

784
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,470
I can wait for you even if it takes years.

785
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,540
Do you...

786
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,110
I like you.

787
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,420
I liked you a lot.

788
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,060
I liked you

789
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,660
for a while.

790
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,400
Sorry. You're just a friend to me.

791
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,800
I'd like to remain

792
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,570
friends.

793
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,350
Woo-yeon.

794
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,020
Are you crying?

795
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,460
Of course not.

796
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,290
Good. I thought you were crying.

797
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Okay.

798
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,770
Let's stay friends.

799
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,710
Take care of yourself

800
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,750
and have a safe flight,

801
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,380
friend.

802
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,350
Thanks.

803
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,160
Take care of yourself too.

804
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,770
Bye.

821
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:58,150

(I'm good.)

823
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:03,320
(I'm good. What about you?)

824
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,790
(Including the fact that we're friends...)

825
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:10,430
Know what that is? He was like...

826
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,470
(April 2017)
Know what that is? He was like...

827
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,030
What are you talking about?

828
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,570
- It was me.
- Wait.

829
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,070
Really?

830
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,910
- Cheers.
- This is on the house.

831
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,270
Awesome.

832
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,680
How did you know I like salmon?

833
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,380
Is the building owner's daughter
buying again?

834
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,250
- Of course. I'm buying.
- Thank you.

835
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,380
Eat. I'll come back.

836

Cheers.

837
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,180
- Right?
- Totally.

838
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,420
They look alike.

839
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,450
Don't butt in.

840
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,590
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

841
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,260
Cheers.

842
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:40,230
I didn't finish.

843
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,130
Cheers.

844
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,100
Let's finish drinking and go.

845
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,200
Am I the last one?

846
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,810
- Me?
- Finish it.

847
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,250
(And the fact that I still like him.)

848
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,520
Why is the phone ringing?

849
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,630
What?

850
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,300
He picked up.

851
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,340
You picked up today.

852
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,390
Hi, Woo-yeon.

853
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,680
(I was still)

854
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,810
(walking with my long-standing curse.)

855
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,820
She's coming.

856
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:23,130
Kyung Woo-yeon.

857
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,010
What are you doing?

858
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,010
Hey! Stop. Hey.

859
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,850
What are you doing?

860
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,520
Stop it.

861
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,560
What are you doing?

862
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,160
Because you're ugly.

863
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,130
- What?
- I should only look at beautiful things.
