2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,220
Congratulations, son.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,830
Congratulations.

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,830
Thanks.

5
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,090
Our son looks so haggard.

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,090
Is something wrong?

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,260
I think they broke up.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,600
He cried.

9
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,700
What?

10
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,900
That punk cried?

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,870
What if I go see her?

12
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:03,939
Don't.

13
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,240
Don't you remember
when my mom went to see you?

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,680
Why are you bringing that up?

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,350
Exactly.

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,370
(At the End of the World,
Door Photography Exhibit)

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,110
Mr. Lee came again today.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,379
I know, right?

19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,280
The artists rarely come
every day of the exhibit.

20
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,200
(A flower that blooms from longing)

21
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,710
What brings you here?

22
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,920
Here. Would you
give it to Young-hee for me?

23
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,190
Tell her it's from you.

24
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,830
Vitamins?

25
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,630
Why don't you give them to her yourself?

26
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,830
If I do, she won't take them.

27
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,900
What does love mean to you?

28
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,240
- So suddenly?
- I'm curious.

29
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,280
I'd be hurt if I were you,

30
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,450
but you continue to love her
without getting tired.

31
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,220
I'm curious about what love means to you.

32
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,650
While thinking of how much
you can do for that person,

33
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,790
what you can sacrifice,

34
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,160
and what you can put on the line,

35
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,229
you feel as though you can do anything
if it's for that person.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm so jealous.

37
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,210
Of Young-hee?

38
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,310
Of both of you.

39
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,380
I'm jealous of you
for loving someone like that,

40
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,410
and I'm jealous of Young-hee
for receiving such love.

41
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,150
It's something that'll never happen to me.

42
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,290
If you already set it in stone like that,

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,260
you won't be able to receive love
no matter who it is

44
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,030
or what kind of love they give you.

45
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,500
Did you go to Soo's exhibit?

46
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,890
Why does he keep staring out the entrance?

47
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,760
He must be waiting.

48
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,240
Gosh. How could he print out
such a huge picture of himself?

49
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,810
I shouldn't have come.
I had to see such a picture.

50
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,220
(At the End of the World,
Door Photography Exhibit)

51
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,100
Yes, sweetie.

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,400
What is it again?
We just spoke on the phone.

53
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,130
Dinner?

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,770
Did You call because of that?

55
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,570
(- What makes people happy is so simple)
- All right.

56
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,740
(that it sometimes makes me feel hollow.)

57
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,510
(- Woo-yeon.)
- Why do you keep on calling me?

58
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,980
It's so nice to do this.

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,550
I'll fix them all.

60
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,650
I love you a lot.

61
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,890
I love you.

62
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,590
Good morning, my Woo-yeon.

63
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,290
Good morning, my Soo.

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Are you brushing your teeth?

65
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,360
I love you.

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,730
I love you too.

67
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I'll be there soon. Yes.

68
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,770
Gosh, I got it.

69
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,440
Let's go.

70
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,710
- Good work, Mr. Lee.
- Good work, Mr. Lee.

71
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,780
- Let's go.
- Are you going somewhere?

72
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,059
(I lost you because I couldn't
do those simple things,)

73
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,960
(and I'm regretting it for a long time.)

74
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,559
(How much longer will it last?)

75
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,670
(I can't even dare to guess.)

76
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:41,380
Son.

77
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,950
You should heat it up
and eat it one by one

78
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,620
instead of eating out.

79
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,620
Why did you make so much curry?

80
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,020
Curry is good for you.

81
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,330
It's anti-inflammatory,
and it's good for your immune system.

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,630
It's good for getting over
bad memories too.

83
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,170
I feel like what you really want to say
is the last one.

84
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,340
Did you catch that?

85
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,670
Did she come?

86
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,580
It looked like you were waiting for her.

87
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,910
She won't come.

88
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:18,150
You should go get her if she doesn't.

89
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,450
I can't.

90
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,320
Stop with the act.

91
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,430
Soo. Let's drop the act.

92
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,360
I know how she feels,

93
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,770
so I can't do that.

94
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,340
Also, they're not bad memories for me.

95

(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)

96
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,660
Why don't you try writing it thicker?

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,630
That's good.

98
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,140
(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)
- Take care.
- Thank you.

99
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,610
Let's go eat something.

100
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,490
Thank you.

101
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,530
It's nothing.

102
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,940
What brought you here?

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,010
I saw your postcard at Soo's place.

104
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,680
Your social media handle was on it,
so I went on it

105
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,240
and your workshop's address was there.

106
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,290
I came to give this to you.

107
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,890
I wanted to thank you for a long time.

108
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Ever since Soo was young,
he was always on his toes.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,730
He never cried or threw a tantrum.
Instead, he worked hard

110
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,570
to get on our good side.

111
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,640
When he was a little older,
he didn't do anything.

112
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,440
He just left.

113
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,980
That's why we thought we lost our child.

114
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,590
But Soo changed a lot
ever since he met you.

115
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,490
So I wanted to thank you.

116
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,890
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I can take this.

117
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,200
Actually, Soo and I broke up.

118
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,830
I know.

119
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,370
I came knowing that.

120
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,370
Things have changed,

121
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,570
but I'm still thankful.

122
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,080
It wasn't me. It's Soo who changed.

123
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,050
I didn't do anything.

124
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,680
People don't change.

125
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,020
But if someone changed,

126
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,460
and if that person changed
because of someone else,

127
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,230
it's something huge.

128
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,030
Thank you for showing up in Soo's life.

129
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,370
Do you think...

130
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,880
I really made Soo change?

131
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,480
Do you really think

132
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,550
I was something huge to Soo?

133
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,490
I liked him for a long time.

134
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,520
I liked him a lot.

135
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,790
But during that time,
I was always curious.

136
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,730
In the past, I wondered why
Soo didn't like me back.

137
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,070
After we broke up,

138
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,370
I wondered if he really

139
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,110
loved me.

140
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,420
It's not something for me to judge
since it's between you two,

141
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,960
but to me, it looked like it.

142
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,430
He looked like

143
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,390
he liked you a lot.

144
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,630
This is the biggest problem.

145
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,110
It's hard for me to believe.

146
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,880
Maybe I have some regrets.

147
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,820
Maybe I still like him.

148
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,260
And maybe

149
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,530
this is the end for good.

150
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,800
But?

151
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,310
You're sure you two loved each other,

152
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,250
but it feels like you had a crush.

153
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,750
Whenever you ask him to say "I love you",
he only drifts away.

154
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,860
When you're not on the same page,
things can go wrong.

155
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,360
I understand.

156
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,460
I understand it better than anyone.

157
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,070
As a woman,

158
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,200
I don't want to tell you to love him
despite all this,

159
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,140
but as a mother who feels sorry,

160
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,010
I want to ask you to try just once.

161
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,250
I'm sorry for saying this.

162
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,100
(At the End of the World,

163
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,940
For a photographer,
his perspective is everything.

164
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,380
(At the End of the World,
Door Photography Exhibit)

165
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,560
- I think it's going smoothly.
- Yes.

166
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,660
Please let me know
if anything bothers you.

167
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,170
Congratulations.

168
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,780
Woo-yeon won't come.

169
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,750
I know. I didn't even give her a ticket.

170
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,220
Then why are you waiting for her?

171
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,720
No reason.

172
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,430
Just in case.

173
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,630
Although I know the answer.

174
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm not on your side.
Acting pitiful won't work on me.

175
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,330
Did you know, Young-hee?

176
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,870
You're the only one who hates me now.

177
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,280
According to Jin-ju,
she says emotions can wear out.

178
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,380
That's why she doesn't hate me anymore.

179
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,780
If she feels that way,
it'd be even worse for Woo-yeon.

180
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,190
You sound like you want Woo-yeon
to hate you.

181
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,490
I wish Woo-yeon would at least hate me.

182
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,600
I wish she'd think of me
at least because she hates me.

183
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,700
Then you shouldn't have let her go.

184
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,700
Why are you clinging to her now?

185
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,370
You can't let go of Hyun-jae either.

186
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,340
That's how it seems.

187
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,810
You're right.

188
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,880
I'm in no place to say this
to someone else.

189
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,680
If you can't let him go,
you should go to him.

190
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,690
You both still have feelings
for each other.

191
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
Give them to her yourself.

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,470
If I do, she probably won't take them.

193
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,840
Whether she takes them or not,

194
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,840
you should see her face to face.

195
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,440
You need to hover around her
so that you're on her mind.

196
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,220
Young-hee.

197
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,440
Why are you here?

198
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Here.

199
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,410
What is it?

200
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,150
It's nothing much.
I got you some vitamins.

201
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,880
Why are you doing this?

202
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,519
Do you feel responsible, or is it pity?

203
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,330
If I was living well without you,

204
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,259
I bet you'd see a different woman

205
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,130
without even turning back.

206
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,870
That's possible.

207
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,009
But I would regret it not long after.

208
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,140
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

209
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,180
If what I think is love

210
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,050
feels like I'm being responsible
or pitying you,

211
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,920
I'll do even better

212
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,760
so it feels like love to you.

213
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,400
You were always good to me.

214
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,130
This didn't happen because
you weren't good enough.

215
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,040
Can't you just let me blame myself?

216
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,980
Can't you just blame me too?

217
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,520
Let's just say

218
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,920
we broke up because of me,

219
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,720
and now I'm a changed man.

220
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,630
Can't you just fall for it?

221
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,060
How could I do that

222
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,200
when it's not true?

223
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,470
I know it's all my fault.

224
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,210
Hyun-jae.

225
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,520
If you keep doing this,

226
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,120
it will be really difficult for me.

227
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,460
I'm doing this because I can't stand it.

228
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,460
I'm doing all this because of me.

229
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,600
It's not because I feel responsible
or because I pity you.

230
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm doing this because I still love you.

231
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,050
Young-hee.

232
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,120
I'll always be in the same place,

233
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,090
so don't forget that.

234
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,530
If you change your mind,

235
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,700
just reach out.

236
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,660
You're scaring me.

237
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,590
I'm already weak as it is.

238
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,800
Why do you want to go
to Soo's exhibit after eating?

239
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,740
I'll get indigestion.

240
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,070
Because you'll lose your appetite
if we go before eating.

241
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,370
That's true.

242
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,410
You said emotions can wear out.

243
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,680
Why do you still hate Soo?

244
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,280
I just said that.

245
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,580
I was only pretending.

246
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,290
You know, it makes people madder
when you don't pay attention to them.

247
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,660
I don't like someone
who made my friend cry.

248
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,060
I hate him.

249
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,130
I really don't get those two.

250
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,730
We should never be like them.

251
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,460
Of course not.
Just looking at you makes me happy.

252
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,470
Just hearing your voice makes me happy
all day long too.

253
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,340
Right. Did you book our shoot?

254
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,570
What shoot?

255
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,610
Our wedding pictures.

256
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,680
Didn't you book it?

257
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,150
Didn't you book it? I sent you the link.

258
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,190
Jin-ju.

259
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,930
Jin-ju.

260
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,130
I did it. I reserved it. It's finished.

261
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,270
Why didn't you do it until now?

262
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,700
I thought you sent me the link
after booking it.

263
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,010
Hey. I'm not getting married
by myself, am I?

264
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,140
I booked the hall, the dress,
and even your suit.

265
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,610
Why am I doing everything alone?

266
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,710
I mean...

267
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,580
It's because
you didn't like anything I chose.

268
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,590
I like everything you like,
so I left it to you to make things easy.

269
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,920
If you wanted to make things easy,
you should've picked something I like

270
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,360
instead of sending a link
that pops up at the very top.

271
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,030
You could've spent the time
to do some research.

272
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,530
I'm not mad about the booking.
I just hate how insincere you are.

273
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,630
"Insincere"? Even when I work until late,

274
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,040
I still make lunch and deliver it to you
so I can see your face.

275
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,840
- Is that insincere too?
- Why are you bringing that up?

276
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,340
It's the truth. You never talk about
anything I do well.

277
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,340
You just nitpick
if I make a single mistake.

278
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,450
"Nitpick"?

279
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,150
- That's not what I mean.
- Hey.

280
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,590
What I said is right,
and what you did is wrong.

281
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,690
You did wrong,
and I'm only pointing it out. Got it?

282
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,390
It's hard when you act so pushy.

283
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,060
"It's hard"?

284
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,300
I see.

285
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,070
I must be the villain.
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

286
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,540
The villain will go away, then.

287
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,770
Why are you talking like that?

288
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,740
No, I'll disappear for you.
I won't bother you anymore.

289
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,940
You had to work until late,
but I made you make lunch for me

290
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,140
when you didn't get enough sleep.
I'm so sorry.

291
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,850
- I'm sorry.
- Let me go.

292
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,650
Don't follow me. Don't call or text.

293
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,260
(Did you two fight again?)

294
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,130
Why do you fight so often?

295
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,600
I don't know. There are just
too many things to fight about.

296
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,900
We fight over something useless.
It's so annoying.

297
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,600
Break up.

298
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,540
- Guys are always like that.
- Break up with him.

299
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,040
- Come on.
- Hey.

300
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,210
- What did I do?
- Why do you keep telling her to break up?

301
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,710
I already have my date set.

302
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,410
No one fights in order to fix someone.
You fight in order to adapt.

303
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,050
Exactly. No one fits from the get-go.

304
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,850
Shouldn't you be perfect
if you're destined?

305
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,550
What kind of naive nonsense is that?

306
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,410
Are you from Disney?

307
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,850
I'm saying it should be the case
if it's destiny

308
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,890
and if Jin-ju and Sang-hyeok
are meant to be.

309
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,520
That fortune-teller said
they're destined to be together.

310
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,290
I paid the fortune-teller in advance
to say that.

311
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,900
We can't keep up with the mind
of an SNU grad.

312
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,330
You wise girl.

313
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,770
Is it okay to lie about something
so big in your life as marriage?

314
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,840
What if you end up meeting
the person you're really destined for?

315
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Does your destiny carry an ID
saying he's your destiny?

316
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,980
If I make him mine, he's my destiny.

317
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,950
Even if he were my destiny,
if I lose him, it's over.

318
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,190
What? Why? What is it?

319
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,360
Woo-yeon, breathe.

320
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,730
I almost fainted from the shock.

321
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,570
My gosh.
Who knew I'd hear this from Jin-ju?

322
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,300
It's the end of the world.

323
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,010
I guess it won't be over for you.

324
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,090
I'll be right back.

325
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,690
Come back.

326
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,520
Take your time and come back quickly.

327
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,510
What is it? Why are you here?

328
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,480
You said not to call
and not to follow you,

329
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,750
so I came to see you.

330
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,020
If you have something to say, say it.

331
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,660
It wasn't because I didn't care.

332
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,760
You have sophisticated taste,

333
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,000
and I didn't think I could match that.

334
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,500
That's why I thought I should
just go with what you choose,

335
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,910
and left it to you.

336
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,440
Because I like everything you like.

337
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,380
I'm sorry for making you feel that way.

338
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm really sorry.

339
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,190
I'm sorry too.

340
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,960
Sorry for being so pushy.

341
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,330
Don't cry.

342
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,660
Come here.

343
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,870
I'm sorry.

344
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,910
I'm sorrier.

345
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,740
I'm really sorry.

346

(the thickest suit of armor that you can.)

352
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,840
(Then it's one or the other.)

353
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,310
The armor will crush you,

354
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,480
or you'll take it off.

and if that person changed
because of someone else,

359
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,730
it's something huge.

360

(The self-portrait.)

369
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,840
My philosophy of not photographing things
I didn't love applied to myself as well.

370
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,650
So I had never taken a picture of myself.

371
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,450
When I think back,

372
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,650
I don't think I had ever loved myself.

373
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,690
I think I had the courage
to take that picture

374
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,290
because I was finally ready
to love myself.

382
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,860
The perspective of the photographer
is like a filter.

383
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,290

make you cry again?

390

You probably are not

399

Yes.

402

It's so annoying.

409
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,150
Will you say something?

410
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,220
Say you're pleased I'm here.

411
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,620
Or that I'm too late. Say something.

412
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,170
There's no way you're too late.

413
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,770
I never cared for anyone else.

414

I didn't think how hard
I was being on you.

419
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,460
I wallowed in my emotions
and resented you.

420

I'm so sorry.

421
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,480
I won't be able to leave
if we start apologizing for things.

We're both so immature.

What are you most uneasy about?

Couples break up for the same reasons.

430
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,540
We broke up once before.

431
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,040
There's no guarantee
it won't happen again.

432
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,280
I'll come back to you again.

433
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,110
Even if you push me away.

434
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,120
I'll stay close

435
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,190
until you're really, really sick of me.

436
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,520
Do you not want to go away now?

437
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,630
I will travel every now and then,

438
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,230
but I won't do anything
that requires a long time.

439
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,700
Am I holding you back?

440
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,070
I'm letting you.

441
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,070
I always wanted you to hold onto me.

442
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,240
Stay connected to me always.

443
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,540
I'll make you happy.

444
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,750
Even more than now?

445
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,810
Yes.

446
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,120
Wow, then will my cause of death
be happiness?

447
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,220
It was so hard not doing that,
but I had to just take it.

448
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Yes. This is a moment
when you can say you "just took it".

449
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,540
I just took it three years ago,
so you just take it from now on.

450
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,170
Well, that was...

451
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,910
You kept pushing me away
and I got annoyed.

452

What should I do with this little boy?

453
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,420
What about you? You always
confess your love before I leave.

454
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,720
So I can't let you go or cling to you.

455
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,490
I'm sorry.

456
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,130
I was immature.

457
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,800
Yes. So let's grow up together.

458
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,470
Kiss me if you agree.

459
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,790
Where are you going?

460
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,990
You weren't asleep?

461
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,590
I just woke up.

462
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,990
In case you left.

463
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,430
I'm not going anywhere. You can let go.

464
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,140
No. Let's sleep a little more.

465

Here's your curry.

466
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,920
Why do you have
so much curry in your freezer?

467
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,790
It's from my mom.

468
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,530
Do you get along with her now?

469
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,330
Kind of.

470
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,040

your mother came to see me.

472
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,340
Did she say something?

473
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,610
Nothing bad.

474
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,480
She gave me a drawing.

475
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,380
To thank me.

476
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,420
And she gave me the courage
to come back to you.

477
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,560
My mom did?

478

we got back together.

480
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,500
Okay.

481
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,670
Eat up. We have a busy day.

482

Are we going somewhere?

483
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,970

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,420
I thought about it and like you said,
we weren't even friends.

489
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,760
but that conviction,

490
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,490
that arrogance is what split us up.

491
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,900
I won't do that again.

492
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,000
Are you trying?

493
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,200
I said I would.

494
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,970
Let's try together.

495
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,240
Okay.

496
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,980
(19. Body part you're most confident about?)
Next, number 19.

497
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,680
"Which body part
are you most confident about?"

498
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,750
My face.

499
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,450
Okay.

500
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,520
Number 20.

501
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,820
"Which part of your face
are you most confident about?"

502
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,220
Must I choose one feature?

503
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,720
Just one?

504
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,860
Yes, you must pick just one.

505
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,600
That's way too hard.

506
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,830
Ears-eyes-mouth-nose?

507
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,400
(20. Facial feature
you're most confident about?)

508
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,940
Okay.

509
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,040
Number 42. "What do you do when drunk?"

510
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,150
I saw you drunk already.

511
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,550
Darn it.

512
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,350
Number 43. "What do you do
when you're in a good mood?"

513
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,120
I smile. Brightly.

514
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,090
No, you don't. You don't smile brightly.

515
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,360
Then how do I smile?

516
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,460
Prettily. Dazzlingly.

517
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,530
I got it correct.

518
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,570
Number 73.
"What's your most precious memory?"

519
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,740
Kyung Woo-yeon.

520
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,180
Number 74.

521
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,980
"Did you ever cry out of happiness?"

522
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,890
Not yet, but if I ever will,

523
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,820
it'll be because of Kyung Woo-yeon.

524
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,460
Number 75.

525
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,860
"Did you ever cry out of sadness?"

526
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,030
Not long ago.

527
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,830
That was also because of Kyung Woo-yeon.

528
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,870
I must really be stupid.

529
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I thought I really liked you a lot.

530
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,740
But I just realized that I like you

531
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,350
incredibly much.

532
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,820
I wouldn't have to be stupid
if it weren't for you.

533
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,230
Let's go on.

534
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,890
- Next question?
- Yes.

535
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,730
(My son)

536
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,140
Hi, son. What's the occasion?

537
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,270
(Just because.)

538
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,540
You just brightened up my day.

539
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,880
I'm seeing Woo-yeon.

540
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,980
Really? You got back with her?

541
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,680
Yes, I did.

542
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,120
Son. Are you happy now?

543
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,890
Yes.

544
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,020
(I'm sorry to you, Mom,)

545
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,130
but I'm happy for myself
for the first time.

546
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,260
Why are you apologizing?

547
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,830
I'm so happy.

548
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,570
I'm so grateful to your girlfriend.

549
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,840
Thank you, Mom.

550
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,010
For being on my side.

551
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,050
Bye.

552
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,760
Hey.

553
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,230
Have you eaten yet?

554
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,600
Shall we walk around the block again?

555
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,140
We already did seven times.

556
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,340
Darn it. Why is one block here so small?

557
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,150
Next time, let's take a longer road.

558
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,710
Then we'll have to go to Santiago
to walk one of those pilgrimages.

559
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,820
What shall we do tomorrow?

560
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,650
I have plans tomorrow.

561
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,060
With whom?

562
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,090
The CEO.

563
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,630
On Joon-soo?

564
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,560
Yes.

565
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,070
Is it work or personal?

566
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,940
I guess...

567
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,470
Somewhere in-between?

568
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,640
I did the calligraphy for a movie title

569
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,210
and Eunyu published the original novel.

570
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,680
He invited me to the preview.

571
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,450
If it's somewhere in-between,
focus on work.

572
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,420
Not anything else.

573
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,260
I won't.

574
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,430
You're cute when you're jealous.

575
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,030
Can I be jealous?

576
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,230
Why would you ask for permission?

577
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,440
That's something you do
in small amounts at certain timings.

578
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,440
You don't like it when I get jealous.

579
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,070
I never said that.

580
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,640
That's your dating type.

581
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,340
Ludus. The type that resents

582
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,950
- jealousy or obsessiveness...
- If you really like someone,

583
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,750
how can you date

584
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,050
without any of that?

585
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,790
You speak so sweetly too.

586
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,360
Really? They got back together?

587
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,270
That's really great.

588
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,170
It is. Isn't it great?

589
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,840
That fool.

590
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,570
Why won't he ever call me?

591
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,720
What? Do you have something to say?

592
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Last time, I said that

593
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,130
emotions are determined by the receiver.

594
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,560
Yes. You said that.

595
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,770
I thought about it and I think
that was too arrogant an idea.

596
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,740
Seeing the two
get back together made me think.

597
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,250
I think it would be okay to see you again.

598
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,420
What?

599
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,960
Do you still like movies?

600
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,630
Of course, I do.

601
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,700
Then instead of eating,
let's go to a movie.

602
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,600
You don't like movies.

603
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,270
I'll try to like them again.

604
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,920
Oh, dear.

605
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,980
That's hot.

606
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,960
(Han Cinema)

607
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,180
Did you enjoy the movie?

608
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,250
Yes, I did.

609
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,020
So...

610
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,750
I have something to say.

611
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,630
Let's not talk here.
Shall we sit down somewhere?

612
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,930
I think I know what you'll say.

613
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,940
I thought you'd say no to dinner.

614
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,210
I hear you got back together with him.

615
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,250
Yes.

616
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,090
Why do you like him?
He just makes you cry.

617
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,990
Just because.

618
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,230
It's okay to cry and feel hurt,

619
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,570
but I also like being with him.

620
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,870
I saw you break up once, so should I wait?

621
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,170
But then I saw you get back together,
so should I stop?

622
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,380
I'm not being clingy,
and I don't have regrets.

623
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,280
I'm saying you shouldn't cry.

624
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,190
Don't stand there with a sad face.

625
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,060
I won't do that now.

626
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,100
But don't put on a brave face
when you're suffering either.

627
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,200
It's always hard to pretend.

628
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,280
What I really want to say is,

629
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,280
be happy.

630
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,290
Even before I knew you were you,

631
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,860
I wanted the woman
on the phone to be happy.

632
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,900
You too.

633
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,970
I want you to be happy too.

634
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,780
I'll try.

635
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,740
Your boyfriend was mean to me once.

636
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,940
So I'll be mean as well.

637
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,750
Thank you

638
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,190
for bringing me
pretty words and pretty thoughts.

639
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,360
For making me see
what it's like to be loved.

640
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,930
And for warming my heart.

641
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,210
I'm sorry I was the only one who got warm.

642
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,160
I hugged you to get rid of my regret,

643
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,730
and I feel even worse now.

644
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,400
Go on home.

645
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,400
Before I want to stop you.

646
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,880
(We started dating again.)

647
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,400
Stop it.

648
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,540
Why won't you look at me? Come on.

649
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,200
Why won't you look at this handsome face?

650
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,810
My gosh. That's so embarrassing.

651
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,310
Hey.

652
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,520
Why? What?

653
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,820
Don't let me see your face.
I can't stay mad then.

654
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,150
How can you make jokes right now?

655
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,990
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

656
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,430
I can't just let it slide,
so let me say it to your back.

657
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,970
(We fought often.)

658
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,450
I'm here.

659
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,630
Do you like photography or me?

660
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,100
Naturally, you.

661
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,200
You're the best.

662
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,540
But you show up 30 minutes late
because of work?

663
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,710
I'm really sorry.

664
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,040
Freeze.

665
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,750
Hey. You have to unfreeze me.

666
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,160
I'm an idiot. Why did I fall for it again?

667
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,230
Hey. I froze you. Who said you could move?

668
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,430
I melted because I was so hot.

669
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,270
How are you hot on this chilly day?

670
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,540
It's always summer for me
because my heart is hot

671
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,900
for you.

672
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,840
Seriously.

673
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,680
Should we delete this memory?

674
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,690
What is it?

675
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,890
You forget the bitterness
if I give you something sweet.

676
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,290
Please forget.

677
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,140
It's sweet.

678
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,910
I'm being nice
only because this tastes good, okay?

679
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,410
Okay.

680
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,040
Shall we take a walk?

681
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,260
(Another word for "fight" is "dialogue".)

682
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,000
(By fighting often and making up often,)

683
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,460
(we adjusted to each other.)

684
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,770
We're back together.

685
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,610
We're dating again.

686
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,370
Why are you guys so melodramatic?

687
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
Are you the only ones in the world dating?

688
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,610
Awesome. Let's commemorate
all of us being back together,

689
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,180
and take a trip somewhere.

690
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,880
Let's go somewhere chill and relax.
How about Gangwon-do?

691
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,790
- Good, right? Everyone in?
- Sounds good.

692
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,990
Excuse me.

693
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,120
Some of us are broken up.

694
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,430
I'm fine with it.

695
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,360
If you're okay with it.

696
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,460
What's this?

697
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,170
I'll pay for the whole trip.

698
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
Which days work for you?

699
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,840
Nice. This is how powerful
a deep pocket is.

700
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:05,610
Okay, then. Let me play a song
to get us in the mood.

701
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,210
(Travel music)

702
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,960
("Travel to Me" playing)

703
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,190
You said it was a trip.

704
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,760
You said let's relax.

705
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,000
You weren't paying for the trip,

706
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,600
you were paying for labor.

707
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,830
A true capitalist.

708
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,500
Come on, people.
I wouldn't ask for this for free.

709
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,240
I have gifts for you all.

710
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,210
Gifts?

711
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,270
Yes.

712
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,280
- Nice.
- Looking good.

713
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,150
You said they were gifts.

714
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,620
Everything coming out of your mouths
is a lie.

715
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,160
Are you a fraud couple or something?

716
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,190
Hey. Do you know how much those cost?

717
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,960
Do you know what my hourly rate is?

718
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:02,960
Why you...

719
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,130
Do you think I won't fight
because I'm dressed all elegantly?

720
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,300
- Come at me. Let's fight.
- Stop it.

721
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,270
I'm holding back only for Woo-yeon.

722
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,470
Don't.

723
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,770
Fine, let's fight.

724
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,140
Okay, let's fight.

725
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,370
- Gosh.
- Come at me.

726
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,570
- Come at me.
- Come at me.

727
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,810
That's the real gift.

728
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,080
What's going on here?
Why do you look so pretty?

729
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,520
Stop that.

730
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,850
This is ridiculous.

731
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,590
I fell for you for the 3,840th time today.

732
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,690
Really?

733
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,070
You look pretty.

734
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,740
Thanks. You look nice too.

735
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,950
One, two, three.

736
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,050
Get closer.

737
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,250
One, two, three.

738
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,520
- How pretty.
- Nice.

739
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,620
Faster.

740
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,630
- How pretty.
- Faster.

741
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,830
Okay, two more.

742
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,600
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

743
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,130
- One, two, three.
- Give me that.

744
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,870
They're so pretty.

745
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,970
- What is this?
- Nice.

746
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,840
It's so pretty.

747
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,240
Come here.

748
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,510
- Why?
- Here.

749
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,340
- No.
- Just go.

750
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,750
- You look pretty.
- Smile.

751
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,910
Why are you so down? What's the problem?

752
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,520
Come on, smile.

753
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,050
- Smile.
- Smile!

754
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,520
- Okay.
- Don't smile like that.

755
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,020
One, two, three.

756
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,690
Sang-hyeok.

757
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,330
One, two, three.

758
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,170
Okay. One, two, three.

759
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,840
One, two, three.

760
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,670
Let's get closer.

761
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,510
One, two...

762
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,710
Stop.

763
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,240
Hey. You too?

764
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Give me that.

765
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,320
What?

766
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,190
Why, you little...

767
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,330
Can I kill him?

768
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,100
Well... Because every moment
is Woo-yeon to me.

769
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,470
Stop that.

770
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,240
Do it right, okay?

771
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,010
Let's do it again.

772
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,440
Okay?

773
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,890
When did this baby grow up,
that she's getting married?

774
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,590
We met when you were in high school,
and you're getting married?

775
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,530
You're still the Jin-ju in round glasses
studying English vocabulary to me.

776
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,130
I'm happy.

777
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,100
I'm sad, but you're happy?

778
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,770
I'm so sad I'm about to cry,
but you're happy?

779
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,570
Yes. I'm happy about getting married,
but more than that,

780
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,610
I'm happy that my friends
who knew how I was in high school

781
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,680
are celebrating with me.

782
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:42,550
That time we shared
makes me feel secure and happy.

783
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,080
Secure.

784
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,350
I'll kill you if you make Jin-ju cry.

785
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,370
Okay, everyone. Did you enjoy your dinner?

786
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,540
Yes.

787
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:58,180
So... I'd like to thank you all
for coming all this way in the cold.

788
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,480
Let's thank Han Jin-ju
for throwing us this party.

789
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,580
Applause, please.

790
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,120
You're the best!

791
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,720
We'll turn your support into
our stepping stone to happiness,

792
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,660
and will live happily together
until we're gray and old.

793
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,030
Please bring nice and fat envelopes
to the wedding...

794
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,000
Puppy Dog. That's enough.

795
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:55,100
You're still wearing the ring.

796
00:59:58,510 --> 00:59:59,510
Yes.

797
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,460
Hyun-jae.

798
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,560
I'm still ill-tempered, gloomy,

799
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,430
and will feel things you won't understand.

800
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,140
I'll still be poor,

801
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,740
so I'll have to work hard.

802
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,380
If you stay with me,

803
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,750
you'll have to work hard too.

804
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:44,220
I'll make you do housework.

805
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,650
You'll peel shrimp only for me.

806
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,760
If...

807
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,400
by chance...

808
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,300
the offer still stands...

809
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,310
Will you marry me?

810
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

811
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,190
Don't cry. I'll take it back if you do.

812
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,360
- I won't cry.
- Hey.

813
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,560
I won't cry.

814
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:40,970
I love you.

815
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,280
I love you too.

816
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,160
(Kyung Woo-yeon, Lee Soo)

817
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,670
- Hey, let go.
- Stop it.

818
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,110
Life is unpredictable.

819
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,250
They were broken up yesterday,
but they're back together today.

820
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,550
Kids who we thought would be
friends for life are getting married.

821
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,290
I don't know about other people's lives,

822
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,330
but I know what will happen in ours.

823
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,730
Hey!

824
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,660
Hey!

825
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,660
What will happen?

826
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,400
(Kyung Woo-yeon, Lee Soo)

827
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,570
(Kyung Woo-yeon's Soo)

828
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,680
We'll continue to be happy

829
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,150
since it's our destiny.

830
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,160
(This happiness)

831
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,560
(may be fleeting.)

832
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,700
(We may break up.)

833
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,070
(We may be happy forever.)

834
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,170
(We may break up
and get back together repeatedly.)

835
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,910
(The possibilities are endless,)

836
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,340
(so I can't be sure of anything.)

837
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,780
(I plan to love you completely today.)

838
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:36,450
(Our possibilities may be endless,)

839
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,150
(but I am confident.)

840
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,690
(Even if our timing is never right,)

841
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,520
(my possibilities)

842
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,360
(are all you.)

843
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,390
Soo.

844
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,430
Come here.

845
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,040
What's up?

846
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,340
(Love must have the courage
to become confident.)

847
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,380
(Then love won't be pushed around.)

848
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,120
(It will lead.)

849
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:27,890
(Thank you for watching
More Than Friends.)
