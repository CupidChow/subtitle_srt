1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,980
(Opportunities lost become regrets.)

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,050
(If there are no more opportunities
for me to lose,)

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,590
(I can just create them on my own.)

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,730
I'll be the one
in an unrequited love this time.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,670
Just as you liked me...

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,930
No. Much longer than that.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,070
I'll like you much more.

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,510
I'll act like you now.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,940
You act like me.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,250
Then, just as I liked you,

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,090
like me back.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
If this is our cycle,

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,200
I'll wait.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,070
You are still as arrogant.

15
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,110
You're always so confident

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,250
and do as you wish.

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm confident for you too.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,420
I have to be confident

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,720
so that I can catch you.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,140
Don't catch me.

21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,550
I said, don't catch me.

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,290
I didn't say what I just said

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,260
so I could go to you.
I said it to let you know I can't go back.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,689
It's already too late.

25
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,090
You'll only give me a headache
if you shake me up.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,070
I'll get going.

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,510
What should I do?

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,190
Someone who's late has no right.

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
It's nothing much.

30
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,100
It's nothing.

31
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,010
Why do I keep crying?

32
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,830
(The phone is turned off.)

33
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,570
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

34
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,940
(Kyung Woo-yeon)

35
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,250
You wouldn't pick up your phone.

36
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,890
I turned it off.

37
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,590
It's okay.

38
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,200
How could you be okay
about something like this?

39
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,570
Because you're Kyung Woo-yeon.

40
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,140
If you're angry, get mad at me.
If you're upset, say so.

41
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,440
You should show your emotions.

42
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,250
I feel more sorry when you act like this.

43
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,250
You'll get used to feeling sorry
and thankful.

44
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
When those feelings get dull,

45
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,760
maybe other feelings will become
clearer after that.

46
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,900
I'll try even harder.

47
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,430
How could you do better than now?

48
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,310
What are you looking for at this hour?

49
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,340
I couldn't sleep,
so I'm trying to make some tea.

50
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,080
Sit down. I'll make you some.

51
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,410
- I can do it.
- Sit down

52
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,810
and don't make trouble.

53
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,660
What is it?

54
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,430
Does it look like something happened?

55
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,130
You said you can't sleep.

56
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,870
You're drinking tea
in the middle of the night,

57
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,270
so I assume something's troubling you.

58
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,110
- Mom.
- Yes?

59
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,550
Will everything become okay

60
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,950
with time?

61
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,690
Will everything work out
if I put in the effort?

62
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,790
Do you mean with your work?

63
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,630
Work and heart, both.

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,260
Anything.

65
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,500
Efforts don't betray you.

66
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,140
Minus for a few exceptions.

67
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,980
=Episode 9: The Function of Efforts=

68
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,160
What are you thinking?

69
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,260
(I Pray)
"They're so good. I'm so jealous. I envy them."

70
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,930
Something one-dimensional.

71
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,260
Soon enough, someone else
will be standing at your spot

72
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,730
in front of your work.

73
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,500
That's something really distant
for me at the moment.

74
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,070
It won't be that far away.

75
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,180
Eunyu Publishing is really good
at making books.

76
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,550
They sell well too.

77
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:22,979
They're number one in the industry.

78
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,580
I'm hungry. Let's go to eat.

79
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,570
I love the weather today.

80
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,670
Then I'll be the weather today.

81
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,550
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,560
Are you okay?

83
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,810
Do you have a lot of work these days?

84
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,710
No. Why?

85
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,680
You look a little tired.

86
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,510
You look pale.

87
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,450
Could it be your liver?

88
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,850
Do I? Should I take some medicine?

89
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,290
My friend works at an amazing
pharmaceutical company.

90
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,030
This has boxthorn, oriental raisin,
East Asian stripe maple,

91
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,400
gardenia seeds, turmeric, kudzu,
and mugwort among others.

92
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,330
It has everything that's good
for the liver...

93
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,670
- Forget it.
- Why?

94
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,780
I feel like I'm trying to sell something
to you.

95
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,350
It's okay. You probably brought it
since it's good.

96
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,950
No, forget what I said.

97
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,920
I don't want to be mistaken
by the person I like.

98
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,400
The book is nearing its completion.

99
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,470
- Already?
- I've been working on and off,

100
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,510
so I just have to work on
the last shooting.

101
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,250
When I say I did it on and off,
I don't mean I did it half-heartedly.

102
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,680
I worked really hard,
so my wrist is hurting.

103
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,650
Look. I can't even hold up a fork.

104
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,520
I should let our insurance
cover your treatment.

105
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,560
Have you decided on the title?

106
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,260
Right.

107
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,400
I just realized
we forgot to come up with one.

108
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,730
Take your time.

109
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,170
I'm not the type of person who rushes
someone who hurt themselves while working.

110
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,070
(Woo-yeon)
(What should we call the book?)

111
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,280
You're reading.
Is it a book that you like?

112
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,840
Let's only talk about work.

113
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,350
Sure.

114
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,750
The final photos.

115
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,960
What about the title?
Did you think about it?

116
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,030
What about you?

117
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,230
"Seoul Becomes a Vacation"

118
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,070
I want to say that Seoul,

119
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,500
which is familiar,
can become a place for a trip.

120
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,870
Seoul is too pretty
to walk past and not notice.

121
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,610
Yes. Too pretty.

122
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,280
That's why I can't leave.

123
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,050
What about you?

124
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,690
Did you think of some titles?

125
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,360
"A Daily Occurrence For You,
a Trip For Me."

126
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,790
Seoul may be a daily thing for you,

127
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,260
but it was a trip for me.

128
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,630
I like that.

129
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,670
I'm thinking of adding
something like that in the text.

130
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,140
"The moment when the familiar seems new."

131
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,210
"A place where that newness
feels good. Seoul."

132
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,010
Why are you staring at me?

133
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,680
Why are you totally fine?

134
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,920
Do you want to be friends?

135
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
- What?
- Or

136
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,760
should I ask you to go out with me
although I don't like you

137
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,200
just because you like me?

138
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,570
Sounds familiar, right?

139
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,170
Feels even worse
hearing it said to you, right?

140
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,780
It does hurt, but I feel fine.

141
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,050
What can I do? I'm the one who said it.

142
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,280
I told you to act like me.

143
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,550
Do you want to be friends?

144
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,220
Or should I be someone
you kill time with?

145
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,290
It's an essay question,
not multiple choice.

146
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,730
You can hit me.
You can curse at me.

147
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,430
I'll do whatever you say.

148
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,770
Why are you forcing
your emotions on me?

149
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,670
Do whatever you want.

150
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,140
That's how this happened.

151
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,180
Because everything I did to you
was the wrong answer.

152
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,210
That's why I'm asking you.

153
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,120
What should I do?

154
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,560
What are you doing?

155
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,990
Unrequited love.

156
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,190
Thoughtfully.

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
I refuse it all.

158
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,270
Your thoughtfulness

159
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,640
and your promise to do whatever I say.

160
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,710
I don't want to be like you.

161
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,150
I like the title. Let's go with that.

162
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,780
We're done, so I'm out.

163
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,880
You won't take my calls, right?

164
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,790
Right.

165
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,220
You won't see me if I go to you, right?

166
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,830
I'll call the cops.

167
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,530
What about coincidences?

168
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,460
Are coincidences okay?

169
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,400
Since coincidences are by coincidence.

170
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,300
I don't care enough about you
to complain about coincidences.

171
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,290
I won't need a coincidence.

172
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,330
("The Harmless Person"
A Novel by Choi Eun-young)

173
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,230
Are you okay?

174
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,600
It's awkward.

175
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,800
Not that. About being dumped.

176
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,540
I didn't know what I felt. It happens.

177
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,140
I'm the jerk.

178
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,210
Hey!

179
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,010
How could you just end it
because you want to?

180
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,940
I won't be a jerk anymore,

181
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,310
so can't you give me a chance?

182
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,450
How...

183
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,149
How could an unrequited love change?

184
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,820
(You freak.)

185
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,230
(It's your dad. I'm hanging up.)

186
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,100
No wonder.
I was surprised that she picked up.

187
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,840
Were you dumped?

188
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,610
I wouldn't go out with you either.

189
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,610
Why not?

190
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,980
I thought he had multiple personalities.

191
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,280
He got mad, then begged,

192
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,280
then suddenly tried to persuade me
with reason...

193
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,350
Dad.

194
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,350
Is that why you came?

195
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,390
No.

196
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,490
I wanted to eat all together
before you left.

197
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,890
I wanted to say something too.

198
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,100
- I'm not going.
- You're not?

199
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,970
Why not? Because of her?

200
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,600
Not you too.

201
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,640
What did you want to say?

202
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,840
You get mad every time you see us, right?

203
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,780
Then get mad every time you see us.

204
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,410
As you said, it may be in the past,
but it did happen.

205
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,620
The wounds from back then,
the rage you still have inside...

206
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,950
Let them all go.

207
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,460
It wasn't that big a sin.

208
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
I know.

209
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,930
We're the ones who sinned.
Why are you the one paying for it?

210
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,530
I'm sorry

211
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,670
for just leaving you alone back then.

212
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,370
What has gotten into you?

213
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,540
I'm worried that you'll hurt others
as you were hurt.

214
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,050
I'm worried that you'll act cold and mean

215
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,180
in order to hide your scars.

216
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,790
I want our son to be happy.

217
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,680
You should get mad and curse at me

218
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,780
whenever you see me.

219
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,610
What?

220
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,850
Dump everything that's festering inside

221
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,220
on me.

222
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,890
What has gotten into you?

223
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,560
I don't want you to grow old
being mean to hide your scars.

224
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,130
I did a lot of wrong things to you.

225
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,170
Resent me and curse at me.

226
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,810
(Can't you do this little thing?)

227
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,280
(Am I stupid? Must you say it like that?)

228
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,950
(How should I say it then?)

229
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,390
(Must I do worry about
every little thing like this?)

230
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,590
(You used to tell me
not to lift a finger.)

231
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,390
(- Why are you getting annoyed?
- Because I'm annoyed!)

232
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,330
What if you do that too?

233
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,700
What?

234
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,170
Boyfriends who ran to the pharmacy
if their girlfriends got a little cut

235
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,740
turn into husbands who always get annoyed.

236
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,610
Do you think I'd do that?

237
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,280
No one is like that from the start.

238
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,150
Marriage starts off as a fairy tale
but turns into a story

239
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,680
about someone you know.

240
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,280
What's wrong with that?

241
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,550
Someone I know

242
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,560
peels his wife's shrimp for her
even when they're fighting.

243
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,730
The wife curses him out
and says she hates him,

244
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,960
but she picks out his clothes.

245
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,460
That's how they live.

246
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,070
I like that story.

247
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,530
I hope we end up the same.

248
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,140
I love you, Kim Young-hee.

249
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,510
How much?

250
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,980
As much as a house costs in Seoul.

251
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,620
That's way too much pressure.

252
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,460
(I'm the only one desperate for you.)

253
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,860
(You don't care for me.)

254
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,240
(It's rare for the one you like
to like you back.)

255
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,010
(She cut hurt him
without lifting a finger.)

256
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,010
(I didn't know what it meant
to love a person.)

257
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,850
(I lack the confidence and courage...)

258
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,250
(I opened the book
to learn more about you)

259
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,190
(and only discovered my wrongdoings.)

260
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,000
(Feelings I want to keep)

261
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,370
(Like how feelings you overlooked
suddenly show up...)

262
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,870
(Daily life to you...)

263
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,950
(Sang-hyeok) (You're invited to a new menu
tasting session on Wednesday.)

264
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,050
(Jin-ju, Young-hee, Hyun-jae)
(I'm busy.)

265
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,020
(Office workers don't make plans
on weekdays.)

266
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,590
(I'll go if Young-hee goes.)

267
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,290
(Why doesn't anyone want to come?)

268
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,290
(Woo-yeon)

269
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,760
(I'll go if I can.)

270
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,730
This is a coincidence.

271
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,000
She said coincidences are okay.

272
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,880
(Mom)

273
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,960
Shouldn't you be at work?

274
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,090
(I stepped out for a moment.)

275
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,590
(What time are you coming home?)

276
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,900
I'm going to be late today. Why?

277
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,900
No reason. I was just wondering
when you might come.

278
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,400
Do you have something to say?

279
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,200
(Of course not.)

280
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,710
All right. Don't be too late.

281
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,370
Okay.

282
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,360
- Gosh.
- What are all these?

283
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,660
This has boxthorn, oriental raisin,
East Asian stripe maple,

284
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,360
gardenia seeds, turmeric, kudzu,
and mugwort among others.

285
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,230
They're nutritional supplements
good for the liver.

286
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,870
What have you been up to these days?

287
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,470
Don't take them then. I was being nice.

288
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,870
Wait, wait. I'll take them.

289
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,440
Was this passed by Food and Drug Safety?

290
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,880
Honey, take them.

291
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,450
- I'm okay. Take them to your mother.
- No, you take them.

292
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,150
I have more in the car. Do you want more?

293
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,880
I think that would be nice.

294
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,720
I'll be right back.

295
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,060
What's with her?

296
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,270
- That looks good.
- Yes.

297
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,340
Hey. You look cool.

298
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,780
You're looking normal for a change.

299
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,720
Really? Guess where I am.

300
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm with my friends.

301
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,820
Did you eat?

302
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,330
Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

303
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,070
Do you mean my heart?

304
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,970
No, your heart's not burning.

305
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,370
Something else is burning.

306
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,610
Hey, the fire!

307
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,540
- Gosh.
- Watch out.

308
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,210
- Fire.
- What do we do?

309
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,110
- It's burning.
- What?

310
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,250
Open. Open the windows.

311
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,180
- Hurry.
- What happened?

312
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,250
Gosh, I almost died.

313
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,120
You were acting too frivolous.

314
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,690
No, I wasn't. I was looking cool.

315
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,030
We're tired office workers,
but you called us out on a weekday night

316
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,260
and you made us breathe in smoke.

317
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,430
Sorry.

318
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,400
Let it go, honey.
I'm sure he had good intentions.

319
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,970
What's the point when the result is this?

320
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,010
- You're a really bad girl.
- Don't speak casually to me!

321
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,280
You startled me.

322
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,650
By the way, where did Woo-yeon and Soo go?

323
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm at "Tonight".

324
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,690
Sang-hyeok asked us to come
and taste his new menu.

325
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,920
Are all of your friends there?

326
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,120
Yes.

327
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,730
I'm on my way to a public reading.

328
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,230
(Tonight)

329
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,370
(I figured I wouldn't be able
to contact you for a while,)

330
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,830
(so I wanted to hear your voice.)

331
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,700
I'll pick you up later. See you.

332
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,170
Okay.

333
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,020
Do you have something to say?

334
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,560
I have a lot to say.

335
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,890
But you won't give me the time for it.

336
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,700
Yes. I don't think there will be
any time today either.

337
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,270
I wondered why I was always
the wrong answer for you.

338
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,110
I get it now.

339
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,010
My best efforts are tormenting you.

340
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,890
Just because what happened is in the past
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

341
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,160
The bad memories must be clear to you,

342
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,190
but I acted like
nothing happened. I'm sorry.

343
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,370
I'm sorry I always joked around
and spoke so lightly.

344
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,170
I'm also sorry that all of my efforts

345
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,570
were so selfish.

346
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,880
I just felt like I should tell you,

347
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,850
although doing this might be selfish too.

348
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,090
Can't you just live a good life?

349
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,320
You said you'll do whatever I say, right?

350
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,560
Just live a good life.

351
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,800
Don't be trapped in the past,

352
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,170
and don't try to fix
what's been ruined already.

353
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,600
Don't bother clinging onto something
that won't work.

354
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,740
I'm going to lead a good life too.

355
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,780
I'll act like I am,

356
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,150
but I can't guarantee it.

357
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,380
I'll regret all the chances I lost.

358
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,150
I have too many regrets.

359
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,550
I'm not sure if I'll be able to act well.

360
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,360
But I'll still try to act like

361
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,390
I'm well and living a good life
in front of you,

362
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,130
so just assume that I'm fine

363
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,200
and that I'm living well.

364
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,440
Why are you staying outside?

365
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,710
No reason.

366
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,320
Should I lend you an ear, or should I
go back in and ignore everything?

367
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,230
Soo says he likes me.

368
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
If he said he likes you,

369
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,400
why are you sitting there
with a face like that?

370
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,840
What kind of face do I have on?

371
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,570
Like someone who saw the world fall apart.

372
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,750
Because I thought this would never happen.

373
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,220
It's something I desperately wanted
for a long time.

374
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,560
And not now?

375
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,820
I like Joon-soo.

376
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Yes.

377
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,860
I'm glad to hear that,

378
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,370
but why does that sound like
a spell to me?

379
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,970
"I like Joon-soo."
"Please make me like him."

380
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,940
That's what it sounds like to me.

381
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,710
Illnesses and feelings
will only grow bigger

382
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,580
if you cover them up.

383
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,360
- I got a discount too.
- Really?

384
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,530
- What? What about Soo?
- He left.

385
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,200
How can he leave without saying bye?

386
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,800
This is how he is.

387
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,040
He always comes and goes without a word.

388
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,710
He lives as he pleases.

389
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,950
Did something happen?

390
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,150
I'll tell you later.

391
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Can you hear me now?

392
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,380
We're in front of your place.

393
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,610
What are you doing here?

394
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,050
I told you I'd pick you up.

395
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,250
Don't you remember?

396
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,890
No.

397
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,490
I'm glad.

398
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,820
Why?

399
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,460
Because you'd be embarrassed
if you remember.

400
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,930
Did I do something?

401
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
You snored.

402
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,670
I'm joking.

403
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,570
It's late. Go inside and sleep.

404
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,110
You can snore all you want.

405
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,010
Come on...

406
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,710
You should drive home safely too.

407
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,520
I love you.

408
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,400
I love you, Woo-yeon.

409
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,710
Thank you for today.

410
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,840
- I'm almost there.
(- You're so selfish until the end.)

411
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,210
(Back then, and today too.)

412
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,410
You were selfish in every moment.

413
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,390
(Whether you like me or not...)

414
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,860
Whether you're going to wait for me
or not...

415
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,990
Whether you live a good life or not...

416
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,000
It's me, Young-hee.
She's too drunk right now...

417
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,410
(Joon-soo)

418
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,370
You're crazy.

419
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,140
Woo-yeon.

420
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,310
Gosh.

421
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,180
Mr. On.

422
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,820
Woo-yeon is a little drunk right now.

423
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,020
Hey, try and get up. Come on.

424
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,020
(Lee Soo)

425
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,490
I guess you're not confident.

426
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:58,010
(Eunyu Art Museum)

427
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,420
When is this exhibition on until?

428
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,320
Until the 17th of this month.

429
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,760
The calligraphy photo collection
is scheduled to publish next month, right?

430
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,060
Yes, that's right.

431
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,800
You haven't decided on
the publishing event yet, right?

432
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
No.

433
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:17,600
Great.

434
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,050
Thank you.

435
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,230
I hear you're dating these days.

436
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,930
How did you know?

437
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll see myself out.

438
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,400
Gosh, how did she find out?

439
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,810
Don't be too harsh on Sang-sik.
I asked him.

440
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,380
Good.

441
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,010
I was dying to boast anyway.

442
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,150
Are you not like that anymore?

443
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,180
What do you mean?

444
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,950
Do you still play it safe?

445
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,980
You used to stay a step behind

446
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,120
and waited until something you wanted
came to you,

447
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,990
or you just endured it all
in order to keep it.

448
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,820
You were like that.

449
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,430
I'm still like that in some ways,
but I also changed in other ways.

450
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,360
I'm not sure what the right way is.

451
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,370
It becomes more difficult
the more I'm desperate.

452
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,280
I think it's closed.

453
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,380
Is it okay to go in?

454
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,050
Do you know the name of this building?

455
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,560
"Eunyu Art Museum"...

456
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,130
I'm the CEO Eunyu Publishing, remember?

457
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,700
That's amazing.

458
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,300
You suddenly feel so distant.

459
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,700
Don't put it like that.

460
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,770
You should say,
"Gosh, my boyfriend is so rich."

461
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,470
"Which bag should I ask him to buy?"

462
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,170
I wish those were the thoughts
on your mind.

463
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,110
Then is our next date
happening at a department store?

464
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,580
What time should we go to tomorrow?

465
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
I was joking.

466
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,080
Why did we come here?

467
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,420
Before choosing a bag,
I want you to choose something else.

468
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,600
How long do you think it'll take
for you to wrap up the book?

469
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,440
Soon?

470
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,610
There won't be any issues in finishing it
for the publishing schedule.

471
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,370
That's good.

472
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,610
This is the best spot at this gallery.

473
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,350
What do you want hanging at this spot
next month?

474
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,090
Why are you asking me?

475
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,230
You should start thinking about it

476
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,460
because your work will be hanging here
next month.

477
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,970
We'll hold a calligraphy photo exhibition
as the publishing event.

478
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,310
From now on, if the path
you're taking is too rough,

479
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,740
I'll pave it for you.

480
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,410
If what you want is far away,

481
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,080
I'll bring it in front of you.

482
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,220
You can take it easy in front of me.

483
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,250
Am I Cinderella?

484
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Do you want to be Aladdin instead?
I'm your Genie.

485
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,330
I think Genie is much cooler
than a foolish prince

486
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,000
who can't even recognize the one he loves.

487
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,820
Yes, Young-hee.

488
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,160
Have you made wedding invitations before?

489
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,890
(People often order wedding invitations
in a bulk, so I haven't.)

490
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,860
I made a lot of postcards
and cards before.

491
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,630
Why? Is someone getting married?

492
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,670
(Six Months Till Wedding Day Check List)
What? No, I'm just curious.

493
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,870
I bet you and your boyfriend
had a huge fight.

494
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,710
With Joon-soo?

495
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,480
Why?

496
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,180
Did he not say anything?

497
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,450
You called your boyfriend drunk last night

498
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,720
thinking he's Soo.

499
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,320
What?

500
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,690
Is your boyfriend

501
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,160
(considerate or foolish?)

502
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,100
(How could he not say anything
after hearing everything?)

503
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,370
I'll call you back later.

504
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,440
(Okay.)

505
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,150
You should go in.

506
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,280
Don't you have anything to say to me?

507
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,090
No.

508
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,330
Okay. Thank you for driving me home.

509
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,060
Sleep tight.

510
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,660
You too.

511
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
(I want to like things that you like.)

512
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,170
I should match you.

513
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,670
It's okay. Because you're Kyung Woo-yeon.

514
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,210
Don't hold back.

515
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,280
If you ever fall short,
I'll make up the difference.

516
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,810
I'm your Genie.

517
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,180
(Will everything work out
if I put in the effort?)

518
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
(Efforts don't betray you.)

519
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,660
(Minus for a few exceptions.)

520
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,430
Like people's feelings
and sudden misfortune

521
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,060
can't be controlled by efforts.

522
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,430
Hello?

523
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,030
Let's meet tomorrow.

524
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,830
I need to tell you something.

525
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,570
Okay.

526
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,690
Are you looking for something
in particular?

527
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:03,030
Well... I want to propose to my boyfriend.

528
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,270
- Really?
- Yes.

529
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,470
- May I take a look at this?
- Sure.

530
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,480
(Efforts don't betray you.)

531
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,580
(However, there are things for which)

532
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,920
(effort is unnecessary.)

533
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,420
(Hapjun University Hospital)

534
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,430
(It's stomach cancer.)

535
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,970
(For example, unavoidable misfortune)

536
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,740
(or people's hearts.)

537
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,090
I could've gone to you.

538
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,660
I thought it was only right
that I come to you.

539
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,560
I ordered the coffee for you.

540
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,010
There are many reasons to like you.

541
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,380
But even if I recite
all those reasons again and again,

542
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,190
it won't turn into love for me.

543
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,260
Is it that you can't do it,
or that you can't do it for me?

544
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,770
It hurts very much.

545
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,580
It hurts more to admit it.

547
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,780
And it doesn't hurt if you keep it in?

548
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,120
Why do you never say anything?

549
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,450
Why do you always keep it in?

550
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,030
If I called you thinking it was
another guy, you should've gotten mad.

551
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,030
You should've resented me.

552
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,430
You should've scolded me.

553
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,400
How could I say that
when I feel like you'll leave me?

554
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,110
I knew you didn't love me.

555
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,940
I knew you weren't over him.
That's why I tried.

556
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,780
I thought that if I was patient

557
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,380
and kept it in, you'll love me.
So I waited.

558
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,790
Couldn't you have been
a little considerate of me?

559
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,320
You should've given me time to think.

560
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,660
Time to think about
things that were to come.

561
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,930
Why should you think about that?

562
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,400
Why upset yourself about the inevitable?

563
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,210
No matter how hard you try,
you're always nervous.

564
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,870
So you just take it again and again.

565
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,680
Eventually, you lose yourself.

566
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,180
That's a bad relationship.

567
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,920
So...

568
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,930
let's break up.

569
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,870
I'm sorry.

570
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,260
(The feeling of impotence brought by
the realization the efforts were in vain.)

571
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,330
(That feeling that wrecks a person)

572
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,570
(is the adverse effect of effort.)

573
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,900
Will you just take it again?
Although you have the right?

574
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,800
I'll try even harder.

575
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,870
How could you do better than now?

576
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,980
Why? Did Woo-yeon say she likes me again?

577
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,810
Why you...

578
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,250
You get only one punch.

579
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,960
I don't care if she likes you.
You can't have her.

580
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,690
Any other guy, but not you.

581
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,330
Who are you to decide that?
Who do you think you are?

582
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,700
Because you only made her cry
for ten years.

583
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,570
Because you have no idea
how precious her feelings are.

584
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,850
I do now.

585
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,960
That's why I'm going to like her
from now on!

586
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,560
Excuse me.

587
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,790
What do you think you're doing?

588
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,030
- Woo-yeon.
- Woo-yeon.

589
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,710
You're making my tears dry right up.

590
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,590
What are you, kids?

591
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,430
Your lip's all busted.

592
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,930
You said you've been sparring
for ten years.

593
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,630
How can you beat someone up like that?

594
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,100
Did a trained fighter hit a person?

595
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,740
This is assault. Maybe aggravated assault.

596
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,510
My dad's a lawyer.

597
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,320
I was wrong.

598
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,860
Hey, I'm hurt too.

599
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,900
I guess your lips are fine.

600
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,170
That's not fair.
You should treat us equally.

601
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,540
Have you got no shame?

602
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,710
Do you think you and Joon-soo are the same?

603
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,280
Do you? Seriously.

604
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,040
That hurts.

605
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,360
I want to stop with the bad relationships.

606
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,160
Relationships in which I always get hurt
or hurt the other person are

607
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,570
both harmful to me.

608
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,640
It's too hard. I can't take it.

609
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,710
That's why I can't go out
with either of you.

610
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,220
No.

611
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,280
I won't go out with either of you.

612
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,620
You can curse me out if you want.

613
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,120
You can resent me for being selfish.

614
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,870
I told you before, didn't I?

615
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:35,170
That my pain is my burden to bear.

616
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,380
Whether I cling onto you
or find an excuse to see you,

617
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,210
I will go to you.

618
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,190
I'll wait.

619
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,630
If you'll come to me, I'll wait quietly.

620
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,200
Do as you wish.

621
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,570
I don't care anymore.

622
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,340
I care the most about myself.

623
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,090
(One month later)

624
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,500
(Where the past and present can coexist.)

625
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,100
(We may be displaced,
but we still live on.)

626
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,700
(A daily occurrence for you,
a trip for me.)

627
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,900
(A feeling you want to protect.)

628
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:47,510
(Just like feelings that you were
unaware of suddenly surface.)

629
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:53,950
(Will You Marry Me?)

630
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,060
It's so pretty.

631
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,320
You got another one?

632
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,760
My book is being published soon.

633
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,700
So I got this for myself.

634
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
Gosh.

635
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,900
Let's succeed.

636
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,910
(Let's succeed, Kyung Woo-yeon.)

637
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,110
Awesome. This is great.

638
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,550
Aren't you going on dates anymore?

639
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,510
You're always working at home.

640
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,550
No, I'm not.

641
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,050
Did you break up with both of them?

642
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,720
I broke up with one of them,

643
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,390
and I never went out with the other.

644
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,060
I thought that love letter kid
said he'd wait. Did he give up already?

645
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,590
It was only a month.

646
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,160
I told him not to wait.

647
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,800
Did you go through my things?

648
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,070
That's why I told you to clean up
a little.

649
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,610
Do you want to eat, sleep, and work
in that pigsty?

650
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,510
Yes. I'm going to eat, sleep, work,
and die there.

651
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,280
The guys need to see her nasty temper
so that they can come to their senses.

652
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,350
Don't complain about Woo-yeon.

653
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,620
She's just like you when you were young.

(My emptiness made someone
ready to love me leave me.)

660
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,390
(I'm going to take a short trip.)

661
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,520
(I won't be going far. Just within Korea.)

662
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,140
(I can come whenever you call,)

663
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,770
(but I feel like I'll bug you
if I stay near you.)

664
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,860
(I said I'll wait, so I'll wait quietly.)

665
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,630
(You can call me if you get drunk.)

666
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,600
(Even better if you call
because you miss me.)

667
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,190
It has been a month,
but she didn't call once.

668
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,590
It's like it really is over.

669
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,280
(I opened the book
to learn more about you)

670
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,450
(and only discovered my wrongdoings.)

671
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,130
(I've brought the sentences)

672
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:41,740
(that you underlined with me as well.)

673
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,350
Sir. I've notified the photographer
and calligrapher

674
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,350
of the schedule for the photo book.

675
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,620
We gave the calligraphy
a lot of attention as well...

676
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,030
so that it isn't overshadowed
by the photos as instructed.

677
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,430
What are you so unhappy with?

678
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,570
I don't want to work with a foolish boss.

679
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,000
Bring me your resignation.
I'll process it right away.

680
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,540
Hey, you! Do you have no pride?

681
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,510
Do you really want to do all this
for an ex-girlfriend?

682
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,040
We didn't break up.

683
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,610
She told you it was over.
She won't answer your calls.

684
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,520
You can't even ask how she's doing.

685
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,780
That means you broke up.

686
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,020
When writers get stuck, they stop
or start over.

687
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,320
They take a break.

688
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,690
That's what this is.

689
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,960
If you start over,
it's not the same thing.

690
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,170
It's the same
if the intention is the same.

Whatever.

693
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:50,810
Bring this to Woo-yeon.

694
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,510
And bring back news about her?

695
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,480
You can't quit.

696
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,710
- Why not?
- You know me too well.

697
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,980
It's so frustrating, I can't breathe.

698
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,890
Mr. On said to bring this to you.

699
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,090
Thank you.

("A Daily Occurrence For You,

701
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,600
Did you get the text about the exhibit?

702
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:20,170
- Yes.
- You'll come, won't you?

703
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,740
Will Mr. On be there as well?

704
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,510
That's the point.

705
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,540
You should still come.

706
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,580
I should. It's work.

707
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,050
I'm shameless, aren't I?

708
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,250
As the editor, I appreciate your attitude.

709
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,230
But as Joon-soo's friend, I hate you.

710
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,300
He's a total wreck.

711
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:54,570
I know I shouldn't blame you.
My apologies.

712
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,470
Not at all.

713
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,270
I've done my part, so I'll go now.

714
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,540
I'll see you then.

717
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,540
Seeing them in an exhibit like this, I can see

718
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,340
how well the photos
and Ms. Kyung's calligraphy go together.

719
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,710
- They look good.
- You have a great eye.

(A feeling you want to protect.)

722
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,070
You look like you feel awkward.
Is it because it has been a month?

723
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,840
A little.

724
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,380
Congratulations on your first exhibit.

725
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,680
Thank you.

726
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,720
It took an entire month
to come up with an excuse.

727
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,690

(there are things that require)

735
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,690
(and don't require effort.)

736
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,230
(For example,)

737
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,100
(people's feelings.)

738
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,200
- Hello, Mr. Lee.
- Thank you for your hard work.

739

(Where will we be
once all the vain efforts)

(come to an end?)

741
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,770
(Why did you do that?)

742
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,840
Pardon? What?

743
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:48,910
(Why did you do that to Woo-yeon?)

744
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,680
Oh, that.

745
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,150
You never see things that are too close.

746
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,990
For example, you can't see
if you hold the mirror too close.

747
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,790
So imagine how close you are to yourself.

748
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,530
(Why did you do that to Woo-yeon?)
So imagine how close you are to yourself.

749
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,990
I misunderstood myself.

750
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,800
I cleared it up though.

751
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,800
(I think the ship has sailed.)

752
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,670
If Woo-yeon is a ship that has sailed,
I'll swim until it stops for me.

753
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,600
(A message for Woo-yeon?)

754
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,770
Woo-yeon. You're bound to come back to me.
