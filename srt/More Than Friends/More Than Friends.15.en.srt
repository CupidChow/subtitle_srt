(The fox jumped with all his might
to pick some grapes,)

00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,290
(but they were too high.)

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,430
(After jumping for a while,
the fox gave up on the grapes,)

(and turned away.)

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,570
("Those grapes are probably
too sour anyway.")

11
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,280
Hi,

12
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Woo-yeon.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,440
Do you want some tea?

14
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,110
How have you been?

15
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,879
(A heart meant for that one person)

16
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,690
(I cried every day,)

17
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,070
(and I couldn't even remember
to close my umbrella.)

18
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,370
But you ask...

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,570
how I've been.

20
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,210
Good.

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,520
I've been well.

22
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,930
You?

23
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,960
I see, you have.

24
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,170
I'm glad.

25
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,510
Time heals all wounds.

26
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,580
I've been busy.

27
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,490
I hardly ate or slept.

28
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,460
All I did was take pictures...

29
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,230
to come back to you.

30
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,640
I told you, time has passed.

31
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,490
It's too late.

32
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,190
Woo-yeon.

33
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,110
You're with a guest.

34
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,950
He's leaving.

35
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,650
If you're done...

36
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,850
No, I'm not.

37
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,290
With anything.

38
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,060
Then another time.

39
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,140
I have plans for tonight.

40
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,610
I'll call you.

43
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,280
Thank you.

44
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,680
I came to bring you this.

45
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,150
Did I come at a bad time?

46
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,320
No.

47
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,490
What is this?

48
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,230
Our company's merchandise
that you worked on.

49
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,230
They sent you a set.

50
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,440
I could've picked them up.

51
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,940
Thank you.

52
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,080
Should I lend you an ear,

53
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,880
or should I change the subject?

54
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,150
You seem down

55
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,350
and nervous.

56
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,090
You always

57
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,690
catch me.

58
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,400
I told you. We're alike, you and I.

59
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,730
Please change the subject.

60
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,540
Let me think of something else.

61
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,280
That movie that you worked on
was based on a book

62
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,150
owned by Eunyu.

63
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm going to the premier.

64
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Go with me
if you have no one else to go with.

65
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Okay.

66
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,590
Don't act like you're fine
in front of me if it's too hard.

67
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,530
You know I see right through you.

68
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Okay.

69
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,209
(Crossing the ocean between us)

70
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,880
(Your photography project finished
earlier than I expected.)

71
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,979
You didn't eat or sleep
while working on it.

72
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,750
Because I have to go back to Woo-yeon.

73
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,960
It's the first time your photographs
had a different goal.

74
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,490
It's the first time I regretted something
because of photography too.

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
Every day since I came here,

76
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,970
I regretted coming.
I should've stayed beside Woo-yeon.

77
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,370
I guess I'm regretting things again.

78
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,570
Why did you break up with Woo-yeon?

79
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,310
I thought we'd never break up

80
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,150
since it took a long time
for us to be together.

81
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,580
I'm used to being lonely
since I was always alone,

82
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,850
but it wouldn't be the same for Woo-yeon.

83
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,820
How can I beg her to stay
when she says it's too hard on her?

84
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,500
I thought you were selfish,
but you're stupid.

85
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,300
Once you let go, it's over.
Too much time has passed.

86
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,410
It's different for us.

87
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,550
We're different.

88
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,560

91
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,370

94
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,260
She's probably asleep, right?

95
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,400
What is it?

96
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,970
Ms. Kyung and I met today because of work.

97
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,340
Did you call to tell me that?

98
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,440
Yes.

99
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,480
There's nothing between us,
so don't get us wrong.

100
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,710
Why are you telling me this?

101
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,350
Because I don't want her
to be misunderstood because of me.

102
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,650
If I misunderstand,

103
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,620
wouldn't that give you a chance?

104
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,960
I don't want to catch a cheap chance.

105
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,270
I need...

106
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,340
to catch whatever I can.

107
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,020
(Hyun-jae.)

108
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,790
Yes. Go ahead.

109
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,690
You can take Young-hee.

110
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
Don't worry about me,
and take just Young-hee with you.

111
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,730
If you stay beside her,

112
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,270
I'll be able to close my eyes in peace.

113
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,610
You shouldn't close your eyes.

114
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,010
Young-hee is going to be really beautiful.
You should open them wide to see her.

115
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,620
We're going to have an American wedding,
so you have to wear a dress too.

116
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,790
What color would you like?

117
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,190
Pick me out something bold.

118
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,260
Something with a very low back.

119
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,270
Sure. I got it.

122
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,420
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,740
I'm sorry, Mother.

(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)

125
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,930
Woo-yeon, you should go on a blind date.

126
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,560
I know a prosecutor who is a great catch.

127
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,870
Forget it. I'm sick of dating.

128
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,970
What? You're sick of dating?

129
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,170
Are you still not over him yet?

130
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,140
Are you never going to date again?

131
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,610
Oh, right. Soo's back.

(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)

133
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,850
- Is he back in Korea?
- Did he call you?

134
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,250
He came here.

135
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,590
How are you okay?

136
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,420
Should I be crying my eyes out, then?

137
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,300
Work is the most important thing to me
right now,

138
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,230
and I don't want to fall in love again.

139
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,830
I don't want to waste my emotions
on stuff like that.

140
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,310
In just one year, the person to whom love
was the most important thing

141
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,880
is gone.

142
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,920
What are you doing just sitting here?

143
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,650
Let's go out.

144
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,480
I feel full and it's cool outside.
This is paradise.

145
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,790
It gets rid of all my trivial thoughts.

146
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,590
I'm happy since you two are happy.

147
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,420
It was worthwhile.

148
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,560
I'm thankful to both of you
for staying beside me.

149
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,170
I love you.

150
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,170
I love you too.

151
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,900
You make me cringe.

152
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,740
Why don't we just stop dating
and forget about getting married?

153
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,810
Should the three of us
live together forever?

154
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Sorry. I already have my date set.

155
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,480
My gosh. Are you going to be like this?

156
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,460
- Gosh.
- What's the matter with you?

157
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,290
- Here you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

- One more soju, please.
-  Okay.

- Okay.

- Sure.

What? Long time no see, brother.

164
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,750
You have a lot of customers now.

165
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,520
This is a hot place now.

166
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,850
Take a seat.

167
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,060
When did you come to Korea?

168
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,230
- Today.
- Then you should be resting.

169
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,430
Did you come straight to see me?

170
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,330
I didn't come straight here.
You're the third person I'm seeing.

171
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,100
Who did you see so fast?

172
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,400
Woo-yeon.

173
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
Did you see her?

174
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,670
Why are you being awkward?

175
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,880
You two broke up.

176
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,450
You probably went to see her
because you still have feelings for her.

177
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,850
If you're here to drink alone,

178
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,920
it probably didn't work out well.

179
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,850
You changed a lot in the meantime.

180
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,390
A year has gone by already.

181
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,090
Is a year a long time?

182
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,490
The time going by is one thing.

183
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,760
The situation has changed a lot too.

184
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm getting married.

185
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,910
What?

186
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,210
Hey, Kitty Cat.

187
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,050
Hey, Puppy Dog. Are you working hard?

188
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,620
I missed you so much
that I thought I might die.

189
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,250
How much?

190
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
Me too.

191
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,760
Did you hear the story
of how they got engaged?

192
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,590
Yes. I thought it was
a scene from a sitcom.

193
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,400
What do I do?

194
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,940
Puppy Dog, you look so cute today.

195
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,710
- How do I look? Do I look okay?
- Totally. You look so hot. I'm in love.

196
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,880
What happened to your finger?

197
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,480
Dong-sik did this.

198
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,250
Dong-sik should get scolded.

199
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,450
Don't do that.

200
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,050
He's the most powerful member
of our family.

201
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,890
He thinks everything is a chew toy
besides my mom.

202
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,590
My dad and my brothers are all scared.

203
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,760
I better get on Dong-sik's good side too.

204
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,560
Just don't let him see you.
That'll be the best.

205
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,530
Okay.

206
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,130
Let's go.

207
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,700
Okay. Let's go.

208
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,410
I know

209
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm not good enough for Jin-ju.

210
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,610
But

211
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,580
I

212
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,720
really

213
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,050
love Jin-ju.

214
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,590
Whatever I lack, I promise

215
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,490
to fill them as we live together.

216
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,730
It's not that you lack something.

217
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,570
You and Jin-ju aren't right
for each other.

218
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,370
By that, I mean one of you
will end up exhausted.

219
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,280
You'll likely become that person.

220
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,610
Mom.

221
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,950
I won't stop you two from dating.

222
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,450
But as for marriage...

223
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,190
What's with him today?

224
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,370
Gosh, my dear Dong-sik. You're so cute.

225
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,110
What's wrong? Gosh.

226
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,210
My goodness.

227
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,070
Dong-sik.

228
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,480
What?

229
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,720
(Sure, the dog is picky with people.)

230
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,650
(But is it normal to give them permission
to marry because the dog likes him?)

231
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,350
Her mom even went to a fortune-teller.

232
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,860
Apparently, they're a perfect match.

233
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,590
Wait just a little.

234
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,430
I'll be right there. Okay.

235
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,370
Gosh. How sweet.

236
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,330
Vomit.

237
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,800
Vomit.

238
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,440
What do you want to drink?

239
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,640
Black sugar milk tea.

240
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,380
- We'll get two black sugar milk teas.
- Okay.

241
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,310
- Please charge this card.
- Okay.

242
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,520
It's sweet. Drinking something sweet
makes me feel good.

243
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,090
Sugar is the best when things are tough.

244
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,990
Are things tough for me?

245
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,590
Why are you giving me sweets?

246
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,000
In case you're low on sugar.

247
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,900
Pretending to be something you're not
is the hardest.

248
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,900
Are you talking about yourself?

249
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Yes.

250
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,640
Are you going home?

251
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,810
No. I'm stopping by the hospital first.

252
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,550
How's your mother doing?

253
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,780
She's the same.

254
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,890
Didn't Woo-yeon talk about me?

255
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,530
No.

256
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,670
Is it really over for her?

257
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,140
Why do you two make dating so difficult?

258
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,840
Why is it always so hard?

259
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,740
Both of you are too considerate,
which ends up hurting the other person.

260
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,950
I was always alone,

261
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,320
so I don't know how to treat other people.

262
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I didn't even know that was a fault.

263
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,730
You normally don't talk about this stuff.

264
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,770
I keep regretting things.

265
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,640
I think I ruined our relationship.

266
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,470
And despite that,

267
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,710
I don't know how to turn it back.

268
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,540
I feel lost.

269
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,520
Gosh. You and Woo-yeon are the same.

270
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,490
You're both so foolish.

271
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,770
Why are you watching me? It's unsightly.

272
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,780
Are you going to make me remember
only what your back looks like?

273
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,090
Don't even remember my back.

274
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,790
Don't remember anything.

275
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,770
The backside is always sadder.

276
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,940
And I made you

277
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,880
see that backside

278
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,050
too many times.

279
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,760
Exactly.

280
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,690
Show me your face.

281
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,560
I don't want to forget your face.

282
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm going to sleep. Leave.

283
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,730
Puppy Dog.

284
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,660
You're here.

285
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,960
- Did you have fun?
- Yes. How was work?

286
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,100
Good.

287
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,170
You're here too.

288
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,370
Aren't you going to ask me why I'm here?

289
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Why should I?
You must be at a bar to drink.

290
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,410
You must be at your friend's bar
to see your friend.

291
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,580
What is this?
I thought you'd yell at me to go away.

292
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,720
There's no need.

293
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,350
I don't hate you anymore. I really don't.

294
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Why not?

295
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,860
Emotions can wear out.

296
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,960
I hated you so much
that I don't feel anything anymore.

297
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,230
Now I just assume
you're someone like that.

298
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,700
You'll start to hate me again.

299
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,200
I saw Woo-yeon today.

300
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,300
I intend on asking her to come back to me.

301
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,540
Go ahead,

302
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,680
but I have no direct connections to you.

303
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,050
All of my emotions towards you
were built through her.

304
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,250
I was only a bystander,
and this is how I feel.

305
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,850
Wouldn't Woo-yeon's emotions
be even more worn out than mine?

306
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,860
She said she'll call me.

307
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,160
She said she would,

308
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,100
so she will.

309
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,580
Are you back in Korea for good now?

310
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,110
Maybe.

311
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,150
Are you going to leave again?
You'll make your girlfriend upset.

312
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,250
Why didn't you bring your girlfriend
with you today?

313
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,360
I want to buy her a meal.

314
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,030
Next time.

315
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,600
It's mine.

316
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,410
Yes, sir.

317
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,910
Soo.

318
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,150
Did something happen?

319
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,390
No.

320
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,760
If something happened...
If you feel troubled or lonely,

321
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,660
won't you tell me?

322
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,730
Parents are people you can always rely on.

323
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,970
We were never able to tell you,

324
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,370
so I thought you might not know.

325
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,450
I'll tell you if anything happens.

326
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,090
(It looks like)

327
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,460
something happened between Soo
and his girlfriend, doesn't it?

328
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,500
Did they break up?

329
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,070
Then again, who would put up with a guy
who makes her lonely?

330
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,140
Did you just diss me?

331
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,550
Why? Did that strike a chord?

332
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,990
I thought he took after me,
but he takes after you.

333
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,020
- I'm so upset.
- Why are you blaming me?

334
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,360
Never mind. We made him that way.

335
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,070
Just blame me.

336
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,300
I'm the root cause.

337
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,410
What?

338
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,750
Did I mess up again?

339
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,510
I'm amused because you keep growing up.

340
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,620
Was that a compliment?

341
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,850
It was.

342
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,260
We were planning to only display

343
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,300
the nature scenes
from World Airlines' departure points,

344
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,930
but we didn't want to miss
your first portraits.

345
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,170
(Open PDF file)
That's why things got much bigger than anticipated.

346
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,410
I see.

347
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,940
(World Space Gallery Portrait Exhibit Adjustments)

348
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
(Import image)

349
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,850
(Copy, paste)

350
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,420
(Important)

351

(Save as PDF)

352
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,390
I sent you the revised layout.

353
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,230
The photo that I attached
is very important.

354
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,490
Let's display it by itself.

355
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,930
Yes, sir.

356
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,730
Anyway, how did you take
so many pictures in a year?

357
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,000
It's like you didn't even sleep.

358
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,770
I didn't sleep.

359
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,570
So that I could come back.

360
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,370
I see.

361
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,410
Hello.

362
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,850
She'll be conducting the interview
to be included

363
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,180
in our pamphlet.

364
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,950
Hello. I'm Yoon Da-un.

365
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,550
Hello, I'm Lee Soo.

366
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,830
The title of the exhibit
is "The Door at the End of the World."

367
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,890
Is there a special reason for that?

368
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,430
I appreciated that the world was round
during my trip

369
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,630
because whereas nations have borders,
the world does not.

370
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,070
A new world opens, that's all.

371
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,610
Whether it's the door to a plane
or airport,

372
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,180
you must open the door
to reach the new world.

373
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,310
I think people are the same.

374
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,480
(They say every person
possesses their own world.)

375
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,020
(So if a person enters yours,)

376
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,160
(it means an entire world is entering.)

377
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,000
(If I open my heart,
I can see a whole new world.)

378
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,240
(It was an unexpected discovery.)

379
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,440
(I think the title encompasses
both subjects, landscape and people.)

380
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,410
You're more famous
as a landscape photographer,

381
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,580
but there were many photos of people
in this exhibit.

382
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,590
Is there a special reason why
you took pictures of people?

383
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,330
I had never looked at anyone
with love before.

384
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,400
Generally, I tend to be very cold,

385
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,960
but it was also my belief
that things like love

386
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,400
were but a mirage, which lasts briefly,
then disappears.

387
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,310
However, that belief was shattered
because of someone.

388
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,040
Most of the people in the exhibit
are people in love.

389
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,150
Only recently did I realize
that people and their love

390
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,150
were lovely.

391
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,290
Which is your favorite photograph
among all that you've taken?

392
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,690
The self-portrait.

393
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,590
My philosophy of not photographing
things I didn't love

394
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,090
applied to myself as well.

395
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,800
So I had never taken a picture of myself.

396
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,670
When I think back,

397
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,870
I don't think I had ever loved myself.

398
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,740
I think I had the courage
to take that picture

399
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,540
because I was finally ready
to love myself.

400
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,430
As I lay here,

401
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,610
I tried to remember just one time
I was good to you,

402
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,880
but I couldn't.

403
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,950
At least you won't cry for too long
since I wasn't a good mom.

404
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,420
I'm glad.

405
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,220
Don't talk, Mom.

406
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,390
It's too hard for you.

407
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,730
I...

408
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,470
never received love from my own mom,

409
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,640
so I couldn't love you properly.
I'm sorry.

410
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,980
I said to stop talking.

411
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,120
My daughter.

412
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,920
Yes?

413
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,950
My pretty daughter.

414
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,220
Yes?

415
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,430
Don't cry.

416
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,260
I'm sorry for making you
be born as my daughter.

417
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,700
I will...

418
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,340
stop being your mom now.

419
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,300
In your next life, don't...

420
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,420
Don't be born as my daughter.

421
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,860
Be born to a good mom

422
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,230
and receive lots of love,

423
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,200
and throw tantrums as much as you want.

424
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,630
Be a spoiled brat

425
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,710
with good parents.

426
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,210
I was too ashamed to tell you, but...

427
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,820
I love you,

428
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,420
my baby.

429
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,790
I love you too, Mom.

430
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,060
I love you.

431
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,570
Is Cheol Soo not coming?

432
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,510
I wish I could see him before I go.

433
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,310
Mom.

434
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,820
Please don't go.

435
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,850
Please stay with me.

436
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,730
You never did anything I ever asked.

437
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,160
Mom.

438
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,000
I won't stop you for long.

439
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:54,040
Please stay just a little while longer.

440
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,110
Please?

441
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,220
I'm sorry, my baby.

442
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,420
Mom.

443
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,700
I'm good now.

444
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,540
Mom.

445
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,980
Mom.

446
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,780
Mom.

447
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,390
Mom.

448
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,460
Mom.

449
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,560
(Rest in Peace)

450
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,750
Hey.

451
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,220
Thanks for coming.

452
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,050
Don't act strong.

453
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,950
Yes, don't act strong.

454
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,560
Watch how you talk to your elder.

455
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,800
Cry.

456
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,670
We'll cover you, so cry.

457
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,600
We'll hold you, so just cry.

458
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,340
You don't have to wear
mourning clothes too.

459
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,750
I'm an only child
and don't have an older sister.

460
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,020
Pretend you have a younger sister.

461
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,150
I only have two older brothers
and not an older sister.

462
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,660
You have another younger sister.

463
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,460
I feel so reassured.

464
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,700
Mom would be

465
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,400
so pleased to see you.

466
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,780
(Rest in Peace)

467
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,620
It's okay to cry, Young-hee.

468
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,690
Will crying change anything?

469
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,430
It will if you don't cry.

470
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
If you keep your tears in,

471
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,770
it'll dampen your spirits.

472
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,310
And once you get too wet,

473
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,140
you'll sink alone.

474
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,150
So it's okay to cry, Young-hee.

475
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,820
You won't crumble even if you do.

476
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,010
If you crumble,

477
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,510
I will hold you up.

478
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,420
You can lean on me.

479
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,020
As a friend is fine.

480
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,260
Or if not, consider me a chair, a rock,

481
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,990
or a tree.

482
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,930
Anything you can lean on.
Consider me something like that.

483
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,770
(Was it because I was used to
seeing my mom's back?)

484
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,840
(Or was it like she said,)

485
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,610
(and that she wasn't a good mom?)

486
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,510
(I seemed to be getting over)

487
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,550
(my mom's death pretty easily.)

488
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,850
(Closed)

489
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,520
Forget it. Pour me a drink.

490
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,160
I need liquid courage to say
something so cringe-worthy.

491
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,670
Your existence alone comforts me.

492
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,620
I thought that

493
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,920
I'd crumble if I cried.

494
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,490
I thought leaning on others
would make me feel small.

495
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,990
But I didn't crumble even when I cried.

496
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,200
Because you were there to hold me up.

497
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,730
I leaned on you as much as I wanted

498
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,040
and I didn't feel small at all.

499
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,800
I knew that you wouldn't
shed tears so easily.

500
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,010
I never held you up.

501
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,040
Why should I take shared credit
for what they did?

502
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,610
That would be shameless of me.

503
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,620
I can't take credit,
so I'll just fill your glass.

504
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,350
You're cute, punk.

505
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,120
Don't abuse it. I'm not your waiter.

506
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,120
Don't worry.
I hate you and very much at that.

507
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,660
Hate me at least.

508
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,630
Just don't pretend I don't exist.

509
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,480
Shall we clink glasses?

510
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,980
Okay.

511
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,780
Ready? Kim Young-hee, be happy.

512
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,150
- Be happy!
- Be happy.

513
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,190
- Be happy!
- We love you.

514
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,820
Since when?

515
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,430
Hi, Mom.

516
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,030
I'm at Tonight with the guys.

517
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,870
Yes.

518
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,800
She looks okay.

519
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,380
Okay, then. I'll see you soon, sir.

520
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,450
Bye.

521
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,480
Hey.

522
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,720
If you talk to your mom,

523
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,490
do you think I'll cry and go, "Mommy"?

524
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,220
I dislike that even more.

525
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,260
I'm sorry.

526
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,460
Why are you always apologizing?

527
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,430
Are you Hyun-jae?

528
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,240
I didn't think you'd invite him too.

529
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,470
I owe him a lot, and I'm very grateful.

530
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,880
Anyway, do you feel uncomfortable
because I invited Soo?

531
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,380
It's fine. He's your guest.

532
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,320
What'll you do about him now?

533
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,960
He still seems to have
lots of feelings for you.

534
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,690
He wouldn't stop looking at you.

535
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,130
I don't want to whine at you
even on a day like this.

536
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,170
Please whine at me, will you?

537
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,040
I really need an excuse
to think about something else.

538
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,280
So what? What'll you do about Soo?

539
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,060
I didn't throw out anything he gave me.

540
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,430
I look at them
and keep thinking of what we did.

541
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,870
The bad memories, the hurtful feelings.

542
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,810
The days I cried.

543
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,210
Must you do that?

544
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,810
They say that fear comes from memories.

545
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,250
That fear is what keeps me wary.

546
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,320
I must be wary.

547
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,830
It's like armor.

548
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,460
Well...

549
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,700
I guess it is.

550
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,000
Am I pathetic?

551
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,670
Who can say that when it's your life?

552
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,310
Find and put on

553
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,520
the thickest suit of armor that you can.

554
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,820
Then it's one or the other.

555
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
The armor will crush you,

556
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,320
or you'll take it off.

557
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,730
I'm glad to see that Young-hee seems okay.

558
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,900
I'm not sure if she's really okay,

559
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,170
or if she's just pretending to be okay,

560
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,670
but it was good to see her smile.

561
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:03,970
Yes.

562
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,150
What's up with Soo and Woo-yeon anyway?

563
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,060
Thanks for taking me home.

564
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,000
Get home safely.

565
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,230
Woo-yeon.

566
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:36,970
Yes?

567
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,140
We have some talking to do.

568
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,920
Yes.

569
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,990
Let's wrap it up today.

570
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,930
I was hoping to start.

571
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,460
But you ended it.

572
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,400
The only thing we can start
is a friendship.

573
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,970
Is that what you want?

574
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,340
I can't be friends with you.

575
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,210
Not anymore.

576
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,450
Then we'll have no reason to meet again.

577
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,620
I really hate myself for doing this.

578
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,260
But you owe me a wish.

579
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,200
Do you want to bet?

580
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,400
The one who asks to break up
has to grant the other a wish.

581
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,940
Okay, I'll keep my word.

582
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,580
What do you want me to do?

583
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,490
For just one day,

584
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,430
can we go back to before we broke up?

585
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,870
Okay.

586
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,770
What's the point of all that
when we're breaking up?

587
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,870
That's why we shouldn't break up.

588
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:22,640
Okay.

589
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,340
You liar.

590
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,180
You said we shouldn't break up.

591
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,740
You're here early.

592
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,910
Yes. I got ready early.

593
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,770
Do you not like that?
Shall I order you something else?

594
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,500
It's tasty.

595
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,860
(Late Night Snack Cart)

596
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,360
You should've waited until
the noodles came out.

597
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,260
Why are you downing soju
after being away so long?

598
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,400
I feel like drinking today.

599
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,830
You evil brat.

600
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,130
How could you stop coming
just because you broke up?

601
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,840
You broke up with him, not with me.

602
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,900
How did you find out?

603
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,440
Hyun-jae comes by sometimes.

604
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,980
My gosh. Just when I mentioned you.

605
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,230
(Late Night Snack Cart)

606
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,770
My glass is empty too.

607
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,620
You should've taken that off long ago.

608
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,720
Young-hee.

609
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,920
I'm still the same.

610
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,330
I haven't changed.

611
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Yes.

612
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,400
You're right.

613
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,440
Nothing has changed.

614
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,780
I'm still miserable.

615
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,510
And

616
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,220
I still don't want to share my misery
with you.

617
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,690
You know

618
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,500
how you told me to get out of your misery?

619
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,300
Do you know where I'm living now
after being kicked out?

620
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,180
I'm living within my misery.

621
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,250
Can't you

622
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,320
let me back into your misery?

623
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,360
My misery...

624
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,030
hurts way too much.

625
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,230
Consider me your cart.

626
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,770
Why do you keep trying to do so much?

627
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,710
Because I want to do anything I can.

628
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,050
Hop on.

629
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,060
- Hurry back.
- Okay.

630
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,760
(Mom constantly walked away from me,)

631
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,630
(so all I remembered)

632
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,470
(was her back.)

633
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,170
If you're poor, at least be nice.

634
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,850
It's the worst.

635
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,160
(I thought she was turning her back to me
to shun me.)

636
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,430
(I realized over time,)

637
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,670
(that it was to feed her child
a little more.)

638
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,370
I'm going to sleep.

639
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,710
(To cry alone.)

640
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,750
(To hurt alone.
Her back was actually the face of a mom.)

641
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,190
What should I bring you on my way home?

642
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,360
Cookies.

643
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,890
Okay. I'll finish work quickly

644
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,430
and buy you cookies.

645
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,130
Come home quickly.

646
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,470
Okay.

647
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,660
(Late Night Snack Cart)

648
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,930
You're showing me your back
in order to carry me.

649
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,030
I'm having an exhibit this Saturday.

650
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,300
Will you come?

651
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,420
Soo.

652
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,950
Let's drop the act.

653
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,660
It's over between us.

654
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,160
Can't we

655
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,570
start over?

656
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,210
I'm not someone you can drop and pick up
whenever you feel like it.

657
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:19,540
You're the one who dropped me.

658
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,240
Did I really?

659
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,620
You called multiple times a day,
then it became once morning and night.

660
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,920
Then once a day.

661
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,720
Some days, we only exchanged
brief messages.

662
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,190
You're the one who changed.

663
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,560
There was the time difference.

664
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,430
If I called right before falling asleep
after working all day,

665
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,500
you'd be busy working.

666
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,970
If I woke up in the morning,
you were ready for bed.

667
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,940
It was only natural that I called less
as the time difference grew.

668
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,940
You said you were okay with it.

669
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,080
You said

670
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,410
you understood.

671
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:04,620
I had to understand, to feel less pathetic
because of your indifference.

672
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,730
I understood in order to be loved,

673
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,160
but you kept growing
more and more distant.

674
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,630
You agreed and simply let go
when I said let's break up.

675
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,370
How could I stop you?

676
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,670
It wasn't like I could fly back.

677
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,540
You said it was too hard for you.

678
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,680
How could I stop you?

679
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,050
You should've told me then

680
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,390
to try harder.

681
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,450
You should've said all this back then.

682
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:49,930
Soo.

683
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,530
I was insecure
the entire time I was with you.

684
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,410
I wondered whether you truly liked me.

685
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,510
Maybe I mistook fleeting jealousy
for love.

686
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,050
Someone who's insecure...

687
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,290
can't say what's in their heart.

688
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,130
For fear of losing the other person.

689
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,170
You always doubt me and think by yourself.

690
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,110
You love alone and break up alone.

691
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,120
I thought we loved each other,

692
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,920
but it was always an unrequited love.

693
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,000
You dealt with it
because you didn't trust me,

694
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,100
and I dealt with it because I felt bad.

695
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,310
We both just dealt with it until it ended.

696
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,260
You're right.

697
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,500
That's a failed relationship.

698
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,070
Don't hold onto a failed relationship.

699
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,780
Let's really end it this time.

700
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,320
Eat well,

701
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,150
sleep well,

702
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,560
and be well.

703
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,480
You're home.

704
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,650
I stopped by because I thought

705
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,250
you'd have nothing to eat...

706
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,250
Son.

707
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,920
What's wrong?

708
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,630
I thought I could see her again
if I came back, but...

709
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,670
I was wrong again.

710
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,790
(There is a reason
why someone shows their back.)

711
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,500
(I realized that reason)

712
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:50,530
(too late.)

713
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,710
(No one knew of the fox's wounds.)

714
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,810
(The fox's efforts.)

715
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,210
(If he fell just one more time,
the fox would've died.)

716
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,580
(The fox showed his back
in order to live.)
