1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,060
(Woo-yeon)

2
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,430
Why is the phone ringing?

3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,630
What?

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,430
(He picked up.)

5
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,150
You picked up today.

6
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,460
Hi, Woo-yeon.

7
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,800
It speaks.

8
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,340
You're drunk, Woo-yeon.

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,340
You're drunk, Woo-yeon.

10
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,710
You're hallucinating.

11
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,650
Is this a dream?

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,189
It isn't a dream. I'm real.

13
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,390
Goodness. It's warm.

14
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,180
Is it 4D?

15
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,080
It smells good too.

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,050
Would you please add an adjective?

17
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,880
A nice smell.

18
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,390
It seems so real.

19
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,590
How much did you drink?

20
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,360
- Let's go inside.
- No.

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,800
You're not in there.

22
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,200
I want to stay in this dream.

23
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,590
=Episode 2=

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,100
Where are all my business cards?

25
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,430
Why does my wrist hurt so much?

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,640
Ask Ms. Kim to make copies
when she gets in.

27
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,210
Give it to me. I'll do it.

28
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,840
You don't have to do this.

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,610
Just tell Ms. Kim when she gets in.

30
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,610
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,790
(Group chat)

32
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,160
(You can just pay
according to the notice.)

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,240
(Oh no. I sent that
to the wrong chat room.)

34
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,940
(That was for full-time employees.)

35
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,170
(The others don't have to pay.)

36
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,650
One Iced Americano please.

37
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,020
You get a 15 percent discount
with your employee ID.

38
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,920
- Just ring it up without--
- Here.

39
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,590
Hi.

40
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,960
People think of huge things
when you mention "discrimination",

41
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,760
but true discrimination
is in these little things.

42
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,900
Like a 15 percent discount for coffee.

43
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,270
"You don't have to do it.
You don't have to pay."

44
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,110
They disguise it as being considerate.

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,940
Right?

46
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,040
During the last workshop,

47
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,710
they asked, "So-yeong,
do you want to attend the workshop too?"

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,020
"Do you want to?"

49
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,750
But you became a full-time worker.

50
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,650
Not all full-time workers are the same.

51
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,790
I can't get promoted or get a raise.

52
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,360
They don't even want to take me
to a workshop.

53
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,200
Once a blue, always a blue.

54
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,630
Your first strap is your last strap.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
There's no vision.

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,480
I set a new record yesterday
on the punching machine.

57
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,580
Really?

58
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,760
Hey, Young-hee.

59
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,860
Did I hit the punching machine last night?

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,630
Why does my wrist hurt so much?

61
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,170
(Yes, you did. You hit Soo.)

62
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,440
Soo? What do you mean?

63
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,470
(That poor thing.
As soon as he got to Korea.)

64
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,270
Korea?

65
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,240
That wasn't a dream?

66
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Woo-yeon.

67
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,820
Hi, Woo-yeon.

68
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,590
How rude.

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,700
That's pretty.

70
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,230
Can we see these in size 275?

71
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,930
Okay. You can try those on.

72
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,340
I really don't need them.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,540
Try them on.

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,450
I have nowhere to wear these to.

75
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,620
Don't dress all shabby
just because you have nowhere to go.

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,820
Don't be discouraged
just because you're studying.

77
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,590
I can't stand you looking discouraged.

78
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,690
Are you buying me shoes
so that I'd run away?

79
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,060
I'm buying them so you'd come to me
as a civil servant.

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,490
They're nice.

81
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,730
- These?
- Okay.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,670
I'll study hard.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,470
Hey... What are you doing here?

84
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,440
Why... Why are you here?

85
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,680
You said to come.

86
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,780
I did?

87
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,510
That's not possible.

88
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,850
You said to come...

89
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,150
(Kyung Woo-yeon)
and collect payment.

90
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,290
No.

91
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,160
Hey.

92
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,760
Soo.

93
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,230
- Woo-yeon.
- Woo-yeon.

94
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Don't go.

95
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,100
Don't.

96
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,530
I'm miserable.

97
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm ruined!

98
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,809
It's all your fault.

99
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,140
Stop hitting me.

100
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,210
Hey.

101
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,880
- Stop her.
- Woo-yeon.

102
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,980
It's your fault.

103
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,780
Ding dong.

104
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,120
Ding dong.

105
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,520
You should go, "Who is it?"

106
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,620
Ding dong. Who is it?

107
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,460
If you have a problem with it,

108
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,460
you can come collect payment.

109
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,170
I left my phone in my office.

110
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,600
Isn't it in your hand?

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
Here it is.

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,450
So? How will you pay?

113
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,120
Sorry...

114
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,460
about last night.

115
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,130
What are you sorry for?

116
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,630
So...

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,559
Did... I...

118
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,870
hit you lightly?

119
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,240
Definitely not lightly.

120
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,010
I guess it could've been hard.

121
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,640
But... By any chance did I...

122
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,650
throw my business cards at your...

123
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,950
What?

124
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,150
Did I do something else?

125
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,120
Hey, even if I did, can you not tell me?

126
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,560
It's humiliating enough.

127
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,090
It'll be much worse
if I actually remember.

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Okay.

129
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,740
- But...
- I said not to tell me.

130
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,770
What's wrong with you?
I'm going to ask something else.

131
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,740
What is it?

132
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,209
Why are you working at an office?

133
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,110
You wanted to be a writer.
Or a calligraphist.

134
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,050
I realized it's not for everyone.

135
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,820
I had to find a job
since I had to make a living.

136
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,430
That's not right.
You should do it if you want to.

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,430
How many people do you think
actually do everything they want?

138
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,770
Race, sex, religion, parents,

139
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,870
job, spouse, et cetera.

140
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,970
Among the factors that affect your life,
the only ones you can choose...

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,910
are your job and spouse.

142
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,210
Wouldn't it be too miserable
if you can't choose those either?

143
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,120
Which school did you say you're attending?

144
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,060
School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

145
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,560
Isn't that place really famous?

146
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,370
How cool.

147
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,270
It takes a lot of effort to look cool
inside and out.

148
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,350
Everything is still the same here.

149
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,510
The convenience store
and the neighborhood too.

150
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,020
I guess so.

151
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,720
How can everything

152
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,990
still be so nice?

153
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,260
You should go in.

154
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,960
How long are you staying in Korea?

155
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,930
- Until next week.
- I see.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,470
It's spring break.
I came in to renew my visa.

157
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,240
I see.

158
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
I better see a lot of Kyung Woo-yeon
while I can.

159
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,550
(What's the point of seeing you a lot?)

160
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,550
- Does he want to date?
- Does he want to go out?

161
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,420
- Does he want to sleep with you?
- That's too much.

162
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,920
That's too American.

163
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,530
It's possible.
He lived in America for a while.

164
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,360
You're right. That's it.

165
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,570
What are you saying?

166
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
If you want to see him, you should.

167
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,110
If you want to kiss him
while seeing him, kiss him.

168
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,640
And if you want to sleep with him,
just do it.

169
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,280
What is she saying?

170
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,780
That way, you won't have any regrets.

171
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,580
They dragged on for seven years
because they never got to do anything.

172
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,290
Do everything you want, then end it.
The curse and everything else too.

173
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,960
I agree.

174
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,990
Me too. Majority wins. Case closed.

175
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,260
Cheers.

of Creative Writing, 2012, Second Term)

178
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,440
(At dusk, I climb a hill)

179
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,610
(and stroke the silver grass.)

180
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,850
(Let's not talk in a complicated way.)

181
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,280
(If you miss someone, tell them.)

182
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,200
- Mom.
- Yes?

183
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,530
Can you buy me a set of 55 crayons?

184
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,340
You have crayons at home.

185
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,170
I only have 24 colors.

186
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,110
Do you know how many colors
there are in the world?

187
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,200
Hey, get in.

188
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,410
Why did we come here all of a sudden?

189
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,610
I was bored, and you felt uneasy.

190
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,080
We came for several reasons.

191
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,110
You became considerate
in the time we didn't meet.

192
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,680
I was always considerate of you.

193
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,320
- You?
- "You"?

194
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,220
I was so good to you.
Did you forget everything?

195
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,560
You must be mistaking me
with someone else.

196
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,890
There was only you,
so I have no one to mistake you with.

197
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,430
It's too bad. I wanted to see
the cherry blossoms in Korea.

198
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,570
Everything's green.

199
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,170
It's too bad.

200
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,710
Cherry blossoms are great,
but they wilt too fast.

201
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,740
People go look at them because they do.

202
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,220
I guess you're right.

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,950
They don't have pine tree festivals,
but they have cherry blossom festivals.

204
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,960
Cherry blossoms fall,
while pine trees have armors.

205
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,390
Pine trees won.

206
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,790
You sure do know how to talk.

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,370
Are you feeling better now?

208
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,040
Yes. I'm better.

209
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,570
I'm happy you're better.

210
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,780
Why are you happy when I'm better?

211
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,840
Because we're friends.

212
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,990
I can't be friends with you.

213
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,690
You won't even ask why.

214
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,830
You already know

215
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,130
that I

216
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,540
- still like you.
- Stop it.

217
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,770
What?

218
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,840
No matter where I've been

219
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,050
and how long I've been away,
I want to continue seeing you.

220
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,520
As friends.

221
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,020
So,

222
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,560
don't do something like
confessing your feelings to me.

223
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,740
I won't.

224
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,710
I won't since I'm disgusted.

225
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,980
Let's stop.

226
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,950
I'll stop having feelings for you

227
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,990
and being friends with you too.

228
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,660
I told you I want to stay as friends.

229
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,130
And I

230
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,540
told you I like you.

231
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,740
But you're the one who rejected me.

232
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,650
So...

233
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,290
So let's just reject each other
and never meet again.

234
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,160
Now we've got that sorted,
can you please leave?

235
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,210
- I'll drive you home.
- I'm embarrassed, so just leave.

236
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,750
I'm embarrassed that I got rejected twice.

237
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,060
It drives me crazy that I still have
feelings for you despite that.

238
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,190
So please,
let's never see each other again.

239
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,800
Jin-ju.

240
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,770
What should I do?

241
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,940
(That's the day)

242
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,850

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200
Of course I'm okay.

246
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,840
How did you call me right on time?

247

- Telepathy?
- Soo called.

- Why are you telling her?

Do you like puppies?

If you like puppies,
do you want to play with me?

291
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,090
I become a total dog when I get drunk.

292

Is that right?

How dare a dog
try to sit at the table with people?

Let her be. He canceled that line,
so he won't pick up anyway.

297
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,820
What if he comes to Korea?

298
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,620
What if he picks up?
She did that three years ago too.

299
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,160
Let her be. She needs to be utterly
humiliated to come to her senses.

You say such mean things at times.

I'm glad it was only at times.

302
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,970
I never asked you out.

303
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,570

to do anything with me.

You know,

306
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,650
when someone tells me he likes me,

307
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,050
whatever I felt for him dies.

308
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,390
I even get sick of him.

309
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,090
So

310
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,160
please like me just once.

311
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,530
Just a little.

312
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,970
Please like me just once.

313
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,240
Please?

314
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,980
Is that so hard?

315
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,590

Is it?

(Is it?)

322
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,570
Gosh. You're a bad daughter
for not having a job

323
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,570
and just chasing your dreams at your age.

If you get drunk on top of that,
you'll break your parents' hearts.

325
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,970
You'll break them.

326
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,910
I told you that I have a job.

327

I'm a calligraphist.

328
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,180
Gosh. If you made money from that
like a real job, would you be here now?

329
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,890
You're here
because it pays like a side job.

330
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,460
That's right.
We're closing for a while to remodel.

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,930
What? Then how will I get paid?

333
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,900
You get paid hourly.
You get paid for the hours you work.

334
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,970
You can't get paid when you don't work.

Hello?

No.

I'm working when I came to heal

It's been four days since you came.

Are you still jet-lagged?

382

Do you still have that?
It's more than 20 years old.

It's more than 20 years old,
but it still works.

386
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,720
Why did you teach me photography?

387
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,580
I was only eight.

388
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,150
I hated the fact

389
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,720
that an eight-year-old's only hobby
was collecting awards.

390
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,790
I wanted to win everyone's favor then.

391
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,760
I guess it was in vain.

392
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,500
Aren't you going to go to Seoul?

393
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,640
No.

394
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,040
Am I a pigeon or something?

395

I'm exhausted from updating
you and your dad about each other.

396
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,050
You don't need to update me
about anything.

397
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,320
Even better if you don't tell him
any updates about me.

398
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,390
I shouldn't have taught you photography.

399
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,120
I taught you so you wouldn't be lonely,

400
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,090
but now you decided to make
being lonely your vocation.

401
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
It's not too bad.

402
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,100
Why do you live like that? You're young.

403
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,800
I'm used to it.

404

Mr. Han made us cross the ocean
in the end.

405

At least we get to feel
the Jeju breeze thanks to him.

406
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,180
Did you contact the photographer?

407
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,750
Yes. I scheduled a meeting tomorrow
at Cafe Eunyu.

408
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,390
Good. Let's schedule him for tomorrow.

409
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,920
As for now, let's go catch Mr. Han.

- Let's enjoy the drive.
- Sounds good.

412
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,430
How adorable.

413
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,270
You're so cute.

Room service.

418
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,300
What room service?

419
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,900
I didn't order any.

420
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,870
Hello, Mr. Han.

421
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,570
Nice to meet you, Mr. Han.

422
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,790
Just think of this as your studio
and write comfortably.

423
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,520
Don't writers have any human rights?

424
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,090
In the 2018 spring issue

425
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,690
of Eunyu Quarterly, you said,

426
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,390
"A writer is the most human-like machine."

427
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,830
- I respect you, sir.
- I respect you.

428
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,030
I'm so sick of you publishers.

429
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,040
Please look after Mr. Han.

430
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,340
I have somewhere to go.

431
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,940
Okay. See you later.

432
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,910
Where are you going? Take me with you.

433
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,380
Mr. Han, you should write.

434
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,930
He took photographs everywhere
while he traveled around the world.

435
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,300
He won all kinds of awards and snatched
sponsorships from conglomerates.

436
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,070
He shot the album cover
of the global pop artist, Bruno Marlabu.

437
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,809
I know he's a hot photographer.

438
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,610
That's why we spent a lot of money
on this yacht.

439
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,420
Sir.

440
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,520
There's only one thing
that the Jeju Tourism Organization wants.

441
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,760
When people see your pictures,

442
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,160
we want them to wish they could
visit Jeju Island before they die.

443
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,630
We want the composition to be
something like this.

444
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,230
Something grand, yet detailed.

445
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,770
How should I explain it?
Something that looks cold yet warm?

446
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:27,610
It makes you want to throw yourself
into the water right this moment,

447
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,980
yet you don't.
It's something you just want to admire.

448
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,250
Are you listening?

449
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,720
So you were listening.

450
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,560
These aren't the kind of pictures
one can take after hearing some advice.

451
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,630
- Pardon?
- So,

452
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,830
just watch instead of talking.

453
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,900
Don't get in the way and just wait.

454
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,640
That jerk only looks down on me.

455
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,870
No... He looks down on everyone.

456
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,280
Hey. You were being too cold
to our employer.

457
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,550
What if the Jeju Tourism Organization
decides to switch photographers...

458
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,220
Right.

459
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,490
Who would replace you?

460
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,320
You're rude, but you're too talented.

461
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,260
When should we go to Seoul?

462
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,260
There are some advertisers contacting us.

463
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,230
I told you. I'm not going to Seoul. Ever.

464
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,640
Hey, what about me?

465
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,270
Why are you asking me that?

466
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,610
I came all the way here from the US
because of you.

467
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,150
You always ruin
the advertisement jobs I get for you,

468
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,820
but when you told me
you were going to Korea,

469
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,350
I thought you were going to settle down.

470
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,790
I thought your family might set up
a studio for you.

471
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,020
I came all the way here because of you.

472
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,160
And I told you not to come.
You're the one who followed me.

473
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,130
Advertisements? Did I not do the job?

474
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,430
Did I cancel them without a reason?

475
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,360
Money comes first for you,
not my photographs.

476
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,130
You were too busy pleasing clients

477
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,830
that you ripped my work apart.

478
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,000
What can't you do for money?

479
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,180
You must think you're my partner,

480
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,680
but you're mistaken.

481
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,110
You're not my partner. You're a parasite

482
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,920
who only cares about money.

483
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,660
You think you avoid making
useless connections, don't you?

484
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,230
You're wrong.
You're incapable of making connections.

485
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,860
You don't know how to accept
love or kindness.

486
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,830
All you care about is yourself.

487
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,300
Fine. Since you're so great,
I hope you live a long and lonely life.

00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,670
I sent you an email but you didn't reply.

493
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,040
Here.

494
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,840
These are calligraphy postcards I made.

495
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,420
If it's okay with you,
could you display them over there?

496
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Sure. You can leave them.

497
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,820
Okay. These are samples.

498
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,190
If you need more or get an order,

499
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,690
please message me on social media.

500
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,760
Okay. You can leave them.

501
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,900
Okay.

502
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,100
Thank you.

503
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,920
Are you going in or out?

504
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,500
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,980
Hold on.

506
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,050
Why...

507
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,260
Why isn't it coming off?

508
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,930
Take your time.

509
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,560
Okay.

510
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,970
Hold my jacket.

511
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,770
What?

512
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,520
This will be easier.

513
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,720
Hello...

514
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,790
Sir.

515
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,390
(Let's meet again.)

516
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,560
How have you been?

517
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,660
Good.

518
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,210
I'm making rounds to see
how our neighborhood bookstore collection

519
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,140
is faring.

520
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,720
Got it.

521
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,720
I'll give you one
since you're a gentleman.

522
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,060
This is super expensive.

523
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,300
How many postcards do I have to pay to buy this?

524
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,380
Maybe it's because it's a special edition,
but it's the best seller.

525
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,080
That's good.

526
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,480
Here. I wanted to return this.

527
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,150
Thanks.

528
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,060
Oh no. When did this get here?

529
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,210
If you're going to throw away
the other two as well,

530
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,220
may I just take them?

531
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,590
I didn't make these postcards
to become trash.

532
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,360
I'll go then.

533
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,850
(Winds blow in order to pass by.)

534
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,740
(Winds blow in everyone's life.)

535
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,140
(It's okay.)

536
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,880
(Winds blow)

537
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,850
(in order to pass by.)

538
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,650
The old saying is right.

539
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,320
"A picture is worth a thousand words."

540
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,750
It hurts to see more than to hear.

541
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,320
(Winds blow in order to pass by.)

542
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,560
It's making me realize my place.

543
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,640
Woo-yeon?

544
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,790
(I was wrong.)

545
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,860
(Actually, winds blow)

546
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,760
(in order to come back.)

547
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,870
Why did you run away? Am I a ghost?

548
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,410
That's right, I thought you were a ghost.

549
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,980
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?

550
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,210
How long are you going to stay down there?

551
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,550
Is that comfortable?

552
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,880
A person fell, but you don't reach out--

553
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,420
Get on.

554
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,190
Ghosts can't do this.
I'm not a ghost, so get on.

555
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,470
Hang on.

556
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,070
I'm hanging on.

557
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,110
Don't make me repeat myself.
I'm exhausted.

558
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,520
Thank you.

559
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,220
Thanks. You may go now.

560
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,160
Do you think I'm an ambulance
just because I carried you here?

561
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,800
That's not it. I assume you're busy.

562
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,030
You didn't hurt your mouth,
so explain yourself.

563
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,170
Why did you run away?

564
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,400
I did not...

565
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,240
I told you. I thought you were a ghost.

566
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,740
Don't tell me

567
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,010
you're still awkward with me
because of what happened three years ago.

568
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,980
Awkward?

569
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,780
Hey. I'm totally comfortable.

570
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,450
I'm comfortable around you.

571
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,620
I can eat with you, have tea with you,
and even drink with you.

572
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,390
I can even take a dump in your home.

573
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,130
That was a bit far.

574
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,260
Then do it.

575
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,030
What? Take a dump in your home?

576
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,260
Except that.

577
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,400
Do it all.

578
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,940
Buy me food first.

579
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,310
Private ambulances usually charge a fee.

580
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,650
Why did you come to Jeju?

581
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,220
Just to get some rest.

582
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,760
How have you been?

583
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,560
Just... Well...

584
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,190
I've been okay.

585
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,290
Seriously.

586
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,660
Must you always start with "just"?

587
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
You're right.

588
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,270
How long are you staying?

589
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,970
I fly out tonight.

590
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,170
Are you going straight to the airport?
I'll drive you.

591
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,140
It's okay. I have to stop by
where I'm staying and get my stuff.

592
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,810
- Then I'll drive you there.
- There's no need.

593
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,650
Do you want to hurt your other leg too?

594
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,110
You're wobblier than a newborn calf.

595
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,620
I don't want to be even more of a burden.

596
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,650
Don't think about others.
Think only about yourself.

597
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,790
Weigh the options and run the numbers
to see which is the most profitable.

598
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,260
Human beings are selfish creatures.
Everyone puts themselves first.

599
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,260
No one puts others first.

600
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,660
Even parents.

601
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,730
Still.

602
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,330
Go with me unless you're uncomfortable.

603
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,700
I'm not uncomfortable.

604
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:16,950
Is that a treasure chest?

605
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,120
Why are you clutching it so hard?

606
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,520
I thought it was,
but it's just a nuisance.

607
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,230
What is it?

608
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:25,930
This?

609
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,660
(Crossing the ocean between us)

610
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,800
(Crossing the ocean between us)
Calligraphy postcards.

611
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:29,830
Calligraphy postcards.

612
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,630
Why do you carry those?

613
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,140
I made them as souvenirs
to sell to bookstores,

614
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,610
but they remain in my bag.

615
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,910
Give me one.

616
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,210
To keep as a souvenir?

617
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,850
To keep as a memory.

618
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,780
I missed you.

619
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,220
By the way,
where did you say you're going?

620
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,020
Jieum Guesthouse.

621
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,560
Thanks. Bye.

622
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,210
Do you think a simple thank you
is enough for what I did?

623
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,010
Is that what this country taught you
on how to be courteous?

624
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,580
My mom taught me this.

625
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,950
Your mom raised you well
as a progressive person.

626
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,550
There's no way she would've
taught me that.

627
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,990
By the way, did you get out
just to tell me this?

628
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,990
- Why would I do that?
- Are you back?

629
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,260
How did you two come in together?

630
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,000
He's like a son to me.

631
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,370
He's staying in the suite
you cleaned earlier.

632
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,340
By the way,
how do you two know each other?

633
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,140
We're acquaintances...

634
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,240
We're friends.

635
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,810
It's not what you think.
We're just friends.

636
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,080
You'd never offer to give a friend a lift.

637
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,280
What about Yu-ra?

638
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,120
I was nice to you in case
you become my son-in-law.

639
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,590
It's nothing like that.
Don't say anything strange to Dad.

640
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,160
All right, punk.

641
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,490
He's cranky.

642
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,160
I'm leaving.

643
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,130
Woo-yeon, you said
you're leaving tomorrow, right?

644
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,360
Yes.

645
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,460
Okay.

646
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,770
Tomorrow?

647
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,110
You ran away, then you lied.
What's with all this naughtiness?

648
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,210
I wasn't lying.

649
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,980
I made a mistake. I was confused.

650
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,150
I think you do feel awkward with me.

651
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,750
I told you I don't feel awkward.

652
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,720
Then follow me.

653
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,020
Where?

654
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:36,190
We only did one of the things
we were going to do.

655
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,330
There are so many stars.

656
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:46,430
You're right.

657
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,880
You're so lucky.
You get to see this tomorrow too.

658
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,540
Tomorrow will be different.

659
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,910
Are there no stars tomorrow?

660
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,380
You won't be here tomorrow.

661
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:24,440
(Winds blow in order to pass by.)

662
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,480
Prior to
the "Talk with the Author" session

663
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,940
for Lee Yeon-kyung's publication event,

664
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,150
we plan on holding a digital calligraphy event.

665
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,050
("Jae-oh's Shadow")
We'll select five book covers from Eunyu Publishing's

666
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,620
(Neighborhood Bookstore Best Collection, Park Wan-suh)
literary collection.

667
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,350
("The Life Before Me")
They'll be made into backgrounds.

668
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,190
The calligraphers will write out
a phrase chosen by the guest on the spot.

669
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,160
Did you recruit a calligraphist?

670
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,790
Yes. I've contacted Jang Seo-yeon
whom we worked with before.

671
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,930
She already confirmed.

672
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,360
Great. It's late. You should go rest.

673
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,100
Okay. Goodnight.

674
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,040
Gosh.

675
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,080
Aren't you going to take a break?

676
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,480
Just because I told you to rest,

677
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,620
are you going right into friend mode?

678
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,790
Isn't it so sad?

679
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,350
We were friends in college,

680
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,190
but you're my boss now.

681
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,530
Being born into a rich family is the best.

682
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,160
That's why I pay you a lot.

683
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,330
Gosh. I'm going to get a drink.
Should I pick something up for you?

684
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,270
Yes. Some tea.

685
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,670
Joon-soo. Joon-soo!

686
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,140
The only thing you should drink
at this hour is alcohol,

687
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,370
or liquor, or alcohol!

688
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,610
- What do you mean, tea?
- Alcohol!

689
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,050
- What?
- I'm in for drinks.

690
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,220
- Mr. Min.
- Yes?

691
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,780
You're on a business trip right now.

692
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,050
Right, I forgot.

693
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,220
I'll be back, sir.

694
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,620
Since Mr. Han is working so hard,
things are going so smoothly.

695
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,960
Please keep going.

696
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,330
I swear I heard him talk about drinks.

697
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,410
(Let's meet again.)

698
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,380
(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)

699
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,420
(Woo-yeon Calligraphy)

700
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,520
(Follow, Message)

701
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,930
(None of us were shaken,
so I'm not an obstruction.)

702
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,030
(To you)

703
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,330
(We call water, water.)

704
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,600
(Someone who was hurt can't be strong.)

705
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,600
(You're my beautiful nightmare.)

706
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,970
(Like a rain shower
or a fever after being soaked,)

707
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,440
(you came to me out of nowhere
and I fell ill for years.)

708
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,800
(You have no friends, do you?)

709
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,200
(- I do too.)
- Who?

710
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,810
Kyung Woo-yeon.

711
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:12,970
Hi, Woo-yeon.

712
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,640
Hi, Woo-yeon.

713
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,850
I'm happy you're better.

714
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,350
Woo-yeon?

715
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,880
To keep as a memory. I've missed you.

716
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,420
Tomorrow will be different.
You won't be here tomorrow.

717
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,580
Did you throw out my pills?

718
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,610
Why would I throw out your pills?

719
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,080
How could I?

720
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,450
I heard you cleaned my room.

721
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,220
My sleeping pills were on top
of the nightstand.

722
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,120
What are you saying?

723
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,690
What is this?

724
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,600
You look like you know what I'm saying.

725
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,200
Were they yours?

726
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,710
I have a meeting tomorrow.
What are you going to do about it?

727
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,440
I'm still jet-lagged.
Everything's ruined thanks to you.

728
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,070
Were you sleeping?

729
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,000
I thought I told you I can't sleep.

730
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,000
Here.

731
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,110
- What is it?
- Some stuff to help you sleep.

732
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,910
- I brought this and that...
- Come in.

733
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,210
No, I'll leave after I give you these.

734
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,080
Why do you only want to do things
you want to do?

735
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,320
- Me?
- You get to see

736
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,550
only the good stuff.

737
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,520
But I have to stare at the ceiling
for hours.

738
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,560
I'm bored. The ceiling isn't so beautiful.

739
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
Were those really
sleeping pills I threw out?

740
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,260
First, the sleeping position.

741
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,270
You should change the position
depending on the height of the pillow.

742
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,570
It's pretty high.
You should lie down facing up.

743
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,640
Lie down.

744
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,340
There's a sleep-inducing video
or past life exploration.

745
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,440
- Which one do you want?
- The sleep-inducing video.

746
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,480
I was a royal in my past life.

747
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,720
What is this?

748
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,650
I told you to face up.

749
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,990
This is comfortable for me.

750
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,620
This is why you can't sleep.

751
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,760
Here.

752
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,230
Hold it for me. It's perfect right now.

753
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,630
I don't want to lift a finger.

754
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,270
Am I your tripod?

755
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,300
My sleeping pills...

756
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,970
My small and precious sleeping pills...

757
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,540
Is the angle okay?

758
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,280
It's too far.

759
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:05,750
I said, it's too far.

760
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,850
Is that good?

761
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,010
She's sleeping by herself.

762
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,140
And he said he couldn't sleep.

763
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,500
Did you marry me not knowing
this would happen?

764
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,840
Why did you get married
if we were going to be so lonely?

765
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,470
Why did you marry me if you were
going to make me miserable?

766
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,640
You're too sensitive! It's exhausting!

767
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:16,740
Do you realize that?

768
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,680
Let's get a divorce then.

769
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,780
Fine! Let's get a divorce!

770
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,080
All he cares is that he sleeps well.

771
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,310
What about me?

772
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,350
What?

773
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,250
Where did I drop it this time?

774
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,860
- What?
- Hey.

775
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,930
I think I left my earring.

776
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,800
Come in.

777
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,110
Did you close the door last night?

778
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,780
Yes, to block out the light

779
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,680
so that you can sleep well.

780
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,350
You repaid kindness with a nightmare.

781
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,120
What?

782
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,750
I sleep with the door open.

783
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Why?

784
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,490
I don't like shut doors.

785
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,630
I don't see it.

786
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,530
I must've dropped it somewhere else.

787
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,080
I'll look for your earring later.

788
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,010
It's okay. I have to stop by somewhere,

789
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,450
then straight to the airport.

790
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,520
Isn't it an evening flight? Why don't we...

791
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,620
For what?

792
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,350
It's okay.

793
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,220
Take care. Be healthy.

794
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,030
What comes after that? "Goodbye forever"?

795
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:14,830
You always talk like
we'll never meet again.

796
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,500
We have no reason to meet.

797
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,400
Woo-yeon.

798
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,700
Thanks for all your hard work, Woo-yeon.

799
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,300
Thank you for everything.

800
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,470
No. I'm the one who should be thankful.

801
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,010
Woo-yeon, here's the map to Cafe Eunyu.

802
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,140
Thanks.

803
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,280
Why do you always go to bookstores
and book cafes?

804
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,420
That's how I heal my soul.

805
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,680
I'll miss you.

806
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,290
Thanks for everything. Take care.

807
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,990
- What?
- What?

808
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,860
Why are you so rude to me?
Who knows when and where we'll meet again?

809
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:50,560
We won't meet again.

810
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,900
Thank you for everything. Goodbye.

811
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,810
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

812
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,520
Are you insane?

813
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,320
Why did you run in when that was falling?

814
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,460
Why did you butt in?

815
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,360
I was just trying to save you.

816
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,190
Who asked you to save me?
Why do you hurt yourself for someone else?

817
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,360
What if you get seriously injured?
Do you think they'll take care of you?

818
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,930
No one will take care of you.

819
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,430
Stay out of other people's business.
Don't be such a busybody.

820
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,000
Take care of yourself first

821
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,310
before others.

822
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,150
Did I butt in because I wanted to?

823
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,850
Did I hurt myself because I wanted to?

824
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,390
I was worried about you
and had no time to think. That's why.

825
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,020
I knew that you were a selfish jerk,

826
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,190
but this is too much.

827
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,530
Fine.

828
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,270
I hope you have a good life
all by yourself.

829
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,640
You jerk.

830
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,160
Dropping off?

831
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,750
Jerk.

832
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,660
Hello. May I ask you something?

833
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,190
Is there a Cafe Eunyu...

834
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,090
(Cafe Eunyu)

835
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,460
I'm the CEO of Eunyu Publishing Company,
On Joon-soo.

836
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,630
(CEO On Joon-soo)

837
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,340
I didn't know you'd come.

838
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,140
You refused several times before.

839
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,740
You came all this way.

840
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,140
But what brings you to Jeju?

841
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,350
If I say I came to win you over,

842
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:40,950
would that be too cliche?

843
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,280
I came for something else,

844
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,520
but I wanted to meet you in person.

845
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,250
I saw your email.

846
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,290
You proposed a Seoul-themed
photo book with calligraphy.

847
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,730
Why Seoul?

848
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,390
We recently published
a Seoul-themed collection of stories.

849
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,160
One review struck me deeply.

850
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,330
The person said there is beauty
even in this particularly cold

851
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,270
and cruel city,
and that it was a source of comfort.

852
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,810
I want to show that beauty.

853
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,640
How nice.

854
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,010
That's why I can't do it.

855
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,210
May I ask why?

856
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,250
I don't think I can find

857
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,450
the sides to Seoul
that are not cold and cruel.

858
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:32,570
(Cafe Eunyu)

859
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,580
We meet again.

860
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,950
Hello.

861
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,650
You must like books.

862
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:52,950
I do.

863
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,260
- Okay, then.
- Thank you for the postcard.

864
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,790
Do you write all the text that you post
on your social media page?

865
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,700
Yes.

866
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,700
There are copyright issues,

867
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,430
and I thought it would seem
more sincere if I write them myself.

868
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,670
It's sort of like a diary.

869
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,910
It must be the prettiest diary
in the world.

870
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,910
I liked what you wrote.
Of course, your calligraphy too.

871
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,310
Thank you. In more ways than one.

872
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,520
I didn't do anything to earn a thank you.

873
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,720
Actually,
I've been feeling very down lately.

874
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,090
Your one comment was really nice.

875
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,330
I must like this a lot.

876
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,330
It'll keep getting harder.

877
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:36,660
The more you like something,
the harder it gets.

878
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:40,200
I hope you'll keep it up
notwithstanding that.

879
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,070
Okay, then.

880
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Jerk.

881
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,300
Look how sweet even a stranger is.

882
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,440
Am I the jerk?

883
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:22,840
What the...

884
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,110
What took you so long? I've been waiting.

885
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,020
I guess you felt bad.

886
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:33,190
Go ahead. Apologize.

887
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,350
For what?

888
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,090
Excuse me. For real?

889
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,360
"Sorry for yelling at you."

890
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,760
"Sorry for being an ingrate."
Aren't you going to say that?

891
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,300
Why would I say garbage like that?

892
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:47,170
I'm not sorry or grateful to you.

893
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:49,340
If I am sorry or grateful,

894
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,940
you'll keep doing that.

895
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,310
You won't think about yourself
and throw yourself into danger

896
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,010
for other people again.

897
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,710
Am I stupid? Am I a moron?

898
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,720
I wouldn't do that for just anyone.

899
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,520
Regardless of who it is.
Don't do it for anyone.

900
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,020
And...

901
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,090
I'm thirsty.

902
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,800
I'm thirsty.

903
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:31,210
It's scraped. It'll scar.

904
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,380
It's okay...

905
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:48,430
Darn it. I wouldn't have gotten hurt
if it weren't for Woo-yeon.

906
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,300
Aren't you going to share?

907
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:59,160
Hey, stupid.

908
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,070
Give me that.

909
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,200
- I can...
- Don't put it on the wound.

910
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,980
You have to put it around the wound.

911
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,650
So it doesn't get infected.

912
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,200
Apple juice?

913
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:37,980
Yes, apple juice.

914
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,480
Is this your apology?

915
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,050
It's just apple juice.

916
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,590
What time is your flight?

917
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,620
At 9 p.m. tonight.

918
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,900
Are you really leaving tonight?

919
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:00,300
Yes. It's true I'm leaving tonight
and that I'm busy.

920
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,300
I have to give out postcards
to bookstores.

921
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,010
Should I be busy with you?

922
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,410
These are samples.
If you need more or get an order,

923
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,200
please message me on social media.

924
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,450
Thank you.

927
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,960
(Modest Bookstore)
Hello, I'm Kyung Woo-yeon. I'm a calligrapher.

928
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,060
These are postcards that I made.

929
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,760
(Winds blow in order to pass by.)
These are postcards that I made.

930
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:28,360
Would you be willing to display them here?

931
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,400
- You can leave them.
- Thank you.

932
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,470
(Let's meet again.)

933
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,250
- Thank you. - Have a nice day.

934
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,250
(Crossing the ocean between us)
- Thank you. - Have a nice day.

935
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:47,350
- Thank you. - Have a nice day.

936

(Hyewon Bookstore)

937
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,290
They still have compasses.

938
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,120
Because there are always people
who get lost.

939
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,990
Right?

940
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,200
Do you have more postcards left?

941
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,260
Nope. I gave them all out.

942
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,630
I gave out so many.
I wonder how many I'll hear from.

943
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,740
I wonder if I'll hear from any.

944
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,940
You will.

945
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,440
It's not your life, is that it?

946
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,710
Are you a croissant?
Why do you twist everything?

947
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:53,250
At least croissants are sweet.

948
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,350
My life is bitter.

949
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,660
Why the sudden bubble tea?

950
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,070
You said life is bitter.
So have something sweet.

951
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:26,450
Here.

952
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,020
- "Don't get lost"?
- "It's okay to get lost."

953
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,590
You liked superstitions.

954
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,860
Consider it a lucky charm.

955
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,930
A lucky charm?

956
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,030
You get that to rest your mind at ease.

957
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,300
I want you to look at that and be at ease.

958
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,870
It's okay to get lost

959
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,380
since it'll show you the way.

960
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,480
Why are you always giving me stuff?
Are you my grandma?

961
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,580
Because I'm happy to see you. I was bored.

962
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:13,460
Why are you always bored?

963
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,430
I always get bored.

964
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,130
Come again.

965
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,500
It's fun with you here.

966
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,270
I see.

967
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,990
What?

968
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,220
You keep giving me sweets,

969
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:45,130
so I keep forgetting the bitterness.

970
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,640
I liked you a lot.

971
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,270
I liked you

972
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:01,840
for a while.

973
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:05,010
Sorry. You're just a friend to me.

974
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,550
Wherever I come from,
however long I've been away,

975
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,280
I want to keep seeing you

976
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,520
as a friend.

977
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,760
Let's say bye here.

978
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,000
And

979
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,370
let's never meet again.

980
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,880
You keep telling me to go
whenever you feel like it.

981
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,250
I always have bad relationships.

982
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:16,820
I dated just anyone
without liking any of them.

983
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,590
I can't like anyone else
ever since I liked you.

984
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,230
I don't know whether you're a prince
or a wicked witch,

985
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,400
but you keep holding me back like a curse.

986
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,530
It's too hard for me.

987
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,380
I really want to stop now.

988
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,280
That's your problem.

989
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,350
What?

990
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,320
I said I wanted
to keep being friends with you.

991
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,990
I said I wanted to keep seeing you.

992
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,890
I just took it three years ago,
so you just take it from now on.

993
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,930
You still think only about yourself.

994
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,300
Jerks always only think about themselves.

995
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,200
You told me

996
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,870
to take care of myself before others.

997
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:17,310
I'm going to put an end to the curse,
you, and everything,

998
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,880
before I leave.

999
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,610
How will you end it?

1000
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,880
The curse, me, everything.

1001
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:31,560
(There is only one way to break the curse,
and it is very simple.)

1002
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,300
(A kiss.)

1003
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,160
The curse...

1004
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,390
is broken now.

1005
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,130
There are no flowers,
but there's a flowery wind.

1006
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,390
A flowery wind? What's that?

1007
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,930
A wind that blows
right before the flowers bloom.

1008
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,600
Why aren't there any flowers?

1009
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,170
Look. The prettiest flower in the world.

1010
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,840
You're wind. You go all over the place.

1011
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,950
Then make me a flowery wind.
Something pretty.

1012
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,850
Come to think of it, it's mean.

1013
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,920
Why does it come
and knock down all the flower petals?

1014
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,360
I'm sure it didn't come
to knock them down.

1015
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,020
It probably came
to look at the flowers too.

1016
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,000
(Thank you Woo Hyun
for the special appearance.)
