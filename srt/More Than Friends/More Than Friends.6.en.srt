("Wolf! A wolf is here!")

4

by the boy's lie)

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,630
(and brought weapons,
but there was no wolf.)

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,210
(no one)

11

(believed the boy.)

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,750
What if I say I'm being sincere?

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
Answer me.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,029
What if I'm being sincere?

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,500
What will you do then?

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,830

(Flirt in slang means dating and treating
people of the opposite sex recklessly.)

20

Treating the opposite sex recklessly?

21

What does she take me for?

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,840
I told her not to misunderstand.

(Aren't you going to tell me what it was?)

29

(It's nothing.)

Goodnight.)

46
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,620
You scared me.

47

Why are you screaming on the phone?

50
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,960
Hyun-jae kept asking.

51
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,430
Are you really trying to kill me?

You're going to get married soon.

(Exactly.)

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,210
We were going to get married, but now,
I'm too ashamed to because of you.

57
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,210
I'm too ashamed of our family
to marry him.

58
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,510
Darn it.

59
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,530
Is this the final design for the cover?

60
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,360
How was your date
with your destined drunkard?

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Good.

62
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,470
What did the two of you do?

If her first love returns,

71
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,010
she'll be torn.

72
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,010
Her first love was intense.

73
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,950
Why? Did the destined drunkard's
first love return?

74
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,220
Don't worry about her first love.

First loves aren't meant to come true.

76

I mean, who knew your first love
would return as your sister-in-law...

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,370
That was supposed to comfort me, right?

78
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
I was thoughtless. I'm sorry.

79

- Just a minute. - Sure.

- Just a minute. - Sure.

Yes, sweetie. Okay.

I love you too.

I'm sorry, my girlfriend called.

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,240
Did you have something to say to me?

105
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,310
No, I...

106
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,740
That hangover drink
you gave me worked really well.

107

I'm wondering where they sell it.

whenever you need it.

- "A hypochondriac"?
- Yes.

113
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,530
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

114
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,770
- Do you want more?
- No.

115
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,390
Don't you think there would be
a reason why I didn't tell you?

116
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,860
I probably wanted to hide it.

117
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,230
Did you have to dig into it?

118
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,760
Why did you have to find out
and make me feel ashamed?

119
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,730
What's there to be ashamed about
between us?

120
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,330
- There's no reason.
- There doesn't have to be

121
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,770
a reason to feel ashamed.

122
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,810
When someone's ashamed,
they're just ashamed.

123
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,740
You're too emotional right now.

124
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,010
- Calm down first and...
- Why are you making me feel miserable too?

125
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,150
Then why are you making me
a bad boyfriend?

126
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,949
We dated for ten years.
Is it still that hard to rely on me?

127
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,490
You can tell me.

128
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,960
It's okay

129
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,660
to lean on me.

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,270
I don't want the one I love
to struggle alone.

131
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,910
It's not because of you.
It's because of me.

132
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
Why should I always be

133
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,520
the only one who leans on you?

134
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,950
You're not the only one in love.

135
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,160
I love you too.

136
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,260
So why are you telling me
to be a burden to you?

137
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,370
I'll pay you back.

138

Please take it.

He did say he already had it with him.
I didn't know he was telling the truth.

142
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,430
But he already has a girlfriend.

143
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,060
Who cares if I drank or not?
Why would he give this to me

144
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,260
and confuse me?

145
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
Cheer up.

146
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,470
You said something huge happened.

147
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,770
This is huge.
If this is not huge, what is?

148
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,640
How peaceful and dull could your life be

149
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,110
for this to be a huge happening?

150
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,710
What did you say?

151
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,150
Come on, Young-hee. Jin-ju just...

152
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,420
How long will you keep whining
like a baby?

153
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,920
How much longer will you confuse
goodwill and interest

154
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,290
and whine and grumble
saying you're lonely?

155
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,790
What did you just say?

156
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,930
"Whine like a baby"? "Grumble"?

157
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,700
You heard me.

158
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,270
Then what about you?

159
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,340
Do you think you're an adult?

160
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,340
You act like a know-it-all

161
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,710
and as if you're the only one
who's suffering in this world.

162
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,810
It's really annoying when you
look down on people.

163
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
- What?
- I said you're annoying.

164
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,550
Jin-ju, why are you acting like this?

165
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,920
Let me be.
I'll say everything while I'm at it.

166
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm sorry, but you're not an adult.

167
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,850
You're an emotional teenager
who's always knee-deep in self-pity.

168
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,330
- What do you know?
- I don't know.

169
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,960
How can we know
when you never talk about yourself?

170
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,030
One day you're depressed,
then you're fine the next.

171
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,570
You're always suffering on your own,
so how can we know?

172
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,500
How much longer do we have to be
on our toes?

173
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,310
If I talk about it,

174
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,770
will a rich girl like you even understand?

175
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,910
Don't be so twisted.

176
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,380
Okay. Great.

177
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,920
We can just stop seeing each other.

178
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,520
I was getting sick and tired
of listening to your complaints.

179
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,250
I'm leaving.

180
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,160
Young-hee.

181
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,570
Young-hee, you can't leave like this.

182
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,140
Then should I keep sitting there

183
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,110
and argue about who's wrong?

184
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,710
Can't you be understanding today?
I bet she's really upset.

185
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,720
What about me? Do I look okay to you?

186
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,190
Did something happen to you too?

187
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,220
No. Go back to Jin-ju.

188
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,530
Come on. Let's go in together.

189
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,260
I have to get to bed early
so I can work tomorrow.

190
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,660
I'm leaving.

191
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,570
What is all this?

192
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,710
Did Young-hee leave?

193
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,980
Yes.

194
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,180
Goodness. You should've held it in.

195
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,120
Yes. I know I didn't have
any shortcomings.

196
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,120
I got a good education, my family's rich,
and I have a good job.

197
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,490
Where can I talk about my worries
when I'm so perfect?

198
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,260
Like Young-hee said,
it'll sound like I'm whining.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,270
But it's really hard and upsetting for me.

200
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,740
We're friends,
so that's why I talked about it.

201
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,310
You did well.

202
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,940
Keep on talking.
You have to tell us for us to know.

203
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,950
Was I too much earlier?

204
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,190
Both of you went too far.
You and Young-hee both.

205
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,820
Why are you drinking?

206
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,620
It's me who should be drinking right now.

207
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,060
I'm so upset that I want to die.

208
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,860
What can we do? That's your fate.

209
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,600
My fate?

210
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,970
Why is my fate so nasty and burdensome?

211
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,190
Why is everything my responsibility?

212
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,760
Why must I carry all the weight?

213
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,660
It's the worst.

214
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,100
Was I too harsh on everyone?

215
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,940
Soo. What brought you here without notice?

216
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,280
I wouldn't call you
when I'm visiting Dad's place.

217
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,880
I should ask you the same.
What are you doing here?

218
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,990
Why are you asking that to my guest?

219
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,620
I came to get something. Don't mind me.

220
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Soo.

221
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,930
Have something to eat before you go.

222
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,200
Gosh. The rice was cooked nicely.

223
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,240
Can you taste the soup for me?

224
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,310
Okay.

225
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,440
It's perfect.

226
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,910
I'm glad.

227
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm off.

228
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,520
Okay. Good work today.

229
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,000
I think it's closed.

230
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,070
Is it okay to come in here?

231
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,540
It's fine. I own the place.

232
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,040
Do you want a drink? Coffee? Tea?

233
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,440
Coffee, please.

234
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,480
Okay.

235

(I like you. Darn it.)

257
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,960
This is a confession.

258
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
I'm not an impatient person,

259
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,840
but whenever I'm in front of you,
I become impatient.

260
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,880
I didn't make the confession rashly,

261
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,010
so please don't answer in haste.

262
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,250
Think about it for a long time

263
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,150
before answering me.

264
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,790
It's your birthday this Saturday, right?

265
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,800
Let's go on a date

266
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,770
on your birthday.

267
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,070
You can answer me then.

268
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,120
What is it? Does it taste bad?

269
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,060
No. It tastes good.

270
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,560
I can't remember the last time
we ate together like this.

271
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,130
It's nice.

272
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,670
He thinks he's big now,
so he doesn't want to eat with us.

273
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,910
That's because we were never so peaceful
before I grew up.

274
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,840
Stop with the act.

275
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,650
Don't act like a normal couple

276
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,280
and a normal family. It's ridiculous.

277
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,630
I know we wronged you,

278
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,230
and we regret it.

279
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,500
Things were difficult, but we should have
paid more attention to you.

280
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,540
We shouldn't have fought so much
in front of you.

281
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,810
That's why we're trying
to make up for it now...

282
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,040
It's too late.

283
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,140
This won't make what happened go away.

284
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,150
Have you ever thought about
how selfish these efforts are?

285
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,450
You two keep acting like nothing happened!

286
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,590
It makes me feel like I'm the strange one.

287
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,060
Then what?

288
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,660
What do you want us to do?

289
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,400
You're grown up now.
Can't you understand us?

290
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,170
I understand you two.

291
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,840
You can get divorced
if you're not right for each other.

292
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,940
Your own feelings could've blinded you
from seeing

293
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,340
your child's fears and his broken heart.

294
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,310
I understand.

295
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,850
Knowing how one was hurt
doesn't heal a wound.

296
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,220
Understanding you

297
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,660
doesn't make me okay.

298
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,300
I'll get going for now.

299
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,910
What should we do on your birthday

300
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,610
to allow me to keep seeing you
without having to make excuses?

301
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,180
We don't want any distractions
to sway your heart,

302
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,950
so should we watch a musical
to keep you in a daze?

303
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,420
I'd like that.

304
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,960
Great. Let's watch
a musical this Saturday, then.

305
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,030
You should go in.

306
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,730
You should go first today.

307
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm always the first to leave.

308
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,000
But I like it that way.

309
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,270
Watching the back of people
could become a habit.

310
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,770
I don't want you to remember me
by my back.

311
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,010
Sure, if you say so.

312
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,050
Bye.

313
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,350
Hey, Woo-yeon.

314
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,990
What are you doing here?

315
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,490
No reason.

316
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,990
I'm not trying to flirt.

317
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,400
I was just reminded of you.

318
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,200
Did you eat?

319
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Go ahead and eat.

320
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,480
You're only nice to me
when something happens to me, right?

321
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,680
What happened?

322
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,880
I said I came without a reason.

323
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,950
No.

324
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,380
Something happened to you.

325
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,460
If I tell you,
are you going to comfort me?

326
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,890
No. I'll just sit with you.

327
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,600
(Should I set the table?)

328
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,070
Take this. I'll set the table.

329
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,370
Nice. This looks good.

330
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,170
Son. You must be hungry. Let's eat.

331
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,240
Hey.

332
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,480
Why are you here, Mom?

333
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,510
Didn't you two get divorced?

334
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,550
- The thing is...
- Your mom and I...

335
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,890
decided to be friends.

336
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,170
Soo.

337
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,150
What are you doing here?

338
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,420
Why that... Just because we say he's hot,
he thinks he really is...

339
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,590
Which he is.

340
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,020
How annoying.

341
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,830
Hey, you! You annoying punk!

342
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,200
What? What is it?

343
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,740
Eat.

344
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,470
If it gives you energy, be energized.
If not, just leave it.

345
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,080
Do you call that comforting me?

346
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,580
I think it's abusive

347
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,680
to tell someone who's hurting
to be strong.

348
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,350
I can't do anything else,

349
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,120
but I'll sit with you
until you finish eating.

350
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,160
It's more depressing
if you're alone when you're depressed.

351
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,790
Because you dig deeper and deeper
into the ground.

352
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,030
I don't know

353
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,270
whether you're in basement level one
or level ten,

354
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,440
but I'm trying to stop you
from going any deeper.

355
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,890
You're right.

356
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,620
Just by being there,

357
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,890
you'll keep me from falling
past basement level ten.

358
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,960
What are you talking about?

359
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,930
I'm saying you haven't changed at all.

360
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,770
That's true. I never change.

361
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,340
I'm so stupid.

362
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,240
Liar. You've changed.

363
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,650
Why didn't you keep your promise?

364
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,320
What promise?

365
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,050
You said I'd be the first to know
if anything develops with that CEO.

366
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,520
That wasn't a promise.

367
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,260
How long have you been going out?

368
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,860
We're not going out yet.

369
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,360
- Really?
- But...

370
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,900
he asked me out today.

371
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,970
Unless something big happens,
I'll probably go out with him.

372
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,980
Which reminds me...

373
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,310
Let's not meet alone like this
outside of work.

374
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,480
What?

375
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,720
Being friends with someone I liked

376
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,890
is inconsiderate to him.

377
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,660
I don't want to feel bad.

378
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,040
I'm home. Bye.

379
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,180
Woo-yeon.

380
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
Yes?

381
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,850
You and I were apart all this time.

382
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,350
Like you said,
I suddenly left to study abroad,

383
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,790
so we didn't see each other much since.

384
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,360
But regardless,

385
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,760
I always thought about you.

386
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,800
I didn't know why,

387
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,970
but I wondered how you were doing

388
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,170
and hoped you were well.

389
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
I assumed I'd see you
whenever I came to Korea.

390
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,510
And I liked that.

391
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,540
But I realized today.

392
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,580
Whenever I was alone,

393
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,020
you're there.

394
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,420
You were there.

395
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,860
That's why I feel like I'll really
be alone if you disappear for good.

396
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,660
Yes, I understand why
you don't want to see me

397
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,300
ever again. I do.

398
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,970
But I have to see you.

399
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,040
Why do you keep...

400
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,210
Forget it.

401
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,520
Why do I bother talking to you?

402
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,050
Later.

403
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,990
Don't forget about the shoot tomorrow.

404
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,160
Let's continue talking tomorrow.

405
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,160
She always disregards what I say.

406
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,620
(360 Donggyo-ro)

407
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,560
Woo-yeon.

408
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,320
Woo...

(Daeo Bookstore)

00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,740
("This Poem")

411
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,110
(Novels)

412
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,060
(To the person I loved so dearly.)

413
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,130
(I will never get over you.)

414
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,730
(I know I will never receive your love,
but I will always think of you.)

415
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,820
(All the preparations are done
for the memorial. Don't bring anything.)

416
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,800
I guess you won't give in this time,
Hyun-jae.

417
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,740
You don't have to help me like this.

418
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,710
Young-hee helps out at my house.
Naturally, I should do the same.

419
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,280
She blew up at you that day, didn't she?

420
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,480
Sorry.

421
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,550
She got my nasty temper.

422
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,290
Please tell me going forward
if you have problems again.

423
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,190
I'm fine if Young-hee gets mad at me
or curses at me,

424
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,630
but I hate seeing her struggle alone.

425
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,000
I want to scold that brat,

426
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,540
but I can't even get mad at her
because I haven't done anything for her.

427
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,680
I feel sorry for Young-hee.

428
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,150
She suffered ever since she was a kid

429
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,150
because she was stuck with bad parents.

430
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,560
She has a nasty temper,

431
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,560
but it's because she has so many scars

432
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,460
and because she developed thorns.

433
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,060
So please embrace her.

434
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,540
I know I have no right,

435
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,840
but please take good care of my daughter.

436
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,480
I'll be better to her.

437
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,889
- What?
- That's what I want to ask.

438
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,430
What's wrong with you? What's the problem?

439
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:10,829
I don't have a problem.

440
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,099
You've been acting aloof
and won't answer me.

441
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,900
You walk away if I go near you.

442
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,369
If there is no problem,

443
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,700
did you do something wrong to me?

444
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,400
In that situation,

445
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,309
most people ask
if the other person is mad at them.

446
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,010
Why would you be mad at me?
What did I do wrong that you'd be mad?

447
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,720
And this face would make you feel good
even if you were mad.

448
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,420
Hey. I really didn't want to say this,
but your face is one...

449
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,360
that you either love or hate.

450
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,220
Love or hate...

451
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,160
Find me anyone who hates it.

452
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,430
- Me. Kyung Woo-yeon.
- What?

453
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,700
I hate everything from head to toe,
your facial features,

454
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,730
your hair part, your piercings,
the way you dress, everything.

455
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,910
- Hey.
- What?

456
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,940
(Arcade)

457
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,580
Come with me.

458
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,050
(Insert bills)

459
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,520
Why are we here?

460
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,660
You should be grateful.

461
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,360
You'll never find a partner like me.

462
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,800
Who takes their partner to an arcade
to cheer her up?

463
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,060
I'm so thoughtful.

464
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,270
What's wrong with me?

465
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,770
We were just passing by it.

466
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,940
We were just passing by it,
so we could've just passed by it.

467
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,480
But I stopped for you,
so you should be grateful.

468
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,910
You can't cry because you lost, okay?

469
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,150
(I am waiting for you to challenge me!)

470
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,210
Okay.

471
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,940
I haven't played in too long.

472
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,110
Let's go again.

473
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,210
Okay.

474
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,020
Darn it.

475
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,470
You're so simple.

476
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,770
Look how happy you are now,
just because you won a few games.

477
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,470
Look who's talking.

478
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,040
You flipped out
just because you lost a few games.

479
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,580
You always suggest doing things
you're not even good at.

480
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,850
How can a person be good at everything?

481
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,450
Even as is,
I have way too much going for me.

482
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,990
(How can a person be good at everything?)

483
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,530
Even as is,
I have way too much going for me.

484
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,940
Come to think of it,

485
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,380
you were always the same.

486
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,080
I had no reason to be surprised.

487
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,310
You'll do it again too.

488
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,180
What?

489
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,990
I thought it was something unusual,
but it wasn't.

490
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,230
I used to come here often.

491
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,060
On nice days, cloudy days,

492
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,070
snowy days... Every type of day.

493
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,640
But in my memory,
it's always bright in Bukchon.

494
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,540
Is it because it's a neighborhood
that's loved?

495
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,140
A neighborhood that's loved?

496
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,380
It's a protected area.

497
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,080
If you want to protect something,

498
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,680
it means that's how much you love it.

499
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,990
You should go with that.

500
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,160
The concept.

501
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,990
"A feeling you want to protect."
Something like that.

502
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,300
I like it.

503
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,700
Maybe you are a good partner.

504
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,000
I told you I am.

505
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,090
Give me some too. I'm thirsty.

506
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,490
No. This has to last me a day.

507
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,570
Let me barge into your day.

508
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,010
Stop barging in already.

509
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,630
(So if I ever take a photo of someone,)

510
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,440
(it would mean...)

511
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,010
(I like that person a lot.)

512
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,160
(A feeling you want to protect)

513
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,770
(Mom and Dad fought every day.)

514
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,870
(How dare you disrespect me?)

515
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,200
(Dad screamed at Mom
for disrespecting the man of the house)

516
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,010
(- when all she did was keep the house.)
- You're disrespecting me now.

517
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,240
(Mom screamed back, telling him
to stop acting superior)

518
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,810
(about bringing home a tiny paycheck.)

519
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,220
(They said that they loved each other
at first.)

520
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,900
Mom.

521
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,230
Why...

522
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,470
Why did he have to
cancel his life insurance

523
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,640
right before he got sick?

524
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,410
You made me suffer all my life.

525
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Did you have to leave like that too,
you jerk?

526
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,950
How are we supposed to survive now?

527
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,700
(The chemical reaction of love and poverty
results in hatred.)

528
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,870
(That was my view on life.)

529
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,310
Why did you make so much all by yourself?

530
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,880
Hyun-jae came by.

531
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,520
Don't get mad. I didn't call him.

532
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,230
He said I had to prepare everything
since you were working,

533
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,960
so he was worried and wanted to help.

534
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,500
I refused over and over.

535
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,470
He's amazing.

536
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,770
You won't meet a guy like him.

537
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,940
So don't drag it out, and get married.

538
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,370
Get married when we have nothing?

539
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,970
We need something at least.

540
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,980
You don't need a lot of money.

541
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,010
Even if you start in a studio,
if you both work hard--

542
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,620
What if we have nothing ready,
and get pregnant?

543
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,680
Should I blame the baby

544
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,050
for ruining my life?

545
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,350
Like you and Dad did?

546
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,560
What's wrong with you?

547
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,020
I don't want to do that.

548
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,190
That's why I absolutely refuse
to get married right now.

549
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,560
Brat.

550
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,010
(Woo-yeon)
(Young-hee.)

551
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,510
(Beer tonight? Are you in?)

552
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,480
(Okay.)

553
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,680
(Jin-ju)
(I'm totally in.)

554
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,890
I'll be your Cupid tonight.

555
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,360
What is this? What are you doing here?

556
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,830
I'm going to check something.

557
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Check what?

558
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,070
What I mean is...
I'm going to check something.

559
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,900
Let me have three seconds.
Just three seconds.

560
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,310
Fine, just three seconds.

561
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,820
What are you checking anyway?

562
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,110
Hey...

563
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,710
Are you crazy?

564
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,980
Are you sick?

565
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,480
I think so.

566
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,920
What's going on?
I think you're really sick.

567
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Hey.

568
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,560
You really have a fever.

569
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,330
Wait here.

570
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,810
(Medication Instructions)

571
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,380
Are you sick?

572
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,880
You have a fever.

573
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,620
(Medication Instructions)

574
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,420
Give me your keys. I'll drive you home.

575
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,060
Why are you nice to me? Do you like me?

576
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,000
You should thank my principle
to be gentle with the sick.

577
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,440
Why did you give me this medicine?
Why are you driving me home?

578
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,870
Did you buy me medicine last time
because you like me?

579
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,670
If buying medicine or giving a ride
means someone likes you,

580
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,940
then pharmacists and chauffeurs
must be philanthropists.

581
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,750
I guess it started then.

582
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,520
Why are you giving this to me?

583
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,760
What is this?

584
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,690
By the way, what are you doing here?

585
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,660
I thought you were hurt.

586
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,910
Drive carefully. Both my mind and body
are weak right now.

587
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,510
Make sure you take your medicine.
I'm leaving.

588
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,040
Woo-yeon.

589
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,680
Did you answer that CEO?

590
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,710
Answer what?

591
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,350
His confession.

592
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,490
Why are you asking that?

593
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,690
Answer me.

594
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,190
No. Not yet.

595
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,360
You told me you'd date him
unless something happens.

596
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,630
So what?

597
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,470
Well, something happened to you.

598
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,470
Go on a date with me tomorrow.

599
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,740
- Are you joking?
- It's not a joke.

600
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,280
Go on a date with me.

601
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,850
I'm watching a musical
with Mr. On tomorrow.

602
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,850
- At what time?
- At 7:30 p.m.

603
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,450
Okay. Then meet me in front
of Namsan Tower

604
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,420
at 7:30 p.m.

605
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,530
I saved it to go on a special day
with a special person,

606
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,260
but I never got to go.

607
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,030
See you tomorrow. I'll be waiting.

608
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,600
I said I have plans tomorrow.

609
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,170
Then I'll wait until you come.

610
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,540
Hey. I'm not coming.

611
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,140
I told you I'm not coming.

612
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,440
I also said that I'd wait until you come.

613
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,540
Hey.

614
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:56,280
I said I'm not coming.

615
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,320
What was that?

616
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,890
Did something happen to his head?

617
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,370
Are you trying to act cute?

618
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,040
I thought something happened to you.

619
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,710
I didn't have anything
when I was texting you,

620
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,350
but something did happen.

621
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,320
- What?
- What is it?

622
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,890
So you're meeting Mr. On tomorrow
after his confession...

623
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,960
But then Soo asked you out tomorrow
to go to Namsan Tower?

624
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,760
Namsan Tower of all places?

625
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,200
Are you torn right now
when we're talking about Mr. On?

626
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,970
He's the perfect guy.

627
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,540
If only good catches survived,

628
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,140
why would people like Cinderella
or On-dal the Fool exist in this world?

629
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,410
Meanwhile, I'm jealous.

630
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,750
It's a problem if you have
no men or too many men.

631
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,330
So? What are you going to do?

632
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,060
Who do you want to go to?

633
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,700
- Goodness.
- I feel zero tension.

634
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,270
What do you mean?

635
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,140
You already said your answer
when you hesitated.

636
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,480
She said her answer when she
sighed after calling us here.

637
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,310
I didn't do that.

638
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,180
- I know you'll go to Soo.
- I know you'll go to Soo.

639
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,210
Right?

640
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,720
I won't.

641
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,790
I'm not that stupid.

642
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:46,990
- Yes, you are.
- Yes, you are.

643
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,660
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

644
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,430
How exhilarating. How refreshing.

645
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,340
Being handsome is the best.

646
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,970
I'm sorry.

647
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,580
Do you have to go?

648
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,250
I'm really sorry.

649
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,820
Hey, are you okay?

650
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,790
You scared me half to death.

651
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,420
Why did you have to get hit by a car
all the way at Namsan?

652
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,760
Why did you go there anyway?

653
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,430
- Hey.
- Where's my phone?

654
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,300
Seriously. You were out cold
for an hour with a concussion,

655
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,100
and the first thing you do is
ask for your phone?

656
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,570
Give me my phone.

657
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,770
Fine.

658
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,540
Lie down. I'll get the doctor.

659
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,380
Woo-yeon, you're not still waiting for me,
are you?

660
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,950
(What?)

661
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,850
Something suddenly came up,
so I couldn't make it.

662
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,960
In case you were waiting...

663
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,190
(I told you)

664
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,130
I had plans.

665
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,300
You didn't go?

666
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,930
No.

667
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,300
Why?

668
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,440
Why couldn't you make it?

669
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,310
It's nothing serious.

670
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,560
(Hello?)

671
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,720
(Woo-yeon.)

672
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,990
It's nothing serious.

673
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,100
Sorry,

674
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,100
I'm with Mr. On now, so I have to go.

675
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,410
Hey. What are you doing? Are you insane?

676
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,050
Hey.

677
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,770
What are you doing here?

678
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,400
I was waiting for you.

679
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,540
Why did you wait?

680
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,140
I thought I'd be able to see you
if I waited.

681
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,950
Are you stupid?

682
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,520
You should get angry at me
for leaving like that.

683
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,290
You should curse me out.

684
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,460
You should at least resent me. Why...

685
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,360
Why did you wait?

686
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,130
I didn't come to resent you.

687
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,600
Because I couldn't tell you this.

688
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,840
Happy birthday, Woo-yeon.

689
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,170
I'm not too late, am I?

690
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,580
Definitely not.

691
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,300
(When the wolf appeared,)

692
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,940
(the boy regretted it the most.)

693
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,040
(Because the boy never knew)

694
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,280
(that a wolf would really appear.)

695
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,780
(Life is filled with
intersecting lives and incidents.)

696
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,020
(Benjamin Button said)

697
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,390
(that whether intentional or not,
there's no way to stop them.)

698
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,030
(I was getting my hair done
to see Woo-yeon.)

699
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,670
(At the same time,
a woman leaving for her date)

700
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,940
(returned home because she got a run
in her stockings.)

701
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,880
(She changed her stockings
for about two minutes.)

702
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,940
(No Parking)

703
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,710
(The man who was waiting for her
saw police officers)

704
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,450
(and decided to circle the block.)

705
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,590
(The woman came out
and waited for her boyfriend.)

706
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,090
(I was just leaving the salon.)

707
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,460
(The man who had driven around the block)

708
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,460
(picked up the woman
who was waiting for him.)

709
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:59,030
(The boy who was crossing the street
was heading to his academy)

710
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,500
(five minutes later than usual.)

711
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:04,170
(He was engrossed in his game
and lost track of time.)

712
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,910
(Right when the boy
was crossing the street,)

713
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,540
(I was buying a gift for Woo-yeon.)

714
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,780
(When I was buying the gift,
the woman ordered a drink at a cafe.)

715
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,920
(But she received the wrong drink.)
- Here you go.

716
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,350
I asked for it hot.

717
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,490
I'm sorry.

718
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,360
(One of the workers didn't come in,
so she was frazzled.)

719
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,060
(The woman got the new drink
and got in the car,)

720
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,900
(and a delivery truck blocked the car.)

721
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,670
(Right then,)

722
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,400
(I was heading to our meet-up spot.)

723
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,110
(The truck moved,
so the car started to go again.)

724
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,540
(Sang-hyeok)

725
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,050
(When I pulled into the garage,)

726
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,710
- What's up?
(- I got out of the car with the gift.)

727
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,320
(When the man reached his destination,)

728
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,350
(I struggled briefly with my umbrella.)

729
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,470
You really are hopeless, Woo-yeon.

730
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,880
(If only one thing had been different...)

731
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,580
(If just one thing had been different...)

732
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,960
(If my umbrella had opened
on the first try,)

733
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,390
(or if the truck hadn't stopped them,)

734
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,900
(or if the cafe worker hadn't been sick
and the correct drink was made...)

735
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,800
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

736
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,840
(If the boy had left on time,)

737
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,840
(or if the police
hadn't passed by right then,)

738
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,470
(or if her stockings had not run,)

739
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,980
(I would've gone to you,)

740
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,580
(and that car)

741
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,650
(would've just driven by.)

742
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,150
(But life is a series of countless
intersecting lives and incidents.)

743
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,030
(One which no one can control.)

744
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,930
So he said...

745
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,870
(The man looked away momentarily
while he was driving)

746
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,800
(and hit me.)

747
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,540
(The one thing that should've changed...)

748
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:22,140
(Sang-hyeok)

749
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,110
(wasn't any of the events today,)

750
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,990
(but my feelings
that I realized too late.)
