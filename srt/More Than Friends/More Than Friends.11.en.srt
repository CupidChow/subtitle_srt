1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,580
Woo-yeon.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,260
Do it. Explain, make excuses, anything.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,860
I'll believe anything you say,
even if it's a lie.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,330
You should've listened
when I wanted to explain.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,700
That's why I came right after you.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,060
And if you do,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,170
does that take away what you said?

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,100
Will my feelings disappear?

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,040
So let's talk.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,210
Let go first.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,710
You stay out of it. You have no right.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,880
I don't need a right.
Woo-yeon says she doesn't want to talk.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,520
You said opportunities lost
become regrets, right?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,360
Just keep regretting it.

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,770
What's your problem?
Do you have something to say to me?

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,080
Even saying you like someone hurts
if you say it like it's nothing.

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,810
How long are you going to follow me?

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
You're making me uncomfortable.

19
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,250
That was the point.

20
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,650
So that you're too distracted
to remember his nasty words.

21
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,360
Can't I pick up the opportunity

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,330
that he lost?

23
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,560
Why do you want
someone else's opportunity?

24
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,960
It's an opportunity only when he has it.

25
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,670
What you have

26
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,570
is not an opportunity.

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,740
I got excited for nothing.

28
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,580
I thought it was an opportunity.

29
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,680
You should stop too.

30
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,920
Stop coming.

31
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,750
I don't know how to stop.

32
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,890
We met too rashly
and broke up too suddenly.

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,360
My heart hasn't caught up yet
to the situation.

34
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,500
So please

35
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,629
give me some time.

36
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,110
All I can do

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,270
is stand in front of you

38
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,710
as if I'm being punished.

39
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,680
How could I ever punish you?

40
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,180
Are you still being punished?

41
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,120
Probably.

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,290
I'm the one being punished.

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,800
Go inside.

44
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,430
I'll go.

45
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,990
- Why are you here?
- You punk.

46
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,000
How could you greet your dad with
"Why are you here?"

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,000
Because I'm not glad to see you.

48
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,070
I'm so hurt.

49
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,540
Do you have any alcohol?

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,709
This isn't a bar.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
What happened between you and that girl?

52
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,300
I guess it didn't go well.

53
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,770
What about you? What happened with Mom?

54
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,450
That man isn't her boyfriend.

55
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,450
It wasn't a date.

56
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,850
You're talking to me, right?

57
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,220
Then who else?

58
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,090
You sounded like
you were talking to yourself.

59
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,660
You seem to want to believe that.

60
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,470
Believe what you want.

61
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,600
If that's what you want to believe,
go ahead.

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,470
Don't let a misunderstanding torture you.

63
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,810
If you like someone,
then listen to everything they say.

64
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,310
Trust them no matter what.

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,050
That way,
you won't have any regrets later.

66
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,880
Are you regretting, Dad?

67
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,450
That's

68
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,220
my specialty.

69
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,790
Is it hereditary?

70
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,970
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be studying?

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,440
I'll study when I have to.
You're not my mom.

72
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,480
- Mom.
- Watch it.

73
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,720
If I'm not around,
your sister is your mom.

74
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,350
No, she's just my sister.

75
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,020
Also, you're going to be around.

76
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,560
Do you think I'll live forever?

77
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,430
Do you think only you grow older?

78
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,130
I'm aging.

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,630
Yes, you should age.

80
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,340
Let us watch you become an old lady
after living a long time.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,510
Cheol-su, isn't it time to pay
for your after school classes?

82
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,940
Why didn't they charge me?

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,910
They will soon.

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm leaving.

85
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,520
- Bye.
- Okay, baby. Go and study hard.

86
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,320
Don't make me throw up.

87
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,790
- Hyun-jae.
- Long time no see, Cheol-su.

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,460
- Where are you going?
- To the library.

89
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,020
Wait.

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,360
I'm not a kid. Bye.

91
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,230
That punk.

92
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,470
He's all grown up.

93
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,000
Are you well, Mother?

94
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,840
Yes. It's so nice to see my son-in-law.

95
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,680
We're not even married, and everyone
treats him like he's my husband.

96
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,050
I like it. What's wrong?

97
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,950
Go and buy something
for Hyun-jae to drink.

98
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,150
I'm okay.

99
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,220
I'll have an iced americano.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,290
Okay.

101
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,230
Here.

102
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
- Hyun-jae.
- Yes. Please go ahead.

103
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,650
It must be tough.

104
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,320
They have nurses caring for patients
at this ward, so guardians aren't needed.

105
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,090
I'm doing better than you think.

106
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,470
I'm sorry I can't help you
with the burden.

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,370
I'm sorry I'm always having a hard time.

108
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,470
Say something else other than "I'm sorry".

109
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:19,780
I love you.

110
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,020
I love you more.

111
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,290
My poor baby is sick.
I don't know what to do.

112
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,500
I wish I could be sick in your place.

113
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,500
Gosh. I hope my daughter gets better soon.

114
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,200
- It hurts my heart.
- My mom

115
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,870
died when I was really young.

116
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,410
I can't even remember her face properly.

117
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,480
But these days,

118
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,820
I miss my mom although
I can't remember her face.

119
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,120
When I think about it,

120
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,630
there aren't many moments

121
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,760
when I miss my mom.

122
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,900
But at that moment,

123
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm really desperate.

124
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,140
I bet.

125
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm worried about my kids.

126
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,940
I don't even remember my mom well,

127
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,550
but I miss her so dearly.

128
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,550
I feel sorry for my daughter.

129
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,690
When she's sick,

130
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,160
who'll be there for her?

131
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,310
No, no.

132
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,280
(Cafe Manager)

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,620
(Ms. Kyung,)

134
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,580
(a new part-timer is coming tomorrow.)

135
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,390
(Please train them well.)

136
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,620
I hate myself for being like this.

137
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,430
(Kyung Woo-yeon)

138
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,280
Why is it so hard?

139
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,730
Let's meet.

140
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,270
Why did you ask to see me here?

141
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,640
Then why did you show up?

142
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,910
To talk about something else.

143
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,380
I want Woo-yeon to be happy
more than anyone.

144
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,790
I don't mind if she's not with me.
It doesn't matter who she's with.

145
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,850
Except

146
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
for you.

147
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,760
Who are you to decide that?

148
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,560
If you hurt her once,
you can hurt her again.

149
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,700
If she was hurt before,
she'll be hurt again

150
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,170
because she'll get used to being hurt.

151
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,940
What do you know about me and Woo-yeon?

152
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,940
I know the face she makes
after being hurt by you.

153
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,610
I know the sad face she makes
behind your back,

154
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,250
and I know her hurtful face
after turning away from you.

155
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,180
I also saw

156
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,050
her face as she waited for you
despite all that.

157
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,260
That's why you're no good for her.

158
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,180
Did Hyun-jae leave?

159
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,220
Yes.

160
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,020
Make sure you hang onto his hand

161
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,560
and don't let go.

162
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,490
He's a good boy.

163
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,530
I know that too.

164
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,930
You should hurry up and get married.

165
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,100
I'll take care of that.

166
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,170
I know.

167
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,740
You were always good
at taking care of things on your own.

168
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,710
I never did anything for you.

169
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,750
Although I don't like what you say,

170
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,380
I'll let you get away with it
since you're sick.

171
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,850
I'm not being sarcastic.

172
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,030
I'm sorry I let you grow up
so independently.

173
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,960
I'm sorry I left you on your own.

174
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,770
That's why you should hurry up
and get better.

175
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,940
Don't leave me on my own from now.

176
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm going to sleep.

177
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
You should go.

178
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,870
It doesn't look like this misfortune

179
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
will ever end.

180
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,780
=Episode 11: The End=

181
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,760
What is this? Is it a solo drinking day
or something?

182
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,110
Why are you sitting there?

183
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
I purposefully sat away for you.

184
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,880
Just tell me to leave, why don't you?

185
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,450
Don't leave and sit in front of me.

186
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,130
Both Woo-yeon and Jin-ju
are fast to tell me to leave.

187
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,770
Why did you tell me to sit down?

188
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,140
Do you think I told you to sit
because I like you?

189
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,340
Objectively speaking,

190
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,310
I didn't do anything wrong
to you or Jin-ju.

191
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,910
But we saw it all.

192
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,410
We saw Woo-yeon's ten years.

193
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,980
We watched her emotions for too long,
and it caught onto us.

194
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,830
Why did you tell me to sit down
if you don't like me either?

195
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,760
No reason. I'm happy to see you.

196
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,730
I don't feel welcomed,

197
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,730
but it must be just a hunch.

198
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,080
You look like the world is going
to fall apart.

199
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,280
Just tell me. It looks more serious
when you talk with body language.

200
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
Do you know Rapunzel?

201
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
Yes. The one with long hair, right?

202
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,720
Do you know where she lives?

203
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,990
In a tower?

204
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,090
Yes.

205
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,500
There are no stairs or ropes,

206
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,470
but there's a window.
She lives at the top of the tower.

207
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,540
She can look out, but never go out.

208
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,850
The top of the tower.

209
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,380
I feel like I'm there too.

210
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,450
Why are you telling me this?

211
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,360
Because you're going to leave.

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,860
I can be honest with someone who'll leave.

213
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,630
You can't live in such a place.

214
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,500
Higher floors are more expensive.

215
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,370
You suit

216
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,800
somewhere around the 15th floor.

217
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,470
You're kind of cute.

218
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,710
Don't fall for me. I belong to Woo-yeon.

219
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,880
Fine, but why are you making
that confession here?

220
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,410
I tend to do it everywhere.

221
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,120
I do it in front of others
whenever I get the chance,

222
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,150
and I do it to Woo-yeon
whenever I can make it happen.

223
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:52,460
Wait.

224
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,369
Give me your hand.

225
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,200
- It's okay.
- Take it. Take it.

226
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,909
- I said I'm okay.
- Just take it.

227
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,720
Are you serious?

228
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,190
What do you want to eat?
Should we order more drinks?

229
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,020
Hey, put a case of soju under Soo's name.

230
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,500
- "A case"?
- Yes.

231
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,630
Here.

232
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,910
What is it?

233
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,050
I made you a lunchbox.

234
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,350
Don't order jjajangmyeon for lunch.

235
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,360
Why are you giving this to me?

236
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,120
No reason.

237
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,060
It's true

238
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,900
I said what I said when I was angry,

239
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,670
but I didn't grow my feelings from anger.

240
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,170
I really

241
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,970
like you.

242
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,340
You pity me, don't you?

243
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,680
Do you feel sorry for me

244
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,850
- after what happened with...
- It's not pity. It's affection.

245
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,650
I don't feel sorry for you.
I have feelings for you.

246
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,190
I'm confessing.

247
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm asking you to date me.

248
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,130
Hey.

249
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,860
I'm not crazy. Why would I date you?

250
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,200
I know

251
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,470
you didn't live this hard
to date someone like me.

252
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,870
But you know,

253
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,610
I don't have to be your final stop.

254
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
I can be a station you pass by.

255
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,650
A station where you transfer.

256
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,880
When you find a good guy,

257
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,590
you can go to him.

258
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,620
I'll let you go without any regrets.

259
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,760
What is this? You make it sound serious.

260
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,100
I'm serious.

261
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,170
If you really don't want to date me,

262
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,870
you can just play with me.

263
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,510
I'll be your toy.

264
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,050
Don't answer me right away.

265
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,280
Answer me
after you think about it seriously.

266
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,450
There's no need
to think about it seriously.

267
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,690
Just look. I have goosebumps all over me.

268
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,090
- Do you see it?
- That's because you're cold.

269
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,590
Go inside and eat.

270
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,460
I'm leaving.

271
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,060
Bring the box over later.

272
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,770
I'm really leaving.

273
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,480
What's with him?

274
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,290
(Prosecutor Han Jin-ju)

275
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,900
I'd have butterflies
if this was from a different guy.

276
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,010
Coffees are on the right,
milk teas are on the left.

277
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,210
- Check the date on the receipt...
- Okay.

278
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,880
Welcome.

279
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,030
Hello.

280
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,600
Can you refill the napkins
and the straws in the hall?

281
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Okay.

282
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,030
Okay.

283
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,710
Coupon. I was fair this time.

284
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,080
I didn't say anything.

285
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,180
One iced americano.

286
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,940
Please wait, sir.

287
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,450
I came to apologize.

288
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,660
It's okay.

289
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,590
I understand why
it could've happened that day.

290
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,130
I'm sorry about that day
and the day before too.

291
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,800
I came to apologize for everything.

292
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,540
I didn't know telling you my feelings
like that could hurt you too.

293
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,570
I was mad to see you with him,

294
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,780
and it hurt me when you told me
you don't like me.

295
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,420
I put my feelings first
and acted like a kid. I'm sorry.

296
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,290
Did you eat something wrong?

297
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm on an empty stomach.
Let's eat together.

298
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,020
- I'm working.
- I'll wait until you're done.

299
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,590
See you later, Woo-yeon.

300
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Mr. On.

301
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,770
Sorry, but no.

302
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,640
You don't even know
what I was going to ask.

303
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,380
I can't drink.

304
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,350
How did you know?

305
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,380
You should change the way
you always ask me.

306
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,980
It's you who should change.

307
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,220
You're going to Ms. Kyung right now,
aren't you?

308
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,120
How much longer are you going to do this?

309
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
I don't know

310
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
how long it'll last
and what I should do either.

311
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,730
That's why I'm looking for a solution.

312
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,230
There is no solution.

313
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,830
It's the wrong proposition
and an epigraph.

314
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,370
You should throw out such a sentence.

315
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,340
Sometimes an epigraph can become a poem.

316
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,740
When someone hurts you,
you should be hurt.

317
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,580
If you keep on saying you're okay
with every rock thrown at you,

318
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,750
one day you'll face a boulder.

319
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,650
I'll try to act like I'm okay
with a boulder too.

320
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,320
You'll be crushed to death.

321
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,990
Seriously. Who is she to you
for you to go this far?

322
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,660
I want to try things at least,
but she won't allow me any room.

323
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,120
It's best you don't.

324
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,730
I can't watch her get hurt.

325
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,230
Then turn your eyes away.

326
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,360
You're just an onlooker now.

327
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,250
Your americano is ready.

328
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,270
Darn it.

329
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,370
Are you okay?

330
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Hey.

331
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,610
Are you okay?

332
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,360
Welcome.

333
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,530
Is Ms. Kyung Woo-yeon not in today?

334
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,300
She went to the hospital.

335
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,500
"The hospital"? Is she sick?
Did she get hurt?

336
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,300
No, she didn't get hurt.

337
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,700
Her friend was hurt.

338
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,440
He was very good looking.

339
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,980
I hope it won't scar.

340
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,020
You'll have to take responsibility.

341
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,280
I'll pay the hospital bill.

342
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,520
Woo-yeon is looking at me
because I'm hurt.

343
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,230
Will she keep looking at me if it scars?

344
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,100
Let me remove that.

345
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,810
Don't get it wet for a while

346
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,020
and put the ointment on
according to the schedule.

347
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
Okay.

348
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,650
You may go now.

349
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,720
Let's go.

350
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
What are you doing?

351
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,060
Hold my hand. I'm hurt.

352
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,320
Are you insane?
Why do you hurt yourself for someone else?

353
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,460
What if you get seriously injured?
Do you think they'll take care of you?

354
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,530
Are you okay?

355
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,280
I went to the cafe but you weren't there.

356
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,120
Stop going there.

357
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,390
I'm going to quit.

358
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,190
Did you clear up the misunderstanding
with him?

359
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,400
I happened to hear
when I went to the cafe.

360
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,530
I guess so.

361
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,400
He keeps getting new opportunities

362
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,640
even after he loses them.

363
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,640
I envy him.

364
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,880
I guess that's true too.

365
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,450
If there's really nothing I can do,

366
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
maybe I should punish you after all.

367
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,260
But I'm not the only one
being punished then.

368
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,890
You feel like you're being punished too.

369
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,060
I think being punished may be better.

370
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,540
Why are you doing this to me?

371
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,370
Even if I combine all the guilt

372
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,240
I've ever felt toward anyone,

373
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,910
it doesn't compare to you.

374
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,080
But you know,

375
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,350
no matter how bad I may feel,

376
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,420
it doesn't beat my liking him.

377
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,890
Even if he throws opportunities
and my feelings on the ground,

378
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,760
I keep wanting to put them back
in his hand.

379
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,670
So please stop making me feel bad.

380
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,630
(Obey traffic laws)

381
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,820
Hey.

382
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,520
- The security camera?
- The camera? Oh. Yes.

383
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
I guess I should go then.

384
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,130
Okay. Get home safely.

385
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
You're a rare breed these days.

386
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,430
She says she's too scared
to go to the bathroom,

387
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,430
and he installs a camera right away.

388
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,040
- Pardon?
- I was talking to myself.

389
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,010
- What was that?
- Did you eat?

390
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,880
Is that all you care to ask me?

391
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,010
No.

392
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,710
Then may I ask what I really want to know?

393
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
No.

394
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,620
Don't be scared.

395
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,020
Hey. Let me make myself clear.

396
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,560
I don't want...

397
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,830
I only want to be friends with you.

398
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,100
I'm going to go on blind dates. Right.

399
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm going to meet a really great guy
and get my happily ever after.

400
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,140
Okay.

401
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,740
You accepted that rather quickly.

402
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,080
You just said you don't like me.

403
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,520
I'll just do my best to win you over.

404
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,090
- Win what over?
- You. You, that's what.

405
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,750
- Sit down and eat.
- Stop telling me to eat!

406
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,020
Do you want tteokbokki?

407
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,740
(Soo)

408
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,800
Hello?

409
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,470
(Woo-yeon.)

410
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,210
What's wrong?

411
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,680
Are you sick?

412
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,050
I ran over because you sounded
like you were about to die.

413
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,590
How can you eat right now?

414
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,060
Well. It's delicious. Eat some.

415
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,360
I'll shut my mouth since you got hurt
because of me.

416
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,260
Don't shut your mouth. Eat.

417
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,010
I guess I need to get hurt
for you to eat with me.

418
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,410
It's our first time eating alone together
since I came to Seoul.

419
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,650
- Really?
- It's nice being hurt.

420
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,480
I get to eat with Woo-yeon.

421
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,390
- What?
- You seem very unfamiliar.

422
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,530
Why? Did I do something wrong?

423
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,560
This is unfamiliar too.

424
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,470
Just call me if you need me.

425
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,000
Don't fake being sick like earlier.

426
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,040
You scared me.

427
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,640
Really?

428
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,110
Yes, really.

429
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,710
You'll regret it.

430
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,950
(Soo)

431
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,750
Hello?

432
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,760
(- Woo-yeon.)
- Yes?

433
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,200
What does hurting your back
have to do with watching a movie?

434
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm emotionally weak right now,
so I get scared in the dark.

435
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,510
(Soo)

436
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,550
Hello?

437
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,650
(Woo-yeon.)

438
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,220
(Woo-yeon.)

439
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,630
(Soo)

440
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,000
Woo-yeon.

441
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,210
Please... Please, will you please
stop saying my name?

442
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,480
Please stop saying my name.

443
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,540
You said to call you whenever I need you.

444
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,780
Don't you know moderation at all?

445
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,380
Is it fun for you to torment me?

446
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,420
I won't torment you if you come to me.
I'll be good to you.

447
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,320
Let's go.

448
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,790
Why won't this go?

449
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,860
Let's go.

450
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,070
Hello?

451
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,880
Kim Cheol-su's academy tuition
wasn't taken out yet.

452
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,420
He quit?

453
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,890
What's his problem?

454
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,860
Who shows up 20 minutes late
to a blind date?

455
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,130
Han Jin-ju?

456
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,040
Oh...

457
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,270
Yes.

458
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,320
Hey, you! Hey! Bring me some water.

459
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,550
Why are you snapping your fingers
at people?

460
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,320
Who cares? The customer is king.

461
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,760
Enjoy.

462
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,760
You must be superficial and extravagant.

463
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,400
Pardon?

464
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,439
Do you drive an imported car?

465
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,039
Oh, yes.

466
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,939
Imported cars are nice.
Sports cars are nice.

467
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,180
But if you consider the initial
expenditure and fuel efficiency,

468
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,709
it's actually a waste of money.

469
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,680
I have lots of cash
and wasting it is my hobby.

470
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:38,950
That's not your building, Jin-ju.
It's your parents' building.

471
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:41,920
It's not like a prosecutor makes much.

472
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,630
I'm sure I make more than
an average salary-man.

473
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,270
I didn't take you for that kind of person.

474
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,600
You like to make men feel small.

475
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,180
Why aren't you eating?

476
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,750
Are you pretending to be ladylike?

477
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,150
I like women who enjoy their food.

478
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,260
I can't eat. I have anorexia.

479
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,290
Then have a glass of lassi.

480
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,600
The lassi here is delicious.

481
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,540
You darned lame...

482
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,770
Lassi.

483
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,580
An injured person shouldn't cook.

484
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,750
I'm getting over my regret.

485
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,290
Sit and wait. It won't take long.

486
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,090
Okay.

487
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,500
Free your schedule tomorrow.
We're going somewhere.

488
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,570
Okay.

489
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,870
Do you photograph people now?

490
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,880
Yes.

491
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,350
I think I will a lot from now on.

492
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,650
Are you going to travel again?

493
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,520
I should. Traveling is my job.

494
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,600
Yes.

495
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,030
Traveling is your job.

496
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,340
There you go.

497
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,980
Lots of seafood and firm noodles

498
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,180
with lots of Cheongyang chilies.

499
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,650
Do you know how upset I was
after you left the way you did?

500
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,320
What is it now?

501
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,630
What did I do wrong?

502
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,400
You didn't do anything wrong.

503
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,140
My heart skips a beat
whenever you give me that look.

504
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,110
I get scared you'll jump up and leave.

505
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,210
I hope your back doesn't scar.

506
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,180
Why? Are you afraid
I'll use it to cling to you?

507
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,250
If it scars, I'd feel bad for
your future girlfriends.

508
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,650
Hey, Kyung Woo-yeon.

509
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,860
No woman loves a man who'll leave her.

510
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,560
Your dream is so far away.

511
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,330
If you're looking for a woman
who'll wait for you like a port,

512
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,570
that's not me.

513
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,470
I said I was okay with you being
halfway around the world, 12 hours apart,

514
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,340
and I said I could wait for
the rest of my life when I was 18.

515
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,040
That me is gone now.

516
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,060
Why did you insist on joining me?

517
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,660
You paid for dinner,

518
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,200
so I'll provide some company.

519
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,530
I'm being considerate.

520
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,270
That's too much consideration.

521
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,070
Is it because it's an imported car?
It is quite nice, isn't it?

522
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,410
Everything's automatic.

523
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,410
Should I just kill him?

524
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,480
I'll do the dishes.

525
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,320
I'll do it.

526
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,320
No, let me.

527
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,890
I didn't invite you over
to make you wash dishes.

528
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,600
Instead,

529
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,630
get me a milk tea.

530
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,230
Okay.

531
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,210
Jin... Jin-ju.

532
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,680
What do you want?

533
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,940
I need...

534
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,980
I need to go to the toilet.

535
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,180
Right now?

536
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,590
When the traffic's this jammed?

537
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,020
I don't think

538
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,960
- I can plug it.
- Plug it! Keep it in at all costs.

539
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,990
- I think I might die.
- Darn you!

540
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,600
You just had to gulp down your lassi.

541
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,230
Hang in there a bit.

542
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,530
No, I can't.

543
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,340
Welcome. What can I get you?

544
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,980
I'll have two black sugar
bubble milk teas.

545
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,380
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

546
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,620
Shake it 15 times before using your straw.

547
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,950
Thank you.

548
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,620
Enjoy your drink.

549
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,720
Bye.

550
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,020
What took you so long to let me in?

551
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,090
Sorry.

552
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,710
Why? What's wrong?

553
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,040
- Take it off.
- What?

554
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,040
- Take it off.
- What are you doing, Woo-yeon?

555
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,050
Pull yourself together.

556
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,090
If you're in pain,
you should've made me leave

557
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,890
or asked me to put cream on for you.

558
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,300
Why didn't you say anything?

559
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,530
I don't want you to leave,

560
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,400
and you'll only get upset
if you see my back.

561
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,570
Are you stupid?

562
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,480
I think my IQ is evaporating these days

563
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,980
when I'm with you.

564
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,110
You confess your love whenever you can.

565
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,550
I do what I can whenever I can
and you still block me out.

566
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,530
Hey, you smiled. You smiled, didn't you?

567
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,790
Keep still.

568
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,530
Don't move too much.

569
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,610
I know even the back of
my head's handsome.

570
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,180
(The person you have reached...)

571
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,690
The psycho disappeared?

572
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,680
What is it?

573
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,220
What's wrong?

574
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,890
You quit your extra lessons
to work part-time?

575
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,630
Yes, I'll make money.
I'll make lots of money.

576
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,530
Who told you to make money?

577
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,370
If you need more allowance,
I'll give you more. Just study.

578
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,200
Are you Mom?

579
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,970
Why would you give me
an allowance when Mom doesn't?

580
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,940
Why do you act more like a mom
than Mom does?

581
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,040
Will you just quit bothering me
and just get married?

582
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,510
I'll take care of Mom.

583
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,650
Can you do that by flipping burgers?

584
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,180
I won't get married so...

585
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,390
Get married. Why wouldn't you?

586
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,950
You want to get married.

587
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,060
If you stay single because of us
and die alone,

588
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,230
I bet Mom and I would just love that.

589
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,300
Darn it.

590
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,570
Kim Cheol...

591
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,740
Must you act out too right now?

592
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,800
What is it?

593
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,370
- What's what?
- What? What's up?

594
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,470
I need a drink because I'm perplexed,
so why do you both have long faces?

595
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,410
- Why are you perplexed?
- I bet it's Soo.

596
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,780
I am so sick of this.

597
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,150
Not as sick as the one involved.

598
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,880
What about you, Young-hee?

599
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,650
Cheol-su's all grown up.

600
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,760
- What's wrong with that?
- Don't ask.

601
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,860
What about your blind date?

602
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,330
What? You went on a blind date?

603
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,930
My blind date.

604
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,570
That's crazy.

605
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,340
How could he poop in your car?

606
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,380
How could he poop in the seat
and just disappear?

607
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,110
You don't believe it either, do you?

608
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,710
I'm still wondering if it really happened.

609
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,880
You should consult a fortune-teller.

610
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,280
Something's definitely wrong.

611
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,820
That was too drastic.

612
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,520
You're really okay, aren't you, Young-hee?

613
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,390
Is this a bad time for me to whine?

614
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,090
Don't you mind me tonight.

615
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,930
Even if the skies cave in,
you have the right to whine.

616
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,270
Yes.

617
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,470
I'm not too pleased to have that right.

618
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,340
People say that your life is a play.

619
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,310
If this is a play,

620
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,110
I want to murder the scriptwriter.

621
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,480
Me too.

622
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,950
My scriptwriter
has a thing for unrequited love.

623
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,290
Why should one's love be so tiresome?

624
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,390
He's a real pervert.

625
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,360
The poop-and-dash.

626
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,730
I didn't want to win
with an episode like that.

627
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,870
Where's your car?

628
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,540
Yes. Did you clean it up yourself?

629
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,170
I left it at a repair shop.

630
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,780
What did Soo say to you?

631
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,120
It's not like he says much.

632
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,950
There's a behind story to this.

633
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,460
Not at all.

634
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,730
There is something.

635
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,280
(Mont Best)

636
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,110
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

637
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,850
Don't you have a pack of six?
That's the daily dose.

638
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,680
Just a moment, please.

639
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,030
Han Jin-ju.

640
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,340
Are you okay?

641
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,470
Oh, dear. It's okay. It's fine.

642
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,940
I tried to wipe it all off,

643
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,280
but I just couldn't,
so I took it to a repair shop.

644
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,350
You can pick it up in two days,
Ms. Prosecutor.

645
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,660
Your ugly face
is even uglier when you cry.

646
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,730
Why are you so nice to me?

647
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,760
I'm not nice to you.

648
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,630
I haven't done anything for you yet.

649
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,300
If I really start being nice to you,

650
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,770
you'll be surprised.

651
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,940
I'll buy you dinner.

652
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,280
Not dinner.

653
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,780
Let's watch a movie.

654
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,050
A movie?

655
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,850
That's more like a date.

656
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,570
Did you have a lot to drink?

657
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,900
Just a little.

658
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,810
Will you just

659
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,710
quit bothering me and just get married?
I'll take care of Mom.

660
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,110
I thought he'd be good when he grew older.

661
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,450
How he's older, it's upsetting.

662
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,040
Kyung Woo-yeon. What if I don't go?

663
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,210
- What?
- What if I don't leave?

664
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,540
Will you love me then?

665
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,650
You'll give up your dream for me?

666
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,760
Answer me.

667
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,860
Then I'll think
long and hard starting today.

668
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,450
You hurt your back, not your hands.

669
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,950
Why must I drive you?

670
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,250
I hurt my hand long ago.

671
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,120
I always get hurt whenever I'm with you.

672
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,060
Why do you never hurt your lips?

673
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,190
If my lips were to bleed,

674
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,160
you'll get the fright of your life.

675
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,430
My lips would look like split cherries.

676
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,830
Where do you learn all those lines?

677
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,200
It's a natural talent.

678
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,070
So, where are we going?

679
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,240
(Go straight for 300m and turn left.)

680
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,180
Just follow the GPS.

681
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,470
Where am I right now?

682
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:25,970
In my heart?

683
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,670
But I'm in Jumunjin.

684
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,310
Hey.

685
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,580
My gosh. This is so infuriating.

686
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,050
I'm so annoyed.

687
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,380
Drink this. Water should cool you down.

688
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,320
Welcome to my day, Kyung Woo-yeon.

689
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,430
Grandma.

690
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,130
You actually came back?

691
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,400
How have you been?

692
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,670
Hello.

693
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,840
Is she your wife?

694
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,370
No. At least not yet.

695
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,540
Let's go inside.

696
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,550
You came all the way here to give me this?

697
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,960
Thank you anyway.

698
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,460
I promised.

699
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,060
Where's your husband?

700
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,670
Him? He's gone.

701
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,860
You're back from
the community center already?

702
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,730
Because it's lunchtime.

703
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,860
Oh? Hello there.

704
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,050
I'm surprised.

705
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,290
You came all the way here to give a photo?

706
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,820
I keep my promises.

707
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,190
How did you meet the old couple?

708
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,070
I told you I'd go on a trip.

709
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,130
I came here.

710
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That's when

711
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,110
I saw the elderly couple
walking hand-in-hand.

712
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,650
I took photos of them
and got to know them.

713
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,480
Why did you photograph them?

714
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,290
If there's a happy ending,
I think that would be it.

715
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,660
When a fairy-tale ends,
"the end" always goes up.

716
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,300
I thought the picture in the next page

717
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,700
would be something like that.

718
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,810
I'm surprised.

719
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:19,910
I thought you were insensitive.

720
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,480
People get that wrong about me
all the time

721
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,350
since I act so cool.

722
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
Woo-yeon.

723
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:15,220
Can't I keep being unexpected
and unfamiliar to you?

724
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,050
I'll keep being unexpected and unfamiliar

725
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,960
and make you forget
all the times I hurt you.

726
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,960
I planned to think about it
once you answered me,

727
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,800
but I thought about you every day,
so I'm done thinking.

728
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,870
I won't go if you tell me not to.

729
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:35,540
Not anywhere.

730
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,940
That's what I've decided to do.

731
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,990
- I...
- Wait. Don't say anything.

732
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,260
Think first before you answer me.

733
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,440
I'm not ready yet.

734
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,540
I don't want to be hurt again.

735
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,040
Let's go. I'll drive.

736
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,010
What was that?

737
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,620
What am I supposed to do
if he does everything by himself?

738
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,250
Hey, we have to stop for gas.
We're running low.

739
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,930
The surgery went well.

740
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,270
Thank you.

741
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,550
Are you okay?

742
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,950
Yes, I'm okay.

743
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,650
Mom.

744
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,660
Are you awake?

745
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,460
Mother. Do you know who I am?

746
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,230
She's still under anesthesia,
so she may not recognize you.

747
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,230
What are you doing?

748
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,370
- We're out of gas.
- What?

749
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,270
What now?

750
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,610
I'll call roadside assistance.

751
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,180
I told you earlier to fill up.

752
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,580
Oops. I forgot.

753
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,860
Why do incidents always happen
when I'm with you?

754
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,970
- What?
- Come out.

755
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,460
Okay.

756
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,320
What are you doing?

757
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,860
Sit down.

758
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,630
Why should I?

759
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,470
Look at the stars. There are so many.

760
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,740
Do you seriously think
I want to stargaze right now?

761
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,940
What's gotten into you?

762
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,190
It's so pretty.

763
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,620
You're so simple.

764
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,630
Okay.

765
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,080
What is that? Did you prepare for this?

766
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,180
Yes, I did. In many ways.

767
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,090
This is nice.

768
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,110
Why are you staring at me?

769
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:13,280
I realized that although I've known you
for a long time,

770
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,480
I don't know anything about you.

771
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,390
To be more precise, I'm not someone
you've known for a long time,

772
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,620
but someone you knew a long time ago.

773
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,860
We were apart more than we were together.

774
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,070
Talk about yourself.

775
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,440
I want to know about you.

776
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,310
When did you get into calligraphy?

777
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,350
You were working in an office
when I last saw you.

778
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,980
Three years ago.

779
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,420
I quit my job two years ago.

780
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,750
Why did you quit?

781
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,420
Among the factors that affect your life,
the only ones you can choose

782
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,690
are your job and spouse.

783
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,860
Wouldn't it be too miserable
if you can't choose those either?

784
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,500
So I wouldn't be miserable.

785
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,370
What foods do you like?

786
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,380
I eat everything. I'm not picky.

787
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,110
Favorite singer?

788
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,530
Urban Zakapa.

789
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,000
What? Me too.

790
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,710
Favorite movie?

791
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,480
"A Moment to Remember."

792
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,550
(Life)

793
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,950
(doesn't provide you with an end
at the right time and place.)

794
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,490
Favorite...

795
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,320
(The end always comes,)

796
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,290
(and we just)

797
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,890
(stand at that end.)

798
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,560
Hyun-jae.

799
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,100
Yes?

800
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,540
You want to get married, right?

801
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,180
Should we break up?

802
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,990
(Either sick...)

803
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:40,290
(or happy.)

804
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,800
Come to think of it,

805
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,440
You taught me what I like and dislike,

806
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,310
and when to be bold and when to back off.

807
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,480
I must have liked you a lot.

808
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,490
Do I still?

809
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,180
Me too.

810
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,690
I like you a lot,

811
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,090
Woo-yeon.

812
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,540
My unrequited love is over now, right?

813
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,680
I don't have to wait anymore, right?

814
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,250
I don't need an answer.
I won't wait anymore.

815
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,690
(Finally, my curse...)

816
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,860
(Finally, my unrequited love...)

817
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,070
(came to an end.)

818
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:18,290
Yu-ra. You forgot this.

819
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,760
Oh my gosh. Thanks.

820
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,590
Are you going back to Korea
right after Milan?

821
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,290
I think so.

822
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,830
To see him?

823
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,430
Yes.

824
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,930
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

825
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,640
He's quite cute.

826
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,740
I know, right?

827
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,510
Hey, what do you think about this dress?
