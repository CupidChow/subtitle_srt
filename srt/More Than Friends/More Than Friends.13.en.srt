1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,280
(They say that in ancient times,)

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,750
(humans used to be two people
stuck together.)

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,050
(They had four arms, four legs,)

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,560
(and two heads.)

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,830
(The arrogant humans challenged the gods.)

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,700
(Eventually, Zeus split
the human body in half.)

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,270
(In order to obtain the perfect happiness
from before they were split,)

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,880
(human beings must wander the land
to find their other half.)

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,650
(We call that destiny)

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,220
("love.")

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,190
I've missed you.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,130
Long time no see.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,460
Let's go inside.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,670
(If that's the furthest love can go,)

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,300
(love would be so easy.)

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,339
=Episode 13: Attitude Towards
What We Love Too Much=

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,480
Over here.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,690
Why did you suddenly want to see me?
You came all the way to my office.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,900
It's about our family meeting.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,230
Do you think it'll be possible?

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,970
Your mother's sick.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,540
What meeting?

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,570
I heard you want to have a small wedding.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,470
We have so many people to invite.

25
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,510
But if the number of guests
is too different for the two sides,

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,980
it won't look nice.

27
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,380
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,350
Hyun-jae told me yesterday
that you're getting married.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,160
What do you mean?

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,600
I guess it was just his idea.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,970
But are you going to marry him?

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,050
I'll be honest with you.

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,720
If you're not thinking of marrying him,

34
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,290
let Hyun-jae go.

35
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,160
We know your situation.

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,230
I know you're in no place
to get married right now.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,930
Your brother is young,
and your mother is sick.

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,830
You're the breadwinner of the family.

39
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,030
I'm not saying this to upset you.

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,740
It's just that if you get married
without plans,

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,410
it'll be tough on both sides.

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,810
You know I'm saying this
out of concern, don't you?

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,350
Yes.

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,760
- But, you know...
- Yes?

45
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,330
Even if you say it nicely,
something hurtful

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,430
will still be hurtful.

47
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,500
My pride

48
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,370
was just hurt.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,780
I'll get going for today.

50
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,080
Hey. Young-hee.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,129
(Love is definitely not easy.)

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,430
(I have yet to solve
the countless problems)

53
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,370
(that arise)

54
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,270
(after you find your other half.)

55
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,460
Do you have something to say?

56
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,200
Why are you standing there
in front of someone else's home?

57
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,970
I'm not doing this because I want to.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,510
Lady, are you someone strange?

59
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,770
No.

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm not someone strange,

61
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,980
and I'm not that old.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
Okay.

63
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,790
I'm not watching.

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,690
Mom! There's a strange lady
outside our house!

65
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,430
I told you I'm not a strange lady!

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,440
Sure.

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,440
I guess it's strange.

68
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,580
I can't even ring his doorbell
when I saw a woman go in.

69
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,890
Woo-yeon.

70
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,590
I thought I was hearing things
because I heard your voice.

71
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,020
You're really here.

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,560
Is someone here?

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,459
Hands off. My girlfriend is really strong.

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,709
What brings you here unannounced?

75
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,370
What?

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,580
Well...

77
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,750
I was nearby.

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,420
I'm sorry.
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

79
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,790
I see.

80
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,290
It's okay.

81
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,630
Who is she?

82
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,570
I'm Kwon Yu-ra.

83
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,740
Oh, I see.

84
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,370
Don't stand here. You should come in.

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,640
No, no.

86
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I...

87
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,410
You have a guest.

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,180
I'll just go.

89
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,450
Well...

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,520
Wait just a minute. I'll drive you.

91
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,990
It's okay. You have a guest over.

92
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,090
You don't have to mind me.

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,230
What are you doing?
Hurry up and drive her home.

94
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,930
No, no. I can go alone.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,100
I have somewhere to drop by too.

96
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,840
Bye.

97
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,550
I'll get going.

98
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,780
I'll call you.

99
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,890
If you want.

100
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,220
Woo-yeon, will you give me your number?

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Why are you getting
my girlfriend's number?

102
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,830
I don't have any friends in Korea
except for him.

103
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,810
You should call me if you get bored.

104
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,010
Okay.

105
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,930
Thank you.

106
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,630
Aren't you going to ask me why?

107
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,700
Why you suddenly decided to do
commercial photography?

108
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,070
I came here
because I was curious about that,

109
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,840
but the answer was just here.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,340
It's because of Woo-yeon, isn't it?

111
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,140
I want to be with her.

112
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,210
Really?

113
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,710
I'll connect you to a Korean agency.

114
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,950
They have several famous models,

115
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,820
and they're pretty big. It'd be best
to work as a photographer there.

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,330
Enough talking about work.
Let's be friends now.

117
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,760
Have you been well?

118
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm fine. Thank you, and you?

119
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,830
Gosh. Really?

120
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,800
About what?

121
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,709
I heard an airline wants to sponsor you.

122
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,380
They want to use your work
in their advertisements.

123
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,910
Are you sure you're fine after

124
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,020
losing that opportunity?

125
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,350
How did you know?

126
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,920
I know someone on their marketing team.

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,030
I answered you, so you should answer me.

128
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,000
I think I'll be fine.

129
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,140
Are you going to make Woo-yeon
uncomfortable with that face?

130
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,110
If you meet someone
with an uncomfortable heart,

131
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,820
that person can feel it too.

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,520
Don't struggle alone
and talk to Woo-yeon about it.

133
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,120
It's not just your work.
It's about the both of you now.

134
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,970
(The person you have reached
is not available.)

135
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,240
(Farmed Jin-ju)

136
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,440
(Tonight)

137
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,740
Is Jin-ju busy?

138
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,910
- You're here.
- Hey.

139
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,180
I made sure to close the door properly.

140
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,220
The air conditioning won't leak.

141
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,490
No, it's not that.

142
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,860
Did you come alone?

143
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,830
Yes.

144
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,230
- I want a beer.
- Okay.

145
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,700
Why do you look so down?

146
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,210
Can a man and a woman

147
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,510
be friends?

148
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,980
Hey.

149
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,620
(As long as there are drinks and nights,
no man and woman can be friends.)

150
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,550
But... Why not?

151
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,560
Friendships can be strong.

152
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,360
Do you think drinks and nights
can break it apart?

153
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,530
If a man and a woman are friends,

154
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,200
they're either both really ugly,

155
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,630
they both have partners,

156
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,770
or one side is just suffering patiently.

157
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,870
But you're friends with Jin-ju.
We're friends too.

158
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,380
Didn't Jin-ju

159
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
talk about me?

160
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,180
What about you?

161
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,360
Come on. Jin-ju isn't the type
to talk behind someone's back.

162
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,260
Forget it.

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,510
Hey. When a girl doesn't tell her friends
she's checking out a guy,

164
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,680
or if she knows that a guy likes her,
what's the reason?

165
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,910
It's either she doesn't care at all,

166
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,780
or is embarrassed.

167
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,020
It has to be one or the other.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,470
You came just in time.

169
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,070
The soup's almost ready.
Go wash your hands so we can eat.

170
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,830
Why did you cook? It's too tiring.

171
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,170
No reason.

172
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,770
I don't have anything to do at home.

173
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,410
You know you have
chemotherapy tomorrow, right?

174
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,680
I took a half-day,
so I'll come to get you in the afternoon.

175
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,180
Will I survive if I get chemotherapy?

176
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,590
You should.

177
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,160
You're getting the treatment
so you can survive.

178
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,230
Do you

179
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,160
want me to live long?

180
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,070
I didn't want to live long.

181
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,370
Because you don't want to burden us?

182
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,980
But this is too early.

183
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,120
I don't care about everything else,
but I wanted to be beside you

184
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,390
when you're pregnant

185
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,260
and when you give birth.

186
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,430
Your grandma passed early.

187
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,240
On a normal day,

188
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,670
I'd tell myself

189
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,940
I never had

190
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,880
a mom to begin with.

191
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,750
But when I had you,

192
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,420
I missed my mom desperately.

193
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,720
After I gave birth to you,

194
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,420
I couldn't stop crying

195
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,860
from missing my mom.

196
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,800
I don't want

197
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,010
my daughter to cry like that.

198
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,780
Mom, I...

199
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,220
I think I'll need you more than that.

200
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,760
So can you please not die?

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,730
I want to live too.

202
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,070
Yes.

203
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,240
Then live.

204
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,230
(Prosecutor Han Jin-ju)
Ms. Han, how about some pho
for lunch today?

205
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,500
There's a really good place
just across the street named Tendon.

206
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,130
Sure.

207
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,370
What's "Tendon"?

208
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,570
Tendon. Cow tendon.

209
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,510
Right. Tendon.

210
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,450
Gosh, she startled me.

211
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,150
What's the matter?

212
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,460
I don't like tendons. I'm allergic to it.

213
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,760
I didn't know someone could be
allergic to tendons.

214
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
(Sang-hyeok: No matter how busy you are,
make sure you eat.)

215
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,480
(Han Jin-ju. No matter how busy you are,
make sure you eat.)

216
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,640
(Good luck.)

217
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,550
"Gone, gone, everyone has gone
to the other shore."

218
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,720
What are you doing here?

219
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,730
I was waiting for you.

220
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,830
Why didn't you call?

221
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,460
Your lights were off.
I figured you'd come soon.

222
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,670
Why did you come?

223
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,800
Because I missed you.

224
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,240
Yu-ra is a model.

225
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,810
She's quite famous abroad,
and she has connections here.

226
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,610
I see.

227
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,720
I met her to ask her for work.

228
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm planning to work as
a commercial photographer in Korea.

229
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,060
Does that mean you won't leave anymore?

230
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,430
Are you going to stay here?

231
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,530
Are you happy I'm staying?

232
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,230
Of course.

233
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,860
Yes.

234
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,830
I'm not leaving.

235
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,480
Kyung Woo-yeon.

236
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,820
Mom. Dad.

237
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,750
Hello.

238
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,940
Why are you going on your knees?
Just sit properly.

239
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,940
It's not like he did anything wrong.

240
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,210
Do you want to side with the guy
who made you cry?

241
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,060
By the way, Mom. I've been curious.

242
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,390
How did you know that?

243
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,770
What a thug.

244
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Seriously.

245
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,950
It looks like we're seeing you regularly
this way.

246
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,880
Having a crush is harsh on her.

247
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,420
Don't go.

248
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,460
Don't go.

249
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,560
Don't go.

250
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,730
Please like me back.

251
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,540
Wake up. I'm your mom.

252
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,940
Park Mi-sook.

253
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,540
Mom.

254
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,580
Mom.

255
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,420
Mom, your daughter was dumped again.

256
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm not garbage, but I was dumped.

257
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,930
Let's put her away.

258
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

259
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,370
Hey. Come here.

260
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,840
One, two, three.

261
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,060
I won't let

262
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,860
the guy who made my daughter cry
hang around her.

263
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,230
I'm really sorry I made her cry.

264
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,840
I regret it a lot,
and I'm trying to be good to her.

265
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,610
A few words out of your mouth won't
fix the scratches on her heart.

266
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,240
By the way, Dad...

267
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,010
You don't have the right to say that.

268
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,850
What did you say?

269
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,390
He did wrong before we dated.

270
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,990
You married Mom,
but you're still not good to her.

271
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,320
You punk.

272
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,760
You got confused
about Mom's birthday last time,

273
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,230
and you made her ask
whose birthday you confused hers with.

274
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,330
Also, the last time you two went
on a couples' outing,

275
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,940
you helped the lady Mom hates the most
when she was taking a side dish.

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,770
It really upset Mom.

277
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,940
Also... Yes.

278
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,110
Five years ago at Grandma's house...

279
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,280
Stop.

280
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,410
Why?

281
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,080
There's a lot more.

282
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,720
That's not important right now.

283
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,960
He didn't do anything wrong to me
since we started dating.

284
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,560
It's possible to do wrong
when we're strangers.

285
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,200
But becoming complacent after
the person becomes yours

286
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,160
is worse.

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,830
Woo-yeon.

288
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,570
Why are you scolding someone else's
precious son?

289
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,240
Why are you scolding my man?

290
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,110
If anything, I'll be the one to scold him
or talk bad about him.

291
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,110
I have a bigger share of him than you two.

292
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Let's go.

293
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,960
I... I'm sorry.

294
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,390
Why are you sorry?

295
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,630
I'll be going.

296
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,630
That brat.

297
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,070
She's obsessed with a boy
and doesn't care about her dad.

298
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,440
Children are useless.

299
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,300
Isn't that right, honey?

300
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,840
You're useless too.

301
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,310
Honey.

302
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,180
Mi-sook.

303
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,010
Sook.

304
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,190
My woman is so strong.

305
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,040
Sorry for making you cry.

306
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,380
So you have to be good to me.

307
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,910
By my side, every single day. Okay?

308
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,150
You have to be good to me
every day without fail.

309
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,050
Every day.

310
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,490
I'll be good to you.

311
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,430
- Sir.
- Why did you come out again?

312
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,570
Let's go.

313
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,670
No. I'm not going.

314
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,110
I'm going to stay with Soo.

315
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,540
It's late, so you should go inside.

316
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,350
Not you.

317
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,750
Young man. Do you drink?

318
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Pardon?

319
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,660
Me?

320
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,900
But...

321
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,750
What are you doing?

322
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,180
It's bad luck...

323
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,850
Sorry, sir.

324
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,500
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,910
I don't like you.

326
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,010
I don't like you because my daughter
cried for ten years because she liked you.

327
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,710
I don't like you because you said
you didn't like my precious daughter.

328
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm sorry, sir.
I realized how I felt too late.

329
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,020
I like Woo-yeon now. A lot.

330
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,790
Will you make her cry again?

331
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,060
I don't make promises I can't keep.

332
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,530
I can't control my own feelings.

333
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,570
I can't be sure of hers.

334
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,200
She may cry some days,

335
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,440
but I'll do my best to be good to her.

336
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,690
Why are you smiling?

337
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,660
I said I don't like you.

338
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,020
Sorry, sir.

339
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,230
I'm sure every parent feels that way,

340
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,740
but Woo-yeon is my world.

341
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,940
Don't destroy my world.

342
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,670
Yes, sir. Please demolish me if I do.

343
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,650
You are very witty.

344
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,790
I'm quite intelligent.

345
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,160
- Pour me one.
- Yes, sir.

346
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,030
Cheers.

347
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,880
Woo-yeon, I think I'm in.

348
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,580
I think so.

349
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
How did you win him over?

350
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,590
I didn't do much.

351
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,320
I answered his questions honestly

352
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,330
and made some corny jokes.

353
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,830
That's it. My dad loves corny jokes.

354
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,660
I see.

355
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,000
What else? What else did you say?

356
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,040
That I like Woo-yeon

357
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,270
very much.

358
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,580
(I like you a lot, Woo-yeon.)

359
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,680
I love you

360
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,580
a lot.

361
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,290
I love you.

362
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,490
What?

363
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,260
I said I love you.

364

Jin-ju.

365
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,020
Why did you come back?

366
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,790
I came to see your face.
Won't you let me see it?

367
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,100
Did you not sleep?

368
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,970
Not much.
The customers left late last night.

369
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,740
I'm here to deliver lunch
to our prosecutor.

370
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,940
I said not to do this.

371
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm doing it because I want to,
so don't stop me.

372
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,740
Finish it all, okay?

373
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,880
The chicory is just decoration,
so don't eat it.

374
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,520
You're acting like my mom.

375
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,450
- Jin-ju.
- Hey.

376
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,950
- Are you going out to lunch?
- Yes.

377
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,620
Who's he? Boyfriend?

378
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,920
No.

379
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,660
Lunch delivery?

380
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,960
- No, I'm...
- Yes, he's delivering my lunch.

381
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,170
Thank you.

382
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,010
That lunchbox.

383
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,840
May I get your card?
The food looked good last time.

384
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,580
Sorry, but we haven't opened yet.

385
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,380
I'll come back with our card once we do.

386
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,090
Okay, then.

387
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Okay. Have a nice day.

388
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
- See you later.
- Okay.

389
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,410
All you had to do was say he was a friend.

390
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,180
Why did you say yes?

391
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,890
Why did you say he was a delivery boy?

392
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,420
He has pride too.

393
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,370
It's either she doesn't care at all,

394
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,340
or is embarrassed.

395
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,510
It's one or the other.

396
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,300
Are you done? Let's go.

397
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,300
Mother. I'm here.

398
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,500
Why? You must be busy.

399
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,840
School's out, so I'm not.

400
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,540
Why did you come?

401
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,310
The treatment must've been hard enough.
It's too hard for her to take a cab.

402
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,880
I'll help you, Mother.

403
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,590
- Be careful.
- Okay.

404
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,390
Hold on.

Did you rush over to show me this?

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,550
Yes. I wanted to watch it with you.

You're so pretty.

416

Don't do it.

What did she say?

438
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,500
That marriage in my situation is a luxury

439
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,070
and if I don't want to marry you,
I should let you go.

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,540
I'm sorry.

441
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,470
I'll tell her to apologize to...

442

What she said isn't wrong. She's right.

How can we marry in this situation?

444

Because the situation's like this.

445
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,710
I want to be by your side,
as your husband and guardian.

-  I'll sort out...
-  How will you sort it out?

00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,920
Will you scream in front of your parents?

449

Will you curse out your oldest sister?

450
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,930
If you turn against your family like that,
would that make you feel good?

451
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,600
Forget about how you feel.

They paid to support you
and they will support you in the future.

Can you give up all that?

454
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,810
I don't like the fact that you must
give up something because of me,

455
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,140
and even if you do,

456
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,780
I don't want a man who has nothing.

I'm that darned Kim Young-hee.

460
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,519
I'm Kim Young-hee who has nothing.

461
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,160
So I won't marry a man who has nothing.

462

You're getting emotional again.

463

I apologize for what my sister said.
And I'll sort it out.

So don't get any bad ideas.

465
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,769
I'm not saying this because I'm emotional.

Where are you?

471
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,470
I will

472
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,940
marry Young-hee.

473
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,880
I will, even if you disapprove.

474
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,350
Even if you say it'll kill you,

475
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,820
I'll marry her.

476
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,450
Do you think you can live with love alone?

477
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,920
Try it. Marriage sometimes
makes you think of love last.

478
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,030
Sometimes, love is more of a burden.

479
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,230
You should...

480
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,340
You apologize to Young-hee.

481
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,370
- How dare you...
- If it hadn't been for her,

482
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,110
I wouldn't be the teacher
you wanted me to be.

483
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,610
I probably wouldn't even
live like a human being.

484
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,750
I was a lowlife, and the person

485
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,750
who made me study, dream,
and act like a decent human

486
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,920
was Young-hee and you know that.

487
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,590
Even if it hadn't been for her,

488
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,730
you'd have grown up well
because you're a good boy.

489
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,330
I'm not good at all.

490
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,330
I pretended to be good
to appeal to Young-hee.

491
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,100
That's why

492
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm not wasting my life right now.

493
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,210
Hey. Are we doing this for our own good?

494
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,310
We're doing this for your sake...

495
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,580
I'll return the security deposit
you paid for my apartment.

496
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,390
If you say I don't acknowledge
how you raised me,

497
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,960
I'll drive people or work part-time

498
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,930
to pay that back too.

499
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,770
You'll only ruin your health.
Why would you do such a thing?

500
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,800
I don't mind living like that
for the rest of my life.

501
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,770
I'm sorry to say that

502
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,840
I can live

503
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,150
without seeing you again.

504
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,250
But without Young-hee,

505
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,120
I'll really die.

506
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,180
(Tonight)

507
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,550
Hi.

508
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,850
Hello.

509
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,120
I enjoyed the food.

510
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,960
Good.

511
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,460
I wasn't picky. I ate everything.

512
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,670
Even the decorative chicory.

513
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,800
Well done.

514
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,170
I'm sorry about earlier.

515
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,610
I got flustered when he asked
if we were dating and...

516
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
It's okay.

517
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,690
What will you make tomorrow?

518
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,830
I won't come anymore.

519
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,630
What?

520
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,770
Sorry for bothering you until now.

521
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,440
I thought I could be a transfer station,

522
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,380
but you don't need that
because you have an expensive car.

523
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,550
So this is it?

524
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,450
Yes.

525
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,090
You said you'd seduce me
as best you could.

526
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,960
Is this your best?

527
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,200
Isn't this right?

528
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,900
Okay. That's great.

529
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,540
Bye.

530
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,980
(Tonight)

531
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,720
Why are you pouring soju in this?

532
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,920
Hey, what are you doing?

533
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,520
I don't have an expensive car now.

534
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,760
I need a transfer station or a last stop.

535
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,400
Go on liking me.

536
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,240
Please keep liking me.

537
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,240
I like you too.

538
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,610
Will you say something...

539
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,100
(Her chemotherapy includes
a drug called oxaliplatin,)

540
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,940
(and a side-effect is that
she can't touch cold objects.)

541
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,750
(Not just unable to touch,
but it feels like a stabbing pain.)

542
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,980
(It's a side-effect the patients dread.)

543
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,450
(Some people can't even touch
room temperature glass or metals.)

544
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,760
(Her skin will dry up, causing nosebleeds,
so maintain humidity.)

545
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,030
(Hyun-jae's oldest sister)

546
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,670
Hello. Why did you call?

547
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,080
(I wanted to apologize.)

548
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,880
I'm sorry.

549
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,280
I just felt so frustrated.

550
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,390
Were you very hurt?

551
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,420
Not really.

552
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,830
(Love is so strange.)

553
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,900
When it's about my family,

554
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,900
I become so selfish and mean.

555
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,330
I'm sorry, Young-hee.

556
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,170
(Nothing you said was wrong.)

557
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,410
Right. Thank you for understanding.

558
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,980
(The photos will be used in our ads.)

559
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,310
(We'll respect your creative choices
in this project of unprecedented scale.)

560
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,420
He said he won't go anywhere.

561
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,090
He never asked me to let him go.

562
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,290
So

563
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,830
I don't have to ask him about it first.

564
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,810
(Yu-ra)
(It's Kwon Yu-ra. Let's hang out.)

565
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,480
Do you have a particular style in mind?

566
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,250
I'm meeting someone later.

567
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,720
It must be someone important.

568
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,690
Who are you meeting?

569
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,090
My boyfriend's

570
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,430
other woman?

571
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,340
Just a moment.

572
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,310
Director!

573
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,150
(Close at 22:00)

574
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,010
You're beautiful today, Woo-yeon.

575
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,580
Did I not put in enough effort?

576
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,250
Not really.

577
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,690
I don't embarrass you
because I'm pretty, right?

578
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,960
What is it?

579
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,160
Oh, was I too honest?

580
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,830
Why did you ask to see me today?

581
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,840
To have fun.

582
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,240
I want us to be friends.

583
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,680
What do women do to have fun in Korea?

584
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,570
They're pretty. You should get these.

585
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,910
No, thanks.

586
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,540
Then I'll buy them.

587
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,580
That is so cute.

588
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,950
I think this place
will look great in a photo.

589
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,320
Come here.

590
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,990
- No, thanks.
- Get over here.

591
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,660
Three, two, one.

592
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,430
Three, two, one.

593
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,270
Three, two, one.

594
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,600
You're going way too far behind.
Three, two, one.

595
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,210
We look nice, don't we?

596
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,680
Three, two, one. The last shot.

597
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,120
Cheers.

598
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,400
This is so nice.

599
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,870
Do you have something to say?

600
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,140
Didn't you have something to say?

601
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,840
Me? I don't.

602
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,540
Should I say something?

603
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,340
Well...

604
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,680
I thought you wanted to talk about Soo.

605
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,920
Why? Did he do something wrong?

606
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,850
Why does he always mess up?

607
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,190
It's not that.

608
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,990
How long have you known Soo?

609
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,530
Since he was in his mom's tummy?

610
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,170
No? Is it since he was part of his dad?

611
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,900
I see.

612
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,080
Do you

613
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,950
like Lee Soo?

614
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,300
I told you

615
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,430
that I'm straightforward.

616
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,470
If you're asking if I have
feelings for him,

617
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,110
then my answer is yes.

618
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,780
But that's just it.

619
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,150
It's not at all like love.

620
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,650
I just sometimes
get confused if I like him

621
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,720
as a guy or as a friend.

622
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,730
Don't worry. I don't want to
sway someone who has a girlfriend,

623
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,230
and even if I tried, he won't budge.

624
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,840
Was I being rude?

625
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,010
Not at all.

626
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,710
You're right.

627
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,510
It is rude,

628
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,980
so why am I not offended?

629
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,560
What is it?

630
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,360
It's amazing.

631
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,130
It's amazing that Soo likes someone
that much,

632
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,400
but at the same time,
it's understanding because it's you.

633
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,610
You were the one person
whose name he mentioned.

634
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,840
I see.

635
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,350
Also,

636
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,980
photography was his everything,

637
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,490
but he says
you're the most precious to him now.

638
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,420
He says he won't leave you

639
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,460
no matter how great an offer he gets.

640
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:53,980
I'm home...

641
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,120
Mom.

642
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,590
- It hurts...
- Are you okay?

643
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:01,890
It hurts.

644
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,520
Here. Are you okay?

645
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,590
No.

646
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,630
I felt really nauseous.

647
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,660
So I wanted to have
something refreshing to eat.

648
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,100
But my hand...

649
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:18,100
Why does my hand hurt so much?

650
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,910
Gosh.

651
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,580
You'll get hurt. Get away.

652
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,920
I don't even have to get you
used to the idea of me being gone.

653
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,100
Everything I do is a nuisance.

654
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,500
Stop that.

655
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,230
I never...

656
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,640
did anything
with any responsibility anyway.

657
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,780
But now, I've become utterly useless.

658
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,310
Please, Mom.

659
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,320
It's better for you

660
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,990
if I were gone.

661
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,620
I only make you cry.

662
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,270
I'm not crying.

663
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,320
Why did you come?
I said you didn't have to.

664
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,090
Because I missed you.

665
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,620
I'm going right back after I buy this.

666
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,690
I get to look at you while you buy this.

667
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,650
What about dinner?

668
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,380
Did you eat?

669
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,750
I have no appetite.

670
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,420
No. You can't skip dinner too.

671
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,620
Let's go eat.

672
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,120
I have no appetite.

673
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,590
You have to eat regardless.

674
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,130
I said not. Why do you...

675
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,200
Sorry.

676
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,840
Are you still mad at me? Is that why?

677
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,380
Or is it because things are too hard?

678
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,620
What's the difference?

679
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,090
If it's the prior, I'll apologize.

680
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,860
If it's the latter,

681
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,920
I'll make you smile.

682
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,160
Seriously, are you stupid?

683
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,100
How could I be a teacher if I were stupid?

684
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,360
Are you stupid?

685
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,100
What?

686
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,600
See? Made you smile. You smiled.

687
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,640
I did not.

688
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,910
Come now. Yes, you did.

689
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:40,970
I did not.

690
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,870
You're smiling now. See?

691
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,210
(I smiled briefly that day,)

692
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,150
(and that was why I decided to leave him.)

693
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:54,850
(Because I realized)

694
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,760
(that Hyun-jae loved me
as someone he was nursing.)

695
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,060
It's Saturday tomorrow.

696
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,100
Let's go on a date.

697
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,300
Sounds good.
Is there anywhere you want to go?

698
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,010
Somewhere we don't go often.

699
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,080
Somewhere we wouldn't go
outside of special occasions?

700
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,810
Okay. I'll look for something.

701
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,880
Okay.

702
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,730
(Young-hee)

703
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,670
Hi, Young-hee.

704
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,210
I thought Hyun-jae and I
were stacking blocks,

705
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,650
but they were dominos.

706
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,480
You stack them
in order to knock them down.

707
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,350
I realized

708
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,490
we stacked them for too long.

709
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,420
Did something happen with him?

710
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,500
It's always me.

711
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,170
I'm always the problem.

712
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,800
Stop saying that.
Nothing's wrong with you.

713
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
Wrong.

714
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,710
I'm a total mess.

715
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,140
Young-hee.

716
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,280
Hyun-jae

717
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,450
wanted to get married,

718
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,750
but he held back because of me.

719
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,960
I made him hold himself back
for way too long.

720
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,560
Hyun-jae

721
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,830
wants to marry you.

722
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,700
Because it's you.

723
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,930
Yes, that's right.

724
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,270
I made him that way. Me.

725
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,640
I turned him into an idiot
who lives only for me.

726
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,910
I made him that way,

727
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,310
but I can't take responsibility for it.

728
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,320
I hate myself for it.

729
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,260
If only one side makes all the sacrifices
in the name of love,

730
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,520
that's the beginning of misery.

731
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,860
One person is miserable
because he has to make sacrifices,

732
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,630
and the other is miserable
because she feels guilty.

733
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,300
It's so strange.

734
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,810
You made the sacrifice
in order to be happy,

735
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,170
but neither person becomes happy.

736
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,080
Nothing else remains

737
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,680
but misery.

738
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,280
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

739
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,450
Shoes for a man in his late 20s.

740
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,160
I think he'll have to walk long and far,

741
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,530
so something nice and comfortable, please.

742
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,470
Why did we get a divorce? Gosh.

743
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,580
I don't know.

744
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,880
What time is the movie?

745
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,980
Five o'clock.

746
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,020
If you're done,
shall we start heading over?

747
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,850
Okay.

748
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,060
(Han Cinema)

749
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:59,260
(Watch movies on weekends
with your mileage points.)

750
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,640
Should we get some popcorn?

751
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,110
What's wrong?

752
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,150
Why here of all places?

753
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,020
We came here often when we were dating.

754
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,250
You asked why we got divorced, right?

755
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:21,520
What?

756
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Yes.

757
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,260
This is where I decided to divorce you.

758
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,770
Are you okay, sweetie?

759
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,010
Hey, lady. Watch where you're going.

760
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,380
What was that? You...

761
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,580
Sorry.

762
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,780
Are you okay?

763
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,180
Let's go.

764
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,850
Why did you apologize?

765
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,520
Why bother making a fuss?
It'll just be a pain.

766
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,130
If it's such a pain,
why did you come to the movies?

767
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:03,430
Can't you just let it slide for today?

768
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,100
It was really hard for me to leave work.

769
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,600
You've been in a bad mood,
so I wanted to take you to a movie.

770
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,970
Must my moods fit in your schedule too?

771
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,770
Then show me your schedule ahead of time.

772
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:15,070
Let me know when I can feel what I want.

773
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,740
Like the schedule will be correct.

774
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,180
It's not like I enjoy
being buried in work.

775
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:23,980
Did I make you do it?

776
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,120
No one made you do it.

777
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,550
Let's drop it.

778
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,890
- Drop what?
- Let's stop!

779
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,090
Fine.

780
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,530
Let's stop everything.

781
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,370
(The man who said he'd pluck the stars
from the sky for me)

782
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,140
(Han Cinema)

783
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,770
(Han Cinema)
shoved me to the bottom of the list.

784
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,040
I was lonely and hurt.

785
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,910
I couldn't endure the hurt
of seeing the love evaporating.

786
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,680
That's why we got divorced.

787
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,450
It never evaporated.

788
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:04,160
Regardless of how you felt,
that's how it felt for me.

789
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,790
The recipient is the one
who discerns what they feel.

790
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,990
Won-jung.

791
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,030
I haven't heard you say that name
in a very long time.

792
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:19,640
Furthermore, I don't like
Korean food or movies.

793
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,340
You used to.

794
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,510
I'm sure you did,

795
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,410
I liked you.

796
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,050
I did things that you enjoyed with you.

797
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,220
You shouldn't glue together
something that shattered and reuse it,

798
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,720
but I forgot again.

799
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,500
I can't join you for the movie today.

800
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:48,170
Let's continue just being friends.

801
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,870
Bye.

802
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:18,430
Also, photography was his everything,

803
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,070
but he says
you're the most precious to him now.

804
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,900
He says he won't leave you

805
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,010
no matter how great an offer he gets.

806
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,380
(If only one side makes all the sacrifices
in the name of love,)

807
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,410
that's the beginning of misery.

808
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,720
One person is miserable
because he has to make sacrifices,

809
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,390
and the other is miserable
because she feels guilty.

810
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,730
Did you know
that the same Chinese character is used

811
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,870
for "turtle" and "explode"?

812
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,870
Really? I didn't know.

813
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,010
People look only at the scars.

814
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,680
They don't care how long a turtle lives,

815
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,450
how fast they are in the water,

816
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,450
or anything like that.

817
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:50,590
They look only at the scar
on the turtle's shell.

818
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,270
Young-hee.

819
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:13,410
I've always been poor

820
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:17,350
and miserable, and I always will be.

821
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,890
So...

822
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,820
get out of my misery.

823
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,060
What?

824
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,630
Let's...

825
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,240
break up, Hyun-jae.

826
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,910
(There are various people in the world,)

827
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,280
(and each person loves in their own way.)

828
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,520
(Some people)

829
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:58,590
(let the other person go
because they love them too much.)

830
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,500
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

831
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,670
I heard you got an offer from an airline.

832
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,070
That's a great opportunity.

833
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,010
How did you find out?

834
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,850
I saw your email last time.

835
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,250
I see.

836
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,090
Actually, I was going to ask you.

837
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,360
You're going?

838
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:35,790
Yes.

839
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,270
How long will it take?

840
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,070
From a year and a half to two years.

841
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,640
That's like military service.

842
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,440
But you still want to go?

843
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:55,750
Yes, I want to go.

844
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,520
I wanted to give it up let it go,
but I couldn't.

845
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:08,430
I know just how selfish I am being, but...

846
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,170
If you don't mind, will you go with me?

847
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,370
Go with me, Woo-yeon.

848
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
Okay.

849
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,170
I'll go with you.

850
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,040
(And some people say)

851
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,080
(you must hold on)

852
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,550
(because you love them so much.)

853
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,680
(There are countless ways to love,)

854
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:09,690
(and none of them are wrong.)

855
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:13,090
Did you change your mind?

856
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,860
About what?

857
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,700
Woo-yeon's boyfriend.

858
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,500
I thought you'd say over your dead body.

859
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,200
Why did you have a change of heart?

860
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,140
Just because.

861
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,440
That's not an answer.

862
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:30,980
Why? Did he grow on you
after you drank with him?

863
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,080
Just because.

864
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:35,710
Woo-yeon likes him.

865
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:38,450
What can I do? My daughter likes him.

866
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,250
I have to give in.

867
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,320
What can you do?
That's what it means to be a parent.

868
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:50,330
(Although there are countless people
in the world,)

869
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,500
(although everyone loves
in their own way,)

870
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:56,670
(there is one thing that doesn't change.)

871
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,240
(The one that always gives in)

872
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,210
(is the one who loves the other more.)
