[Love in the Big City]

00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:54,377
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,050
Mr. Go it's been a while,
it's good to see you again.

4
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,057
You remember me?

5
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:10,275
Of course, Mr. Go.

6
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,703
And your company left you key with us.

7
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:18,004
Room 3300.

8
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,232
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

9
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,253
Wow.

10
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,719
They've given us champagne because
we said we were on our honeymoon.

11
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,809
Now I can relax.

12
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,219
Hey, go wash up before you jump in bed!

13
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,350
Relax

14
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,468
I'm not even under the covers.

15
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,316
You should join me.

16
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,572
Let's lie here a while.

17
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,961
No one asked you to drink so much.

18
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,380
Are you still up for going to the pool?

19
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,382
They were free drinks.

20
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,393
Our flights cost a fortune,
we needed to make the most of it…

21
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,064
Go draw the curtains.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,681
Silly, you don't draw the curtains
at a luxury hotel like this.

23
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:51,268
Why not?

24
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,453
Wow, that's awesome.

25
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,984
Huh? Oh..

26
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:08,665
What is it?

27
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,922
It doesn't work. I think it's broken.

28
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,713
Let's just sleep.

29
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,265
We can't sleep like this.

30
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,726
Gyu Ho.

31
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,895
There's something extraordinary here.

32
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,280
Uh? What?

33
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,151
A crystal penis.

34
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,660
What?

35
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,966
It's big. Impressive.

36
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,314
Hello?

37
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,062
The automatic curtain does not close completely.

38
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,275
We are very sorry for the inconvenience.

39
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,696
So as a gesture of our apologies,
we have upgraded your room.

40
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,867
This is the best type of room we offer,
The Presidential Suite room.

41
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,035
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Have pleasure in stay.

42
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,670
- Kopkhun kap.
- Kopkhun ka.

43
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,014
Yay!!!

44
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,188
Wow, I'm so surprised

45
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,018
What did they say?

46
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,479
That they're sorry, so they upgraded us
to a Park Suite King room.

47
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
Sounds like the boss of a video game.

48
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,990
Right?

49
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,360
Hey, you have to pay for that!

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,821
- Oh, really?
- Just kidding.

51
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,330
Come on.

52
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,417
City view.

53
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,586
Wow.

54
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,463
We can't see the crystal penis from here.

55
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Oh yeah, guess you can't
see it from this side.

56
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,016
I should have seen it earlier,
what a shame.

57
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,651
[I have back-to-back meetings and dinner arrangements.
Please have dinner and do some sightseeing.]

58
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,662
[I'll give you a call when I have time. - Habibi]

59
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:25,630
I was alone in either city,
Seoul or Bangkok.

60
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,452
The unfamiliarity of the destination
only made loneliness clearer.

61
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,306
I'm tired of loneliness,
and I'm tired of getting tired.

62
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,885
[I'll be free for dinner. Meet me at the Fort by 6.]

63
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,383
[Okay.]

64
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,628
These are the only ones for this prescription?

65
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,721
Yes. Yes.

66
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,052
They're the only ones they have
that match your prescription.

67
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,755
Uh?

68
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,640
Really? You sure?

69
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,650
Yes. Only this.

70
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,429
Oh, damn it! It's hot!

71
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,874
I told you not to laugh.

72
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,921
Okay, I'm sorry. I won't laugh anymore.

73
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,465
Come on! Cut it out!

74
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,254
You have to admit it's pretty hilarious.

75
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,507
You look like that rabbit detective, Usami.

76
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,499
Well then, you're Kumakichi.
The perverted bear.

77
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,425
- I'm Usami!!!
- Me too, Usami!

78
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,563
No, you're Kumakichi!!

79
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,316
I'm Usami.

80
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,443
My eyes are blue.

81
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,378
I'm Usami.

82
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:39,514
No, I'm Usami!!

83
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:02,097
Is there any anti-viral drugs for HIV?

84
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,756
Uh... yes.

85
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,599
This is a generic antiviral drug.

86
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:51,229
So the efficacy and dosage instructions are identical.

87
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,898
Take two pills before intercourse

88
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,902
followed by an additional
two pills daily thereafter-

89
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,781
that'll help you prevent infection.

90
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,881
Are you buying them?

91
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,008
Okay. How much?

92
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,909
- Crabby Tabby. Mr. Kumakichi
- Yeah?

93
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,952
What are we gonna do now?

94
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,747
I dunno... Head back to the hotel?

95
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,251
Or we could go to the beach?

96
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,795
The beach is far away.

97
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,213
How come? We're in Thailand.

98
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,548
Isn't it surrounded by water?

99
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,425
That's only true for islands
like Phuket or Ko Samui.

100
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,843
We're in Bangkok.

101
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,143
It's a long way to go to the beach.

102
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,024
So Bangkok is inland, huh...

103
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,052
Why are you laughing?

104
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,109
Do you remember what you said
when we first met?

105
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,154
That it was your dream to go inland.

106
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,996
And that's funny?

107
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,617
How about seeing a river instead of the sea?

108
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,377
The Chao Phraya River.

109
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,473
Sure!

110
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,510
Oh! Oh!!

111
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,936
Chao Phraya River!

112
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:55,003
Kylie was always taking over
my life without a sound.

113
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:03,252
What would have changed if I had known
these things 9 years ago.

114
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,619
Would it be a very different life?

115
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,282
What kind of life is that.

116
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,965
Will it better or worse,

117
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,878
or is it no different than it is now.

118
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,387
It's already been nine years
since I've been with Kylie,

119
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,456
but I'm not used to Kylie's existence.

120
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,155
Gyu Ho always took for granted the
existence of Kylie, who was unfamiliar to me.

121
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:53,002
I was sorry for that but
I pretended to be fine.

122
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,270
Hey, Mr. Bomb!

123
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,149
I'm sorry.

124
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,627
I thought you might have forgotten my face.

125
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,005
And you would come to Bangkok
to meet someone who's forgotten your face?

126
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,494
Why not?

127
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,263
How was your day?

128
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:59,018
Well, I saw a giant's eye that sang and danced.

129
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,530
Cling Cling, Blink Blink,
Cling Cling, Blink Blink.

130
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,777
It seems you've had quite an eventful day.

131
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,485
And how was yours?

132
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,586
I've had a dull one,

133
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,501
as usual.

134
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,072
But tonight...

135
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:20,081
Will be a very special one.

136
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,292
Thanks to me?

137
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,334
No.

138
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,336
Tonight, here in Bangkok,

139
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,996
we are going to see the
world's most beautiful fireworks.

140
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,916
Everything.

141
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,635
- This drink here is-
- Wait,

142
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,886
Wait, don't tell me!

143
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,180
I'd rather not know.

144
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,897
Kopkhun ka.

145
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:26,939
I always wanted to try ordering everything.

146
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,699
Money's great.

147
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,863
I didn't realize money could bring so much joy.

148
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,365
You didn't?

149
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:40,169
Well then, I guess you're not
as smart as I thought you were.

150
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,052
Wow! Delicious.

151
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,752
How's yours?

152
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,859
Melon, malibu, lemon.

153
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,813
And banana…

154
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,774
It's a pretty standard June Bug.

155
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,909
How does yours taste?

156
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,408
Like my ring finger?

157
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,118
Sorry?

158
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,704
Does it taste like your ring finger?

159
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,589
Yes, Would you like a taste?

160
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,309
It really does taste like your finger.

161
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,088
I told ya.

162
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,424
Banana?

163
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,684
How about this?

164
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,433
Cheers!

165
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,192
Cheers!

166
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,647
Are you okay?

167
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,198
No. No way. Ha ha.

168
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,298
Wow! Ha ha!

169
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,464
I can't taste anything anymore.

170
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,445
I think my tongue is paralyzed.

171
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,844
That's okay.

172
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,458
The taste was never important.

173
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,212
Why is it raining?

174
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,798
You said dry season.

175
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,698
It's late rainy season.

176
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,065
Isn't that the dry season?

177
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,182
Late rainy season is also rainy season.

178
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,983
That's why the plane tickets were cheap.

179
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,543
Hey, stop running! We're already soaked!

180
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,053
Slow down!!!

181
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,868
What are you doing?

182
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,564
What do you think?
I'm exhausted so I'm lying down.

183
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:38,150
Yes, but why are you lying down
in the middle of the street?

184
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,277
When I was young, back in Seogwipo,
I would do this all the time.

185
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,028
You would lie down
in the middle of the road?

186
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,866
Yeah. I'd spend all day lying down
like this, by the sea.

187
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,326
You're crazy.

188
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,621
You're lucky you're still alive.
Why would you be so reckless?

189
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,334
I like lying like this.

190
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,957
It's refreshing, and comforting.

191
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:03,634
I open my eyes and see the sky.
It almost feels like I am wrapped around it.

192
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,375
What are you, a poet?

193
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,431
Don't be silly and get up!

194
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,014
You should lie here with me.

195
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,886
Young!

196
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,555
I'm so happy right now.

197
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,858
Even my underwear is wet.
What's there to be happy about?

198
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,662
Just...

199
00:23:58,252 --> 00:24:01,447
Being here with you like this.

200
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,243
That makes me happy.

201
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,547
One day, the darkness came.

202
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,883
Literal darkness.

203
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:35,140
I couldn't see anything so I went to the hospital,
but they couldn't identify the cause.

204
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,998
So I was stuck in a hotel room for two weeks.

205
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:11,656
The only thing I could remember
before everything went dark,

206
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:15,772
was the last thing I'd seen
- the ceiling of my hotel room.

207
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:26,191
From that day on, I take photos
of every hotel I visit.

208
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,459
Their lights,

209
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,471
chandeliers,

210
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:35,117
even ceiling fans...

211
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:39,308
The things that are barely hanging on.

212
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,168
Koo-e-tan-hay-ra...

213
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,364
Koo-e-tan-hay-ra...

214
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,141
We want standard.

215
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,269
I recommend the Deluxe room.

216
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,105
We just stay three hour!

217
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,198
One thousand baht!

218
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,987
Three hundred baht!

219
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,835
One thousand.

220
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,908
Don't they have brief stays?

221
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,495
I don't think we have a choice.

222
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,370
Let's just give him 1,000 baht and rest.

223
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,066
One thousand.

224
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:58,283
1,000 baht for this?

225
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,971
This has got to be a joke.

226
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:07,048
One day we'll look back on this fondly.

227
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,457
Urgh, that's gross. Put it down.

228
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,160
Gyu Ho kept withering when he wore condoms

229
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,898
and I couldn't have sex without
condoms because of Kylie.

230
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,196
As such, Kylie had a great influence

231
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:36,844
on the frequency of my relationship with Gyu Ho.

232
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,515
We decided to give Kylie a vacation as well.

233
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,154
It was the first and last time we
had sex with without condoms.

234
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:56,250
Sex at a Bangkok guesthouse was salty and damp.

235
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,712
If that thing falls,

236
00:29:10,712 --> 00:29:13,172
we'd be ground meat, huh?

237
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,417
Then let's be a burger patty together.

238
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,467
What are you saying.

239
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,153
- What's wrong!
- What's wrong with you.

240
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:28,435
Give it to me, give it to me!

241
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,935
Hey... Its falling.

242
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,397
Okay. All right. Come here.

243
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,283
Ah! Don't do it!

244
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,990
Urgh... I don't think my underwear is dry yet.

245
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,129
Me too. It's uncomfortable.

246
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,134
A present!

247
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,923
You thieving bastard!
Why would you take this?

248
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,510
That crappy room cost us 1,000 baht!
They deserve it!

249
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,313
And it can be a souvenir.
In memory of ours and Kylie's honeymoon.

250
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,392
You're getting stranger by the minute.

251
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,144
You're rubbing off on me!

252
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,814
Is that so?

253
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,815
Anyway, it's a present. So take good care of it.

254
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,488
You're giving it to me because
you can't be arsed to lug it around, right?

255
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:59,352
What happens if we return home
and go back to arguing?

256
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,133
What?

257
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,198
What if we argue again?

258
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,011
Then we'll make up!

259
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,112
And what if we argue again?

260
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,788
We'll make up!

261
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,211
And what if we argue again?

262
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,131
We'll make up!

263
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,757
Argue again?

264
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,212
We'll make up!

265
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,301
Argue again?

266
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,430
We'll make up!

267
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,973
Argue again?

268
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,017
We'll make up!

269
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,393
Argue again?

270
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,687
We'll make up!

271
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,187
Argue again?

272
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,627
We'll make up!

273
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,478
I do not know whether there were
fireworks that night.

274
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,489
It seems that everything went by
in a flash while I was asleep.

275
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:07,997
I don't know since when, but
all the days seemed to merge into one.

276
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:53,216
Habibi, when I saw your tired face,

277
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:58,960
I felt like I wanted to comfort you in some way.

278
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:10,419
But soon I realized that those feelings
were just familiarity, not love.

279
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:21,071
I often thought about love in Bangkok with you.

280
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:30,010
Perhaps love is about sharing
ourselves, exactly as we are.

281
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,720
I once found such a person that
I could share myself with, but at the time,

282
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,248
I did not recognize their true worth.

283
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:52,609
Habibi. I have decided to live wholly as myself.

284
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:58,156
And Habibi, you also deserve
a chance to live that way.

285
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,818
Goodbye. From your nuclear weapon.

286
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,690
How on earth did I live in a place like this?

287
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,262
You could have cleaned regularly.

288
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,937
What shall we do with those?

289
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,036
What else? Chuck 'em

290
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,430
Sure.

291
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:06,224
Use some of those muscles. Grab there.

292
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,442
Hurry up.

293
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:35,698
One second.

294
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,008
I'm the only one.

295
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,466
What would I do without Eun Soo?

296
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,221
You're good at talking.
I'm going to buy you something.

297
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,904
Ice cream?

298
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:33,736
What did you say? Hold on.

299
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,560
Be careful of your feet.

300
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,232
Okay.

301
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,902
Let's go.

302
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,370
We threw away so much that
there's barely anything to move.

303
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,184
Yeah.

304
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,423
This was the only thing you
brought from your mom's house?

305
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,008
The rest wasn't to my taste.

306
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,594
There wasn't much worth taking anyway.

307
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,305
You'll have the joy of buying things one by one.

308
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,332
Yeah, I guess I will.

309
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,189
Do you know when the others will be getting here?

310
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,865
They're on their way.

311
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,878
Your mom is pretty amazing.

312
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,311
How many awards did she receive?

313
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:10,931
Do you want to have a drink?

314
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,410
Then...

315
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,556
Red? Maybe we should cook up a BBQ?

316
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,725
Sounds good.

317
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,935
We could go to the rooftop?

318
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,069
Is the door unlocked?

319
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,440
I would think so.

320
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:28,194
I heard there'll be fireworks tonight.

321
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,154
- Oh really?
- Yes.

322
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,532
Good.

323
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,784
Good.

324
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,744
Since we're holding a glass...

325
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,163
Here's to the princess meeting!

326
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,852
Princess!

327
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:45,545
Oh, it's perfect.

328
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,422
It's incredible!

329
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,215
It's fucking gorgeous.

330
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,301
Isn't this a view you're meant
to share with a lover?

331
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,440
There's no use even if you eat garlic.

332
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,349
Hold on,

333
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,400
we're all single!

334
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,942
Why? Why?

335
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,904
It's true.

336
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:09,805
It's true.

337
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:11,240
Ah, you idiot!

338
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,434
It's okay. What's wrong?

339
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,211
Eat up!

340
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:16,534
Oh, it's good.

341
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,786
It hasn't happened over the past ten years.

342
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,746
You know I'd be lost without you guys, right?

343
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,667
Yes! Honey!

344
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,494
You too, come here!

345
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,335
Okay, everyone hand over your phones.

346
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,131
If any of you are texting
with a guy, you're dead!

347
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,341
Where is it.

348
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,090
Hurry up and give it to me.

349
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,133
This bitch has a guy.

350
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,342
- You have a guy.
- You sneaky bitch.

351
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,510
- Who is it this time.
- No.

352
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,013
- Very suspicious.
- No I swear.

353
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,058
What's wrong with you?

354
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,974
No, it's really nothing.
Really... Hold on

355
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,068
Oh?

356
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,978
Look! The fireworks!

357
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,985
Wow! It's fireworks!!

358
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,970
Now say it! Who is it?

359
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,265
What the hell! Huh?

360
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:54,143
Throw him!

361
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:56,616
I wrote my past relationships as novels.

362
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,418
Preserving them as perfect love.

363
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,914
But in reality, my love life...

364
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,457
Ended in failure.

365
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,003
I wanted to understand why we left each other

366
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,632
through the process of writing a failed love,

367
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,384
but the only thing I knew from writing a novel

368
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:19,438
was the fact that I still
don't know much about love.

369
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:26,530
What are you doing, Kumakichi!

370
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:28,984
Let's go.

371
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:31,445
Wait, stop! Don't do it.

372
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:34,210
- What are you doing?
- Be careful.

373
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:44,425
If you write your wish on a lantern,
we will launch it into the sky for you.

374
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,083
I think she's Chinese.

375
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,834
On New Year's Day in China,

376
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,305
we have a tradition of writing our wishes
on a lantern and releasing them into the sky.

377
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:01,317
Let's do this.

378
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,450
[Porsche]

379
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,311
Should I do it?

380
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,644
- Slowly.
- Yeah. Be careful.

381
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,306
One, two, three!

382
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:55,320
Wow, wow! There we go.

383
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,767
Wow!

384
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:02,119
Oh, it's crazy. It's crazy.

385
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,036
Wow! Wow..

386
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,540
It's so pretty.

387
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,786
Wow, really..

388
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,266
Huh?

389
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:27,218
Huh? Hold on.

390
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:29,711
Wait, isn't that ours?

391
00:45:29,711 --> 00:45:33,639
Oh no, our wishes are on fire!

392
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:38,453
Oh dear, it seems as though yours ripped.

393
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,117
What do I do..

394
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,925
It's fine. It's fine.

395
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,846
I wrote and rewrote my wish on the lantern,

396
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:07,976
because none of it seemed
to be what I truly wanted.

397
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,519
I guess I tore the lantern
while crossing everything out.

398
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,430
[Gyu Ho]

399
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,411
Let's go.

400
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,582
The only thing that I left
on the lantern, my two-syllable

401
00:46:28,582 --> 00:46:30,457
was love.

402
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,966
That was my only wish.
