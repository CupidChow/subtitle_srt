1
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:46,016
[Love in the Big City]

2
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:05,620
For now, we need to monitor her
with routine check-ups,

3
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,539
especially with your family history.

4
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,710
God's will is perplexing.

5
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,379
The prognosis for Mom's
second surgery was not good.

6
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:24,551
Her bile duct was blocked
and the incision inflamed,

7
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,845
causing her fever to exceed 40 degrees.

8
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,305
She started to lose color.

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,655
[Young Soo: Don't worry about me
and take care of your mother.]

10
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:58,035
Progress after the surgery hasn't been bad.

11
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,632
Let's wait and see.

12
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:02,968
Okay, thank you.

13
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,599
The caregiver will be here later.

14
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,283
Is being with me so torturous?

15
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:29,204
You're always so keen
to wander off somewhere.

16
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,789
Mom.

17
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,958
I haven't been home in a whole week.

18
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,292
Right.

19
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:37,629
I'm over here, withering away,

20
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,134
but you go on home,
get drunk and enjoy yourself!

21
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,968
Hello.

22
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,558
You look so radiant.

23
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:52,477
Who would guess you're a patient?

24
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,563
I'm Deacon Yeom.

25
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:56,355
Sorry?

26
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,401
Please call me Deacon Yeom.

27
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,903
You're a deacon?

28
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:04,029
Thanks for being here.

29
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,578
What use is a son?

30
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:15,040
"Children, obey your parents
in the Lord, for this is right."

31
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,225
- Let go, don't do this.
- But I missed you.

32
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:34,895
People will see us.

33
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,063
Who will?

34
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,148
And so what if they do?

35
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:45,822
Babe, what do you think you're doing?

36
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:48,992
There's no need to announce we're gay.

37
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,077
The entire universe already knows.

38
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,537
Are you embarrassed of us?

39
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:26,487
Young Soo?

40
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:35,705
What are the chances of meeting you here?

41
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,958
It's been a while, hasn't it?

42
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,669
You punk, how have you been?

43
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,506
Chan Shik told me that
you're writing a book of reflections.

44
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:45,841
I am.

45
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,342
How's Chan Shik?

46
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,747
Great, of course.

47
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,972
He works so hard, he's swamped these days.

48
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:56,852
Did you hear?
He was nominated to run for city council.

49
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:58,812
Is he?

50
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,523
Didn't you know? Don't your cohort keep in touch?

51
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,903
Of all people, you should know.

52
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:09,364
Everyone's so busy...

53
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:13,076
How could you not know what he's up to?

54
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:16,454
If Chan Shik is up for election,
you should go and help out.

55
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:19,291
Have you really walked away from our work?

56
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,252
What were you doing here?

57
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:25,254
I was just out for a walk.

58
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:27,756
A walk?

59
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,221
With a man?

60
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,144
Are you on a date?

61
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:41,146
You shouldn't joke about that.

62
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:43,106
About what?

63
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:45,775
Being homosexual? Queer?

64
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:48,236
I guess it can happen, I'm not opposed.

65
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:50,237
People can be gay.

66
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:56,536
Come on, I'm just mucking around.

67
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,997
You shouldn't talk about that so lightly.

68
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,373
Apologize now.

69
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:03,043
I told you I was just joking!

70
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:06,324
And I know him, he's not the type.

71
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,548
Go on, tell her you're not gay.

72
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:11,134
Young Soo is totally macho.

73
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:12,552
I told you,

74
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,553
apologize.

75
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:22,269
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:31,071
We're going for lunch, come with us.

77
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,448
Pork backbone stew.

78
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:37,410
I'm sorry but I have plans
so I'd better get going.

79
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,788
Come on, let's go and get a bite.

80
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,125
We've already eaten.

81
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,961
But it's only 11 am.

82
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:48,963
Yes, we had a brunch date.

83
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,177
Let's go.

84
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:56,303
I'll see you next time.

85
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,151
Why did you do that?

86
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,736
Why did you have to do that?

87
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,865
You told my seniors we were on a date,

88
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,826
what will they think of me now?

89
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:21,037
They'll think of you as their junior.

90
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,580
Who even are they?

91
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,167
They're my seniors from our student activist movement.

92
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,420
That's no big deal.
Why were you tiptoeing?

93
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,171
Just brush them off.

94
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:32,007
It is a big deal.

95
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:36,261
The guy was Student Body President
and the woman's a famous author.

96
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,638
They're both in my social circles.

97
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:41,641
Does it even matter what they think?

98
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,435
Student Body President,

99
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,562
and a writer?

100
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:47,772
Who cares when they're full of shit?

101
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:50,774
They were treating you like dirt.

102
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,904
And you... Why did you act like I don't exist?

103
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:01,619
It's hard for me to explain.

104
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,914
What makes it so hard?

105
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,916
What even am I to you?

106
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:16,009
You call yourself activists

107
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,595
yet why are you so ignorant?

108
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:20,722
Fucking bastards.

109
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:24,516
- You only act progressive-
- You don't know anything.

110
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,298
Look who's here.

111
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,887
It's this, right?

112
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:01,930
Yeah.

113
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,808
What good will it do to hand write Bible verses?

114
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,149
Did something happen?

115
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,443
Not at all.

116
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:18,071
You're like a sulking child.

117
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,197
No I'm not.

118
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,538
Do you know Deacon Kwon's niece?

119
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:29,164
The one who had breast cancer.

120
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:33,211
She hand wrote Bible verses for 1,000 days.

121
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,463
Do you know what happened to her?

122
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:38,173
She was healed by the lord's grace.

123
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,761
I'm not exactly

124
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:45,056
hoping for a miracle.

125
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:49,184
I just hope to live a life
that God deems beautiful.

126
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:54,022
I hope the same for you.

127
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:24,137
[The guy with the pretentious
tattoos never fails to anger me.]

128
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,305
Jeez...

129
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:32,019
[Young Soo : Are you okay? I'm sorry about earlier.]

130
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:41,028
You big softie...

131
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,416
I'm sorry, I'm near the hospital
but the traffic is so bad.

132
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,375
I'll be there soon.

133
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:02,300
- Mom, the carer's coming.
- I need the bathroom.

134
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,511
I need to go-

135
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,762
That little prick.

136
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,270
Always leaving a mess.

137
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:53,226
You would look great in this, let me treat you.

138
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,520
We should buy matching ones.

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,564
Is that okay?

140
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:59,399
Don't.

141
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,610
I told you, I'm buying.

142
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,905
You said we'd do whatever I want today

143
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,574
and I choose to splurge.

144
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,244
We could eat countless meals with this money,

145
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:13,246
Come on,

146
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,956
it's to celebrate our "Day 22."

147
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,085
Day 22?

148
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,589
I'm sorry for pestering you.

149
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:31,096
Let's go and try them on.

150
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:41,357
I know posh restaurants in Cheongdam,

151
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:44,235
let's have steak with pasta.

152
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,821
I don't really like meat.

153
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,406
What?

154
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,366
We've had barbecue together.

155
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:55,538
The thing is, I like barbecue but not steak.

156
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:57,999
Then just have the pasta.

157
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,667
That's all done for you.

158
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,543
Thank you.

159
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:07,550
What about seafood noodles?
Tuna sashimi or marinated crab?

160
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,636
Were you a whale in your past life?

161
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,348
Why all the seafood?

162
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:16,059
- It's just too odd.
- What is?

163
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,102
Two men eating pasta in a place like that.

164
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,442
Is there anything you don't find odd?

165
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:54,388
I'm sorry, I was being too uptight.

166
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,434
Aren't you hot?

167
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,938
You should put this down.

168
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,814
Stop.

169
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:25,520
Let's take a photo.

170
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:28,815
I'd rather not.

171
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:32,319
Please don't.

172
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,823
Please.

173
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,830
Young.

174
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,625
I don't like this stuff.

175
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,668
It's not like this is all I like.

176
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:55,051
I just makes me uncomfortable.

177
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:57,385
And I'm very uncomfortable.

178
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:01,849
You always wear baggy pants
and worn out t-shirts.

179
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:05,186
Your bag is always full of crap.

180
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:08,396
North Korean spies wouldn't dress like you.

181
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:17,155
Do you know the sort of life I've lived?

182
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:24,038
Just how hard I've struggled

183
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,998
and how it pains me to this day.

184
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,629
Someone like you couldn't even imagine.

185
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,130
Why is why you'd ask

186
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,342
to eat pasta at a restaurant
in matching t-shirts.

187
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:40,220
What does eating pasta
have to do with your tough past?

188
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:44,058
Not a single soul

189
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:46,686
cares about you and I.

190
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,020
Not a single soul?

191
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,939
Everyone stares when we walk past.

192
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,776
Do I embarrass you?

193
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,739
Do you only want to meet privately?

194
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,288
Yes.

195
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:28,935
Yes?

196
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,273
Sorry?

197
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:49,665
Is she really okay?

198
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,793
She wasn't earlier.

199
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:56,964
I've been told she's better now so I'll clock out.

200
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:59,758
I've stayed quite overtime...

201
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:58,609
My son.

202
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:02,445
You look nothing like me
yet how are you so pretty?

203
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:07,118
I'm pretty because I don't take after you.

204
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:09,829
You're absolutely right.

205
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:12,247
Hand me my bag.

206
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,883
Here.

207
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:25,343
Go out and treat yourself.

208
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,931
No thanks.

209
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:31,267
Where would I go, with whom?

210
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,894
You have plenty of friends.

211
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:35,687
Can I really?

212
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:40,900
No, I won't.

213
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,278
Go on.

214
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,867
Are you sure?

215
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:02,715
Honey, how are things with the fish lover?

216
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,217
Not good, that darn boomer.

217
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:07,052
Why, did something happen?

218
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:10,264
He wants to kiss, have sex,
and do everything in between

219
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:12,057
but he refuses to eat pasta.

220
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,351
That slag!

221
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:20,024
He thinks two men eating pasta
at a restaurant is odd and "too gay."

222
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:24,403
God forbid you share a macaron,
you might combust into flames.

223
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,030
I told you not to see him.

224
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,365
Maybe his dick was huge.

225
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:30,951
Bitch, fess up. Is that true?

226
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:33,328
Shut up and drink.

227
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,458
Is it this big?

228
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:44,088
Cheers!

229
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:55,768
Hello?

230
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,937
You. Let's meet.

231
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:00,356
Young, I'm working right now-

232
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:03,234
Shut up and tell me
if we're gonna meet.

233
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,777
You should watch your tone.

234
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,947
As should you.

235
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,452
If you want to meet, you come here.

236
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:14,912
I won't.

237
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:17,706
I'm not your dog
that comes if you whistle.

238
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,791
I was indeed his dog.

239
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,523
I can't stop thinking of you.

240
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,654
I don't stop missing you.

241
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:53,324
You're driving me insane.

242
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:59,205
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,112
Young Soo?

244
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,909
Are you awake?

245
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:41,373
Were you out with friends?

246
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:43,834
In Itaewon?

247
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:47,171
Yes, I needed a pick me up.

248
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:48,505
And?

249
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,090
Did it work?

250
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,258
Yes, thanks to you.

251
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:55,971
Didn't you sleep?

252
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:57,890
I had a manuscript deadline.

253
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,600
Not even a wink?

254
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,060
Yeah.

255
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,937
Come to bed and get some sleep.

256
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:13,237
I looked it up.

257
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:16,449
Your novel.

258
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,663
Did you read it?

259
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:24,374
You're a really talented writer.

260
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,210
Whatever.

261
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:31,339
You'll become a great novelist someday.

262
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,678
One day,

263
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:41,392
when my novels become bestsellers
and I become rich,

264
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:45,269
I'll take care of you.

265
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,942
I can't wait.

266
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:02,746
Easy, mister.

267
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,915
At your age,
you need to watch your stamina.

268
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:09,419
Let's go to bed.

274
00:26:55,697 --> 00:27:01,210
What on earth was going on
inside that mind of his?

275
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,414
In his universe, love and hate,

276
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,543
affection and anxiety,

277
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,710
seemed inseparable.

278
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,647
His anxiety

279
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:28,857
stirred a familiar rage inside me.

280
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:33,957
Fury toward the one
who had abandoned me

281
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:36,583
and left me in a world of fear.

282
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:47,471
Please, let go of me.
Mom, please!

283
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:49,348
Are you crazy?

284
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,516
I can't let you become that.

285
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,644
I can't give up on you, I won't.

286
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:56,605
Mom, please! Save me!

287
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:59,816
Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who-

288
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:03,653
Mom, please. Don't let them take me!

289
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:27,051
You're back.

290
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:38,980
Mom.

291
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:43,526
Shall we go for a walk
after church this Sunday?

292
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:47,155
That's nothing difficult,
you don't need to ask.

293
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:49,448
We'll go for a walk.

294
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:53,536
There's someone

295
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:56,956
I'd like you to meet.

296
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,750
Who?

297
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:11,095
Someone important.

298
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:16,934
Very important to me.

299
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:21,355
Must I meet them?

300
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Yes.

301
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:27,903
You must.

302
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:31,992
Okay then,

303
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:33,659
I will.

304
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:42,520
Young?

305
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,565
Hey.

306
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:47,358
Yes?

307
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,488
This Sunday at 2 pm.

308
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:54,031
Meet me in that park.

309
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:01,539
My mom and I will wait for you there.

310
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,127
Your mom?

311
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:07,670
Don't come if you don't want to.

312
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:14,302
I'll be there.

313
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:16,095
See you then.

314
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:38,075
The person you have called is unavailable-

315
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:49,086
Didn't you say we were meeting someone?

316
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:52,883
They're not coming.

317
00:31:52,883 --> 00:31:54,717
Why not?

318
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,973
I guess they're busy.

319
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:04,185
That's a relief.

320
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,154
Young.

321
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:31,338
My mother's been drinking again.

322
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:34,340
I couldn't find time to get in touch.

323
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:40,095
Can I see you tomorrow?

324
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,894
I'll make a reservation
at a place with good pasta.

325
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:47,853
You have to come.

326
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:58,532
After all he put me through,
I still had feelings for him.

327
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:00,449
It was agonizing.

328
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:09,416
Going somewhere?

329
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:16,549
I'm meeting someone.

330
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:18,802
You are?

331
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:20,971
Your caregiver will be here soon

332
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:23,055
so don't worry.

333
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,017
I'll see you later.

334
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:41,407
Please enjoy.

335
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,829
We're finally eating pasta together.

336
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,088
Thanks.

337

338
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:03,220
Your mother seems to love you dearly.

339
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:07,474
Is that what you think?

340
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:12,272
Your face is that of someone being loved.

341
00:34:12,272 --> 00:34:16,817
It shows, as does the face
of someone who's giving love.

342
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:25,118
To have family who take care of you

343
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:27,036
is a blessing.

344
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:38,047
That's why, Young...

345
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:40,799
Yes?

346
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm leaving for America.

347
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,059
America?

348
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:51,977
My older sister lives there.

349
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,939
When will you be back?

350
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:02,696
I've found a job.

351
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,954
It's near Washington.

352
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:12,498
I start next month.

353
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,796
You should move on

354
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:20,172
and meet a good guy.

355
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:28,138
Or should I say

356
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:32,059
meet a good woman?

357
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,652
Young Soo.

358
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:49,118
What did you think we were?

359
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:54,707
You didn't...

360
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,044
Did you think this was love?

361
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,808
I guess you did...

362
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:37,708
It's not quite my taste.

363
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:00,607
Bastard!

364
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:03,526
You bastard!

365
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:05,278
Please, don't do this here.

366
00:37:05,278 --> 00:37:07,489
You fucking bastard!

367
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:10,240
Sir, please!

368
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:17,303
Deacon, I'll just be a second.

369
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:19,304
Nurse?

370
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,647
Don't try too hard.

371
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:32,567
We all die eventually.

372
00:40:50,712 --> 00:40:53,172
Young?

373
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:55,174
- Young!
- You can't be here.

374
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:59,762
- Young!
- Please leave now.

375
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:01,389
Young!

376
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,182
Let go of me, I'm his friend!

377
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:04,392
Young!

378
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:07,019
Young, we're here!

[A Commentary by Noh Young Soo]

381
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:39,267
Hello Young, it's me.

382
00:43:40,256 --> 00:43:44,969
It's been so long, I feel awkward.

383
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:49,639
Strangely, it feels like an eternity's passed.

384
00:43:50,474 --> 00:43:53,561
Not a year but maybe a decade.

385
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:57,314
Or maybe an even longer period of time.

386
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:00,901
That day

387
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:04,030
and ever since,

388
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,241
I went to that park many times.

389
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:11,328
From a distance, I saw you with your mother.

390
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:14,706
The pair of you looked so loving.

391
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,752
I thought that maybe,

392
00:44:19,545 --> 00:44:23,757
you and I might have looked similar.

393
00:44:26,093 --> 00:44:28,304
I know it's not my place

394
00:44:28,304 --> 00:44:30,681
but I hope

395
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:33,975
this commentary will help you
write your book.

396
00:44:35,937 --> 00:44:37,729
Young.

397
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:41,566
I truly hope that you forgive me,

398
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,404
the coward I was in our past.

399
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:55,038
Are you dressed?

400
00:44:55,665 --> 00:44:57,458
Hey.

401
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,628
What are you doing?
It's very unlike you.

402
00:45:00,628 --> 00:45:02,171
Never mind this.

403
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:03,506
Over there.

404
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:07,259
Grab me the yellow thing from that drawer.

405
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:15,517
Why is this here
when you won't even read it?

406
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:16,746
- Shall we take a rest?
- Why, do your legs hurt?

407
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:20,373
No, I just thought
you might be exhausted.

408
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:24,503
You're all grown up now.

409
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:26,464
Whatever.

410
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:28,256
Wait here.

411
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:48,819
You're meant to throw your trash
in your own trash can.

412
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:51,863
It's not my trash.

413
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,088
I always thought

414
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:10,673
that I was such a daring person.

415
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:19,683
I thought I had a lion heart
and never kept any regrets.

416
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:23,228
I only realized I was wrong
after I had you.

417
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:28,566
When you were in elementary,

418
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:33,489
there was a day when I thought I'd lost you.

419
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:37,784
School had ended hours ago
but you still hadn't come home.

420
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,413
It was chaos, no doubt.

421
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:44,250
I ran around like a madwoman,
searching for you.

422
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,044
Then, in the distance,

423
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,379
I saw you.

424
00:47:50,423 --> 00:47:56,845
I watched as you took a few steps,
then stopped, and walked again.

425
00:47:58,472 --> 00:48:00,266
That day, I saw you

426
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:02,559
in a different light.

427
00:48:03,978 --> 00:48:06,522
And it scared me.

428
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:09,065
I guess I was always distracted.

429
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:13,821
I think that's why I hurt you,

430
00:48:13,821 --> 00:48:16,322
because my heart is frail.

431
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:22,121
I wanted to hold you tight,

432
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:24,747
caged in my small embrace.

433
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:44,434
Everything that fades

434
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:48,188
is truly beautiful.

435
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:51,441
Is that so?

436
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,053
You're right.

437
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:49,415
Isn't this a song by Lee Eun Ha?

438
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:51,835
Do you know it?

439
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:54,171
Of course I do.

440
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:57,174
But how do you know this classic?

441
00:49:57,174 --> 00:50:00,301
I picked it up while studying the universe.

442
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,889
You did?

443
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:10,436
How beautiful.

444
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:17,277
So beautiful.
