- Respects?
- To my mom.

Everyone's here from her college rivals

00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,616
to churchgoers who mocked her matchmaking.

9
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,326
Even the ex-husband who cheated.

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,287
I have to honor her.

11

Is the pearl brooch overkill?

12
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,249
It's gorgeous. You look stunning.

Don't you think the song's offbeat?

23
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,929
It's awkward to put Korean lyrics to a foreign song.

24
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,648
- Sounds like a ghost wailing.
- Tell me about it.

25

Yeah, he's the one.

00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,727
Why's he coming?

33
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,897
I guess Mom asked for his help
on some paperwork.

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,525
He needs me to review it.

35
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,242
He's a lawyer.

36
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,198
There's a lot of stuff to sort out
since your Mom passed.

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,752
You should find a new place, too.
There's no need to live near school.

00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,764
Yeah, just for tonight.

Shall I stay with you for the night?

44
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,019

these documents so quickly?

Guys call me when they're bored
and leave once they're entertained.

179

They leave to find their heartthrob romance.

Sorry, I'm just messing with you.

363
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,203
No formalities, okay?

364
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,541
Sure.

365
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,797

370
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:19,278
Seolhee Nursing School.

371
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,871
March 2019? It expired ten months ago.

372
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,713
Young, it's me!

373
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,803
Hiya.

374
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,847
What are you doing here?

375
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,885
What is this?

376
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,637
I'm putting up curtains.

377
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,097
Why curtains?

378
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,099
You were squinting in your sleep.

379
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,275
You're ugly when you squint.

380
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,329
Whoa, it's really dark.

381
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,211
One, two, three, four, five...

382
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,796
Five what?

383
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,132
I'm counting your moles.

384
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,468
Six, seven, eight--

385
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,811
I don't have that many!

386
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,650
You're dodging me?

387
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,503
I need to get to work now.

388
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,545
Now?

389
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,891
Yeah, I'm having dinner
with my colleagues before we open.

390
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,808
Aren't you taking this?

391
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,435
It's too heavy and I rarely use it anyway.

392
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,737
Why don't you stay for--

393
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,114
some coffee...

394
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,618
Young.

395
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,828
Are you sure you're alright?

396
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,205
Why do you still live alone in my place?

397
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,458
How is this your place?

398
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,509
It's been mine for ages.

399
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,555
Young.

400
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,225
When will you finally come home?

401
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,473
I'm waiting for my prodigal son.

402
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,684
When? I don't know...

403
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,652
I'll go when it's time.

404
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,657
Young.

405
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:57,288
Did you meet someone good?

406
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,213
Young? It's me.

[Three missed calls from Gyu]

408
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,761
Young, wake up!

409
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,682
How come you're here?

410
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,386
Sweet treats make you feel good.

411
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,388
- Are you drunk?
- No.

412
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,149
We were drinking but I only had one.

413
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,738
It's blueberry flavored. Open up.

414
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,817
There we go.

415
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,119
- It's too sweet.
- Don't furrow your brow.

416
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,116
- Shall we go out?
- Are you nuts? I need to sleep.

417
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,701
- I know you slept lots.
- How would you know?

418
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,287
I've been calling since midnight.

419
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,580
Maybe I just didn't answer--

420
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,999
Zip it. Let's go out.

421
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:54,136
- Seriously?
- Come on, let's go out!

422
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,716
- Where shall we go?
- Where do you want to go?

423
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,885
I want to go somewhere cold.

424
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,188
It's winter, the whole peninsula is cold.

425
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,193
- I want to see Seoul.
- You're looking at it now.

426
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,462
How are you already out of breath?

427
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,167
Do you think this stone

428
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,336
is really hundreds of years old?

429
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,221
I wouldn't know.

430
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,136
Ever since I was young,

431
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:46,764
I've wanted to come to land, Seoul.

432
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,185
I wanted to go
to the highest place possible.

433
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,403
Why not climb Mount Halla?

434
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,534
I was thinking...

435
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,163
Shall we go out?

436
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,200
We're outside right now.

437
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,502
You know what I mean.

438
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,591
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,296
Gyu Ho.

440
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,006
Yeah?

441
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,267
Before we date, you need to know two things.

442
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,139
Firstly, I don't have a sweet tooth.

443
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,934
So you don't need to buy me macarons.

444
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,445
- Just give me cash.
- You're funny.

445
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,407
And the second thing is...

446
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,988
In 2014, two days before my enlistment,

447
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,158
my ex had come all the way
to Nonsan to see me off.

448
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,209
I'd been totally psyched.

449
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,604
Kylie...

450
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,735
Her music's always good.

451
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,754
Can I take it off?

452
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,757
You shouldn't...

453
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,510
It's chafing.

454
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,089
Okay then.

455
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:47,802
I spent my last night with him
and went straight to training.

456
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,847
Exactly seven weeks later.

457
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,975
I had a blood test
and the military doctor asked me,

458
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,068
Are you a bottom or a top?

459
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,156
Sorry?

460
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,439
[HIV positive]
[Preventing HIV]

461
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:09,323
The truth is the chances of spreading
HIV to a sex partner are low.

462
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,534
You're more likely to pass on a cold.

463
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,370
With a condom, the chances are close to zero.

464
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,549
But I know that won't lessen
the weight of this burden.

465
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,920
Turns out my piece of trash ex

466
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,057
had been sleeping around
while he was dating me.

467
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,939
Cheers!

468
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,936
How long has it been?

469
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,691
- Three months, maybe?
- A gift! You're up next!

470
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,819
You'd look better in a beret than me!
You look totally masc.

471
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,448
Bitch! How could you be so cruel?

472
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,241
Tell us, how did you get out?

473
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,910
Did you eat poop to get sick?

474
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,128
How on earth did you know?

475
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:01,341
- Ji Tae, this is perfect for you!
- How dare you!

476
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,262
Cover your glasses, everyone.

477
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,684
He has the thing.

478
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,602
I'm going to the bathroom.

479
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,937
What's the thing?

480
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,030
H... I...

481
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,370
I'd listened to Kylie Wilde
on that fateful night

482
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:42,375
so I decided to call
my new companion "Kylie."

483
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:47,346
I was stuck with it forever.
Why not give it a glamorous name?

484
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,438
That's how I met Kylie.

485
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,186
She's been with me
for five years, like family.

486
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,571
Even closer, maybe.

487
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:10,369
We share the same blood vessels,
same nourishment, and breathe as one.

488
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,705
Put differently,

489
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,416
she's another me.

490
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,837
She will always be me until the day I die.

491
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,261
You're the first person I've told.

492
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,176
Don't feel burdened, though.

493
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,971
I've always been too trusting of men
so it's not worth much,

494
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,266
but I felt like I could trust you.

495
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,485
If it's too much too handle,
you can walk away.

496
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,525
Forget I ever entered your world

497
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,820
and attend nursing school
like you've always done.

498
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,914
Go on making drinks at the club on weekends.

499
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,963
I'm going to head home.

500
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:08,302
Do some sightseeing and thinking,
then let me know.

501
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,515
Or don't, if it's a bother.

502
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,598
How can you talk about it like it's nothing?

503
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,322
It really is nothing,

504
00:44:06,322 --> 00:44:08,563
compared to what life throws us.

505
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:13,109
But why say it with a smile?
It makes me sad.

506
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,536
If anyone should be crying, it's me.

507
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,716
Did I ever tell you...

508
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,261
that I really like cats?

509
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,590
I can't adopt one, though.

510
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,427
Why are we talking about cats?

511
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:43,647
You're like a tabby cat
that's crabby and mean.

512
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,060
From now on,

513
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,987
I'll call you "Crabby Tabby."
