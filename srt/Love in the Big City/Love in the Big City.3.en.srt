00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:45,933
[Love in the Big City]

2
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,751
Mom, what is it?

3
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:56,545
What took you so long to answer?

4
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,424
I'm really busy right now, so...

5
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,383
I have cancer.

6
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,554
Cancer?

7
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:07,223
- You have cancer?
- Yes, cancer.

8
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:08,600
Cancer.

9
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,729
I had a bad feeling so I went
for a checkup and it's cancer.

10
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,107
Those insurance policies will finally pay off.

11
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,817
Treatment costs 200 million won.

12
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:20,235
Did you win the lottery?

13
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,907
Hallelujah, it's as good as!

14
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,074
Two weeks later,

15
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:29,329
Mom had an operation with
a reputable uterine cancer doctor.

16
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,457
After a peaceful nap,
you'll be rid of your cancer.

17
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,292
Doctor?

18
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,586
I don't want to be put under.

19
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,838
Everything will be fine
so don't you worry.

20
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,590
Doctor, it's not that.

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,176
I just want to feel
the pain Christ endured.

22
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:46,721
I wish to feel the pain he endured
on the hill of Golgotha,

23
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,098
to share his pain of tearing flesh,

24
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,658
amen...

25
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:58,440
Her cancer was more severe
than we'd initially thought.

26
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,225
It seemed to have metastasized to her
lymph nodes, and her liver was bad.

27
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:21,589
They removed her uterus
and gave her radiation

28
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:24,508
but the cancer refused to go away.

29
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,182
Mi Ae once told me

30
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:34,394
that when your head's about to explode,

31
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:36,980
you should meet new people
in a new environment

32
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,147
or learn something new.

33
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,075
Hello, my nickname is "OMG."

34
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:53,371
I'm panromantic, asexual,
and a member of a queer rights group.

35
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:55,874
I also live an eco-vegan lifestyle.

36
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,750
My tag is "AlphaGo."

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,669
I'm in college studying-

38
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:02,213
- I'm studying, sorry...
- It's okay.

39
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:05,008
Hello, I'm "Wind."

40
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,051
I used to be a teacher

41
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:10,013
but recently retired
and now spend my days at home.

42
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:12,223
You can call me "James."

43
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:16,269
I work as an environment officer
for the Eunpyeong District.

44
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,937
I'm...

45
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:20,397
"Blueberry."

46
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:28,197
I'm here today to strengthen myself.

47
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:30,074
I'm "Legend of Autumn."

48
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,910
I run a vegan leather business

49
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,205
and I'm here to meet
and communicate with new people.

50
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:38,248
I'm glad to meet you.

51
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:45,172
Will our latecomer introduce himself?

52
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,343
I'm Noh Young Soo.

53
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,887
I'm a creative.

54
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,145
Now then, shall we start the class?

55
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:03,274
In his most prolific work "Ethics,"

56
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,527
Spinoza lists 48 human emotions...

57
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,488
Hey.

58
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,365
- Can I have a sip?
- Sorry?

59
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:18,373
all human suffering
stems from our passions.

60
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:21,501
Spinoza believed that human emotions

61
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:25,337
are governed by the laws of nature.

62
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,007
Noh Young Soo.

63
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:31,052
His nonchalant, if not icy, self-introduction

64
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:34,097
gave the sinister impression of a narcissist

65
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:38,141
and I determined
not to get better acquainted.

66
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,694
Hey.

67
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:50,405
I'll buy you a coffee.

68
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,573
Sorry?

69
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,534
No, that's alright.

70
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,494
Please.

71
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:59,580
I'd like to pay back the favor.

72
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,250
Favor? There's really no need.

73
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,960
It's alright.

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,671
There's a cafe right over there,

75
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:09,089
I won't keep you long.

76
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:28,316
Thank you.

77
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,372
Were you very thirsty?

78
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:44,374
Yes, you saved me.

79
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,462
I'm a recent graduate,

80
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,213
currently a writer.

81
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:51,006
I see.

82
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:05,772
Do you watch any shows?

83
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,398
No.

84
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:09,232
I see.

85
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:11,736
Do you have any hobbies?

86
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:15,113
I like to read

87
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:19,702
and I joined this class
to do some self reflection.

88
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:22,704
I haven't been doing so great recently.

89
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:26,792
I see.

90
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:29,420
My mother

91
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,256
is an alcoholic.

92
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,967
I sent her off to rehab

93
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,428
but she keeps escaping.

94
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:40,556
None of the treatments seem to be working.

95
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,267
She keeps hiding alcohol.

96
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,978
Underneath her bed,

97
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:47,230
inside her bag.

98
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,900
She even has early signs
of alcohol-related dementia

99
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,653
so I'm always chasing after her,

100
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,737
once every other day.

101
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:58,950
That sounds awful.

102
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,953
But she won't admit to her addiction.

103
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:05,123
Alcoholics are crafty, you see.

104
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:09,835
They construct their excuses
like a Dutchman building a dyke.

105
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:13,923
Stephen King.

106
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:16,550
Yes, "On Writing."

107
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:23,474
My mother's also sick.

108
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,518
She has uterine cancer

109
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:28,312
but she's so stubborn.

110
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:32,482
She just had surgery
and is in hospital under my care.

111
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:36,153
We have a lot in common.

112
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:39,364
We do?

113
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:43,035
It's your first class, right?

114
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,370
Yes.

115
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,371
How did you know?

116
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:49,708
I didn't recognize you.

117
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,506
I would have remembered

118
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:58,593
such a cute face.

119
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:00,469
Right...

120
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,639
Sorry?

121
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:34,377
[Noh Young Soo]

122
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:45,013
You're fucking sexy...

123
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:58,777
[Noh Young Soo: Did you get home safely?]

124
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:07,036
[Go Young: I did, thanks.]

125
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:09,247
[Noh Young Soo: Do you like pork backbone?]

126
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:16,253
[There's a good stew place, would you like to go some time?]

127
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:29,307
[Go Young: Sure! I love pork backbone stew.]

128
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,418
Have you been fasting?

129
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:03,217
Pork backbone stew
originates from the Jeolla province.

130
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:07,596
In 1899, during the construction
of the Gyeongin Line,

131
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:10,474
workers who moved to Incheon
often ate the stew

132
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:13,060
and the dish gained its popularity.

133
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,398
An old district office in Incheon
was replaced by a slaughterhouse

134
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:20,651
and because potatoes
were easy to get a hold of,

135
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,362
workers liked dishes with potatoes.

136
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:26,907
The modern pork backbone stew
has elevated nutrition and taste.

137
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:31,620
It's a dish with the perfect balance
of carbs, protein, and fat.

138
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,957
I like pork backbone stew
and have tried it everywhere...

139
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,542
Young Soo.

140
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:40,796
May I ask what you do for a living?

141
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:41,839
All of a sudden?

142
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,091
You only said you were a creative.

143
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:48,095
You're so knowledgeable,
I'm curious what you do.

144
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,015
I'm just...

145
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,267
the average worker.

146
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,727
Okay, got it.

147
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:09,575
Is your eyesight quite bad?

148
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,410
These glasses?

149
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:17,540
I got hit by a ball this weekend
so I wore them to cover my eyes.

150
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,712
Did you play soccer?

151
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:23,172
How did you know?

152
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:27,301
One of my friends injured his retina
while playing soccer.

153
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:30,053
He was exempt from military service.

154
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:33,933
To be exact, I play futsal.

155
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,560
Why don't you join us sometime?

156
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,187
It's not particularly dangerous.

157
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:43,358
I don't like sports.

158
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,226
Don't you have an umbrella?

159
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,438
I didn't think it would rain.

160
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,860
Shall we share?

161
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:29,737
Yes.

162
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,207
How will you get home?

163
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,041
The subway.

164
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:57,892
Since meeting him, I couldn't stop writing.

165
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:01,312
I wanted to know more about this mysterious guy.

166
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:05,065
My head was bursting with thoughts of him,

167
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:07,567
expanding tirelessly.

168
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:21,624
This newfound energy
was overwhelming at first

169
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:26,377
but I decided to write down
and explore my changing emotions.

170
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:29,089
Let's see his face.

171
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:30,508
I don't have a photo.

172
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,301
Show us his profile then.

173
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,469
He doesn't have one.

174
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:34,887
Are you sure he's gay?

175
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,515
In all honesty, I have no clue.

176
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,101
Honey, are you joking?

177
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:44,646
Give me your phone, let's pick apart his texts.

178
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,826
A sky pic?

179
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,246
"It's great weather to take a walk."

180
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:01,747
Hold up.

181
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,540
Why?

182
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:08,921
"It's great weather to take a walk."

183
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,339
Pic of a stray cat.

184
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,883
"This is a cat I feed."

185
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:14,593
"How adorable."

186
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,595
Is that stewed mackerel?

187
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:19,515
"I found a great mackerel place."

188
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:23,769
"They use perilla oil and ginger
to mask the fishy smell..."

189
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,771
"It's good, I'll take you next time."

190
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,068
Cancer-fighting foods?

191
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:35,155
My mom.

192
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:36,824
Did you meet while hiking?

193
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:39,867
No, in philosophy class.

194
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,538
Are you mad?

195
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:46,333
In my seasoned opinion,
he doesn't seem to be gay.

196
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,545
Gays don't talk about
the weather and mackerel stew.

197
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,338
No, he could be gay.

198
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,841
He definitely seems interested.

199
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,676
What do you two eat?

200
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:01,557
Pork backbone stew, grilled fish,
pork chops, fermented soy bean soup.

201
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,225
Ugh, stinky.

202
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:06,145
- And pork bulgogi.
- Come on!

203
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,313
Is there nothing else?

204
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,398
Any clues about which way he swings?

205
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:19,533
Once, it was raining
and we shared an umbrella.

206
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:24,580
He tilted it my way
and his entire shoulder got soaked.

207
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,915
That's not enough, is there anything else?

208
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,588
Then how about this?

209
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:53,901
I totally get a vibe.
Why didn't you have sex?

210
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,737
How could I when I don't even know if he's gay?

211
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,989
He walked you to your door.

212
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,034
Straight guys don't do that,
he's totally interested.

213
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:07,247
- He was asking for sex.
- You delusional bitch.

214
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:09,833
I don't think he's one of us.

215
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,502
Just don't meet him.

216
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:15,046
He sounds like a nutcase and a total boomer.

217
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,635
Do I have bad taste in men?

218
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,720
Absolutely, yes.

219
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,690
Okay, I'm coming.

220
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,737
Sorry, I have to go.

221
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:40,989
Where are you going?

222
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,533
Hey!

223
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,868
Where are you going?

224
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,287
My mom's asking for me.

225
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:48,539
I have to go, sorry.

226
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,290
See you!

227
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,709
Are you meeting Mr. Mackerel?

228
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,264
Are you here?

229
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,890
I told you to hurry up.

230
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:14,939
mom what is this?

231
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,277
let's go for a walk.

232
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:21,612
I've got permission from the doctor.

233
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:33,624
The outside air is so refreshing.

234
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,465
Air pollution levels are sky high,
what do you mean refreshing?

235
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:41,717
Today's air quality is "very bad."

236
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:45,136
So is my mood, very bad.

237
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,056
I hand washed your dirty diapers, you know.

238
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:53,520
Why not ask your carer
to talk you on a walk?

239
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,981
I should know better
than to rely on you.

240
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:58,776
It's like when your grandma had cancer.

241
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,820
You could barely walk
but you crawled over to her

242
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,072
and slapped her right across the face.

243
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,076
- That's the sort of kid you were!
- Come on.

244
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,911
When will you stop bringing that up?

245
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,829
I'll stop when I'm dead, deal with it.

246
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,959
Son, please.

247
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:20,672
Be good to your dying mother.

248
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:23,090
It's all for your own good.

249
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:25,803
That reminds me,

250
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:28,305
do you remember Deacon Park?

251
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:32,559
Her son was a handful and went to
a college much worse than yours.

252
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,022
But he's already married
and bought a flat in Pangyo.

253
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,942
Isn't one of your friends married
and living in Songpa?

254
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,027
Mi Ae or whatever her name is.

255
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:45,530
- Why are you bringing that up?
- Why do you think?

256
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,201
Young.

257
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,578
I run a marriage agency,

258
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:54,373
I could easily find you a match.

259
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:55,999
Marriage is the answer.

260
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,752
It's always the answer!

261
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:03,673
My mom sure talks like
she had the picture perfect marriage

262
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,930
but that couldn't be further from reality.

263
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,849
My bad, honey!

264
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,183
It's okay!

265
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:20,816
My dad was living a double life
when I was in primary school

266
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:25,278
so I guess theirs was
the worst marriage imaginable.

267
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:28,948
Shoot!

268
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:32,774
You're doing great!

269
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:37,332
Never in my life had I seen him
looking so happy and peaceful.

270
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:42,211
It was a side of him
that Mom and I had never seen.

271
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:59,061
Mom instantly filed for divorce
and became our breadwinner.

272
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:17,538
Good shot!

273
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:42,605
Dude, not so hard.

274
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:45,024
Are you okay?

275
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:47,610
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:50,321
I'm alright.

277
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,158
Go.

278
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:57,119
Please go.

279
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,094
You're really out of shape.

280
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:13,887
I am?

281
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:18,392
- It's been so long, we should go out for drinks.
- Shall we?

282
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,894
You can't back out today
like you did last time.

283
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,243
[My thoughts kept me quiet.]

284
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:40,621
[We sat in silence, until I could see the base of my cup.]

285
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,540
You can't back out today
like you did last time.

286
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,917
You have to come.

287
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:29,170
You could ask your friend to join.

288
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:41,933
We're going for drinks.

289
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,934
Will you come?

290
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,398
I'm pretty exhausted.

291
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:52,151
You are?

292
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:55,863
Okay then, get some rest.

293
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,938
[Ho Min: Are you at the hospital?]

294
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:32,733
[We're clubbing. Can you come?]

295
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:26,705
Eight tequila shots.

296
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,372
Sure.

297
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:34,171
Bitch, what's gotten into you?

298
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:35,881
I'm going to drink and forget.

299
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:39,342
Alright, I'm in. Young's had it rough these days.

300
00:25:39,342 --> 00:25:40,510
If that's so...

301
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,680
we better keep up the pace!

302
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,224
Bitches, let's get stupid drunk!

303
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:48,809
Cheers!

304
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:56,943
♫ Stop right there, my sexy love ♫

305
00:25:56,943 --> 00:26:01,448
♫ I see your deep gaze, my sexy love ♫

306
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,159
♫ You're shaking my unyielding heart ♫

307
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,621
♫ You're tearing all my icy walls apart ♫

308
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:09,247
♫ On this electric night ♫

309
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:13,918
♫ Your gaze calls my name just right ♫

310
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,340
♫ Stop right there, come to me, I dare ♫

311
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,760
♫ Come and listen to this confession I now declare ♫

312
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,681
♫ Your have such sexy eyes,
sexy nose, sexy lips, sexy love ♫

313
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,310
♫ Everything about you is so sexy ♫

314
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,938
♫ Sexy eyes, sexy nose, sexy mouth ♫

315
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:37,525
♫ Don't you know, I find you incredibly sexy ♫

316
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:41,737
♫ No, no, no, no, can't you feel my love? ♫

317
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:07,806
Yeah?

318
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:11,810
Why couldn't I get a hold of you last night?

319
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,313
- I was sleeping.
- Son, will you come to me?

320
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:18,857
I'm a minute away from meeting the lord.

321
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:24,823
- What are you on about?
- You know what?

322
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:27,117
When your grandma was sick

323
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:30,245
I feared that my breathing
would disturb her

324
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:33,206
so I didn't even go to the bathroom.

325
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:36,376
I got a UTI from holding it in.

326
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:41,089
But now that I'm the one
knocking on heaven's door,

327
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:42,590
you're nowhere to be seen.

328
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,594
I should just hurry up and croak.

329
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:49,805
Stop talking like that,
I'm going to you now.

330
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:52,225
Hurry up.

331
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,978
Your mom's dying, you should be here.

332
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:57,272
Must I die without seeing you one last-

333
00:27:57,272 --> 00:28:00,525
I told you I'm coming,
I'll go to you now!

334
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:02,609
Just wait.

335
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,711
This is rough...

336
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:26,926
I heard your daughter's in Korea.

337
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:30,972
Give me a shot, I'll find her the perfect match.

338
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:34,516
The man's a doctor who graduated from Sungkyunkwan-

339
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:38,063
Not good enough?

340
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,898
Sure,

341
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:42,400
I'll find someone from Seoul University.

342
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,195
Many of my clients are alumni.

343
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:51,743
Hallelujah, indeed. I'll be in touch Mrs. Oh!

344
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:54,453
Seoul University...

345
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,712
He's from Seoul Uni, right?

346
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:09,676
How come he has the brains
and is also a brilliant actor?

347
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:15,517
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

348
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:17,060
What is it?

349
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,061
Don't read.

350
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,565
I should have made you into a doctor.

351
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:26,653
If I had the support you've had,
I'd have gone to Seoul Uni twice!

352
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:30,156
Yeom Eun Sook was always
top student at Sookmyung High.

353
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:34,244
Your Grandma wanted to sell the house
to send me to university

354
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:36,830
but I'd seen the wrinkles
on her fair face.

355
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,790
I couldn't possibly let her do that.

356
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,792
I worked right after graduating,

357
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,586
as an accountant at Dongil Construction.

358
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:47,424
That's where I met Go Jin Cheol
and ruined my bloody life.

359
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:49,509
Anyways, with my first ever paycheck

360
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:53,346
I bought your grandma
new thermals and Vaseline hand cream.

361
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:55,223
She was so precious with the lotion.

362
00:29:55,223 --> 00:29:56,808
You've told me.

363
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:59,602
It took her three years to use the whole thing.

364
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:01,062
Young.

365
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:05,608
I don't expect such grand gestures from you.

366
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:09,571
Material things no longer matter to me.

367
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:12,824
I only wish you would
accompany me in my faith

368
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:15,827
and join me as one under the grace of God.

369
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,079
That would make my life worthwhile.

370
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,915
That's all I ask, amen...

371
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,544
Where did he go?

372
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,423
My lord...

373
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,426
So, Seoul University...

374
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:49,027
Are you free for dinner?

375
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,196
Yeah.

376
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:53,156
How about chicken soup?

377
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:57,160
- There's an old place nearby-
- Seriously?

378
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,580
Can't we go elsewhere on a day like this?

379
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,040
What day is it today?

380
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,833
It's Halloween.

381
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,376
So what?

382
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:08,087
Can't we have chicken soup on Halloween?

383
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:12,050
I don't want chicken soup.

384
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,886
Tonight, I'm choosing where we're having dinner.

385
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,999
Go on, try some.

386
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:48,670
I don't quite enjoy this type of food.

387
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,880
Then drink some more.

388
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,091
Beer makes me want to pee.

389
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:57,345
You're not having fun.

390
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,973
Do you frequent places like this?

391
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,891
What do you mean by places like this?

392
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:06,437
Crowded and noisy places.

393
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:10,358
Excuse me, could you please take a photo of us?

394
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,150
Of course.

395
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:20,493
- There you go.
- Thank you.

396
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,453
Would you two like a photo?

397
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:23,538
No thanks.

398
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:25,290
Don't worry, it's free.

399
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,541
I'll lend you this.

400
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,754
I'll take it now.

401
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:37,509
Thank you.

402
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:44,142
Everyone's celebrating blindly,

403
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:47,228
unaware that it stems
from a barbaric practice.

404
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:48,938
It stems from what?

405
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:50,607
Never mind.

406
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:53,150
It's a bit of an eyesore.

407
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:57,195
They're just having some fun.

408
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:06,539
You look good.

409
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,626
- You're very photogenic.
- Don't.

410
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:12,461
- Come on, take a look.
- I said no.

411
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:20,427
- My bad, I'm sorry.
- What's your deal?

412
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:22,930
I'm just not...

413
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,225
used to this kind of culture.

414
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:29,604
- And I think you're drunk.
- I'm not.

415
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:32,565
I don't get drunk on two beers.

416
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,192
Never mind.

417
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:36,360
I'll stop bothering you.

418
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:09,059
Young!

419
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:23,615
Are you feeling better?

420
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,953
I was never in a bad mood.

421
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,165
Maybe you were in a grump.

422
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,128
Emotions

423
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:37,672
are subjective.

424
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:39,340
Whatever.

425
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,344
Didn't you hear that Spinoza
listed 48 distinct human emotions?

426
00:34:43,344 --> 00:34:45,887
Were you daydreaming in class?

427
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,892
Right, Spinoza...

428
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:55,188
Why have you been taking
philosophy classes for so long?

429
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:06,951
I'm an editor

430
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:10,413
for a publisher that specializes
in philosophy books.

431
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:14,833
I left the company
and have been working freelance.

432
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,128
I see.

433
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,963
You're a "worker" in publishing.

434
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:26,179
The laws of the universe
have always intrigued me.

435
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:31,267
It's all fascinating,
why the world is the way it is.

436
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,977
Why I'm my pathetic old self.

437
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:39,232
How many stars there are
in this vast universe

438
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:43,320
and how insignificant my being is.

439
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:47,657
If I mull over these thoughts,

440
00:35:48,242 --> 00:35:50,577
I feel infinitely lonely.

441
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:11,808
What do you think you just ate?

442
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:13,600
Flounder?

443
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:16,979
Or rockfish?

444
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:20,233
I can't really tell fish apart.

445
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,735
I like whatever's expensive.

446
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:25,404
You're right and wrong.

447
00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:27,698
What you're eating is rockfish

448
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:31,619
but you're not just tasting rockfish.

449
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,580
On the tip of your tongue
is the taste of the universe.

450
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,085
Sounds like bullshi-

451
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:41,294
I mean nonsense.

452
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:46,509
This rockfish is like us, a part of the universe.

453
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:48,177
So when we eat,

454
00:36:48,177 --> 00:36:51,429
the universe is tasting the universe.

455
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,028
The more transparent one is flounder.

456
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:08,238
Rockfish is chewier.

457
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,699
Rockfish.

458
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:13,661
I'm pretty chewy.

459
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:17,414
You should call me rockfish from now on.

460
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:20,501
No.

461
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:23,211
I'll call you flounder.

462
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:27,632
I can see right through you.

463
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:45,275
My mom always carefully
removed fish bones for me.

464
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:06,838
I wasn't asking you
to do it for me. I'm sorry.

465
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,468
I like it.

466
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:15,056
I like saury, too.

467
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,182
Not the saury.

468
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:21,019
I like the universe that is you.

469
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:16,741
Are you awake?

470
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:21,455
Did you have a dream?

471
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:24,290
No, I just dozed off.

472
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:30,256
You were snoring.

473
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:32,090
I'm sorry.

474
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:35,428
It was cute.

475
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:37,596
How long has it been for you?

476
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,223
Why?

477
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:41,224
You were so good.

478
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:52,110
When did you know I was gay?

479
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:56,448
The moment I first laid eyes on you.

480
00:39:57,408 --> 00:40:01,996
Did you also know
we'd end up lying in the same bed?

481
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:04,289
From the beginning.

482
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,591
Is this a Christmas tree?

483
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,345
It's the tree of life.

484
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:20,222
What's that?

485
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:23,141
It's the legend I study.

486
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:30,815
It symbolizes the laws of the universe...

487
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:34,695
that we're all connected somehow.

488
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:37,948
Want to know more?
Shall I tell you?

489
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:39,783
No.

490
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:50,294
You said there was something you wanted to do.

491
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,879
Can I ask what that is?

492
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:58,510
I'll show you next time.

493
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:05,810
Being here with you in the dark...

494
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,853
Yes?

495
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:11,272
It feels like it's just us two in the universe.

496
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:16,569
Seriously...

497
00:41:18,197 --> 00:41:20,116
That night,

498
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:24,410
we lay still, holding each other tight and close.

499
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:34,546
It felt like my body existed to nestle in his.

500
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:38,300
In my arms,

501
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,469
he felt vast like an entire universe.

502
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:27,975
Why did you have to become a writer?

503
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:31,145
You little asshole,
I told you to become a doctor.

504
00:42:31,145 --> 00:42:35,691
Being a doctor's tough,
you have inspect people's assholes.

505
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:37,401
Do you want me to suffer?

506
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,235
What, you punk?

507
00:42:42,823 --> 00:42:44,617
Where are you off to?

508
00:42:44,617 --> 00:42:47,160
Your carer will be here, I'm off!

509
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:57,170
Heavenly father, forgive my sinful soul.

510
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:03,988
Are you okay?

511
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:06,031
Yeah, it's nothing.

512
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:07,950
No it's not, you're burnt.

513
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,617
Give me that.

514
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:14,080
It wasn't even hot.

515
00:44:21,755 --> 00:44:23,881
Can we eat first?

516
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:27,427
Fine.

517
00:44:49,616 --> 00:44:51,659
Whose song is this?

518
00:44:52,328 --> 00:44:54,079
Lee Eun Ha.

519
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,040
A famous singer from the late 80s.

520
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,753
All her songs were hits,

521
00:45:00,753 --> 00:45:02,879
except this one.

522
00:45:05,674 --> 00:45:09,428
I like hidden gems like these.

523
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:11,138
Discovering them

524
00:45:11,138 --> 00:45:16,559
is like seeing a Messier nebula,
shining brightly in the dark universe.

525
00:45:33,494 --> 00:45:37,081
I wish that time would stop.

526
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:42,336
This house feels dark and lonely
when I'm on my own

527
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:44,962
but when I'm with you...

528
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:49,675
It feels like an entire universe.
