[Love in the Big City]

00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,911
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,900
Go Young?

4
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,977
This is you, right?

5
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,772
Go Young.

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,543
Ah... yes...

7
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:14,073
I guess so.

8
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:16,993
Would you sign my copy here?

9
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,535
Not so formal, just write my name.

10
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,579
Sure…

11
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,059
So, what's the book about?

12
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,274
Oh... just the usual love story.

13
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,927
It's been a year since Gyu Ho left.

14
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,806
I finally quit my job
and became a full-time writer.

15
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,188
In the meantime, I published a book
that wrote an obvious love story.

16
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,195
I haven't really been in love for a year.

17
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:36,508
Hooray! Congratulations,
Go Young, on leaving your job!

18
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,566
It's a series of calm and gloomy days.

19
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,445
I want to cry but I have no tears.

20
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,596
Hey! Go Young!!

21
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,263
Oh! Open the door! Go Young! Seriously!

22
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,558
Hey!

23
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,509
Go Young!!

24
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,305
What if he's really dead?

25
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,329
What do you mean, he's going to die?

26
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,601
Shall we call 119?
Hang on, is it 119 or 112?

27
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,561
What do you mean 112! Oh my gosh.

28
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,192
Oh, Go Young!
Open the door! Go Young!!!

29
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
Hey! Go Young!

30
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,241
Oh! Hey! Go Young! What!!

31
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,036
See? I told you he wasn't dead.

32
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,330
Hey watch it… my wiener!

33
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,165
What's the matter with you guys?

34
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,209
We couldn't get in touch
with you for six days!

35
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,044
We were scared it was like last time,
when you took those sleeping pills…

36
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,255
Six days? Has it been that long...?

37
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,298
Yes!

38
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,634
We thought we'd find your dead body when
we opened that door. We were so scared.

39
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,221
I mean, it does smell like
decomposing bodies here.

40
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,514
T...true...

41
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,891
Look at the state of you…

42
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,935
Come on, let's get you washed up.

43
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,062
- Yeah! Get up!
- Uh, uh...!! Hey!!

44
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,871
Use body wash!

45
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:46,156
Look at the state of the house.

46
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:05,302
Oh! Wow! It's cool!
Wow! It's cool!!!

47
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,429
The food is going to get cold.
I'm going to eat it all. Then?

48
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,207
Eat up.

49
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:15,061
Why does yours look more delicious than mine?

50
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,630
It's good!

51
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,652
Chill out, will you? You're overreacting.

52
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,154
I quit my job after three years of non-stop work.

53
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,669
Can't I go silent for a single week?

54
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,535
I guess, yeah...

55
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,747
It's just... it's that time of year...

56
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,001
What time of year?

57
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,712
- Gyu... It's when he left for China… - Hey…

58
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,506
Come on, it's not my first heartbreak.

59
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,217
Besides, that was so long ago now.

60
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,636
It's been over a year.

61
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,387
You're right.

62
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,223
We've all had our fair share of heartbreaks.

63
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,641
But Young.

64
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,977
Have you not... heard from him since?

65
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,562
I haven't heard anything.

66
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,272
He deleted his messenger account, too.

67
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,274
Why would you ask him that?

68
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,985
Anyway, you have to know
that you break the mood.

69
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,834
I just... I'm worried...

70
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:09,823
And curious…

71
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,242
It's no big deal!

72
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,980
I'm sure he's doing just fine in China.

73
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,416
Come take a picture of me!

74
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,169
- Wait, me too!
- Me three!

75
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
Suddenly?

76
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,422
I'll snatch your heart.

77
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,594
You look like a sissy.

78
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,181
Can't you stand more... vanilla?

79
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,849
What, me?

80
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,143
Who else?

81
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,062
Eun Soo, how about me?
Do I look good?

82
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,274
You look hot, Young.

83
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,734
Then I'm going to take a picture?

84
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,527
One, two!

85
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,503
Good!

86
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,408
Hey, give it to me!
Give it to me! Give it to me!

87
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,951
I'm the only one who needs to
look good in the picture.

88
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,578
The three of us are taking it together,
but this isn't right.

89
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,385
Let go Let go.

90
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:00,999
Hello?

91
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,168
Don't do that. You really.

92
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,045
You look like Donkey.

93
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,509
Yes...

94
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,953
Pardon?

95
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,807
- Uh? Young.
- Young.

96
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,601
What? What's wrong?

97
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,768
Are you feeling dizzy?

98
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,604
I guess it's been a long time
since you got sunlight.

99
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,272
Hey, what's wrong with you?

100
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,484
What's going on again?
You must have had some troubles in your life!

101
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,987
- Hey, what is it?
- Are you alright?

102
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,574
Let me start by congratulating you
for being the first-ever Korean recipient

103
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,366
of the Dublin Literary Award!

104
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,910
Many readers were moved

105
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,288
by the vivid descriptions
and characters in your book,

106
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,874
some say that the writer
actually experienced it.

107
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,711
some even claiming the story
might be autobiographical.

108
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,839
What are your thoughts on this?

109
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,175
All novels are ultimately works of fiction.

110
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,400
I guess I wrote a story
that was so realistic that-

111
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,561
I'll take it as... a compliment.

112
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,813
Yes, next.

113
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,899
Yes. Reporter Jung?

114
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,693
I'm reporter Jung Joon Young
of the Daesan Ilbo.

115
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,904
The Dublin Literary Award is
also known for its substantial monetary prize,

116
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,865
second only to the Nobel Prize in Literature.

117
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,913
Have you thought about
how you'll be using it?

118
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,454
Not yet.

119
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,376
Yes. Next.

120
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,586
Yes. This is Kim In Ae from VIXX News.

121
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,663
Please tell us about your plans
for your next novel..

122
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,194
My son.

123
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,391
Why are you here?

124
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,767
What do you mean why? Son,

125
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,144
I'm here to congratulate you.

126
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,689
I should have brought you
some flowers or something.

127
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,691
I'm sorry I'm empty-handed.

128
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,172
Hey! Go over there!
Go over there!

129
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,007
Stand like this!

130
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,535
Okay, one, two, three.

131
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,162
Wow, it came out well.

132
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,582
These days, bookstores aren't
from the old ones, right?

133
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,253
Thanks to the novelist's son,
I have a good view.

134
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,923
Ah, so...

135
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,549
Me, your father?

136
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,926
A bed for the Swedish royal family.

137
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,470
I have obtained an import distributor.

138
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,514
With just one finger flick!

139
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,886
It's a situation where money comes rolling in.

140
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,516
So?

141
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,179
Did you lease the apartment?

142
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,657
I paid off all the loans with
the rent of Jamsil apartment,

143
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,744
But the economy is in bad shape,
so the shop is also negative.

144
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,914
I'm on the verge of being overwhelmed
because I couldn't pay inheritance tax.

145
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,666
I live in a studio apartment
in front of the school.

146
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,045
What do you think of this father as?

147
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,131
You feel like you're doing something, don't you?

148
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,039
This can all disappear in an instant.

149
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,014
Why didn't you come to mom's funeral?

150
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,166
Hey, give me your address.

151
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,044
What's up with the address!

152
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,381
I can't do anything else
because I'm bad as a father,

153
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,300
and I'm going to send you
a mattress used by royalty.

154
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,510
So go ahead and give me an address!

155
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,566
After my mother's death,

156
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,474
my father only asked about the apartment.

157
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,493
In the face of a tough life and a long time,

158
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,568
love is powerless.

159
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,973
A relationship in which love
has disappeared is so shabby.

160

[Author Go Young, Achieving the Dublin Literary Award]
[Where did you do your make up?]

161
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,614
[Author, let's open a bottle of champagne at Itaewon.]

162
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:27,426
[Is he meeting a guy? He's not reading the messages.
-He just read. - Hey there?]

163
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,096
Express delivery!

164
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,667
Go Jin Chul was always like this.

165
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,752
He gave me some unwanted pocket money

166
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,103
and pretended to be a responsible father.

167
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,883
Whenever that happened,
I wanted to spend the allowance

168
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,499
on the worst possible place.

169
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,524
[Right now?]

170
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,712
Do you need to wash?

171
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,402
Already have.

172
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,314
Not there!

173
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,524
Sorry?

174
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:10,976
Not there... but over there…

175
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,908
That's... cool. It's like it's alive.

176
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,749
Supplied to Swedish Royalty…

177
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,920
That's... sudden…

178
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,527
Phytoncide...!

179
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,220
I told you not to wear them like that!

180
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,514
Your feet are so small.

181
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,349
Then wear your own!

182
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,018
Why are you always wearing my shoes?

183
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,770
- Your feet smell really bad..
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

184
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,146
Well... Why..

185
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,773
Why? Uh... Ah... Ugh...!

186
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,358
Hahaha!

187
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,904
Oh, my… It's cold! Ha..

188
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,155
Hey!

189
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,576
Oh, I'm hungry.
Let's hurry up and eat.

190
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,120
Let's eat.

191
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,123
Feels like we're millionaires.

192
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,750
Right?

193
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,962
Your company's nice, they're very
generous with the holiday bonuses.

194
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,715
Nice? Not so nice.
They pay me peanuts.

195
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,176
Still. I only got toothpaste from my work.

196
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,388
True. Why do they insist on giving you
four tubes of toothpaste every holiday?

197
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,974
How many teeth do they think you have?

198
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:22,101
They'd be better off giving you Spam.

199
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,853
Augh..

200
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,730
Ah..!

201
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,106
Ah!!!

202
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,692
I knew that would happen.

203
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,361
We'll never get the smell out…

204
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,281
Ah… what the..

205
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,449
Oh, I'm going crazy. Come on.

206
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,472
Oh, I'm sorry…

207
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,622
- Oh, I washed this yesterday!
- I didn't do it on purpose..

208
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,332
Oh, my…!

209
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,064
Aaugh..

210
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,285
Oh, my. What a waste...

211
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,425
I... I'll... I'll wash it..

212
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,594
The machine does the washing, not you.

213
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,429
Young, are you busy?

214
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,514
- Have you checked the group chat?
- Not yet, why?

215
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,919
Eun Soo's boyfriend Jun Bae,
he really fucked up this time.

216
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,561
Eun Soo's flying off the handle!

217
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,149
- Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!!!
- Let go! Hey!

218
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,451
That fucker.

219
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,328
Now we're definitely over.

220
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,623
I'd rather date a woman
than a selfish prick like him.

221
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,611
I'm sure he didn't mean to piss you off.

222
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,007
Would anyone in their right mind,
drag someone around all day

223
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,389
after working an overnight flight?

224
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,055
He always does whatever the fuck he likes!

225
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,100
I always let him...

226
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,534
Everything is going to shit.

227
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,562
Let's go up quickly.

228
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,395
Give me the luggage.

229
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:52,858
I fucking love peanuts.

230
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:57,780
Why did I give up peanuts
to be with an asshole like him?

231
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,211
I don't care if he dies from an allergic reaction!

232
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,586
No, it's all over now.

233
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,839
He thinks he's so agreeable.

234
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,967
Actually, it's me who's always obliging.

235
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,679
What he always wants to do,

236
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,513
what he wants, what he wants.

237
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,100
You know what you need? A hotel staycation.

238
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,603
I have tons of discount coupons so it's all on me.

239
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,481
The Three-second-man!

240
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,317
Do you know how small his dick is?
You need a microscope to find it!

241
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,862
You couldn't even imagine the
pigmentation, freckles, and wrinkles

242
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,823
that he hides under
that thick layer of foundation.

243
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,992
It's embarrassing to be seen in public with him.

244
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,828
- You know that, right?
- I know, I know.

245
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,997
I was with him out of loyalty!

246
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,707
Emotions? No way.

247
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,168
Not even as much as a peanut.

248
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,726
I was biding my time
to break up with him anyway!

249
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:56,965
Rat shit tiny dick!

250
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,774
Goodbye--

251
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,659
Eun Soo! Let's get married!

252
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:14,227
I'll make you happy.

253
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:16,529
Let's spend our lives together!

254
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,882
B...babe...?

255
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:30,247
Silver bead, it's already been 1,871…17
days since you rolled into my arms.

256
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,875
I was in heaven for the time
I spent with you.

257
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,835
What is this?

258
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,296
They fought so Jun Bae called us in for backup.

259
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,048
You seemed busy so we didn't
have any time to explain.

260
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,793
With silver bead, I'm in a cozy cloud.

261
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,677
You may refuse.

262
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,679
I respect your choice.

263
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,934
But I'm gonna slowly wither
and disappear from this world.

264
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,602
My silver bead, Eun Soo.

265
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,312
I'll die without you.

266
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,482
So will you marry me?

267
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,320
Say yes!

268
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,656
- Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!
- Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

269
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,745
Eun Soo and Jun Bae were
in a relationship for five years.

270
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,165
This is a happy ending
for a long-term relationship.

271
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,043
Now that you've been promised
the love you've wanted forever.

272
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,670
Why doesn't Eun Soo laugh.

273
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:25,470
- Say yes! Say yes!
- Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

274
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,882
Ti--Ti--ffa--ny!

275
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,225
How much is that.

276
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,709
Hey... Take a picture!

277
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,446
Nice!! Yeah!

278
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,577
Yes!!!

279
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,288
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss..

280
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,164
Peanut...!

281
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:58,335
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

282
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,676
Wow! Wow! Congratulations!!!

283
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,803
Are you... okay?

284
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,639
- I... think I need to go to the ER.
- I think you're allergic, too

285
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,642
I'll come with you.

286
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:15,573
No... I think we should stay apart today.

287
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,494
Eun Soo! Enjoy tonight for the both of us!

288
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,237
Let's meet tomorrow--

289
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,691
I love you!

290
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,475
Did I just become a bride-to-be?

291
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,806
All this cardio is making me sober.

292
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,058
Refill, please.

293
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,062
No, go do it yourself.

294
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,312
Drinks are on the bride-to-be!

295
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,565
Bride-to-be!

296
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,165
Young. Haven't seen you in a while!

297
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,751
Right, hi. Could I get four Gin and Tonics?

298
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,296
How have you been?

299
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,590
Alright, I suppose.

300
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,368
I read about you getting that award!

301
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,894
Congratulations!

302
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:30,551
Thank you.

303
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,933
Oh, my…Oh...! You crazy!

304
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,158
And this is from Gyu Ho.

305
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:46,401
Sorry?

306
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,445
He asked me to before he left to Shanghai.

307
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,697
Every time you show up,
I'm to give you a glass of this.

308
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,158
On his tab.

309
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,284
You're in touch with Gyu Ho?

310
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,079
Well, sometimes?

311
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,445
He says he's coming back to Korea soon.

312
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,420
Gyu Ho's coming back? To Seoul?

313
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,965
Yeah, he says he has
some work to sort out.

314
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,758
Anyways, thanks for this.

315
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,221
Okay. Have fun.

316
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,900
I can't believe I'm getting hitched!
I bloody love you guys!

317
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,443
Me too!

318
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,862
Who wants my bouquet?

319
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,657
Uh? Me!! Me!!!

320
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,200
Hey! My hat!

321
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,246
Oh! My ring!

322
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:40,733
Determined to break up, Eun Soo was proposed to instead.

323
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:43,792
I thought I would be with Gyu Ho forever,

324
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,712
but now I can't even ask
how each other is doing.

325
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:52,427
Many lovers will love and say goodbye
tonight in the big city of Seoul.

326
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,596
Me?

327
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,689
Okay! It's my last night.

328
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,236
Young, checkout is in an hour.

329
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,902
Let's clean up.

330
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,081
Where is everyone?

331
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,027
They made a run for it, cheeky bastards.

332
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,957
Those bitches...

333
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,804
What about Jun Bae?

334
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,038
He's got work okay.

335
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,007
It's a shame you had to spend
your proposal night apart…

336
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,363
It's alright.

337
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,616
We were together for five years,

338
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,909
and probably will be forever now.

339
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,244
That's true.

340
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,624
And you'll see each other tonight.

341
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,035
Yes.

342
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,489
Eun Soo?

343
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,797
Yeah?

344
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,304
How did it feel?

345
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,535
You were there, how did I look?

346
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,124
I'm so happy!

347
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,161
You?

348
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,565
Fucking ecstatic.

349
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,957
A mattress sold under the
enchanting slogan 'Sleep in the Forest',

350
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,636
has shocked the nation following
a revelation of its use of carcinogenic materials.

351
00:29:57,636 --> 00:30:00,423
An investigation by the Korean Research
Institute of Standards and Science uncovered

352
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:06,596
that company's mattresses exceeded the legal
limit for carcinogens by an alarming 200 times.

353
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,306
The company's CEO, Mr. Go, has mysteriously vanished,

354
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,017
prompting authorities to launch
a thorough investigation...

355
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:16,648
About 30 complaints were filed from
the end of last month to this morning.

356
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,277
The amount of damage totaled 560 million won.

357
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,489
Currently, the company run by Mr. Go is closed,

358
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,619
and about 200 victims are have opened
a social network service chat room

359
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,580
and are discussing additional countermeasures.

360
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,415
Phytoncide my ass..

361
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,775
After investigating the complainant,

362
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:39,039
the police plan to find out where Go is
and the details of the incident..

363
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:50,000
Elder Park from church once said
that my mom had a lot of love.

364
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,956
My father had a little too much love.

365
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:00,856
It seems that I have also inherited
my parents' tendencies to love.

366
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,908
Why is it that despite having so much love,

367
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:06,997
none of us ever knew quite where to direct it?

368
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,988
Kylie Wilde…

369
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:43,825
I know it's a ridiculous delusion
to think of Gyu Ho.

370
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:50,811
But sometimes I want to blindly
believe in something ridiculous.

371
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:14,862
Gyu Ho had smaller feet compared to me.

372
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,501
The owner of the shoe is not Gyu Ho.

373
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,959
Thank you for the warm welcome.

374
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,075
Oops, I'm sorry.

375
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,994
Extraordinary, huh?

376
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:12,379
That's because I'm the best bartender in Korea.

377
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,313
Koo-e-tan-hay-ra.

378
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,508
What?

379
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,663
Koo-e-tan-hay-ra.

380
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,535
Koo-e-tan-hay-ra.

381
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,629
Koo-e-tan-hay-ra.

382
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,789
Condemn! Condemn!
Condemn instead of silence!

383
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,395
Do you mean 'Condemn?'

384
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,431
Yes, I think so.

385
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:06,803
People have been shouting
that outside the hotel.

386
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,512
Does it mean something funny?

387
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,684
Uh…

388
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,697
It's means 'you're fucking evil'.

389
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,992
Name?

390
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,712
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

391
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,661
William.

392
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,551
William, Habibi.

393
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,541
What does it mean?

394
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,113
It means love in Arabic.

395
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,883
And what's your name?

396
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,403
Go Young.

397
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,171
Go Young.

398
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,890
What does it mean?

399
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,768
Shine high and bright.

400
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,937
Like a star?

401
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,271
No.

402
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,358
Like a bomb. A nuclear weapon.

403
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,787
You can do it diagonally like this,

404
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,581
We're not going to do a separate ceremony.

405
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,764
Just a party at Ho Min's cafe.

406
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:24,839
That's a good idea.
Unpretentious, I like it.

407
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,923
Eun Soo.

408
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,592
If you tie them too tight,
the stems will snap.

409
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,354
Ah, got it!

410
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,812
We'll choose everything ourselves,
make it cozy and sweet.

411
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,853
And we'll have people perform.

412
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,981
- Want me to sing for you?
- That's quite alright.

413
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,541
We want to throw away everything
that's wilted and misshapen.

414
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:47,611
All that should be left is
the fresh and beautiful.

415
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,157
And when you're bringing them together,

416
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:55,998
these flowers that have all withstood
their own time and histories,

417
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:59,874
I want you to imagine how two people are
coming together to form a harmonious union.

418
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,458
You're really good.

419
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:06,340
Imagine your futures, exquisite and fresh,
just like these fragrant flowers.

420
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,171
Eun Soo!

421
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:24,599
It's okay, we have plenty of flowers!

422
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,614
The thing is,

423
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:31,966
I can't imagine an exquisite future...

424
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:36,243
I can only smell the fragrance of shit.

425
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,412
Eun Soo…

426
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,019
Young…

427
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:44,011
I've got the fucking marriage blues.

428
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,884
Eun Soo and I and everyone
in this big city were

429
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,634
being swept away by something unknown.

430
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:58,693
past, future, things I want to believe it's love.

431
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,269
If I were to be swept away,

432
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,149
I wanted to end up somewhere that was exotic and stimulating,

433
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,651
rather than familiar and boring.

434
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:10,356
[Q: Right now?]

435
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,853
Q!!!

436
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,801
Habibi!

437
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,575
Habibi!

438
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,317
It's a present.

439
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,845
It's been over a decade

440
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:27,909
since I ran anywhere other than a treadmill.

441
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,737
Extraordinary, isn't it?

442
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:39,090
That's because...

443
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,767
I'm Korea's best florist.

444
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,411
What does it say?

445
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,196
Fuck me deep.

446
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,319
Nuclear weapon.

447
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:30,387
Would you like to come with me to Bangkok?
