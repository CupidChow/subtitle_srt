00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,733
Are you asleep?

3
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,601
Yes, I'm asleep.

4
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,730
Let's go again.

5
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,049
Didn't you say you had an early start today?

6
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,659
Get washed up and go.

7
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,153
Come on, let's go again.

8
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:48,088
Just let me sleep.

9
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:52,073
I need to edit and upload a vlog and stream later tonight.

10
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:54,598
My fans are waiting.

11
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:56,216
Fine, I'm going.

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,218
You'd think I forced myself on you.

13
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,511
Hey, don't be like that.

14
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,272
Fine, let's do it.

15
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,891
- Shall we do it on the sofa?
- Shall we?

16
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,913
Babe, are you asleep?
I got special leave!

17
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:16,150
I danced to a Miss A song
at our battalion social and won.

18
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,551
I ran here to surprise you...

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,927
I'd better leave.

20
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,645
Enjoy yourself.

21
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,894
- You said you were broken up.
- It's a process.

22
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:37,688
What if he deserts because of me?

23
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,356
Are you for real?

24
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:41,567
I'm going to end it, I am.

25
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,862
It's tough to reach someone
who's in the military.

26
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:48,740
Ever heard of a phone?
You could have easily reached him.

27
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,076
- Please sit down.
- Let go of me!

28
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:53,312
I'm late thanks to your excuses.

29
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,622
Are you really going to leave like this?

30
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,776
You're far too emotional,
you should learn to be calmer.

31
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:01,295
Just go and upload your stupid vlogs.

32
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:04,339
I'll leave a comment
about how you're a cheat.

Publicly posting factual information
that damages someone's reputation

35
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,363
can lead to consequences.

Reputation, my ass.

37
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,635
I will sue you.

38
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:21,120
I'm sorry to burst your bubble but you have no grounds to sue.

39
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,894
Nonetheless, I truly loved you
during the week we shared!

40
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,471
Yes, I'm on my way now.

41
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,540
Yeah. I'll be there soon, sorry!

45
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,698
Why are you so late?

46
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,376
You could have at least washed your hair.

47
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,911
I really meant to get here on time...

48
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:02,480
Quick, let's get you dressed.

49
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,121
Mr. Nam, this here is today's model.

50
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,165
Say hi.

51
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,358
I'm sorry for being late.

52
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,310
How can a rookie model

53
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,103
be late to a photoshoot?

54
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,688
He's not technically a model,

55
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:21,024
he's my brother's friend who's helping out.

56
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,776
It seems the traffic was bad.

57
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,945
Whatever the reason may be,

58
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:28,280
being late is absolutely unacceptable.

59
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:30,950
Time is gold.

60
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,122
- I apologize.
- Let's get you in makeup.

61
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:53,473
- Hello?
- You didn't even wash your hair?

62
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,725
My sis had a go at me.

63
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,894
I didn't have a choice.

64
00:04:57,894 --> 00:04:59,854
My morning was a total shitshow.

65
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:01,314
What happened now?

66
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,942
Don't get me started. The pay's good, right?

67
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,111
I already put in a word to my sister.

68
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:09,281
It's an important shoot so be good.

69
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:13,201
I think the photographer's
a bit of a pervert, though.

70
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,578
- He talks strange, too.
- Just get to work!

71
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,167
Jeez...

72
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,095
Splendid.

73
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:37,183
Now can you try looking down?

74
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,351
That's splendid.

75
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,980
Can you gaze far out,
out of the window, maybe?

76
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,024
Spectacular.

77
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:45,817
Now look into the camera,

78
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:51,114
as if you're looking
deep into the eyes of a lover.

79
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:52,906
Truly splendid.

80
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,914
Can you tie a tie?

81
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:01,665
No.

82
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,882
I'll retie it for you.

83
00:06:19,517 --> 00:06:20,769
Is it uncomfortable?

84
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,187
Yes, a little.

85
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:24,397
Just power through.

86
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,190
Sorry?

87
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,068
One, two...

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,865
Can you turn your body
to face the camera?

89
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,243
- Like this?
- Splendid.

90
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,497
That's splendid.

91
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:48,212
Turn your face to the right slightly.

92
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:51,633
A centimeter more.

93
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:54,094
Actually, half a centimeter back to the left?

94
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,180
Lift your chin up a smidge.

95
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,014
A smaller smidge?

96
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,897
Sorry, you're making me laugh.

97
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:07,899
Your smile was splendid.

98
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,275
A big smile this time.

99
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,128
The pants and shirt are a gift,

100
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,047
and the cardigan is a bonus
for your hard work.

101
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,591
Wow, thanks.

102
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,427
Just one thing...

103
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:37,637
Could I have the shoes, too?

104
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:39,180
They're just my size.

105
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,682
The shoes, too?

106
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,018
Okay, wait here.

107
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,983
Was it...

108
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,734
your first time modeling?

109
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:53,194
Yes.

110
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:55,363
Were the photos bad?

111
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,574
Not at all.

112
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:02,495
Although you caused some problems
before the actual shoot,

113
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,122
the results were quite splendid.

114
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,169
Good job today.

115
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:12,838

[Itaewon]

123
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,056
This big city is ruthless.

124
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,767
Countless men gather
at this club every weekend

125
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:09,604
but hoping to meet someone good
to have a loving relationship with

126
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:11,689
is a facade.

127
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:15,235
That stuff only happens in the movies.

128
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,655
Becoming an adult changed nothing.

129
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:21,241
All I can do in this ruthless world

130
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,535
is getting hammered like there's no tomorrow,

131
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:27,496
and rating the guys here
while I waste away my youth.

132

Jeon Eun Soo.

135
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,801
He majored in dance but is a nomad at heart,

136
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,679
preparing to become a flight attendant.

137
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,305
Eun Soo has an eagle eye.

138
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:47,600
Give him five seconds
and he scans all men in the vicinity.

139

He's known as a gym rat among gays

Han Ho Min.

146
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,538
He quit cosmetology school
after three months

147
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,874
because it was too hard on his hands.

148
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:13,334
He currently manages a cafe in Hongdae.

149
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:17,254
When it comes to love,
he's very devoted and pure of heart.

- I don't get your flavor.
- You're playing coy, aren't you?

I know you like horsefaces.

00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:36,941
There's a sea of men,
and yet our flavors overlap?

00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:29,803
This sort of place?

184
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:34,142
I didn't think you were like me,

185
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,602
I'm a little embarrassed.

186
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,312
Embarrassed?

187
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:40,605
Don't be embarrassed!

188
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,526
Are you quite drunk?

189
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:50,838
I... I must be.

190
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,798
I'm too drunk to get home.

191
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,373
Young, that's not good.

192
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,377
Mr. Kim.

193
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:03,629
You remembered my name?

194
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,882
Of course.

195
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:09,260
You were a splendid model.

196
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,180
I'm touched, Mr. Kim.

197
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,182
I'm...

198
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:17,018
My name isn't Mr. Kim,

199
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:18,810
it's Kim Nam-

200
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,132
Mr. Kim, wait here.

201
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:55,055
Just eat him, why don't you?

202
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,725
Choi Mi Ae.

203
00:13:57,725 --> 00:13:58,976
Why are you here?

204
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,020
Why shouldn't I be?

205
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,231
That guy, he's...

206
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:04,732
He's my older cousin...

207
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:08,194
Oh, really? Are we all
kissing our cousins now?

208
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:11,280
So you clearly saw that...

209
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,157
Why don't you come to class?

210
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:15,284
I thought you were dead.

211
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:16,661
Not dead.

212
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:19,120
I've been fine...

213
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,791
Mi Ae,

214
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,253
can you please not tell anyone at school?

215
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,337
Sure.

216
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,714
I might be broke but I sure am loyal,

217
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:30,675
your secret's safe with me.

218
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,093
Don't worry and take care.

219
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,094
And don't skip class.

220
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:50,444
For this exam, please refer
to the classic "Madame Bovary,"

221
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:54,115
to write an essay
on the meaning of love and longing.

222
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:59,704
[Love is... Fucked]

223
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,706
What an antiquated essay topic.

224
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:12,966
I hope she won't tell people.

225
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:21,016
She doesn't appear studious...

226
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,607
I don't have one.

227
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,901
Hey, Go Young!

228
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:31,527
Got a light?

229
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:33,821
Light. A lighter?

230
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:35,739
I don't smoke.

231
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,284
You're a shit liar.

232
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,661
I rarely smoke.

233
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,456
Got it, I'll keep this secret too.

234
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,249
I told you I'm loyal.

235
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,042
Go home, kid.

236
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,004
What's with her?

237
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,796
Young.

238
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,717
Don't you know who she is?

239
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:58,094
She's famous in our department.

240
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:01,307
Famous for what?

241
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's talk over lunch.

242
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:09,732
She's the department slut.

243
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,734
A whore.

244
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,486
Everyone knows.

245
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,071
It's not very implicit.

246
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:16,697
She dresses like one.

247
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:19,825
She came onto me at term start.

248
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,661
So, did you do it?

249
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,162
- Are you mad?
- Idiot.

250
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:28,292
She must have no standards
if she came onto you.

251
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,127
- Want a smack?
- Jeez, I'm scared.

252
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,880
I swear, I'll kill you.

253
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,841
She was hitting on you, right?

254
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,218
Not at all.

255
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,387
Come on, don't deny it.

256
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,848
I saw her touching your shoulder.

257
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:46,852
This is why I hate tall and handsome dudes.

258
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,438
I'm so jealous of your height.

259
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:53,609
When did you first do it with a girl?

260
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:56,445
Can we just eat?

261
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:58,613
Why all the chit chat?

262
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:03,160
Why are you getting riled up?

263
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,412
He thinks he's all that.

264
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:10,792
You're not interested in her, are you?

265
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,295
His face is giving it away.

266
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:16,256
She's not worth your time, seriously.

267
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:20,553
I really didn't want to say this

268
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:23,556
but when term started
she was dying to get in my pants.

269
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:26,100
So I let her just once, and damn,

270
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,018
she's a fucking pro-

271
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:32,481
For fuck's sake.

272
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,691
I've lost my appetite.

273
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:43,242
Hey!

274
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,827
What's his fucking problem?

275
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:50,791
After that day, I become a certified loner

276
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,667
just like Mi Ae.

277
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:08,745
[Unknown: Hello. Did you get home safely that night?]

278
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,135
[Go Young: I'm sorry, who is this?]

279
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,847
[Unknown: I'm Kim Nam Kyu.]

280
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,987
[Mr. Kim?]

281
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:27,383
[If you have some time, could we perhaps meet?]

282
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:58,192
Guess what? He's a total catch!

283
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,444
He's a cutie.

284
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:02,446
Mr. Kim.

285
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:05,491
I'm sorry about that night.

286
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,451
It's alright.

287
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:11,705
Honestly, it was good to see you again.

288
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:15,459
Although I was a little shocked
when you dragged me outside.

289
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:19,504
I'm so sorry, I was totally wasted.

290
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:23,259
By the way,

291
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,428
did you sort things out
with that friend of yours?

292
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:29,682
- Friend?
- Your female friend.

293
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:33,310
She's not really a friend,
just a university classmate.

294
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,437
There was nothing to sort out.

295
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:36,647
Everything's fine.

296
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:41,694
I thought you two were having
a serious conversation.

297
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:44,071
I didn't mean to just leave you.

298
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:45,114
I apologize.

299
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:49,701
Not at all, I should apologize
for the sudden kiss.

300
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,831
If I'm honest...

301
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,251
I quite liked it.

302
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,213
Sorry?

303
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,798
It was

304
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:04,799
rather splendid.

305
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:11,055
Was it bad for you?

306
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:17,438
No.

307
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:19,355
I liked it too.

308
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,929
Mr. Kim, would you mind
if I changed the music?

309
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:54,098
It would be wrong to cut off such a classic.

310
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,854
I guess you really like this song.

311
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:01,189
It's quite a splendid song.

312
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:07,071
You're a very conservative driver.

313
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:11,533
Our current speed is the legal maximum for this road.

314
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:15,453
50 kilometers per hour.
Any faster would be dangerous.

315
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:19,863
Are you from Chungcheong, by any chance?

316
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:25,868
It is wrong to hold prejudices about certain regions.

317
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:28,634
I didn't mean it that way,

318
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,344
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,513
But really, where are you from?

320
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:34,430
Chungcheong.

321
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:50,239
Mr. Kim.

322
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:54,034
Where are you taking me in this cold?

323
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,036
Somewhere I like.

324
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,954
Please follow me.

325
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:05,628
Whoa...

326
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:22,771
I always dreamed of becoming a bird photographer

327
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:26,400
who traveled to the seaside
and hiked up mountains.

328
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,610
Ever since I was young,

329
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,904
I've always looked up at the birds in the sky.

330
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,035
Did you not have many friends?

331
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,707
I'm just kidding.

332
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:44,960
You're right, I don't have friends.

333
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,588
When I saw you at the club,

334
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,465
I was jealous.

335
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:52,468
You and your friends were having so much fun.

336
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:56,054
Let's not talk about that embarrassing night.

337
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,140
Young.

338
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,852
You have such a pure soul.

339
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:09,025
It's something you get to see
when you take photographs.

340
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,112
I can read what's on the inside.

341
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:22,289
Why can't I read you?

342
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,417
"If your pictures aren't good enough,"

343
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:29,296
"you're not close enough."

344
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:31,215
Robert Capa.

345
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:32,883
Sorry?

346
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,053
He's a famous photographer.

347
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:40,557
For portraits, you're meant
to get close to your subject.

348
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:42,309
More importantly,

349
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:44,977
you should look into their eyes.

350
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:47,939
Their eyes?

351
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:16,468
Like a car cruising under the speed limit,

352
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:19,179
his love was earnest.

353
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,309
Being with him gave me butterflies,
both from thrill and anxiety.

354
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,644
We were so transparent.

355
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:46,747
Hey!

356
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,709
Hey, Lippy!

357
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:57,217
No one's here, is class cancelled?

358
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:58,886
I'm not sure.

359
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:01,012
Ask someone.

360
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,184
[Go Young: Hey, Why's there no one in the lecture hall?]

361
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:08,246
[Course Rep: Class was cancelled, check the group chat.]

362
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:14,224
Apparently class was cancelled
in the course group chat.

363
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:17,017
Did you know there was a group chat?

364
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:22,784
They must have one without us, those fuckers.

365
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:24,786
I get why I wouldn't be invited

366
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:26,914
but why you?

367
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:29,708
Really need to ask?

368
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,002
Probably not.

369
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:35,214
If it's cancelled, let's get out of here.

370
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,006
Go.

371
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,015
Sit down.

372
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:51,813
I guess college has outcasts, too.

373
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:54,691
You didn't tell people about me, did you?

374
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:56,901
Who would I tell?

375
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,741
Is your flavor tall guys like you?

376
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,409
Flavor?

377
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,828
How do you know our slang?

378
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,997
I've spent my share of time in Itaewon,

379
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,874
I inevitably have gay friends.

380
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,501
That makes sense.

381
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,669
But why do you ask?

382
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:16,797
The guy you were smooching
was pretty tall.

383
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:20,509
I'm not that picky,
he doesn't have to be huge.

384
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,136
Not in height anyway...

385
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:25,013
And you, what's your type?

386
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:26,848
My type...

387
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:28,850
is male.

388
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,811
All men make me curious.

389
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:33,313
You must have standards, though.

390
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:38,819
If I have to specify,
I guess what matters most is...

391
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,862
- Size.
- Ditto.

392
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:44,074
Size is the most important.

393
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:46,075
Bring it here.

394
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:49,705
Do you want to go clubbing this weekend?

395
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:51,373
Clubbing? Together?

396
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:54,084
Yeah, why not?

397
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:59,298
I want to, but I'm trying
to discipline myself these days.

398
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:01,340
Discipline...

399
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,553
Do you think that will work?

400
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:26,490
Should we write a wish
for our eternal love?

401
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:28,785
No, let's just lock it.

402
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:31,538
But I want to love you forever.

403
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:33,372
Don't you?

404
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:36,584
Alright, do it.

Hurry up.

409
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,543
The pork katsu was good.

410
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:20,003
Wasn't it splendid?

411
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:23,590
Yes, very splendid indeed.

412
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,719
The cable car was fun too,
but it was a little short.

to help with our date plans?

[Top date ideas in Seoul]

418
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:53,619
You should be a tour guide,
not a photographer.

419
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,295
Surprise.

420
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,261
- What is this?
- I bought it on the way here.

421
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,512
Our first promise rings.

It's a perfect fit.

424
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:21,732
It's 24 karat white gold.

425
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:24,066
I wanted it to be special.

426
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,446
This must have been expensive.

00:29:29,322 --> 00:29:31,950
You're still a student.

You can buy me a nicer one
after you get a job.

- What is that?
- A white gold promise ring?

- 24 karat? Looks expensive.
- Give me a closer look.

00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:56,308
It's a nice design.

433
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:59,978
When's the wedding?
It could be an engagement ring.

434
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:02,272
Wouldn't that make me your cupid?

435
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:04,149
Thank me with a designer purse.

00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,037
You absolute drama queen.

441
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:18,789
I'm not too sure, myself.

442
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:21,750
Doesn't eternal love sound daunting?

Let's have a drink.

452
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,687
Cheers.

453

- That hit the spot.
- I'm so jealous.

454

- My head's shaped so ugly.

and surrounded by all these men,

462
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:34,364
I felt my pent-up frustration melt away.

463
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:38,409
It was like returning home.

464
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:24,205
You're not drunk, are you?

465
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:27,250
No, I'm totally sober.

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,337
Who was that guy
you were clinging to earlier?

467
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:33,048
He approached me
when I was dancing alone.

468
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:36,843
I vaguely recognized him
and turns out he's insta-famous.

469
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,053
What about you?

470
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:40,096
Are you moving in with Mr. DJ?

471
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:41,806
Shocking, isn't it?

472
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:46,519
Who knew there'd be a hetero here?
And the DJ no less.

473
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,647
You know what? This won't do.

474
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:50,398
Let's go to my place.

475
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,066
Your place?

476
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:56,404
I don't have a change of clothes.

477
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:59,074
I need to shave and do my hair.

478
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:01,534
My skin's sensitive
so I can't use any old cream.

479
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:03,495
Shut it and let's go.

480
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,830
- Taxi's on me.
- On you?

481
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,040
Oh yeah, deal!

482
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,707
Taxi!

483

My cozy bedroom

484
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,137
comes with a bathroom
and that's about it!

485
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:26,183
Have a look around.

486
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:29,688
You have so much stuff.

487
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:33,233
Isn't my place clean and quaint?

488
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:37,945
You're my very first guest
so you should feel honored.

489
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:45,829
You rascal!

490
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:48,747
How dare you sit on the master's bed!

491
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:53,961
I'm kidding, just sit.

492
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:59,884
I met this guy last summer,

493
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:02,345
he worked at a hiking gear company.

494
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,681
I'd rate his kissing 80, sex 70.

495
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:09,060
I ended things because he took me
hiking every weekend.

496
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,103
He looks slimy.

497
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:13,064
He begged me to meet him
so we slept once

498
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:15,358
but he was a massive two-timer.

499
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:17,694
His partner was in the military.

500
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:19,154
A total douche.

501
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:21,321
An undeniable douche.

502
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,034
This one's a real prick.

503
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:27,203
He tried to take a photo up my skirt
so I smashed his phone.

504
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,496
What a prick!

505
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:31,082
Hey, do you know Cheol Woo from our course?

506
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,209
He recently asked me to sleep with him.

507
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:34,419
He did?

508
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:38,673
Do you know he told everyone
that he slept with you?

509
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:42,510
Yeah, I know he was bullshitting
behind my back.

510
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,637
From the way he thinks
to the way he talks,

511
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:47,222
he excels at being a prick.

512
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:56,399
Who is it? Why did you skip over him?

513
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,485
- He looks the nicest.
- It's nothing.

514
00:34:58,485 --> 00:34:59,861
Who is it? Show me.

515
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:00,904
Do you fancy him?

516
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:03,365
- Do you love him?
- Get your feet away.

517
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:06,034
They're clean, fancy a smell?

518
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:09,953
In life, you meet friends
that you instantly click with.

519
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,499
Mi Ae was one of those friends.

520
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,465
What are you doing?

521
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:22,299
Let's eat.

522
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:34,062
- Fuck!
- What?

523
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:37,273
It's fucking delicious!
Splendid.

524
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,442
You scared me.

525
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:41,236
And don't say splendid.

526
00:35:41,236 --> 00:35:44,363
I hate the word thanks to someone.

527
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:47,534
You sure bitch about nothing,

528
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:49,869
but you're a good cook.

529
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:53,623
We soon decided to live together.

530
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:57,460
- Super stretchy.
- Hey, give that here!

531
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,088
Shall we try this one, too?
Super stretchy!

532
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:05,677
I'd already had plans to leave home
due to my mom's escalating hysteria,

533
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:09,806
and Mi Ae had grown wary
after a series of burglaries,

534
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:12,641
targeting lone females near school.

535
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,895
Is this the one you mentioned?

536
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:19,399
Check that it's from the USA.

537
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:22,318
American ones are big and juicy.

538
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,405
- Maybe they're bio-engineered.
- Everything's big over there.

539
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:31,578
I think you've run out
of cigarettes in the freezer.

540
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:35,372
Yes, remind me at the counter
to get some Marlboro Red.

00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,262
It's my mom, I don't need to take it.

545
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:51,430

Hey, are you okay?

547
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:06,487
I wasn't alone in my struggle
with my mother.

548
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:10,616
The word "mother"
was off-limits to Mi Ae.

549
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:16,622
Soon, Ji Tae and Ho Min
were due to leave for military duty.

550
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:21,211
On our last night out
before they had to shave their heads,

551
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,712
they asked me to bring Nam Kyu.

552
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:30,053
You've lost your sweetness,
you've gone sugarfree

553

Everything's sugarfree,
you've made me hit rock bottom

missing, sugarfree

great dancers, honestly.

No, I'm quite alright.

- Yeah.

You said he only wants sex.

660
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:58,834
He says I'm his muse

661
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:01,629

inspires him.

662
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:03,588

00:45:22,483 --> 00:45:26,362

he won't be of any use to you.

vet my dates from now on.

That day, Mi Ae firmly cut ties
with her parents

675
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,596
and I put an end to
my confusing romance with Nam Kyu.

676
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:57,852
We became even closer
while comforting one another,

677
00:45:57,852 --> 00:46:02,814
helping each other forget our pain
and return to normalcy.

678
00:46:05,067 --> 00:46:06,901
Stop!

679
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:27,923
Mi Ae spent all her savings
paying for a settlement

680
00:46:27,923 --> 00:46:32,385
so she went from raging alcoholic
to unstoppable part-timer.

681
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:38,933
She took several tutoring jobs
and even Ho Min's job at the cafe.

682
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:52,656
Is your shift over?

683
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,116
Yes.

684
00:46:54,116 --> 00:46:58,287
I've seen you a couple of times,
you have a kind face.

685
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:00,872
Do you have a boyfriend?

686
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:03,459
No.

687
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:05,586
I'm totally not a weirdo.

688
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:08,380
I create my own stuff.

689
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,592
- Not music, is it?
- No, not music.

690
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:14,303
I majored in art and am a tattoo artist.

691
00:47:14,303 --> 00:47:16,721
A tattoo artist...

692
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:21,936
If you have some time,
would you like to grab a coffee?

693
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:26,148
I made coffee all day,
could we go for drinks instead?

694
00:47:26,148 --> 00:47:27,441
Aren't you hungry?

695
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:28,567
We can get snacks.

696
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:31,695
Shall we go to The Squid Shack
and drink soju?

697
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:33,155

698
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:34,989
Shall we?

699
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:39,995
Young.

700
00:47:39,995 --> 00:47:42,206
That novel in your notebook is good.

701
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:44,667
Are you mad?
Why would you read that?

702
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,418

703
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:49,004
It's not half bad.
How long have you been writing?

704
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:51,257
I don't know, I can't hear you!

705
00:47:51,257 --> 00:47:53,467
If nothing works out, be a writer.

706
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:56,720
You should write about a gay
who lives with a crazy bitch.

707
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,973
What would you know?
You don't even read.

708
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:04,520
Have you decided
to date the tattoo guy?

709
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,606
He's not a tattoo guy,
he's a tattoo artist.

710
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:10,150
Always with a string of guys.

711
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:13,153
You can talk.
You break up with "Reason for Living,"

712
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:17,116
and now you're dating an influencer
with thousands of followers.

713
00:48:17,116 --> 00:48:18,367
12,000 followers.

714
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:21,704
Who cares.
Are you officially dating?

715
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:26,250
We've been on several dates
but I'm getting nowhere with him.

716
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,128
I say it will be over in two weeks.

717
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:31,255
- Worry about yourself.
- Fuck you!

718
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:34,425
- Double fuck you.
- Two weeks is being generous!

719
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:36,010
You wish.

720
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,763
Where are you looking?
Come to me, sugarfree.

721
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,140
Isn't this song a bop?

722
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,266
Sure.

723
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:45,184
I know the whole routine,
want to see?

724
00:48:48,564 --> 00:48:50,524
Young.

725
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:51,901
Young?

726
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:54,904
Let's go there for another round.

727
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:57,071
I have something to say.

728
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:04,162
We should end things.

729
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:10,085
I like you but I can't stand it
when you sing in the streets.

730
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:12,922
And how you kiss me in public
when you're drunk,

731
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:16,174
and how you start crying,
it's exhausting.

732
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,845
- Okay, I won't do all that.
- There's no need, it's over.

733
00:49:22,598 --> 00:49:24,141
Then let's stay friends.

734
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:27,226
I have too many friends
so don't call me.

735
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:36,153
Dickhead.

736
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:39,864
You cant stand it
when I sing in the streets?

737
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,160
You filter-abusing monster!

738
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,713
Only in the agony of parting
do we look into the depths of love.

739
00:49:54,713 --> 00:49:56,673
George Eliot.

740
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,093
After our breakup,

741
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:02,054
Nam Kyu kept sending me sentimental quotes.

742
00:50:02,054 --> 00:50:03,972
Insistently.

743
00:50:11,105 --> 00:50:13,940
Mi Ae, let's drink.

744
00:50:17,486 --> 00:50:19,529
Choi Mi Ae?

745
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,754
Are you in there?
What are you doing?

746
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:39,425
Are you ignoring me?
Or taking a dump?

747
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:43,052
I feel like crap today
so you have to drink with me.

748
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,724
Fuck!

749
00:50:51,854 --> 00:50:53,730
I'm fucked.
