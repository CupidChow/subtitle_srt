[Love in the Big City]

2
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,568
Young, I'm totally fucked.

3
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:57,571
You're not fucked,
pull yourself together.

4
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,741
I should have quit fucking drinking.

5
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,981
It takes two to make a baby,
call the damn guy.

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,871
That's the real problem.

7
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:07,706
What is?

8
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:11,292
I don't know who to call.

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,172
You were dating them both?

10
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,967
I didn't mean to...

11
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:20,427
The DJ is better at sex

12
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:24,098
but the tattoo guy is hotter.

13
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:27,476
I was taking some time
to weigh things up.

14
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:28,519
Without a condom?

15
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,397
Who has time for condoms
in the moment?

16
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:33,357
Nice one, Mi Ae.

17
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:36,067
What on earth were you thinking?

18
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:44,076
You'll go to a clinic?

19
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:46,327
We'll go tomorrow.

20
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,956
But I don't have any money.

21
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,291
Are you serious?

22
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,001
Who should I ask?

23
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,907
If I ask the DJ, he'll get clingy.

24
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,047
And the tattoo guy...

25
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,799
I've forgotten his name.

26
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,801
I must have been mad!

27
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,885
Shall I get a loan?

28
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:07,182
There's no need, I'll pay for it.

29
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:10,436
No, I can't let you do that.

30
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:14,773
I'm not doing it for free,
pay me back with interest.

31
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:16,983
Let's get you to a clinic.

32
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,987
Really?

33
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,285
You're all I've got. I love you!

34
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,865
[Episode 2]

35
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,796
Are you sure they do the procedure here?

36
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:40,382
Yeah, I looked it up online.

37
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:43,135
I don't know, it seems shady.

38
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,429
Are they professionals?

39
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,764
If not, we'll just leave.

40
00:02:58,275 --> 00:02:59,985
Look here,

41
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:03,489
the gestational sac indicates
that your baby's around five weeks.

42
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,574
Will the father be joining us?

43
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,076
He's not the father.

44
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,868
He's not?

45
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:12,288
Got it.

46
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:18,462
You have sexual intercourse
three times a week?

47
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:21,298
- Yes.
- With strangers...

48
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:22,466
and unprotected?

49
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:25,552
On occasion, yes.

50
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:29,263
So what do you want me to do?

51
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,350
Remove it.

52
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,437
Remove it...

53
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,485
A baby isn't a coffee stain!

54
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:44,738
It's not a pimple that can be popped.

55
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:48,575
Don't girls like me
help keep your clinic open?

56
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:50,369
I'm saying this as your elder.

57
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,371
You're a student, why be so reckless?

58
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,039
It's harmful for a woman's body.

59
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,332
I'm no saint, but...

60
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:58,293
Do you parents know? What did your mother say?

61
00:03:58,293 --> 00:03:59,753
They don't know, do they?

62
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:04,007
Girls should dream of becoming
a faithful housewife.

63
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:06,760
This is the consequence
of your reckless actions!

64
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,929
A woman's body is like a temple...

65
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:10,930
For fuck's sake!

66
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,560
- Miss, please!
- She stole my uterus!

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,645
You came with her, go and stop her!

68
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:18,730
- Hurry!
- Okay!

69
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:24,318
Mi Ae, stop there!

70
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,706
You're so bloody fast.

71
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,459
What the hell did you run off with?

72
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,295
This. It's so old.

73
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:43,464
Maybe he bought if after graduating,

74
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:44,965
Seoul Uni class of 1988.

75
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,467
How do you know that?

76
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:50,554
I read his license on the wall
while I was waiting.

77
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:54,308
I'm avoiding Seoul University
graduates like the plague.

78
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:58,145
Seoul University or not,
why did you steal that?

79
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:00,939
You should have just left
if he wouldn't operate.

80
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:05,110
I stole it with good reason,
he's a total nutter.

81
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,987
Choi Mi Ae?

82
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,946
I'll take that.

83
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,618
Look, I'm sorry,

84
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:15,037
but you must understand.

85
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,831
You heard everything he said.

86
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,709
I know he's a nutcase

87
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,587
but you're getting me in trouble.

88
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,464
Fine.

89
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:28,716
But only because you asked nicely.

90
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:33,180
I know a place,

91
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,307
a clinic near Jungsoo University.

92
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:39,645
Their staff are nicer
and they have much better facilities.

93
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,896
I go there too.

94
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,236
Thank you. I'll buy you a drink
after my procedure.

95
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,613
Your number.

96
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:51,865
Number?

97
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:55,202
Don't forget to send the consultation fee.

98
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,246
Okay.

99
00:05:57,246 --> 00:05:59,873
You don't have any money,
how will you buy drinks?

100
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:04,085
I won't be broke forever,
I can treat her next time.

101
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:08,006
Are we going to Jungsoo University?

102
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,424
I guess so.

103
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:12,177
Don't we seem like

104
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:16,014
the abortion avengers or something?

105
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:19,434
Mi Ae got the procedure done
at another hospital

106
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:22,770
and I made the payment
in three installments.

107
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,864
Look at this, I'm Sadako.

108
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:34,448
My hair's lusher than yours.

109
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:39,079
Is it bad?

110
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,331
Would you like to know?

111
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm good, I'll finish cooking.

112
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,362
A fortnight passed
and Mi Ae returned to her old self.

113
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:17,534
- Cooking noodles?
- Not for you, I'm not.

114
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:21,203
Noodles are best enjoyed together.

115
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,791
Hey, there's no soju.

116
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,460
You need to quit drinking.

117
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,254
You can't have noodles without soju,

118
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,799
In your state?

119
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,677
What will I do with you?
Just wait here.

120
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,595
Watch the noodles.

121
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,890
Hurry back home!

122
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,027
Young.

123
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,287
Nam Kyu.

124
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,915
Why are you here?

125
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,668
I wanted to give you this

126
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:11,545
and I know you live around here
but not the exact house.

127
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:16,510
I thought I might see you
if I waited right here.

128
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,637
What is this?

129
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:22,391
Home-cooked meals are rare
when you live alone.

130
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:25,227
I brought marinated crab
and some side dishes.

131
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,437
They're a delicacy from my hometown,

132
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:30,482
made with quality soy sauce
so it tastes splendid.

133
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:34,361
We broke up, remember?
Why are you doing this?

134
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,445
Still,

135
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:40,366
how could you cut me out so ruthlessly?

136
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:42,577
You reek of alcohol.

137
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:44,412
I hate it!

138
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,915
I hate the way I'm acting, too.

139
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:52,587
But I looked in the mirror
after we broke up,

140
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:54,798
and I looked...

141
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,383
I didn't look human.

142
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:59,386
No, you look perfectly human.

143
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:01,847
- Two eyes, one nose-
- Stop messing with me!

144
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:04,266
You can talk.

145
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,393
Do you know what time it is?

146
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:09,395
Falling in love isn't a sin!

147
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:14,067
Sure, falling in love isn't a sin

148
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,485
but disorderly conduct is.

149
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,573
Young.

150
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:24,118
After our breakup,

151
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:27,913
did you not think of me once?

152
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:33,211
I didn't.

153
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,004
Even so,

154
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,965
can't you just...

155
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,011
meet me?

156
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,013
Every once in a while?

157
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,432
Please give me some time

158
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:47,558
to learn to forget you.

159
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:52,439
I felt suffocated the entire time
we were dating

160
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,358
and you're still driving me nuts.

161
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,359
Take the food back.

162
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,947
This is rather delicious.

163
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:04,117
It's made with wild crabs
which are very rare

164
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:05,786
so eat it.

165
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:08,872
No. I need to get home,
my noodles will go soggy.

166
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:12,041
Am I less important than noodles?

167
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:22,052
Here here, the crabs aren't at fault.

168
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,971
Don't cry here,
come and have a drink with me.

169
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,765
Shall we?

170
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:28,432
Off we go.

171
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:35,689
You're too drunk,
we should call it a night.

172
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,203
- He came to see you?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:52,916
I didn't answer his calls
and he turned up with marinated crab.

174
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,419
I knew he was a nutter when he sang
that weird song at karaoke.

175
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,338
He sounds pretty obsessive.

176
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:01,800
He waited for two hours, hoping I'd walk by.

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,970
Was the crab spicy or in soy sauce?

178
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,264
Who cares?

179
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,349
How did you deal with that punk?

180
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,518
You should have kneed him!

181
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:14,479
Why are you acting all butch, a knee kick?

182
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,524
You haven't held a gun in the army,
you wouldn't know.

183
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:20,067
I was our squad's sharpshooter.

184
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:23,904
Do they teach you to lift your pinky to shoot?

185
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:28,285
Ji Tae, what on earth are you doing?

186
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:30,077
Ladies?

187
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:33,999
First guy, or the second one?

188
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,292
First.

189
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:37,419
You know I have a gift, right?

190
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:40,380
I sense the first guy is very well-endowed.

191
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,716
You frisky bitch.

192
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:46,094
I don't care for that stuff,
what matters is personality.

193
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:48,180
And I sense...

194
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,806
the first guy has a big heart.

195
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:53,101
See you.

196
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:55,728
You're leaving already?

197
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:02,027
He'll run his feet off.

198
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,153
Fickle bastard.

199
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:11,911
If obsession isn't love,
I have yet never loved.

200
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:26,426
- Hey, look over there.
- Damn.

201
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:30,388
- Like two peas in a pod.
- Are they dating?

202
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:33,016
What's so great about Mi Ae?

203
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:36,770
Let's go. What shall we eat?

204
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,314
Do you know what they said earlier?

205
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:41,358
What did those idiots say now?

206
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:44,569
That we live together,
and you had an abortion.

207
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,155
Well, they couldn't be more right.

208
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:49,115
I guess so.

209
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:52,577
It's the power of collective intelligence.

210
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:57,748
To me they said "We heard
you were gay, but guess not!"

211
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:18,353
Through each other,
we learned many facts of life.

212
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:23,441
Through me, Mi Ae learned
that being a gay man sucks

213
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:28,445
and through her I learned
that being a woman equally sucks.

214
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:39,207
With time, Mi Ae started
to care about her grades

215
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:42,252
and cut down drinking,
from eight times a week to three.

216
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:45,754
Like regular college students,
we looked for jobs.

217
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,526
[Career Portal]

218
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,160
[Choi Mi Ae]
"Pass"

219
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,761
Pray that I don't lose my mind.

220
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:35,388
Don't bring strange guys home, alright?

221
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,181
I'm off.

222
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:40,393
Mi Ae got a job at a big company

223
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:43,688
and soon left for the new employees' workshop.

224
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:47,649
For the first time
since I left home, I was alone.

225
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:59,328
Why does she smoke this shit?

226
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:10,215
I wanted to talk to someone
and let things out

227
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:14,511
so I took up Mi Ae's advice
and started writing.

228
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:19,056
Because my nights alone
felt too long and dull.

229
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,947
They're like zombie fingers.

230
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,808
When's she coming?

231
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:09,649
[Go Young: Where are you?]

232
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:16,698
[Mi Ae: Almost home!]

233
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:21,077
[Go Young: Aren't your bags heavy?
Shall I meet you at the bus stop?]

234
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:25,539
[Mi Ae: No, I'm in the car.]

235
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,667
Whose car?

236
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:40,095
What are those flowers?

237
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,142
And who's that guy?

238
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,785
What are these shitty flowers?

239
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:02,952
And who's the guy?

240
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:06,039
Did you do all this?

241
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,791
Who is he?

242
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,919
Where did you meet him?

243
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,214
He's a colleague I met at the workshop.

244
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:17,883
Things just happened, you know?

245
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:23,765
Let me see this guy's face.

246
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:26,392
Don't make it a big deal.

247
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:29,895
He's just an average looking guy.

248
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,983
He looks normal, for once.

249
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:36,444
Different from the punks you always date.

250
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:37,779
Is he?

251
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,240
He's bland, just your average guy.

252
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
We're not talking about soup here.

253
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:47,205
Is he big?

254
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:49,374
He's average.

255
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:51,334
Yet you're dating him?

256
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:55,421
Stop asking questions,
we haven't done it yet.

257
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:59,676
The great Choi Mi Ae brings home
a bouquet, this is a very big deal!

258
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,845
I saw your face
when you were with him.

259
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:07,475
He's just a serious guy
who's studied all his life.

260
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:09,060
Why would you date such a guy?

261
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,982
Because he asked me to!
If it doesn't work out, I'll end it!

262
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,441
Why are you screaming?

263
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:20,113
You met at the workshop?

264
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:22,365
How old is he? Is he rich?

265
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:25,993
Stop talking and put the flowers
in some water!

266
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:31,624
A while later, I officially met
Mi Ae's boyfriend for the first time.

267
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,669
He was keen to meet
his girlfriend's best friend

268
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,255
and I guess Mi Ae
was serious about him too

269
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,257
as she asked me
to join them for dinner.

270
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:47,347
This is Go Young,
my best friend from university.

271
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,436
Hello.

272
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,479
Hello, I'm Lee Jun Ho.

273
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,231
I've heard a lot about you.

274
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:58,693
But you're different
from what I imagined.

275
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,279
What exactly did you imagine?

276
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,697
Nothing bad.

277
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:06,034
You're just taller than I imagined.

278
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:09,704
You're also better looking
than what I've been told.

279
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:11,539
A lot taller, too.

280
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,958
I played a lot of sports
when I was young.

281
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,753
I didn't play any sports
but I just kept growing.

282
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:19,631
Let's stop talking about sports
and order some food.

283
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,590
Sit down.

284
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:32,100
You should try this.

285
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:41,736
Do you do the same work as Mi Ae?

286
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,488
No, I'm not in marketing,

287
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,281
I'm a semiconductor researcher.

288
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:48,076
Wow, that's awesome.

289
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,035
Unlike someone.

290
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,622
Did you major in that field?

291
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,290
Yes, Materials Engineering.

292
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,669
Materials Engineering...

293
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,879
at Seoul University?

294
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,298
- Yes.
- Wow, Seoul University.

295
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,092
You must have been a good student.

296
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,969
Mi Ae tells me that you're really smart

297
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,347
and a great writer.

298
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:11,557
Mi Ae told you that?

299
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,601
Shall we order something else?

300
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,310
Sure.

301
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:19,314
Watch your mouth.

302
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:27,115
- Some grilled short ribs, please.
- Coming right up.

303
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:28,449
Thank you.

304
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:31,369
Mi Ae never talks about her university days.

305
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,455
I hear you two were close,
what was she like back then?

306
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:37,750
Where should I start...

307
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,044
I want to hear everything.

308
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,504
There's no need.

309
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:44,674
Did you manage to pay back
all the settlement money?

310
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:45,717
Settlement money?

311
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:48,302
She juggled several jobs
to pay for settlement.

312
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:51,139
If she sees red,
Mi Ae goes totally berserk.

313
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:54,976
She was legendary in our department,
she once beat up two guys at once.

314
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,894
Is that right?

315
00:20:56,894 --> 00:21:00,314
- I never imagined that you...
- It's not true.

316
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:05,110
Stop playing, he'll believe you!

317
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:15,621
Their romance continued longer
than I had expected

318
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:18,498
and waiting for Mi Ae became routine.

319
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,384
Mi Ae? Where are you?

320
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:29,927
I'm sorry, I forgot.

321
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:34,390
I'm having dinner and drinks
with my colleagues and Jun Ho.

322
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,976
- You said you'd eat with me!
- Sorry I didn't call.

323
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,228
I'll be late, don't wait up.

324
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:42,315
She could have told me earlier...

325
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:45,358
It's overcooked.

326
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,917
Hey, I'm sorry.

327
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:05,379
My manager kept asking me
for personal errands off the clock.

328
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:07,506
Drives me nuts.

329
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,967
Right.

330
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,598
What is it?
Is everything okay?

331
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,978
Do you know Min Ji from our intake?

332
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:23,354
She went to your university.

333
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:28,319
We all went out for drinks yesterday

334
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,778
and she said something strange.

335
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,325
She said that you...

336
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:39,162
have a serious long-term boyfriend.

337
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:44,418
That everyone knew you two
were living together

338
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,210
and that...

339
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:50,424
Never mind.

340
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:52,301
That's nothing.

341
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:56,889
Don't take it to heart,
there were all sorts of rumors.

342
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,432
It's him, isn't it?

343
00:22:58,432 --> 00:23:00,017
Go Young.

344
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:03,020
He's your roommate So Yeon, right?

345
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,981
No, So Yeon's a girl.

346
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:08,524
Then call her right now.

347
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,946
So Yeon went to Thailand

348
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:13,364
to get a massage...

349
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:17,451
Do you think this is a joke?
You're a terrible liar.

350
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,953
Tell me the truth.

351
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,710
You're right.

352
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,128
So Yeon doesn't exist.

353
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:33,257
There's only Young, I'm sorry.

354
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:37,136
I didn't mean to lie to you.

355
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,224
- I wanted to tell you-
- Get out.

356
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,726
It's not like that...

357
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:45,270
- Honestly, it's not.
- I said get out.

358
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,022
He's not that type of guy.

359
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:52,902
The truth is you've been living with a guy.

360
00:23:57,574 --> 00:23:59,826
He's gay.

361
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:03,162
He only likes guys.

362
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:36,238
You're home already?
That was quick.

363
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:38,323
Weren't you eating with Jun Ho?

364
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,575
No.

365
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:43,620
You've made it home just in time, then.

366
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,205
Sit down and eat.

367
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:47,082
I should have ordered more.

368
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:51,086
I was going to save you some
so I ordered it extra spicy.

369
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:52,296
Did I do good?

370
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:53,464
Yeah, you did.

371
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:57,091
Why are you so limp?
Did you two have an argument?

372
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,428
I guess you did.

373
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:01,304
Why did you argue?

374
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,599
Come on, tell me.

375
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,520
Remember Min Ji from university?

376
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,774
She was in Jun Ho's team
during the workshop

377
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:14,026
and she told him weird stuff,

378
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:15,986
about how we live together.

379
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:18,822
You know there were
rumors about us in college.

380
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,532
Sure. So what?

381
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:23,035
Jun Ho, he...

382
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:27,456
He questioned me about who my roommate So Yeon is.

383
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:32,335
He was suspicious and asked me if it was you.

384
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,173
So did you tell him we live together?

385
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:37,674
Yes.

386
00:25:37,674 --> 00:25:40,302
Why would you tell him that?

387
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,429
He's going to get the wrong idea.

388
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:44,723
Jun Ho was so mad

389
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:47,767
that I had to...

390
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:51,187
You didn't...

391
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:54,399
Did you tell him I'm gay?

392
00:25:57,236 --> 00:26:00,614
I had no choice but to tell him.

393
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:02,782
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:12,543
He's not the type to tell people
so it's okay, don't worry.

395
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,253
It's not okay to me.

396
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:16,547
How could I trust that jerk?

397
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,051
Please don't be so harsh.

399
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:26,265
He got mad and started crying
so I had no choice.

400
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,350
Why didn't you ask me first?

401
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,686
Don't you care how I feel?

402
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:34,898
You know what?
You're just like the rest of them.

403
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:37,276
You only act like you're loyal.

404
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:41,947
We agreed this is what we'd do, what's changed?

405
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:45,909
I didn't give you permission
to tell everyone I'm gay.

406
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:48,495
When did I go around
telling everyone you're gay?

407
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:50,205
What do you call this then?

408
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:52,374
Why not go full out
and tell him the truth,

409
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:55,252
that you only live with me
because I'm a loner?

410
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,753
Since when were you so kind?

411
00:26:56,753 --> 00:27:00,048
Things just turned out this way
after we started living together!

412
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:01,216
Who are we kidding?

413
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,552
I'm always eating alone and waiting for you.

414
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,095
Do you think we live together?

415
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:06,221
What more do you want?

416
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,473
Live alone forever then!

417
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:10,225
Do you even care about me?

418
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:12,644
You only care about your boredom.

419
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,439
That's why you're not dating
and still a fucking loner.

420
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:25,823
Just like that, I left Mi Ae's home.

421
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:31,413
I'm the one who got drunk
and made out with a guy in public

422
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:34,498
so I couldn't blame her, really.

423
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:37,252
But it hurt

424
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:43,132
to hear those words
from Mi Ae of all people.

425
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:00,524
Be gentle.

426
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,202

00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,048
Are you okay?

430
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,845
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:13,973
I didn't know who to call.

432
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,101
What happened?

433
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,354
Let's get you up.

434
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,792
You're speeding.

435
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:46,130
I know.

436
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:53,512
I'm sorry I called out of the blue.

437
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:58,893
I have no right to call you.

438
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:06,233
I'm glad to see you again.

439
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,741

440
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,330
Right.

441
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,122
Okay.

442
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:45,064
No one's here tonight.

443
00:30:57,577 --> 00:31:01,539
Do you remember eating katsu
and hanging out over there?

444
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,251
We had those promise rings.

445
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:12,091
I remember.

446
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,763
The padlock we hung up,

447
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:21,143
I wonder where it is.

448
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:23,144
I'm going to find it.

449
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,076
It's here.

450
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:41,580
Look, it's our padlock.

451
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,374
The writing's faded.

452
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:46,625
We should write it again.

453
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:51,505
You fool.

455
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,983
I'm sorry.

Young.

457
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,450
You were always a good person

458
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:23,829
but I was a coward.

459
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:28,125
I wanted to be loved by you

460
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:35,132
but I wasn't brave enough
to receive your love.

461
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:38,886
I'm sorry.

462
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:44,100
Next time,

463
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,894
don't meet a coward like me.

464
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:54,068
Meet someone who'll truly love you,
someone good.

465
00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:59,114
Please.

466
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,050
Thank you for everything.

467
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:03,722
When we talk about love,
we must also talk about death.

468
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:08,183
After finding myself alone,
I completed my romance novel.

469
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:14,148
It wasn't for anyone to read,

470
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:20,321
I just wrote because I couldn't sleep
and needed something to do.

471
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:28,829
My novel seemed to resemble
the times we had shared.

Hello?

477
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,883
It's been a while.

478
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,176
How have you been?

479
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:25,177
Good.

480
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:28,306
I became a writer.

481
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:31,266
I won Donga Daily's New Writers Contest.

482
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:33,728
Really?

483
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:38,108
I wrote about a slutty gay
living with an alcoholic woman.

It seems you were right,

485

I am a good writer.

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,197

"Blueberries and Cigarettes" explores
the protagonist's life with levity.

490
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:02,424
It's a new style of romance
that uses provocative language

00:38:11,928 --> 00:38:15,722
how it happened?

515
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:20,311
A car accident.

516
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,647
It appears he was speeding.

517
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:06,972
I used to think that he was too slow
and that I was too fast.

518
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:10,905
In reality, it was the other way around.

519

Despite meeting so many people,

520
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:19,912
I had never put a relationship
above everything else in my life.

00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:24,417

522
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,783
that he was someone I could have
shared a long future with...

523
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,378
An endless future, full of warmth.

00:41:07,228 --> 00:41:09,397
I don't even have a proper suit.

543
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:11,024
I'll buy you a luxury one.

544
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:12,816
Luxury?

545
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:15,278
I'm seriously tone deaf.

546
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:18,531
You haven't heard me singing, have you?

547
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:22,201
It doesn't matter how well you sing,
what matters is that you sing.

548
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:24,662
It's the price of writing about me.

549
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:28,541
Honestly, I can't carry a tune to save my life.

550
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,376
It's fine.

551
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:35,172
I've told Jun Ho already.
You just need to do your best, okay?

552
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,929
Packing for a move is tough.

553
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:44,890
Everything in life is tough.

554
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:47,977
Mi Ae.

555
00:41:47,977 --> 00:41:52,565
Will you be happy with a child,
changing diapers and stuff?

556
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:55,985
We're not having children,
we already decided.

557
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:58,738
We even wrote a contract.

558
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:01,991
Then why bother getting married?

559
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:06,244
For the experience.
No harm done if it doesn't work out.

560
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:11,793
If things goes south, call it off
and come right back home.

561
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:13,086
Got it?

562
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:15,253
Yes, sir.

563
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:21,510
Did Jun Ho tell you
you're the love of his life?

564
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:27,307
If he didn't, why would I be
doing all this crap?

565
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,651
I always thought

566
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:42,197
that hoping for everlasting love
in my world

567
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,742
was a fool's wish.

568
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:52,874
Like dreaming of seeing a unicorn.

569
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:59,214
You know you're living a fantasy

570
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:04,636
but still hope

571
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:08,265
that it might exist somewhere.

572
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:11,518
The hope excites you.

573
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:17,899
Now,

574
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:22,946
I don't think it's so foolish after all.

575
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:30,787
Mi Ae.

576
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,958
Do you think

577
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:38,920
people like me can find eternal love?

578
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:56,939
We are gathered here today to witness
the union of Jun Ho and Mi Ae.

579
00:43:56,939 --> 00:44:01,986
As they embark on this new journey,
let us offer them our support.

580
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:07,200
As the bride and groom
make their way down the aisle,

581
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,121
please welcome them
with a warm round of applause.

582
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:16,666
Let's hear it for the bride and groom!

583
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:27,844
Gorgeous!

584
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:41,733
- So handsome!
- And stunning!

585
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:48,074
Facing your friends and family,

586
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:50,742
please bow.

587
00:44:55,122 --> 00:44:59,252
Go Young, the bride's
close friend from university

588
00:44:59,252 --> 00:45:01,420
will sing a wedding song.

589
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,464
A round of applause, please.

590
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:09,886
- You can do it!
- Young, you look great!

591
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,639
Mi Ae.

592
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,182

616

As I looked down
at those blueberries, I realized

617
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:19,261
that a time I had thought
would last forever

618
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:21,721
had come to an end.

619
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,800
That every beautiful moment

620
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,345
was but a mere flash.
