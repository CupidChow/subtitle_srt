1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,402
Remember the salt shortage?

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,172
-So you hoarded salt?
-Yes, I…

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,908
The expiration date on this
is May 16, 2023.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,343
You've been eating this.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,285
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:22,322
The guests who are joining us today
are incredibly busy people.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,092
One of the top comments they get is,

8
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,127
"Why aren't you on
<i>Don't be the First One</i>"?

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,562
They're a comedian couple.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,266
Instead of appearing on that show,
they've come to <i>You Bought What?!</i>

11
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,568
Could you tell us a bit about them?

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,370
They have different spending habits.

13
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,406
-One of them makes impulse purchases.
-I see.

14
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,609
And the other
is more of a practical spender.

15
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:47,281
They both enjoy shopping,
but they have different spending habits.

16
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,216
One thing they have in common with us

17
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,753
is that they've been living together
for about eight years.

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,856
-We've been living together for 17 years.
-It's been 17 years.

19
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,059
So I'd like to ask them
what it's like to live together.

20
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,596
These two have different spending habits.
Let's welcome the comedians…

21
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,664
No, wait.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,166
Let's welcome today's guests.

23
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,069
-Hello.
-Hello.

24
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,738
-It's good to see you.
-Hello.

25
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,507
-Please come to the middle.
-Hello.

26
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,410
Could you introduce yourselves?

27
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,478
Hello, I'm comedian Hong Hyunhee.

28
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,613
Welcome.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,816
Hi, I'm Jasson, Junbeom's stylist.

30
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,018
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,388
<i>-Don't be the First One!</i>
-Why did you bring that up?

32
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,823
Don't you hear that a lot?

33
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,860
-Why would I go on that show?
-He's not a comedian.

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,698
I got confused for a second
and thought Hyunhee wasn't a comedian.

35
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,969
So on this show,
we take a look at your spending habits.

36
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,404
-Okay.
-Could you tell us about yours?

37
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,975
To be honest,
I'm very impulsive when I shop.

38
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,411
Even if I should return something,
I end up keeping it.

39
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,480
I'm like that too. I end up keeping it.

40
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,915
Why don't you return it?

41
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,218
-I feel bad.
-Don't you feel bad for your wallet?

42
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,889
-I'm not wired to think that way.
-Me neither.

43
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,559
I'm an impulsive shopper,
and I don't return the things I should.

44
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:09,596
My spending habits are so flawed
that I wasn't sure if I should come here.

45
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,665
That's the kind of guest we prefer.

46
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,333
What about you, Jasson?

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,669
I look at practicality, but also design.

48
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,939
-You like pretty things?
-I like things that are pretty and cute.

49
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,877
If there's something that I really want,
I tend to buy it.

50
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,546
Is that why you married her?

51
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:31,018
I knew you were itching to say that.
I could tell by the look on your face.

52
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,020
Now that's how you deliver a line.

53
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,955
I married her because of her looks.

54
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:39,426
-Have you been married for eight years?
-We got married in 2018.

55
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,094
-That's eight years.
-Already?

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,031
Whenever I see celebrity couples on TV,

57
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,034
I wonder what they're like
behind the scenes.

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,937
Ryugyu and I don't talk a lot.

59
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,039
We don't really talk at home.

60
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,608
-We only talk in front of the camera.
-He's right.

61
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,544
We noticed that you weren't aware
of some of the items

62
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,147
your partner brought today.

63
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,684
That's because I don't interfere
with her shopping at all.

64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,287
I may question
why she bought certain things,

65
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,624
but I don't nag her
or give her a hard time about it.

66
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,759
I sometimes want to steal his stuff.

67
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,394
It's so annoying!

68
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,231
Have you stolen something from him?
He seems so annoyed.

69
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,734
I bought myself a mesh top
because it seemed nice and airy,

70
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,804
but she took it that day
and wore it to a company dinner.

71
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,840
When I got it back,
there was a big kimchi stain on it.

72
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:30,677
-I'm tempted to steal everything he buys.
-It drives me crazy.

73
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,380
That's so weird.
The same thing happened to us today.

74
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,315
-What did you steal?
-I bought this top.

75
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,484
I think it was from Sa**t Ma***n.

76
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,052
It cost 600,000 won.

77
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,756
I saw you wear that shirt today.
I'd only worn it for about five minutes.

78
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,158
-What?
-You threw it on like it was no big deal.

79
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,760
What if you get BO on it?

80
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,629
I washed it, but he didn't wear it.

81
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,732
I was going to wear it today.
You just beat me to it.

82
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,534
-Did he tell you off?
-This is it.

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,403
-That cost you 600,000 won?
-It was 600,000 won.

84
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,704
I didn't say anything,

85
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,508
but he wouldn't look at me
when we rode the elevator down.

86
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,576
You're nice.

87
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,813
We're going to take sides
and defend each of you.

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,218
I know Hyunhee better,
and our spending habits are quite similar.

89
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,855
But to be honest,
I was more drawn to Jasson.

90
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,425
For some reason,
you always felt like family.

91
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,493
Me?

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,963
Let me show you a picture of my aunt.

93
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,731
Why a woman?

94
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,200
You've got that aunt vibe.

95
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,001
My mom doesn't have a twin.

96
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,838
-You could mistake them for twins.
-Really?

97
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,007
FIND THE REAL JASSON

98
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,076
-I see what you mean.
-Is that AI?

99
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,512
-Is she really your aunt?
-Yes, she is.

100
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,247
-I'm crying.
-Your aunt's face…

101
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,583
CAN'T GET IT OUT OF HER HEAD

102
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,987
Then I'll defend Hyunhee,
and Ryugyu will defend Jasson.

103
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,356
Let's dive right into today's episode.

104
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,993
I didn't know Hyunhee was so domestic.

105
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,128
Kitchenware.

106
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,530
KNIFE SET

107
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,532
She has another set at home.

108
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,434
I have 45 knives in total.

109
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,768
Why?

110
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,271
This is by Sa**d Ma***r.

111
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,608
-It's by Sa**d Ma***r.
-These knives are by Sa**d Ma***r.

112
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:12,946
When I'm making food for my kid,
I can't use knives that are dull or rusty.

113
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,115
-That's why I have so many.
-But why?

114
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,917
It might also get discontinued.

115
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,219
You're scared
you won't be able to buy it later.

116
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,988
Do you cook often?

117
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,724
Of course. I cook for my kid
and sometimes for Jasson.

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,327
I've actually been to her house
and was served a meal.

119
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:31,131
She invited me over
and laid out all sorts of delicacies

120
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,768
that she ordered
from eight different restaurants.

121
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,137
-Do you open deliveries with this?
-I do.

122
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,205
Really?

123
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,141
-How much was that?
-That set cost me over 800,000 won.

124
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,242
What?

125
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,344
See? I just don't get it.

126
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,682
Doesn't she use those knives
to cook delicious meals for you?

127
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,051
-I've never used them.
-I see.

128
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,022
-She has other knives that she uses.
-Okay.

129
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,458
She bought this set and has never used it.
It's just a waste.

130
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,661
-That's how I feel.
-I get it.

131
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,831
I'd like to note that
knives have a clear purpose.

132
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,401
But it's the big purchases
that are more worrisome.

133
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,970
-It's purchases like this.
-A suitcase?

134
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,805
-You need that, though.
-That's old.

135
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,474
This is a really expensive brand.

136
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,177
-There's a reason I bought this.
-It's so expensive.

137
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:21,315
I bought it secondhand,
but it was brand new.

138
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,150
-I had no idea.
-He got a good deal.

139
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,452
I started traveling
when I was 20 years old.

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,122
Since then, I've broken over 20 suitcases.

141
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,625
There was one really embarrassing moment.

142
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,328
My suitcase got damaged
while I was traveling.

143
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,064
-Were you rolling it?
-It was at baggage claim.

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,067
My red underwear
was hanging out of my suitcase

145
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,469
as it went around the baggage carousel.

146
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,005
My goodness.

147
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,642
-Did you act like it wasn't yours?
-Yeah, I acted like it wasn't mine.

148
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,913
A suitcase costs about 150,000 won,
so 20 of them would cost 3 million won.

149
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,148
But I bought this for 1.48 million won.

150
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,250
-Secondhand?
-Yes.

151
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,784
The price has gone up since.

152
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,821
I haven't bought
a single suitcase since then.

153
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,690
We skipped over this,
but do you wear red underwear?

154
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,726
-It's Mickey Mouse.
-They're cute.

155
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,961
-Is that your underwear?
-Those were red ones.

156
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,765
I'm really sorry,
but I wore these a few days ago.

157
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:12,866
YOU STOLE THEM AGAIN?

158
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,569
-I thought they were shorts.
-They're comfortable.

159
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,039
I didn't know you ran
a kimchi business, Hyunhee.

160
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,742
Otherwise, why would you…

161
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,809
SEA SALT

162
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,978
THERE WAS A SHORTAGE, SO SHE STOCKED UP

163
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,481
-Remember the salt shortage two years ago?
-I do.

164
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,549
Sea salt?

165
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,985
I'm not even kidding.
I bought three huge sacks of salt

166
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,620
and 50 of these smaller bags.

167
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,089
-So you hoarded salt?
-Yes, I…

168
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,257
PAUSE

169
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,393
It's only hoarding if you call it that.

170
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,762
It was a smart purchase.

171
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,330
Okay, I get it.

172
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,533
But the expiration date on this
is May 16, 2023.

173
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,968
You've been eating this.

174
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,636
THE SALT'S EXPIRED, SO IS HIS TRUST

175
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,938
No wonder your skin glows.

176
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,374
It doesn't bother Jasson
if he doesn't have something he needs,

177
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,244
but I get stressed and anxious
when it happens to me.

178
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,680
You don't want your family
to be affected by it.

179
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,715
-What's your MBTI type?
-I'm an INFP.

180
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,883
-I'm an ENFP.
-ENFP.

181
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,419
-Do you picture all sorts of situations?
-I do.

182
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,422
I hope it never happens,
but if a war breaks out--

183
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,692
I think about that too.
I get scared when I read the news.

184
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:15,229
I'm sure we'll be fine.
Some people will live, others won't.

185
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,065
-What do you think about in the shower?
-I just sing.

186
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,067
-So you don't think at all?
-No.

187
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,169
-What if the water shuts off?
-Exactly.

188
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,504
It's happened before.

189
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,206
What if there's a power outage?
What if someone breaks in?

190
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,976
When I was filming <i>Taste of Wife,</i>

191
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,679
a cameraman walked in on me
while I was in the shower.

192
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,881
-What?
-What?

193
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,450
We were staying in a house
that had one bathroom.

194
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,353
The cameraman walked in on her
when she was in the shower.

195
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,389
-Instead of covering up, you freeze.
-No way.

196
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,525
-She's right.
-I'm serious.

197
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,027
You don't cover yourself up.
You just freeze.

198
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,196
He disappeared after that.

199
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,765
After two weeks, he stopped showing up.

200
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:52,866
I think he retired.

201
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,334
A SAD ENDING

202
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,670
-No.
-He vanished. We never saw him again.

203
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,907
The knives and the salt
have a clear purpose.

204
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,976
-They're essentials.
-You need them when you cook.

205
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,513
Yet again, Jasson bought this,
and I have no clue why.

206
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,716
That's not something
an intellectual would say.

207
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,251
A BOOK RECOMMENDED BY CH***PT

208
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,920
BUT READING IT IS ANOTHER MATTER

209
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,122
He hasn't read it.

210
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,291
I had my doubts
because of the page marker.

211
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,359
This book is titled <i>Bonjour Tristesse.</i>

212
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,762
-Are you sad these days?
-No.

213
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,632
I was chatting with Ch***PT
and told it all sorts of things.

214
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,968
I have a lot of conversations like that.

215
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,738
-And it recommended this book to me.
-Really?

216
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,674
-Give us a summary.
-What's it about?

217
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,909
-I've read one page.
-Just one page?

218
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,345
What did you say
to make it recommend that book?

219
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,780
This is what I said.

220
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,182
"What do you think about death,
you tin can?"

221
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,219
After that conversation,
it recommended this book to me.

222
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,721
-Do you use Ch***PT?
-Yes, for fortune-telling.

223
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:51,258
-What do you ask?
-She asks so many questions.

224
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:55,262
She asks Ch***PT where we should move
or if the apartment suits us.

225
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,997
But she's actually Christian.

226
00:09:58,232 --> 00:09:59,366
You mean feng shui?

227
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,735
Feng shui has been part of our culture--

228
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,606
-It has nothing to do with religion.
-I don't know why he brings up my faith.

229
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,675
God wouldn't make an issue out of this.

230
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,912
No, he wouldn't.
Korean fortune telling is just big data.

231
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,881
Do you ask for Jasson's fortune?

232
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,216
If I'm going to be on a new show,

233
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,353
she checks how compatible I am
with the host.

234
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,890
-Have you two checked your compatibility?
-It's amazing.

235
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,791
What about you two? You live together.

236
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,860
-How do we do it?
-When were you born?

237
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,129
-May 6, 1988.
-Okay.

238
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:32,332
-Next.
-I was born on April 6, 1986.

239
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,067
April 6, 1986.

240
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,569
Here we go.

241
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,171
You're both very fiery.

242
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,874
You're very close,
and you have a lot in common.

243
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,643
You have lively conversations,

244
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,345
but you can be stubborn
during emotional conflicts.

245
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,447
Are you guys stubborn?

246
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,817
We know we're stubborn,
so we try to avoid conflict.

247
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,188
Here's the last part.
Both of you are suns.

248
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,656
You're bright and radiant,

249
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:59,092
but if both suns shine too bright,
you risk burning out.

250
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,328
With care, compromise, and an open mind,

251
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,765
you can achieve amazing teamwork
and lifelong friendship.

252
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,900
It's amazing that Ch***PT can do this.

253
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,871
-Don't things go well when you team up?
-Yeah, it's been going well so far.

254
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,740
Things didn't work out
when we didn't work together.

255
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:17,244
A smart AI tool like Ch***PT
recommended this book to me.

256
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,413
Is it so wrong to want to read it later?

257
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,781
You should apologize.

258
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,718
You just had it read your fortune,
but you don't trust its recommendation?

259
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,886
How about this?

260
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,754
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,022
FROM SKEPTIC TO BELIEVER

262
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,757
-You convinced me.
-It's also pretty.

263
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,428
You can't berate him for one book
because this is overspending.

264
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,130
-What's with the flashy clothes?
-When I bought them…

265
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,432
They're pretty.

266
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,169
I bought this to wear to Brian's
when he invited us over to his place.

267
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45,439
I was told it was an American-style party,
but I had never been to one.

268
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:46,507
Me neither.

269
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,576
-Is this an XL?
-What's wrong with that?

270
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,979
That may be a 2XL. Could you check?

271
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,347
It's a 4XL.

272
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,648
BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT

273
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,551
-You're not that big, though.
-Hold on.

274
00:11:57,618 --> 00:12:00,187
-Does your weight fluctuate?
-It's good to be prepared.

275
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,389
I have trouble making decisions.

276
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,659
She bought a few pieces
to keep her options open.

277
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,094
Why not just decide up front?

278
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,364
-She could regret her decision.
-It's a waste of money.

279
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,765
She didn't even wear it.

280
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:15,102
It turned out to be a casual party,
so I wore a different outfit.

281
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,472
-I spend my money on what I need.
-It's her money.

282
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,073
-Why not return it?
-Right.

283
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,675
How do I do that?

284
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,178
I really like this sweater.

285
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,646
-It's your style.
-So cute.

286
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,980
It has a big logo on it.

287
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,715
-I hate that.
-Big flashy logos.

288
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,851
-This is for kids.
-It's cute.

289
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,320
It's half the price of an adult's.

290
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:36,423
When do you wear clothes
with flashy logos like this?

291
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,726
-When I meet celebrities.
-Me too.

292
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,930
-Can we talk about these, Ryugyu?
-Okay.

293
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,731
There's a reason I bought those.

294
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,334
When I got my first paycheck,

295
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,703
I wanted to buy him
a pair of designer shoes.

296
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,940
Perhaps that's why she bought these shoes.

297
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,043
These shoes are,
without a doubt, designer.

298
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,878
They just scream money.

299
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,014
If I wear these now,
they'll melt because it's so hot out.

300
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,585
I wanted my husband to look cool
even when he's driving.

301
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,321
Hold on.
You didn't take the price tag off.

302
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,323
I thought these were a gift.

303
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,757
They're expensive, right?

304
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,693
-Is this in won?
-For one shoe?

305
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,095
-No.
-What are you saying?

306
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,131
-I meant "won," not "one."
-Korean won.

307
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,369
I really appreciate Hyunhee
for getting me these shoes,

308
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,972
-but I don't wear them.
-Try them on right now.

309
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,342
-They'll look good on you.
-Can I give them to my mom then?

310
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,278
-I'd rather give them to his aunt!
-My mom would like them.

311
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:34,381
-Give them to his aunt.
-It makes more sense that way.

312
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,283
-That photo…
-She bought them for me.

313
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,052
They would suit his aunt better
since we look alike.

314
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:43,223
I think all these clothes
are very reasonable purchases.

315
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,692
But I don't understand
why you bought these.

316
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,161
Before I talk about these items,

317
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,899
let me just say we've bagged his things
like evidence from a crime scene.

318
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,302
I heard you didn't want us touching them.

319
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,371
I don't want you touching my underwear.

320
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,505
UNDERWEAR &amp; SOCKS

321
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,841
BUYS IN BULK,
ALWAYS KEEPING EXTRAS ON HAND

322
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,912
Underwear and socks are daily necessities,
but you have way too many.

323
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,915
We heard you buy seven pairs at a time.

324
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,082
You need spares.

325
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:13,987
He nearly tore a family apart
because of his underwear.

326
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,757
There's a woman
who is the mother of Junbeom's friend.

327
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,393
She was at our house
and wanted to take a shower.

328
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,197
She asked for underwear,
but I didn't have an extra pair.

329
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:27,067
-Jasson said he had an extra pair.
-It was brand new.

330
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,237
So she went home wearing his boxer briefs.

331
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:33,340
Later, her husband
looked in their closet and…

332
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,811
And to top it off,
they had just fought the day before.

333
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,315
-He thought she was having an affair.
-I would think the same thing.

334
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,183
He found a pair of men's underwear.

335
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,353
He was yelling at her,
so she told him it was Jasson's.

336
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,821
STRAIGHT OUT OF A SOAP OPERA

337
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,857
That didn't help the situation at all.

338
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:53,193
-She tried to get him to talk to Jasson.
-It was crazy.

339
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,797
They wouldn't have gotten into a fight
if Jasson hadn't had a spare.

340
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,799
THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU STOCKPILE UNDERWEAR

341
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,767
-That's your conclusion?
-She's right.

342
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,603
How many pairs do you own?

343
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,639
Including the new ones,
I have about 20 pairs.

344
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,773
THAT'S TOO MANY

345
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,042
-Don't you change your underwear?
-Twice a day.

346
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,611
He poops his pants.

347
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,946
-Come on. Don't say that.
-Is that true?

348
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,916
-We're too old to be talking about poop.
-Does he really?

349
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,620
If my underwear gets worn out
or the elastic stretches,

350
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,356
I throw them out
because I don't want to live like that.

351
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,224
-I do it for my own sake.
-Really?

352
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,327
-Don't you wear my underwear?
-I do.

353
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,930
I wear them
when I run out of clean underwear.

354
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:34,334
They're not super tight.
They're supposed to be a bit loose.

355
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:37,004
-Don't they usually have a slit here?
-Some don't.

356
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,339
But why? I thought they all had a fly.

357
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,542
Some do and some don't.

358
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,211
If you want, I can make a slit for you.

359
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,779
-With that knife?
-Yes.

360
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,083
-I can make it convenient for you.
-You're finally using the knife.

361
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,652
This elastic…

362
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,821
I can understand
why Jasson bought underwear.

363
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,523
But sportswear…

364
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,925
SPORTSWEAR

365
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:01,595
Jasson always tells me
I look slim in biker shorts and a shirt.

366
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:04,031
-She really does.
-I'm sure she looks great.

367
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,100
That's why I started buying
a lot of biker shorts.

368
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,604
These are practical, and they're stylish.

369
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,472
You work out in these, right?

370
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,740
No, she doesn't.

371
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,009
When I work out,
I wear my workout clothes.

372
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,711
-What are these?
-Workout clothes.

373
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,947
-Something comfortable.
-Like a sauna suit.

374
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,684
-She looks good in them.
-The problem is she doesn't wear them.

375
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,953
Just like the sportswear--

376
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,154
What's all this?

377
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,989
-You don't know?
-No.

378
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:32,492
Buying vinegar means you've got good taste
and care about your health.

379
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,297
What's more important than exercise
is what you eat.

380
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,467
-Some say, "You are what you eat."
-Exactly.

381
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,570
I bought these to make healthy,
delicious meals for Jasson.

382
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,405
She's taking care of her family.

383
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,241
But it's brand new.

384
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,309
-What?
-It hasn't been opened.

385
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,012
-When did you buy these?
-When we moved.

386
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,615
That was two months ago,
but I've never seen these.

387
00:16:55,182 --> 00:17:00,254
-I should've left it out on the counter.
-He has no idea what you do for him.

388
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,655
Why don't you know?

389
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,624
-Why didn't she leave them out?
-Why?

390
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,826
-Why didn't you check the kitchen?
-Right.

391
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,128
-You live in that house, too.
-Why didn't you?

392
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,763
Have you ever tried this?

393
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,698
-It's tangerine vinegar.
-We can drink it.

394
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,799
That stings!

395
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,736
-Are you okay?
-Did it get in your eyes?

396
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,172
It would've been bad
if it was acetic acid.

397
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,774
Was that supposed to console her?

398
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,910
Smell this.

399
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,212
-This…
-It smells amazing.

400
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,947
-This smells--
-My eyes sting!

401
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,350
If I hadn't come today,
I wouldn't have known we had these.

402
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,920
Don't worry. These expire in 2027.

403
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:38,358
I want him to see the thought behind it.
Ryugyu, let's say you're eating a salad.

404
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,195
Does anyone care enough
to think about your dressing?

405
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,262
No.

406
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,264
That's how much I care about Jasson.

407
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,366
-Tell me that.
-How else would he know?

408
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,636
-Hyunhee isn't that expressive at home.
-Really?

409
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,505
Do you tell each other "I love you"?

410
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,974
We used to,
but now we mostly say it to our kid.

411
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,643
Pang Hyunsook, who was on the show before,

412
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,412
said they still kiss every day.

413
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,181
-With Yangrak?
-I think so.

414
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,716
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY

415
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,986
If you don't mind me asking,
when did you last kiss?

416
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,288
-It's been a while.
-It has.

417
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,190
It's like that when you have a kid.

418
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,326
I'm not comfortable
kissing in front of him.

419
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,560
Why is that important?

420
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:15,562
-I was curious. Married--
-He was curious.

421
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:16,830
When was your last kiss?

422
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,465
It's the same for us.

423
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,300
We have a cat, so…

424
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,369
-You don't want to?
-It's awkward.

425
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,304
Let's look at the next item.

426
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:28,609
I've always known Jasson
to be well-groomed,

427
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,043
but this is a bit much.

428
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,378
What do you mean?

429
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,580
-Do you use all of that?
-I do.

430
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:36,149
This is for exfoliating foot calluses.

431
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,520
I don't like it
when calluses form on my feet.

432
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,088
I always tell my friends,

433
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,624
"Don't look at his face.
Look at his feet."

434
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,926
I can confidently take my socks off.

435
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:47,327
-Look.
-They're clean.

436
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,829
My feet are beautiful.

437
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,497
-Look at my feet.
-You two…

438
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,467
-He doesn't have any hair.
-You have to take care of them.

439
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,068
What are these for?

440
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,803
I pluck my toe hairs with these.

441
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,506
It's because I barely have any.

442
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,042
-Did you pluck them all?
-He did.

443
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,177
Take your socks off.

444
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,879
Mine are so dirty, I can't even show them.

445
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,915
-Let's exfoliate his feet.
-Come on.

446
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,283
Can you show your big toe?

447
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,851
APPALLED

448
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:14,454
That's what I can't stand.
I hate hair on toes.

449
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,156
You've got to exfoliate that.

450
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,724
-Come here.
-Do it.

451
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,594
Hygiene is really important.

452
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,865
-Good thing the table's black.
-It's like carving stone.

453
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,800
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

454
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,471
It sounds like a dentist's office.

455
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:35,309
-Look at all that dust.
-There's so much dead skin.

456
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,744
Could you turn your feet the other way?

457
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:39,513
-You have nice feet.
-He's hairy.

458
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,481
This area has a lot of callus buildup.

459
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,650
That's the spot.

460
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,419
It feels good.

461
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:49,022
Look at all this buildup.
You must've stood on your tiptoes a lot.

462
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:52,025
-Is that true?
-That's really sad.

463
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,494
-Don't tease him about that.
-I feel bad for him.

464
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,631
-Next, we need to apply foot cream.
-Put some foot cream on.

465
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,400
This has royal jelly in it.
You should put some on.

466
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,102
-Can you do it?
-No, thanks.

467
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,504
-Please?
-No.

468
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,771
I don't know how to.

469
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,441
-Just slather some on.
-Do it for him, honey.

470
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,476
Will I get paid big for doing this?

471
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,745
MOISTURIZING

472
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,214
You have to let it soak in.

473
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,450
That feels really good.

474
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,718
HE LIFTS HIS OTHER FOOT

475
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,753
Forget it, I'm only doing one side.

476
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,658
-I just wanted to show you. Look at it.
-You could wear flip-flops on the show.

477
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,726
See?

478
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,295
-So cute.
-Your feet are cute.

479
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:32,165
I've always liked clean-cut guys,
and Jasson definitely is.

480
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,001
He might be a bit too clean-cut,

481
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,904
and hearing what these swabs are for
really surprised me.

482
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,506
It's for my belly button.

483
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,643
-Don't you have to be careful?
-That's what I heard, too.

484
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,145
You just have to be gentle
when you clean it.

485
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:48,515
The belly button collects water
when you take a shower.

486
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,650
That's true.

487
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,886
So to get rid of any odor,

488
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,722
-I take a swab and wipe it.
-That's how you clean it.

489
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,991
Have you ever cleaned her belly button?

490
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,726
-No.
-It's hard to find.

491
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,528
THEY LOOK AWAY

492
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,096
It's kind of hard to find.

493
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,499
IT'S ALSO HARD TO RESPOND TO THAT

494
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:07,534
Hyunhee even brought Junbeom's things.

495
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,869
JUNBEOM'S CLOTHES &amp; SHOES

496
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:13,807
If a mother buys something for her kid,
you can't question that.

497
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:18,679
A mom wants her kid to wear
what she never got to wear.

498
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,048
You bought this last year,
but he never wore it.

499
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,115
And the Cr**s…

500
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,084
-Shoes need to fit right…
-They're cute.

501
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:27,754
…especially when they're growing,
but you bought several in the same size.

502
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,158
I never had these things as a kid.

503
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:34,361
I was just about to ask you that.
Was your family well-off?

504
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:37,130
No, my mom never bought me anything.

505
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:42,569
Junbeom's in between sizes right now.
He's between sizes five and six.

506
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:46,540
I specifically remember calling you
when I was in front of the Cr**s store.

507
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,709
I asked what size to get,
and you said six.

508
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,846
I told her to get the black ones,
but they didn't have any.

509
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:56,049
Wouldn't most people
just come back another time?

510
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,852
-She bought three.
-Mix the colors and you get black.

511
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,287
YOU WEREN'T SPECIFIC

512
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:03,357
-That's why she bought three.
-Is she supposed to melt them?

513
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:08,462
-I told you that I'm Junbeom's stylist.
-Right.

514
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:12,599
I pick out all his outfits,
but these don't match my taste.

515
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,035
This was the outfit I picked out
the other day.

516
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:16,737
-Cute.
-That was his outfit.

517
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:17,871
How much was that?

518
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:21,241
You can buy four of these outfits
for the price of one.

519
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:24,411
-Junbeom doesn't wear this, right?
-No.

520
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:27,047
If I try really hard,
I might be able to wear it.

521
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,382
-I think you can.
-How?

522
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:31,451
If I ignore the fact that we're filming,
I think I can pull it off.

523
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,055
When I went to look at this…
Actually, I saw this by chance.

524
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,623
-I was passing by it.
-I see.

525
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,394
I told myself not to hesitate
when buying things for my kid.

526
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,696
After I bought it,
I wanted him to wear it.

527
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:43,864
It really is cute.

528
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:47,134
-But I couldn't find it.
-That sweatshirt?

529
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:50,637
You got up to say that?

530
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,339
THAT WAS A WEAK REBUTTAL

531
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:55,843
When you're shopping on Co****g,
you're supposed to check the quantity.

532
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:56,910
But I don't do that.

533
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:59,279
I once bought three big boxes
of water balloons.

534
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:01,648
I thought she was opening
an indoor playground.

535
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,617
I bought them without checking.

536
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:06,086
I bought 3,000 cotton swabs last week.

537
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:07,487
He really did.

538
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,089
Some people are like this.

539
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,558
Why not return it?
That's a lifetime supply.

540
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,595
That's true,
but it's this kind of consumption

541
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:17,464
that keeps the factories running
and the economy moving.

542
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,199
It's not just that.

543
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,969
-There's a season for everything.
-Not just clothes?

544
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:24,304
When Junbeom was less than a year old,

545
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,139
she bought him a globe.

546
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:28,041
I wanted him to broaden his horizons.

547
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:30,844
You wanted him to look beyond Seoul,
beyond Korea.

548
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,046
He couldn't even read.

549
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:36,250
Kids with globes do well in school
and have a broader perspective.

550
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:38,519
That's why I bought him a globe.

551
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,889
-But Junbeom never once spun it.
-The globe?

552
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,123
So I threw it away.

553
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,525
-You threw it away?
-Yes.

554
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,461
There's nothing wrong with buying a globe,

555
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:50,731
but I believe the best education

556
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,933
comes from real-life experiences.

557
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,937
But when we post our trips on Yo***be,

558
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,540
people always comment
that kids won't remember.

559
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,509
They say it's just a hassle
for the parents.

560
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:06,880
I don't expect my kid
to remember the trip.

561
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:11,952
I want the happy moments we share
and the looks on our faces

562
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,088
to nurture his emotional growth.

563
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,858
That's why I take him on trips.

564
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,994
I want him to experience many things.

565
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:22,663
We agree in that regard.

566
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:25,599
Even if he doesn't remember,
it's all on Yo***be.

567
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:29,570
I think he'll like it.
He'll know that we really cared about him.

568
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,672
-We're lucky to be living in this era.
-Yes.

569
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:36,810
I didn't hear about these beforehand,
so I'm a bit lost here.

570
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,445
Why did you buy these?

571
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:40,848
I heard you wanted
to bring these items today.

572
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:46,520
Yes, these are too big for Junbeom,
but I think they'd fit you perfectly.

573
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,323
-They'd look good on you.
-They're really cute.

574
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:52,025
You won't have to go shopping this year.

575
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:56,563
I think each piece of clothing
has its moment to shine.

576
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,565
This pretty blue
was meant to be worn now.

577
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,967
It's just a shame.

578
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:01,602
Why don't you try them on?

579
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,337
I'll try this one on.

580
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,105
ASPIRING CHILD MODEL

581
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,307
That's not going to fit, is it?

582
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,009
I haven't looked in the mirror yet.

583
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:11,979
-It suits you.
-That blue looks so good on you.

584
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,947
That's the trend these days.

585
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,415
You look so hip.

586
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:18,318
-I'm not sure what you mean.
-It's like a crop top.

587
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:20,721
Are you being serious or not?

588
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:25,359
You look really stylish.

589
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:27,227
You look fit.

590
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,062
Where are the Lo**s Vu***on shoes?

591
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:33,567
PUTS THE SHOES ON

592
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:35,035
You'll be on <i>Fashion News.</i>

593
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,271
-You look stylish.
-Hi, <i>Daily Fashion News.</i>

594
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:40,374
-Hi, <i>Harper's Bazaar.</i>
-That's amazing.

595
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,842
You really look fit.

596
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,777
It's like a Lo**s Vu***on event.

597
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:47,447
-Hey, I look pretty good.
-You do.

598
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:48,515
Seriously.

599
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,584
Look. He looks pretty good.

600
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,886
-Is this Junbeom's?
-You can keep it.

601
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:56,456
Thanks, Junbeom. I'm wearing your clothes.

602
00:25:56,523 --> 00:26:00,928
Today, I got my feet exfoliated,
I'm wearing nice shoes, and I got a shirt.

603
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,030
-Score.
-It must be your birthday.

604
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,932
-It must be.
-Thank you.

605
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,466
Those shoes look good on him.

606
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,002
I brought these hangers for you.

607
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:13,307
Let's see. Non-slip hangers for kids.

608
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,508
KIDS' HANGERS

609
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,076
They're for ages three and up.

610
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:19,046
-You're over three.
-I'm 38, so I can use them.

611
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:22,916
You're going to choose one recall item
from the things you've brought today.

612
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:28,155
This segment is where you give away items
to people who need them.

613
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,024
-Can you each choose an item?
-To people who need them?

614
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,727
Hold on. Let me take a look.

615
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:37,231
-I'll give away these underwear.
-They're new.

616
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:39,733
They're brand new.
The tag's still attached.

617
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,236
-I'll give away the knives.
-The knife set.

618
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:45,839
I want to give this set
to someone who lives alone.

619
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:49,543
Please leave a message
for the person who will receive it.

620
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,747
I really like this brand.

621
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:56,250
Modal fibers make up 95% of the material.

622
00:26:56,316 --> 00:27:01,021
They won't feel unpleasant down there
because I'm picky about what I wear.

623
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:04,625
I hope you have a breezy summer.

624
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,059
Thank you.

625
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:17,804
We had Hong Hyunhee and Jasson
as our guests today.

626
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:20,107
Can you tell us how it went, Jasson?

627
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:23,177
I had my reasons for my purchases,

628
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:27,080
and since the criticisms didn't bother me,
I'd say they weren't bad purchases.

629
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,284
-So I'll continue buying things.
-Thanks for sharing.

630
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,286
I think I had a real revelation today.

631
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:36,256
I bought so many things for no reason
and never gave them a second thought.

632
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:40,394
I learned that today,
so I'm leaving with a big lesson.

633
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,262
Will you change your habits?

634
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,532
It really hit me hard, so I want to.

635
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,870
This was a great chance
to re-examine my spending habits.

636
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:54,007
That really aligns
with the intent of our show,

637
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,175
so thank you so much.

638
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,377
-Great job today.
-Thank you.

639
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,213
A BIG THANKS TO THE COMEDIAN COUPLE

640
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,916
-This is Park Jihwan.
-This is actor Ro Woon.

641
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:05,152
We've got amazing guests with us today.

642
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,620
You buy a lot of used books.

643
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,822
If it's hard to find,
I'll buy a used copy.

644
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,959
Is there a particular work or author
that's memorable to you?

645
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:14,728
I suffer from literary amnesia.

646
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:16,797
How convenient.

647
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,665
These pants are too short for him.

648
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,734
They come up to here?

649
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,203
-It must be so tough for you.
-What?

650
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,771
I feel bad for you.
