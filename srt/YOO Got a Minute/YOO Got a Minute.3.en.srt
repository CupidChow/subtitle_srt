1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,337
She doesn't have that many. Maybe 30?

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,073
But 30 is a lot,
unless you work in customer service.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,474
Have you walked in my shoes?

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,142
-Did you help buy this?
-Right.

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,377
You didn't help her.

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,547
-I bought it with my own money.
-She did.

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,915
-I want one, too.
-It's so…

8
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,283
That idiot.

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,185
Would you buy it for 30,000 won?

10
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,419
No way.

11
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,426
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,464
Our guests today are a couple
who actually live together.

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,033
It's the first time we've had
a married couple join us.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,903
-Both of them are incredibly greedy.
-Right.

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,106
One of them is so greedy in so many fields

16
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,108
that she's launched a restaurant

17
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,010
and her own TV show.

18
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,713
Out of all the episodes we've done so far,
she's the biggest maximalist.

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,182
I agree. She absolutely is.

20
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,117
She brought two shopping carts.

21
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,920
But she doesn't make
unnecessary purchases.

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,822
On the other hand, the other guest is

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,926
an extreme minimalist
when it comes to actual purchases,

24
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,527
-but he hoards laughs.
-Right.

25
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,463
-You know I'm a comedy expert, right?
-Yes, I know.

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,568
He studies comedy not just from Korea,
but all over the world.

27
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,103
-That's how passionate he is about comedy.
-Right.

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,906
And he's the funniest person in the world.

29
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,509
I'm not saying he was in the past.
I'm saying he still is.

30
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,845
So let's bring out our two guests,

31
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,547
whose spending habits
are complete opposites.

32
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,682
Please come out.

33
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,718
All right. Here I come.

34
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,753
Hello.

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,856
-Hello, sir.
-What brings you here today?

36
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,024
You look really familiar. Goodness.

37
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,160
Could you introduce yourselves?

38
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,696
I think you hyped me up a bit too much.

39
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not the funniest person in the world.
Maybe I'm the ten-millionth?

40
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,636
He was just being polite.
Did you really believe him?

41
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,171
A LITTLE HURT

42
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,373
I'm your cutie, Choi Yangrak.

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,808
-Hello.
-Welcome.

44
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,976
THE ULTIMATE MINIMALIST

45
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,378
Hello, it's your queen, Pang Hyunsook.

46
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,446
Nice to meet you.

47
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,715
-It's my first time meeting you.
-That's right.

48
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,083
-We've never met.
-Right.

49
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,251
If I remember correctly,

50
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,587
my dad visited your restaurant
about ten years ago.

51
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,822
Yes, he did.

52
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,958
Your dad came
to my sundae gukbap restaurant

53
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,427
and introduced himself as your dad.

54
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,096
-Did you ask him who he was?
-No.

55
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,065
He told me all about it
and said he sent you some seaweed.

56
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,867
You're right. He did.

57
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,702
We even texted each other.

58
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,404
-You did?
-Yes.

59
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,673
-Do you really have his number?
-I do.

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,176
He's such a beautiful and amazing person.

61
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,111
I talked about this in the beginning,

62
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,014
but I'd like to ask you both
about your spending habits.

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,583
I earn my own money and spend it.

64
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,851
I buy everything I want.

65
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,653
I also throw away whatever I want.

66
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,057
So Yangrak always begs me
not to throw him out.

67
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:40,127
You'd be surprised
if you saw her spending habits.

68
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,062
She's a total impulse buyer.

69
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,032
If she sees something, she has to buy it.

70
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,402
So, have you two merged your finances?

71
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,004
I give him an allowance.
I gave you money yesterday.

72
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,173
Did you spend it all? Where did it go?

73
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,441
I have some left.

74
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,509
A WIFE OR A MOM?

75
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,577
That's why he's frugal.

76
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,846
HE CAN'T STOP LAUGHING

77
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,014
I gave him one credit card at first,

78
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,318
but he was worried he might lose it
or that it might expire.

79
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,986
So he asked for three.

80
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,423
Now he uses all three in rotation
and juggles the payments.

81
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,193
-So he's living on three credit cards?
-Yes.

82
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,261
I get an allowance too.

83
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,464
He always complains that it's not enough,
but he's quite a spender.

84
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,967
When I was young,

85
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,103
I was clueless,
and had no concept of money.

86
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,171
I'm paying for it now.

87
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,239
HIS CONFIDENCE IS GONE

88
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,306
He's right.

89
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,009
The way this works is that
we each get to defend someone.

90
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:33,046
As soon as I knew who our guests were,
I didn't need to think twice.

91
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,450
-I wanted to defend Yangrak.
-That's great.

92
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,185
-I don't know that fellow.
-Fellow?

93
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,786
A STRANGER

94
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,257
Could you introduce yourself?
He didn't know you'd be here today.

95
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,325
I've lived with Byungjae for 17 years.

96
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,460
In some ways--

97
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,530
-You lived together?
-Yes, for quite a while now. We still do.

98
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,798
We met in the army.
He was six months my senior.

99
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,100
-Six months?
-Yes.

100
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,170
-He was also my manager.
-Really?

101
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,339
Now I'm the CEO of a company
that we run together.

102
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,474
That's impressive.

103
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,643
That's impressive,
because most married couples

104
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,244
don't make it past ten years.

105
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,780
-Don't say that.
-You're better than most couples.

106
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,850
-Why don't you defend her?
-Okay.

107
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,452
And Byungjae can defend me.

108
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,924
We'll now begin You Bought What?!
and look at your spending habits.

109
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,359
Let's take a look at the items
Hyunsook brought.

110
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,895
She filled up two whole shopping carts.

111
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,198
-It's not a lot.
-This is just part of it.

112
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,034
What she brought
is just the tip of the iceberg.

113
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,468
Here are the first items.

114
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,837
These are Tiffany plates.

115
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:30,971
-They're plates.
-Yes.

116
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,975
You might wonder why we're giving her
a hard time about buying plates,

117
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,777
but there are more of these.

118
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,012
-It's a drop in the bucket.
-A drop in the bucket.

119
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,814
She has hundreds. Maybe close to 1,000.

120
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,217
I've spent hundreds of millions
on plates alone.

121
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,618
She's plate-crazy.

122
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,953
HE'S SPEECHLESS

123
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,421
I'm a crazy--

124
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,490
I wouldn't say that she's a crazy--
Maybe just a little mis-plated.

125
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,859
These are really old.

126
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,527
This is a 220-year-old plate.

127
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,595
What?

128
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,129
See? They all have history.

129
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,366
Everything on here is hand-painted.

130
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,934
-It's 220 years old.
-But--

131
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,102
It's true.

132
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,837
She thinks it's 220 years old.

133
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,808
If this were <i>Authentic Masterpieces,</i>
the experts would appraise them.

134
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,444
"The appraisal is done!"

135
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,548
"This is two years old,
not 220 years old."

136
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,616
Why would you…

137
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:20,020
Why do you have to be so annoying
and get on my nerves?

138
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,123
It's 220 years old.
The guy who sold it to me said so.

139
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,191
Really?

140
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:28,529
-This is all hand-painted and--
-But that guy has never been to England.

141
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,098
So I don't trust him.
That's all I'm saying.

142
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,100
Did they have this technique back then?

143
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,435
-No craftsman could make this.
-It's hand-painted.

144
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,671
-That design was popular in the '90s.
-Stop it!

145
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,706
But eating off plates that valuable--

146
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,109
-You can't eat off them.
-You can only look at them.

147
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,144
You can't use them.
They're only for display.

148
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,880
So it's a showpiece,
not something you put food on.

149
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,584
She looks at the plates and says,
"Buying plates makes me so happy."

150
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,854
"What took you so long to get here?"

151
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,923
She looks like a woman
whose soul has left her.

152
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,257
-She talks to them.
-Well, it's pretty.

153
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,893
-It's a bit much.
-Does that seem normal to you?

154
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,629
-You're crazy.
-She called you crazy.

155
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,567
She talks about clearing out the clutter
and living a minimalist life,

156
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,269
but it doesn't make any sense
because she keeps buying more.

157
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:13,307
In her defense, she's certified in Korean,
Chinese, Japanese, and Western cuisine.

158
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,374
I am.

159
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,376
Different dishes for different cuisines.

160
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,845
-Exactly.
-For each cuisine?

161
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,081
Yes, the plate you serve food on matters.
The plates are one thing,

162
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,584
-but these are so bad for you.
-What did he bring?

163
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,718
My goodness.

164
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,187
JUST LOOKING AT THEM MAKES HIM LAUGH

165
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,255
GLARING

166
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,023
Are you crazy? Why are you laughing?

167
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,658
-Then…
-What is this?

168
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,726
SOJU &amp; BEER

169
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:33,794
HE CAN'T RESIST IT

170
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,929
WHEN IT COMES TO BOOZE,
HE DOESN'T HOLD BACK

171
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,733
Why do you buy so much alcohol
when it's bad for you?

172
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,570
Who cares if it's good or bad for me?
It's not like I'm harming your body.

173
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,872
HE CAN'T ARGUE THAT

174
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:49,476
I'm over 60, and it's the only thing
I've bought a lot of.

175
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:53,080
He keeps booze and snacks under the bed.
It's just rotting away.

176
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,649
Why do you stash them under the bed?

177
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,653
If you buy a bottle of soju and a beer,
it costs less than 10,000 won.

178
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,388
-They're cheap.
-I know.

179
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,290
You don't make mistakes while drunk.

180
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,992
-No.
-What are you talking about?

181
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,227
You peed more than once
at someone else's house.

182
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,795
Oh, come on.

183
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,430
Holding it in is bad for you.

184
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,899
-Peeing is healthy.
-Exactly.

185
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,301
And it's not like
I ruined someone else's pants.

186
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:15,969
-I peed my pants.
-Your pants.

187
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,504
You take responsibility.

188
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,574
-It was hardly noticeable.
-So, a friend called me in the morning.

189
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,545
She asked me,
"Hyunsook, did Yangrak come home?"

190
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,182
So I responded by saying,
"I'm not sure. He comes home late."

191
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:33,220
Then she said, "I think he peed his pants
and left them in our bathroom."

192
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,155
THEY LOOK AWAY

193
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,890
That's when he was young, right?

194
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,559
-It was ten years ago.
-Young?

195
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,261
-Ten years ago? That's…
-That's pretty recent.

196
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,463
The number of carts alone

197
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,634
shows a huge difference
between the two of you.

198
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,803
I should be careful with this one.

199
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,572
OLD PAINTINGS &amp; DECOR

200
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,639
SHE LOVES ANTIQUES

201
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,741
SHE ENJOYS DECORATING
AND CHANGING THINGS UP

202
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,076
That's over 100 years old.

203
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,745
Are they all over 100 years old?
All from the last century.

204
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,081
This painting is just one of many.

205
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,549
There are about 100 at home.

206
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,684
A JAW-DROPPING FIGURE

207
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,485
Isn't this a chair?

208
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,887
Yes, it's 100 years old.

209
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,724
You seem to like old things.
Or should I say vintage?

210
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,426
My husband is old, too.

211
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,261
THEY'VE SPENT NEARLY A LIFETIME TOGETHER

212
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,530
My client just likes interior design.

213
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,933
I just want to make one point
about these paintings.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,502
If you like paintings,

215
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,005
you can hang them up
in your living room or bedroom.

216
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,073
Of course.

217
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,509
But imagine hundreds of them.

218
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,513
One piece can be a statement. But when
there are hundreds, they're not special.

219
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,115
-He knows nothing about art.
-I agree.

220
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,452
Do you leave things as they are,
or switch them up from time to time?

221
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,153
-She switches things up.
-Really?

222
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,624
It's set up like this one day,
and flipped over like this the next.

223
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,926
Or this is like this.

224
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,829
And the painting is suddenly on this side.

225
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,564
Have you lost your mind?

226
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,033
HE'S ENJOYING THE DRAMA

227
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,568
I just remembered something.

228
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:58,805
One day, someone came into the house,
lingered for a while, then rushed out.

229
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:03,043
I thought someone had broken in,
so I went outside to check.

230
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,745
And there he was, looking lost.

231
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,614
I asked him what he was doing.
He said, "This isn't our house."

232
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,883
I told him it was.
He couldn't recognize it.

233
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,953
-It's because you keep changing the decor.
-It didn't look familiar.

234
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,622
You just said you enjoy soju and beer.

235
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,723
-Yes.
-Right.

236
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,060
I heard you've got top-shelf liquor,
but you don't drink it.

237
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,763
TOP-SHELF LIQUOR
HE DOESN'T TOUCH THE EXPENSIVE LIQUOR

238
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,998
He has so much alcohol.

239
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,667
I have this at home.

240
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,502
-What's the age on this?
-It's 30 years.

241
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,772
-This is old Ballantine's whiskey.
-It's the old edition.

242
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,741
-I used to have a lot of these at home.
-Okay.

243
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,878
But they kept disappearing.
Someone smuggled them out.

244
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,280
-You didn't drink them?
-No, I didn't.

245
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,049
Listen to me, Byungjae.

246
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,150
That's Ryugyu.

247
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:45,052
-That's not Byungjae.
-I'm Ryugyu.

248
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,954
-Ryugyu.
-Just call him "mister."

249
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,021
-Mister.
-Yes?

250
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,890
We've been married for 37 years.

251
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:54,394
I've been a hardworking wife,
and yet he accuses me of smuggling assets.

252
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,629
It's just ridiculous.

253
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,197
-Not assets. Alcohol.
-Alcohol.

254
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,265
I did smuggle those.

255
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,034
-I told you.
-Then he was right.

256
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,370
-It's better than ruining your health.
-I'm sick of it.

257
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,438
-Of course.
-Right?

258
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:08,408
I've also given away some of Byungjae's
because I wanted him to live longer.

259
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,010
He took a bottle of Ballentine's.

260
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,981
He gave it to a lawyer who helped him
with a hit-and-run accident.

261
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,782
-Good job.
-I don't drink.

262
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,651
I don't either.

263
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,420
It's not like
she's always taking his alcohol.

264
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,790
She supported his hobby
by giving him this gift.

265
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,692
SCANNING

266
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,061
-I never bought that.
-She bought it for you.

267
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,830
I bought it for you, you dummy.

268
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,499
-I see.
-He abandoned it on the balcony.

269
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,968
Look at this. You'll want this, Byungjae.

270
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,037
You can store top-shelf liquor in here.

271
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,105
DOUBLE FOLD-OUT

272
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,240
TRIPLE FOLD-OUT

273
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,677
Yangrak saw this earlier
and asked me whose this was.

274
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,679
-Do you use this?
-No, I don't.

275
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,947
So you got it as a gift.

276
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,549
Why did you give it to him?

277
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,919
You can take the glasses out
and take the bottle out like this.

278
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,053
-Hold this.
-Okay.

279
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,689
"Let's have a drink, Mr. Choi."

280
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,357
Then you pour the drink.

281
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,626
Don't stay out too late, you crazy man.

282
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,495
-Crazy…
-Pour me a glass.

283
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,230
-To your health.
-Let me pour you one.

284
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:04,431
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

285
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,832
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

286
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,302
I hope your YouTube channel does well.

287
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,771
-It's actually on Disney+.
-That's right.

288
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,840
Don't die on us, Disney+.

289
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:13,907
What the heck?

290
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,810
THANK YOU…

291
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,012
-Good luck, Disney!
-Good luck!

292
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,948
With all this soju, beer,

293
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,317
untouched Ballantine's,
and that thing he forgot about,

294
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,452
you can tell Yangrak doesn't spend money.

295
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,223
But when he does, it upsets his partner.

296
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,025
-Here's one that's truly upsetting.
-What?

297
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,395
-Byungjae doesn't get it.
-I just don't understand

298
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,297
-why you bought these.
-Oh, those.

299
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,832
Right, the phones!

300
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,501
PHONES ARE THOUGHT TO BRING GOOD NEWS

301
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,670
Compared to the other items,
there aren't many of those.

302
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,540
She doesn't have that many. Maybe 30?

303
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,409
I used to have a lot more.
I had around 40.

304
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,812
-She's very superstitious.
-I see.

305
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,448
-She thinks they'll bring good news.
-Just throw some out.

306
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,717
-She's hoping for good news to ring in.
-Right.

307
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,053
She puts them everywhere.
She's really superstitious.

308
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,123
-I'm not superstitious.
-Why do we need that many?

309
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,660
I've had so many restaurant failures,
it's left me anxious.

310
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,329
Did you receive any good news
after buying these?

311
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,664
-Of course.
-So much!

312
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,399
That's how I found huge success.

313
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:16,103
But 30 is a lot,
unless you work in customer service.

314
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,671
Have you walked in my shoes?

315
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,473
-Did you help buy this?
-Right.

316
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,707
You didn't help her.

317
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,744
-I bought it with my own money.
-She did.

318
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,647
Apart from the superstition
that phones bring good news,

319
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,249
do you believe in any other superstitions?

320
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:34,388
I felt something in my pillow,
and when I checked, I found a talisman.

321
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,822
Really?

322
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,625
-Why stick that in a pillow?
-I put them in his underwear, too.

323
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,695
I'm supposed to be on his side,
but I'm also superstitious.

324
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,464
-You know why we do that?
-I keep one in my pillow, too.

325
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,135
Even though she doesn't use these,
they all hold sentimental value.

326
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:53,207
But Yangrak has things he doesn't use.
He just hoards them.

327
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,809
HERE IT IS

328
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,245
What's all this?
Aren't these all underwear?

329
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,982
-These are underwear.
-They're all brand new.

330
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:05,018
What's wrong with buying underwear?
Shouldn't he wear them?

331
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,387
-He should wear them.
-He doesn't, though.

332
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,224
-What?
-What do you mean?

333
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,059
He's only wearing pants now.

334
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,061
He's wearing white pants,
so that's a little…

335
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,696
You can see everything.

336
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,164
I'm wearing white underwear.

337
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:18,699
These…

338
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,802
-She bought all of these.
-I see.

339
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,037
See? He doesn't buy anything.

340
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,506
I don't wear these.

341
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,642
-These are old-fashioned.
-He likes the one with sleeves.

342
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,811
-She just buys these.
-He prefers short sleeves.

343
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,813
So I have about 20 or 30 of these.

344
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,251
-She buys them without asking you.
-Yes, and these are uncomfortable.

345
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,353
-You like the baggy ones.
-I like boxers.

346
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,854
-They're more breathable.
-Yes.

347
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,222
But these are sexy.

348
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,357
-What?
-They're sexy.

349
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,027
Who am I trying to look sexy for?
My goodness.

350
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,962
You're going to get me in trouble.

351
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,533
If anyone watching wants these,
feel free to take them.

352
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,468
-Are these all brand new?
-They are.

353
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,270
-I think he wore this once.
-Really?

354
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,838
Then that might be a little…

355
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:58,906
Hey!

356
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,874
That one looks a little worn.

357
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,143
She just tosses them. She says they smell.

358
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,611
ONE SNIFF AND IT'S GONE

359
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,246
SHE THROWS AWAY WHAT SHE WANTS

360
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,948
She's so sensitive to smells.

361
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,716
I come out fresh from the shower,

362
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,386
and she tells me to change
because I smell.

363
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,354
-I'm sure you shower often.
-I do.

364
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,290
She buys them for him,
but he won't wear them.

365
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,357
He won't.

366
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,259
I think it could be hurtful, though.

367
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,362
People tease me for being short and ugly,

368
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,931
but being called smelly--

369
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,700
-It's insulting.
-It's humiliating.

370
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,837
-It even ends badly in <i>Parasite</i>.
-That's right.

371
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,873
Do people call you short and ugly?

372
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,942
They were just joking around.

373
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,243
I don't think they were.

374
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,311
THAT'S NOT A JOKE

375
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,112
You took it as a joke, didn't you?

376
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,149
You tried to point out that
he never wears what she buys him.

377
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,585
But there's an item here
that you never use.

378
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,987
What is it? She only has meaningful items.

379
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,456
Price-wise, this is…

380
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,592
-That's meaningful.
-It's like <i>Authentic Masterpieces.</i>

381
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,993
I don't know the exact price,

382
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,263
but this might be the most expensive item
we've seen today.

383
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,131
-It's a luxury clock.
-A wall clock.

384
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,401
When you think of luxury timepieces,
you picture a wristwatch.

385
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,470
Is there such a thing as luxury clocks?

386
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,639
It reminds me of the old pendulum clocks.

387
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,907
-Gong, gong.
-Gong, gong.

388
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,442
-Chong Kun Dang.
-The big one.

389
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,210
They were a household symbol here,

390
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:13,146
but people overseas
also place great importance on clocks.

391
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,451
I grew to like clocks
because it reminds me that time is money.

392
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:20,988
-Everything I own is meaningful.
-It reminds her to use her time wisely.

393
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,623
She has a lot more at home.

394
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,658
-You have more?
-A lot more!

395
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,094
-This is over 100 years old.
-I think you're right.

396
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,230
I've had it for over 30 years myself.

397
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,934
You said you bought all these clocks
because time is money.

398
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,603
And we've been talking about this
for about a minute.

399
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,838
But it hasn't moved.

400
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:41,341
Yangrak didn't wind it. That's his job.

401
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,876
So, it's broken?

402
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,178
Why didn't you wind it?

403
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,513
It's accurate twice a day.

404
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,982
IT'S RIGHT TWICE A DAY

405
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,985
It feels unfair to be attacked like this
over a single clock.

406
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,921
Everything he owns is junk.

407
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,255
These are wristwatches.

408
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,957
MID-RANGE WATCHES

409
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,359
-They're all mid-range.
-Yes, I can tell.

410
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,161
This one's about 20,000 won.

411
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,096
It's not a big deal if I lose it.

412
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:07,000
This is an Orient watch.
It's about 40,000 or 50,000 won.

413
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:12,172
"Courtesy of Orient, it's 10:00 p.m.
I mean, it's 11:00 p.m."

414
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,440
It's that Orient watch.

415
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,108
You say you don't spend much,

416
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,377
yet you've bought so many
and only wear one.

417
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,613
-Kyuhyun--
-It's Ryugyu.

418
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,749
-Super Junior.
-Kyuhyun's a member of Super Junior.

419
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,752
I bought him a nice watch,
but he lost it when he got drunk.

420
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,288
She bought me a luxury watch.
It's at home.

421
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,556
Why don't you wear it?

422
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:30,858
I just don't wear it.

423
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,793
-I know what you mean.
-Right?

424
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,361
All of these combined…

425
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,831
-They aren't worth one of her plates.
-Exactly, her plates are expensive.

426
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:38,899
GOLD RING

427
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,868
You suddenly bought a gold ring?

428
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,135
Did you buy this on your own?

429
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,238
-I did.
-That's unexpected.

430
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,473
I bought this while I was still drunk.

431
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,742
You bought it while drunk?

432
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,410
I don't know why I bought it.

433
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,379
-When did you buy it?
-A long time ago.

434
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,548
It was 10 or 20 years ago.

435
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:59,920
So, to sum it up,
you bought this for yourself while drunk.

436
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,389
I bought it for myself, not for my wife.

437
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,558
-It was for me.
-He only bought one.

438
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,226
-You didn't buy two?
-No.

439
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,761
-It was for you?
-Yes.

440
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:12,199
-If you love your wife--
-She buys better things for herself.

441
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,401
-She buys her own things.
-She doesn't need me.

442
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,171
-I saved up my allowance for this.
-When a man buys a ring,

443
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,173
he should buy one for his wife.

444
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,674
It's just so inconsiderate.

445
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:21,942
This one I can justify.

446
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,211
You may have been drunk
when you bought this,

447
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,046
but it was a great purchase.

448
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,881
-It's been over ten years.
-It has.

449
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:31,351
We did a little research,
and gold prices have tripled since then.

450
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,253
Exactly. It was a smart decision.

451
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,622
It costs more
to strip gold off the plating.

452
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:36,890
This one's 18 karat.

453
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,692
-It is?
-It's not pure gold.

454
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,527
Of all the things we've seen today,

455
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:44,731
I really wonder why you bought these.

456
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,700
These are a real mystery.

457
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,802
It's so heavy.

458
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,471
-They're rocks.
-They're rocks.

459
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,976
I just brought a few decorative rocks
to show you guys.

460
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,244
She has dozens of them.

461
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,246
She was so obsessed
that she went to China.

462
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,548
-What…
-I took out a loan

463
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,151
-and spent over a hundred million.
-A hundred million?

464
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,519
I bought so many.

465
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,189
I bought statues of a mother and child,
a lion, a tiger,

466
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,757
and even a seven-story pagoda.

467
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,426
-A pagoda?
-Yes, seven stories tall.

468
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,727
Where do you put those?

469
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:17,664
She took out a loan,
bought some land, and moved it there.

470
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:21,535
-But it all got stolen.
-Except for the pagoda.

471
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,237
You bought land to put rocks on it?

472
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,972
-She did!
-And someone stole them?

473
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,940
They loaded them up at night
and stole them.

474
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,408
They're too heavy to carry.

475
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,744
-The big rocks?
-You need a large crane.

476
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:31,979
They must've had one.

477
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,648
They did it so openly, crane and all,

478
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:37,551
that the neighbors just assumed
the owner was taking it.

479
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,685
"They're moving it."

480
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,521
-Right.
-They just picked it up.

481
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,923
-They didn't try to hide it.
-"Turn left, Mr. Kim."

482
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,991
Exactly.

483
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,227
When she was into rocks,
I thought she'd lost her marbles.

484
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,196
Great wordplay.

485
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:50,964
-I have my reasons, Ryugyu.
-Okay.

486
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,034
I bought them because I was lonely.

487
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:58,071
When my business kept failing,
everyone started to avoid me.

488
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,874
I had no one to rely on, and it was tough.

489
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,643
Then one day, I was walking

490
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:06,246
and saw a tiger and a lion
carved in stone.

491
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,748
It felt like they'd protect me.

492
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,483
See? Another superstition.

493
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:14,955
-Ryugyu, I know you're on her side.
-Yes.

494
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:20,527
But have you met anyone
who went to China to buy rocks?

495
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,196
I haven't.

496
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,430
Really?

497
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,766
-Yes, but I understand.
-Call her out on it.

498
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,900
You understand her?

499
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,103
I do. She invests in things
that don't change.

500
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,006
That's right.
My kids would love to have this.

501
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,308
-No, they wouldn't.
-No?

502
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,277
They say they don't understand her.

503
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,781
-Would you buy it for 30,000 won?
-No way.

504
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,516
-There's no place to put it.
-Hey!

505
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,650
It's your loss!

506
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:47,087
When you lay them out,
they just look so grand.

507
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,722
That's why I collect them.

508
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,257
-I want one, too.
-It's so…

509
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,359
That idiot wants to buy a rock.

510
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,827
HE'S ABOUT TO GO STONE-CRAZY

511
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:56,630
-You can get it shipped.
-He got sucked in.

512
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,566
Since he doesn't spend that much,
it looks like you're all done.

513
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,634
We're not done.

514
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,104
This was unexpected,
because I thought he only had alcohol.

515
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,106
It turns out, he has a hobby.

516
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,174
Hanwha.

517
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,242
BASEBALL MERCH

518
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,110
BASEBALL IS THE ONLY HOBBY HE HAS

519
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:13,180
-I have a lot more at home.
-He has a lot.

520
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,982
-Really?
-I also have baseballs.

521
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,283
Seungkyun, this is--

522
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,185
-Seungkyun?
-Just let it go.

523
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,554
-But that's not your name.
-It's fine.

524
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,956
-It's not even close.
-You didn't get one letter right.

525
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,391
I don't even know who that is.

526
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,093
-It doesn't bother me.
-Daesung.

527
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,895
-Daesung?
-Daesung?

528
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:33,367
Let me just say this.
Yangrak wears these jerseys every day.

529
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,235
Even when there's no game?

530
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,770
-Yes.
-I see.

531
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,338
He must love the Hanwha Eagles.

532
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,141
You spend so much money
when you go to a baseball game.

533
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,510
-You have to buy food and alcohol.
-Right.

534
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,412
Do you spend money at the stadium?

535
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,181
Of course, that's part of the fun.

536
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,484
-You drink some beer.
-You know why baseball is fun?

537
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:55,355
If people watched the game in silence,
it'd be really boring.

538
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,424
<i>-I'm happy</i>
-But everyone cheers together.

539
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:58,659
<i>I'm happy</i>

540
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,228
-You chant that with strangers.
-Of course.

541
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:05,098
If your team loses 13 times,
there's nothing to be happy about.

542
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:08,836
Then the tears roll down your cheeks.
That video went viral.

543
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:11,171
And most importantly,

544
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,907
-you can legally drink there.
-While you watch the game.

545
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,543
You can enjoy a can of beer.

546
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,611
It's so wholesome.

547
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:21,515
Eating good food
while watching the Eagles play.

548
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:24,685
Does he go there to eat,
or enjoy the game?

549
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,720
You're so narrow-minded.

550
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,855
HE'S NARROW-MINDED

551
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,456
You eat and have fun.

552
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,158
-What could be better than that?
-Right?

553
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,960
How do you watch the game at home?

554
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:36,330
I watch it in the living room.

555
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,600
Today was an exception,
but we usually have different schedules.

556
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,503
-She has to wake up early for work.
-I'm very busy.

557
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,605
-He doesn't work.
-So I lower the volume.

558
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,040
I watch the game in silence.
When there's a home run…

559
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,676
SILENT CHEER

560
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,212
I have to go out and earn money.

561
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,147
I try not to wake her up.

562
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,520
When it comes to Yangrak,
he's well-known for his hairstyle.

563
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,589
-I heard you dye your hair yourself.
-This is seriously…

564
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,059
These only cost 1,000 won each.
All of these add up to 10,000 won.

565
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,595
-It's sad we have to talk about this.
-I feel bad for myself.

566
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,397
-This is so sad.
-I know.

567
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:14,434
-And this hair dye isn't expensive.
-It's not.

568
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,703
-This is…
-It's a good deal for the price.

569
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,673
-It must be hard to maintain long hair.
-It's hard.

570
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,642
-She has to blow-dry it.
-What?

571
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,744
-You do it for him?
-I can't go to the salon every day.

572
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,811
I dry it for him,

573
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:29,016
-but he has curly hair.
-She's not gentle when she dries my hair.

574
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,118
She'll snap at me and say, "Stay still."

575
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:34,021
You can hear the irritation in her voice.

576
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,457
Let me show you what happens
when I blow-dry his hair.

577
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,994
He always holds his head up.
So I say, "Lean forward, darn it."

578
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,030
Use Yangrak as an example, not me.

579
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,332
-Sit down.
-It's okay.

580
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,667
Do it to both of them.

581
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:51,071
I heard something about Yangrak
that made me laugh so hard.

582
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:54,308
When women get a bad haircut,
they say they look like Yangrak.

583
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,843
I heard that bothers you.

584
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,846
When they get a bob
and they like how it turned out,

585
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,547
they say they look like Go Joonhee.

586
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,382
If it turns out ugly, they look like me.

587
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,751
Hearing that really took
the wind out of my sails.

588
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:07,054
-He has a quote.
-They're the ugly ones.

589
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,622
Why do they say that about me?

590
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:12,226
Go Joonhee invited me
to be on her first YouTube episode.

591
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,293
I saw that.

592
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,429
It was so awkward.

593
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,664
I've never even seen her before.

594
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,266
-You've never crossed paths.
-Right.

595
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,968
You shouldn't have said that.

596
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:22,536
I'm a fan of hers.

597
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,771
How should we edit this?

598
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:29,343
We had Choi Yangrak and Pang Hyunsook
on our show today.

599
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,112
To be honest,
it was fun chatting with you both,

600
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,014
but it felt like a landslide victory.

601
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:37,384
-I almost teared up a few times.
-Me too.

602
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:40,587
Why would you tear up?
He consumed all his purchases.

603
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,656
You had too many useless items.

604
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,191
Why did you feel like crying?

605
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,659
Why did you, Ryugyu?

606
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:49,196
It was so touching
that each item had a story.

607
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,864
You're so sweet.

608
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,199
What did you call me?

609
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,534
-Ryugyu.
-Right.

610
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,436
-I'm honored.
-I'm glad you finally got it right.

611
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:59,740
-You called him Seungkyun and Daesung.
-She called me Daesung.

612
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:04,211
Out of all the items you brought today,
you can pick one recall item.

613
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:07,648
-And you'll be sending it off for good.
-Really?

614
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:11,952
One lucky viewer will win it
in our drawing.

615
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,522
Let's hear what each of you chose.
You can go first, Hyunsook.

616
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,525
Since I have so many rocks,
I want to give one of them away.

617
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:19,793
-Really?
-A rock.

618
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,764
If you like decorative rocks,
I'm sure you'll love it.

619
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,898
How about you?

620
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,669
-All his items are cheap.
-I'll give away the stuff I don't wear.

621
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:32,072
I'll give you the underwear set,
top and bottom.

622
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,141
Those are brand new.

623
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,143
Just take your pick.

624
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,346
-He threw away the ones he wore.
-Yes, he did.

625
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,647
-This is new.
-It is.

626
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:44,151
This is really meaningful
because it's worth the most.

627
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:45,752
It's the most expensive item.

628
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,820
MOST EXPENSIVE ITEM

629
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:49,523
-All he has is soju and beer.
-I can't give those away.

630
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:57,364
Could you please leave a message

631
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:00,067
for the lucky viewers
who will receive these items?

632
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,735
You can tell them how to use it.

633
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:06,807
I hope this goes to someone
who feels lonely and empty inside

634
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:09,009
because I've been there, too.

635
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:12,279
The moment you receive this,
good luck will come your way.

636
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,281
Excellent. Please put it down.

637
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,184
Please hold up your underwear
and leave a message.

638
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,352
Send them a message.

639
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:22,256
I can't exactly tell them
to wear this for good luck.

640
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:25,092
You can wear this
when you're doing chores.

641
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:30,030
You can also wear this
when you're relaxing at home.

642
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:33,934
But if you really don't like it,
you can use it as a dishcloth or a rag.

643
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:36,203
It's totally up to you.

644
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,172
-They can use it freely.
-That's right.

645
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:41,375
And just in case,
you might want to boil it first.

646
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:46,046
Thank you so much
for coming on our show today.

647
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:48,815
-It was an honor to have you.
-Did you have fun?

648
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,551
-We did.
-I truly mean it.

649
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,686
How was it for you today?

650
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:58,759
I'm personally a big fan of Byungjae.

651
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,429
-He's so genuine and hardworking.
-He's very nice.

652
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:03,830
So I came without hesitation.

653
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,567
I hope this show has
a long and successful run

654
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:10,904
and wins the hearts of audiences
all around the world.

655
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:14,107
I decided to come on this show

656
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:18,212
because I truly believe
it will spark worldwide attention.

657
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,582
Please send them lots of love
and give them your support.

658
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,250
-Let's cheer them on.
-Thank you.

659
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,651
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

660
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:27,120
A BIG THANK-YOU
TO THE TWO FUNNIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

661
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:31,258
This is the first time
we've filmed so much physical contact.

662
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,927
Hello, I'm Hong Seokcheon,
the king of touch.

663
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:34,995
I'm Ahn Jaehyeon,

664
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:37,297
the man who's been touched
by the king of touch.

665
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:41,001
In the winter,
this is all you need for a party or event.

666
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,169
-It works?
-It's over.

667
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:43,804
Make way for Hong Seokcheon.

668
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,973
-Goodness.
-There we go.

669
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,674
That's it.

670
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,944
They cost about 50,000 to 70,000 won each.

671
