1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,504
Hello.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,507
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,110
Many of us have had that awkward moment

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,580
when a funny thought pops into our head
during a serious situation.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:18,252
When that happens,
I try my best to think of something sad.

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,921
Our guests today
may find themselves doing the same,

7
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,724
replaying their saddest memories
like a highlight reel.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,528
Let's welcome our guests quietly.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,099
-Go.
-Hello.

10
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,634
All right.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,902
It feels…

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,103
A bit strange.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,938
It's like entering a haunted house.

14
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,039
Yeah.

15
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,309
-This is cool.
-What is this?

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,580
This is really cool.

17
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,883
We have to keep it together
and get through the interview.

18
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,890
-Come on.
-I'm not going to laugh.

19
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:57,958
Is this it?

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,560
-The curtain…
-This way.

21
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,128
It's this curtain.

22
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,729
-Here?
-Yes.

23
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,967
-Welcome.
-Hello.

24
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,436
Thank you so much for coming all this way.

25
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,539
I think we met on
<i>Omniscient Interfering View, </i>Dujun.

26
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,707
Yes, we did.

27
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,677
-And it's our first time meeting, Yoseop.
-Yes, it is.

28
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,380
Despite both of us having long careers,

29
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,084
this is our first time meeting in person.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,022
First, let me explain the rules
of The Quiet Interview.

31
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,824
It's simple. You can't laugh.

32
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,425
Laughter is detected…

33
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:14,768
Laughter is detected
by these cameras you see in front of us.

34
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,671
They're equipped with advanced AI features

35
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:22,442
that analyze your facial expressions
in real time.

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:27,548
So if either of you even cracks a smile,
you'll hear a warning sound.

37
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,685
It also shows up on this display panel.

38
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:37,057
And if you fully burst out laughing,
a much louder siren will go off.

39
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,035
If you hear that siren go off,

40
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,439
you'll be sent to the Quiet Room
for a period of time.

41
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,907
Before we begin,

42
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,476
please introduce yourselves
to the viewers.

43
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,744
Hello.

44
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,981
I'm Yoon Dujun of Highlight.
It's great to be here.

45
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,587
Hello, I'm Yang Yoseop,
the main vocalist of Highlight.

46
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,122
-Welcome.
-Nice to meet you.

47
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,159
Do you want to say something?
You raised your hand.

48
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,727
-You're so cute.
-So cute.

49
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,763
Can I bring my friend?

50
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,799
You want to bring your friend?

51
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,867
Yes.

52
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,702
Do you want to go get them?

53
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,007
You need to answer me.

54
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,978
The boy stepped outside for a moment.

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:35,582
Let's continue with the interview.

56
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,452
Were you born in 1990, Yoseop?

57
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,387
-Yes.
-So you were born in 1990.

58
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,956
-Were you born in early 1989, Dujun?
-In 1989.

59
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,491
-No.
-I'm early '90.

60
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,093
-So you two are friends?
-Yes.

61
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,730
Even though we're a few years apart,
we're all around the same age.

62
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,765
So I'm sure you've thought about this too.

63
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,968
There's a trend where people ask ChatGPT
whether they're a young man

64
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,803
-or a middle-aged man.
-I see.

65
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,605
-Have you tried it?
-Yes, we have.

66
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,806
What did it say?

67
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,943
-I've gotten both answers.
-Really?

68
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,546
-Yoseop always gets young man.
-I see.

69
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,814
Was it the paid version of ChatGPT?

70
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,916
Yes, it was.

71
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,553
-We're using a really expensive version.
-Really?

72
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,790
Can we ask whether you guys
are young men or middle-aged men?

73
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,991
-Sure.
-Yes.

74
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,029
Is Yang Yoseop a young man
or a middle-aged man?

75
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,699
<i>Yang Yoseop is clearly a young man.</i>

76
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,334
<i>He looks super young,</i>

77
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,705
<i>and his voice and mannerisms are</i>
<i>far too youthful for a middle-aged man.</i>

78
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,576
Yes, it definitely says
you're a young man, Yoseop.

79
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,111
I'm sure Dujun will get the same answer.

80
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,814
-Shall we try?
-Can you ask it about me?

81
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,651
Is Yoon Dujun a young man
or a middle-aged man?

82
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,822
<i>You mean the guy who pretty much invented</i>
<i>the boyfriend look?</i>

83
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,694
<i>It's hard to call him a young man</i>
<i>since he's weathered some years,</i>

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,898
<i>but he's still hanging onto his youth</i>
<i>with all his might.</i>

85
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,801
It answers with such detail.

86
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,136
We're using a very expensive version.

87
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:07,074
I think I'm definitely a middle-aged man,
but I'll ask anyway.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,141
Okay.

89
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,912
Is Yoo Byungjae a young man
or a middle-aged man?

90
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,949
<i>Of course he's a young man.</i>

91
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:21,288
<i>You might think he's a middle-aged man</i>
<i>because he acts silly on TV.</i>

92
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:24,958
<i>In real life,</i>
<i>he's not as short as he looks on TV,</i>

93
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:29,530
<i>and some say he looks handsome</i>
<i>and kind of sexy in person.</i>

94
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,033
<i>Got it? Yoo Byungjae is…</i>

95
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,369
<i>How am I a middle-aged man?</i>

96
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,639
<i>Sh*t, how am I a middle-aged man?</i>

97
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,141
<i>Come on, say something, you piece of sh*t.</i>

98
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,810
<i>I'm not a f*cking middle-aged man.</i>

99
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,914
That's interesting.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,448
It says I'm a young man.

101
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,859
-You…
-The siren went off.

102
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,228
You laughed, Dujun.

103
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,498
Please enter the Quiet Room.

104
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,042
I asked this earlier, but am I…

105
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,611
Hi, kid. You're back. Is that your friend?

106
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,580
Your friend is a L*b*bu.

107
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,848
That's so cute.

108
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,484
To be honest,

109
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,920
I had the kid leave
because there was swearing.

110
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,090
We can't have the kid hear that.

111
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,060
I heard you don't play games,
and you just work out.

112
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,331
Are you trying to slim down,
or are you just weight training?

113
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,066
It depends on the time of the year.

114
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,870
When we're preparing for a comeback,

115
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,273
I mostly do diet-focused workouts.

116
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,976
Normally, I do weight…

117
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,549
training…

118
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,186
-Weight training?
-I enjoy it.

119
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,557
Also, I've always been
on the smaller side.

120
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,526
-In terms of height?
-That too.

121
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,793
How tall are you?

122
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,495
I'm 5 foot 5.

123
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:09,830
That's not small!

124
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,899
BYUNGJAE IS 5 FOOT 3

125
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,672
Your time is up, so you may come back.

126
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,474
Let's bring him back and continue.

127
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:28,815
When this airs, it'll be the holidays,
right around Christmas.

128
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,554
I think that's why Santa's gambling
and placing a few bets.

129
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,256
There's something interesting about Dujun.

130
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:40,027
If you look up "Highlight Yoon Dujun,"
you see images of him as an artist.

131
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:44,231
But if you search "Yoon Dujun Highlight,"
you get clips of him playing soccer.

132
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,468
There's even a compilation of his goals,
and it's racked up quite a few views.

133
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,770
How long has it been?

134
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:54,141
I've been playing soccer
since elementary school, so it's been…

135
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,843
It's been almost 30 years.

136
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,813
I heard you're a fan of "FBa."

137
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,615
What?

138
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,983
-FC Barcelona.
-Oh!

139
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,485
I don't know soccer well.

140
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,787
-Yes, FC…
-Soccer…

141
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,490
I know the famous players
like Lionel Messi.

142
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,025
He's a Barcelona legend.

143
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,895
He's a legendary player for Barcelona.

144
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,531
And players like Iniesta and Xavi

145
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,469
are all truly legendary players
for "Barcel United."

146
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,839
-Who's your favorite player?
-Lionel Messi.

147
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,515
He's called the GO-AT for a reason.

148
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,918
Yes, he's the GOAT.

149
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,853
-Huh?
-What?

150
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,788
-GO-AT.
-GO-AT.

151
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,190
"Greatest Of All Time."

152
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,725
-Yes, GOAT.
-GO-AT.

153
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,926
-Now…
-GOAT.

154
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,296
He said Lionel Messi,

155
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,299
the GO-AT of "Baruda K*m S*nsaeng,"
is his favorite player.

156
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,003
I'm curious about
how celebrities rank in soccer.

157
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,805
What tier are you in among celebrities?

158
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,575
-Be honest.
-Maybe tier two?

159
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,177
-Really?
-Yes, tier two.

160
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,845
Here's what I want to know.

161
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,981
Forget the celebrity rankings
for a second.

162
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,451
What if you competed against
a retired professional player?

163
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:15,689
For example, Hwangbo Kwan,
the "Cannon Shooter," at his current age?

164
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,524
-No chance.
-Really?

165
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,860
-Are you being humble?
-It's the truth.

166
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,094
-Really?
-It's a fact.

167
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:27,134
What about a recently retired
Premier League player

168
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:30,838
who arrived in Korea yesterday
with a fancy pedicure?

169
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,773
How do you think that would turn out?

170
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,709
-He doesn't want to ruin that pedicure?
-He probably wouldn't.

171
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,010
There's still no chance.

172
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,179
-Still no chance?
-No.

173
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,783
What about a retired pro
who had ingrown toenail surgery yesterday

174
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,785
and can't move freely?

175
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,120
-If it's ingrown toenail surgery…
-That's…

176
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,058
If it were a major surgery,
he probably wouldn't even be able to walk.

177
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,659
We actually prepared something.

178
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,395
Could you show us
some simple juggling skills?

179
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,931
I can, but I'm wearing dress shoes.

180
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,033
-We prepared cleats too.
-Right.

181
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,835
Can you bring us a ball?

182
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,608
Is there a particular trick
you want to see?

183
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,310
-You could juggle the ball.
-Juggle?

184
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,647
-It's actually quite simple.
-You're good.

185
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,715
Yes.

186
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,885
I can also lift the ball like this.

187
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,654
-You almost had it.
-It's supposed to go like this.

188
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,527
-Great. I mentioned this earlier…
-Yes?

189
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,696
…but it turns out that
our director is a retired pro

190
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,765
who had an ingrown toenail
removed yesterday.

191
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,801
Let's bring him out.
You said you could beat him earlier.

192
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,537
Are you okay?

193
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,704
Hello.

194
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,641
Here's the ball.

195
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,377
He had surgery yesterday.

196
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,445
-Should I start?
-Yes.

197
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,714
I bet he's really good.

198
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,186
Darn it.

199
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,542
Siuuu!

200
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:21,982
Thank you.

201
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,120
All right, Dujun.

202
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,623
Please enter the Quiet Room.

203
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,561
Where did he learn how to do that?

204
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,863
Is he a director?

205
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:36,930
Yes, he is.

206
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,700
He's a former pro
who had toenail surgery yesterday.

207
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,168
Ingrown toenail.

208
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,036
Did someone just hiccup?

209
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,809
If soccer is something
Dujun truly loves and excels at,

210
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,811
I heard you really love books.

211
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,579
Yes, I do.

212
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:56,750
Is there a genre you prefer?
Like novels, essays, or self-help?

213
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,953
-I used to like self-help books.
-I see.

214
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,156
Fans even ask you
for book recommendations all the time.

215
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,259
Is there one you could recommend for us?

216
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,794
I'm an avid reader myself.

217
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,565
-Well…
-Yes?

218
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,401
-There's Schopenhauer.
-Schopenhauer.

219
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,471
<i>Why Shouldn't Your Life Be Difficult?</i>

220
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:21,441
-He sounds a bit cold.
-He's known for being pessimistic.

221
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,579
When Schopenhauer made the nuclear bomb,

222
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,682
he probably had no idea
it'd be used like that.

223
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,685
He was just doing his best as a scientist.

224
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,854
You mean the one on the Manhattan Project?

225
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,791
Yes, I heard Schopenhauer
was greatly shocked.

226
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,693
Since you were coming today,

227
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,696
I brought my favorite book
to recommend to you.

228
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,631
Thank you. What an honor.

229
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,068
This is a really rare book. Take a look.

230
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,306
<i>-Musoyu.</i>
-It's a first edition.

231
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,275
Check the price on the back.

232
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:58,412
Was it 280 won?

233
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,614
Yes, it's a first edition of <i>Musoyu.</i>

234
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:04,852
"By letting go of ownership,
you discover true value."

235
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:09,389
Following those wise words,
I bought this for one million won.

236
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:17,064
Someone listed it for that price,
so I bought it, and now I own it.

237
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,266
Can I really keep it?

238
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,834
I'm not giving it to you.

239
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,338
I just wanted to show you.

240
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:28,542
I've been wanting to recommend it to you.

241
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,278
Your time's up,
so you can come back, Dujun.

242
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,346
Please give it back.

243
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,881
It's mine.

244
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:43,757
You might be tired of hearing this,
but you're known for your tiny face.

245
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,828
-Many people envy that about you.
-Right.

246
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,598
As you can see,
I have a small face for a celebrity…

247
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,666
No, wait.

248
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,939
As you can see,
I don't have a big face for a celebrity.

249
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,207
I'm a bit…

250
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,275
No, that's not it.

251
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,646
As you can see, I also have a face.

252
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,749
We prepared a segment
to compare the size of our faces.

253
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,150
-Is that okay?
-Yes.

254
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,754
People use all sorts of props
to compare face sizes.

255
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,957
I heard you can cover your face
with a single square of tissue.

256
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,926
I don't know about this.

257
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,562
This is plenty for your eyes, nose,
and mouth. See?

258
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,264
It covers all your facial features.

259
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,200
Your face is so small.

260
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,204
-As I said, I'm also…
-Right.

261
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,509
I'm also a celebrity.

262
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,579
-See?
-Your face is smaller than mine.

263
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,180
Whichever way I put it,

264
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,716
-there's still space left.
-There's space.

265
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,019
Celebrities are on another level.

266
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,255
Think of them as otherworldly beings.

267
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:51,291
They're like celestial dragons.

268
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,294
I saw you try this before.

269
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,730
A can of tuna can cover your face.

270
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:59,633
I don't think this one worked.

271
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,869
-But your whole face is covered.
-It is.

272
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,637
Hold it farther from your face.

273
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:04,872
-Like this?
-Yes.

274
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,274
How can it be covered by a tuna can?

275
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,276
-That's amazing.
-But I'm also…

276
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,211
Oh, my gosh.

277
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,946
I'm also a celebrity.

278
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,351
Your face is smaller.

279
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,219
-As I said…
-It covers your head.

280
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,754
It covers my whole head.

281
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:23,724
Celebrities have different
bone structures.

282
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,226
Let me just make that clear.

283
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:32,533
We'll move on to the next question now.

284
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,801
Just a moment, Byungjae. Sorry.

285
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,274
-Let's take a break.
-Okay.

286
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,109
We're about two-thirds done.

287
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,411
-Are we taking a break?
-We're almost done.

288
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:47,915
We're going to take a short break.

289
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,020
-Bugs keep flying around.
-There are lots of mosquitoes.

290
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,401
I've honestly watched it
two or three times,

291
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,403
and I rewatch it often.

292
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,505
I really love <i>Splash Splash Love.</i>

293
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,541
-There's definitely a fanbase.
-Yes, there are cult fans.

294
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:18,912
I heard it was re-released
in theaters for the tenth anniversary.

295
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,448
-It sold out instantly.
-Thankfully, yes.

296
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,118
-And you had extra screenings?
-Yes, for a week.

297
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,753
I'm so very grateful.

298
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,889
It was really surprising to see

299
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,294
a ten-year-old show return to theaters.

300
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:38,799
We were so grateful to have fans come back

301
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,134
and relive those memories with us.

302
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,740
How long have you known each other?
People even call you

303
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,942
-an old married couple.
-Almost 20 years.

304
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,611
-Yes, 20 years.
-That's amazing.

305
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,414
What's your secret to maintaining
such a strong bond?

306
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,749
We try hard

307
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:59,419
to be considerate of each other.

308
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,128
This couch is so comfortable.

309
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,031
This is really nice.

310
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,668
I'm so sleepy.

311
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:18,939
I'll go back to sleep.

312
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,580
Sorry, but who is he?

313
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,049
He's one of our crew members.

314
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,386
He scheduled this break two months ago.

315
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,290
We're going to interact
with the audience now.

316
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,193
I'm told someone prepared
a special performance today.

317
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,395
Is it you? Could we get him a mic?

318
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,964
He prepared a performance?

319
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,935
I came all the way from Busan

320
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,536
-to see Highlight.
-Really?

321
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:54,174
I'm Jung Taewoong, a web-drama director
from Ooh-ah Studio.

322
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,242
-Hello.
-Hello.

323
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,844
What did you prepare for us?

324
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:01,081
I prepared a mystery today
that I've never revealed before.

325
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,850
A mystery you've never revealed?

326
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,185
-I'll reveal it today.
-You'll show us?

327
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,422
Please give him a hand.

328
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,292
<i>You're such a mystery, mystery, why</i>

329
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,094
<i>Mystery, mystery, why</i>

330
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,363
<i>You're such a mystery, mystery, why</i>

331
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,065
<i>Mystery, mystery, why</i>

332
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,600
<i>Mystery, mystery, why</i>

333
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,768
<i>Turn the right way</i>

334
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,370
<i>Mystery, mystery, why</i>

335
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,038
<i>Mystery, mystery, why</i>

336
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,274
<i>Mystery, mystery, why</i>

337
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,477
-Yeah.
-Please give him a big round of applause.

338
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,821
Both of you will have
to enter the Quiet Room.

339
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,691
He revealed his mystery

340
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:47,027
-without holding back.
-That was…

341
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:48,095
That was intense.

342
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:53,300
Both guests may be locked up,
but the interview must go on.

343
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,870
So we brought in a stand-in for them.

344
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:02,042
Today's stand-in is here to support Dujun.
He lives and breathes soccer.

345
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,110
Wait, really?

346
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,881
A high-ranking official
from the Football Association is here.

347
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,082
High-ranking official?

348
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,286
-Who is it?
-Let's see what they have to say.

349
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,821
Let's welcome them
with a round of applause.

350
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,529
Who's that?

351
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,431
Farmers' Association.

352
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,037
Nice to meet you.

353
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,776
Could you please introduce yourself?

354
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:41,615
Hello. I'm Tak Gwipil,
a member of the Farmers' Association.

355
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,351
-Welcome.
-Nice to meet you.

356
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:48,121
You're from the Farmers' Association.
Do you raise animals?

357
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,189
Yes, I do.

358
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,058
What kind of animals?

359
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:55,295
I have about 40 head of cattle,
including mother cows and calves.

360
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,764
It sounds like a large ranch.

361
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:00,200
Do you name your cattle as well?

362
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:05,939
Yes, I name each one
and raise them with care.

363
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,809
I guess it's because
you love them so much.

364
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,611
What are their names?

365
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,387
You said you named them all…

366
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:26,760
Before we wrap up, could you give
a message of support to Highlight?

367
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,632
Before the darkness descends,

368
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,701
the barn is already lit.

369
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,672
Just as our food becomes beads of sweat…

370
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,374
"Beads of sweat?"

371
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,143
Just as our beads of sweat become food,

372
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,046
a single piece of food…

373
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,449
Let me start over.

374
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:54,087
Thank you. Please give him a hand.

375
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,924
You may return to your seat, sir.

376
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,991
-Thank you.
-Yes.

377
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,196
Both of you can come back to your seats.

378
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,337
We're almost done now,

379
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:12,239
so please raise your hand

380
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:14,942
if you would like to say something
to the guests.

381
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,544
Yes, ma'am?

382
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,246
Can someone get her a mic?

383
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,749
Hello.

384
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:28,055
My name is Kim Bonghee, and I have
grandchildren who are fans of Highlight.

385
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:33,126
My granddaughter has been a fan
of Yoon Dujun for a very long time.

386
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,528
-I see.
-Thank you.

387
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,431
She's living far from home,

388
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,301
so there's something
I'd like you to say to her.

389
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,437
-Would that be okay?
-Yes, of course.

390
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:48,876
Since she's living abroad,
a message from her favorite celebrity

391
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,444
-would mean a lot.
-It would.

392
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:51,778
What should he say?

393
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,984
Rather than Messi,
who relies on Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets,

394
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,752
Ronaldo is the true GOAT.

395
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,154
Who do you want to be reborn as?

396
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,724
Shout it! King Ronaldo!

397
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,459
Siuuuuuuuuuuuu!

398
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,462
Okay, thank you.

399
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:16,937
He's going on his own.

400
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,710
This is driving me crazy.

401
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:26,113
All right, today's episode

402
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,349
will have to end
with only Yoseop in his seat.

403
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,285
I want to ask your thoughts on…

404
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:35,455
Is that an IOU?

405
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:40,827
It looks like the kids won't be getting
any gifts this Christmas.

406
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,396
He lost it all.

407
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,298
-You're right.
-Yes.

408
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:49,269
At first, all these gifts were over there,
but now they're here.

409
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:55,075
He must have won the L*b*bu.

410
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,949
Here's your cab fare.

411
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:03,984
Cab fare.

412
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,800
Please return to the Quiet Room.

413
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,436
I can't believe this.

414
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:27,508
If both of you had lasted until the end,
you would've had the chance

415
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:32,646
to share your final thoughts
or promote anything you wanted.

416
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:36,984
But the chance to say the final words
will go to the audience.

417
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,952
Does anyone want to say something?

418
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:42,389
Please come up to the stage.

419
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:45,125
-It's a letter.
-Please give us a mic.

420
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,528
Come to the center here.

421
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,497
Hey, get out of the way.

422
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:02,843
May I look up to Cristiano Ronaldo
all my life without a trace of regret.

423
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:09,183
As the breeze shakes the leaves,
so too has Ronaldo stirred my soul.

424
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,219
With a heart that sings like the stars,

425
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:15,689
I shall love everything
about Cristiano Ronaldo.

426
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:20,961
And I shall walk the Ronaldo path
that has been given to me.

427
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:23,096
Even tonight,

428
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:26,867
Cristiano Ronaldo
brushes past me in the wind.

429
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:30,304
Let's give her a big round of applause.

430
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,273
Thank you.
This has been The Quiet Interview.

431
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,374
Thank you!

432
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,112
This is torture.

433
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:48,222
THE QUIET INTERVIEW

434
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:53,026
