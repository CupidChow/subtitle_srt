1
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:03,179
Oh, my gosh.

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:04,514
This looks possessed.

3
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:07,484
When I move, I'm going to get rid of them.

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:10,654
Dolls like these will follow you
even if you throw them away.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,955
These will go viral.

6
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,824
I wanted to be an influencer
who has that impact.

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,527
They have a two-for-one deal on this.

8
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,534
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

9
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,870
It's already our tenth episode today,

10
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:31,408
and also the final episode
of You Bought What?!

11
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:33,176
But next week on <i>YOO Got a Minute,</i>

12
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:36,413
we'll be introducing a new segment
called The Quiet Interview<i>.</i>

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,284
Ryugyu, please do the honors
and introduce our final guests.

14
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,321
-Their relationship is really unique.
-Okay.

15
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:47,757
His colleague is her brother.

16
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:51,728
But the two of them
also share a close bond.

17
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,397
Without further ado, let's welcome them.
Come on out!

18
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:56,132
FINAL GUESTS ENTER

19
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,535
-Hello.
-Welcome.

20
00:00:58,602 --> 00:00:59,869
It's been a while, bro.

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,206
-We already said hi backstage.
-We're filming now.

22
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:07,344
With so many platforms
and so much content these days,

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,946
everyone knows that you're friends.

24
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,682
But how did you two first meet?

25
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:14,618
She's my friend's younger sister.

26
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:18,255
The first time we met
was during a shoot with Lee Malnyeon.

27
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,656
When was that?

28
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:21,157
When was that?

29
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:25,128
-It was over five years ago.
-That's right.

30
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,130
I really take good care of him.

31
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:28,265
LAUGHS IN AGREEMENT

32
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,133
You called him "bro" earlier.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,035
Yes, with the utmost respect.

34
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:35,538
There's something
I've been wanting to say to Poong.

35
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,275
-I think Ryugyu knows what it is.
-I do.

36
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,845
I lived in Sangsu-dong
for around four to five years.

37
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:44,180
-I saw you a few times.
-Really?

38
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:47,851
I stepped outside one day
and noticed a new business had opened.

39
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:49,185
It was across the street.

40
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:51,221
Was it the legendary one?

41
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:53,023
It was called OF Cafe.

42
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,292
In that neighborhood,
businesses come and go.

43
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:59,229
I don't run a business myself,
but whenever I see a business close,

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,198
I think of the hardship
the owner must've faced.

45
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:08,071
You know, it didn't feel like
your cafe was open for very long.

46
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:10,140
You're right. It wasn't.

47
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,741
How long did you run it?

48
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:14,377
About a year and seven months.

49
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:17,080
-That's longer than I thought.
-It was pretty long.

50
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:21,985
I opened the legendary OF Cafe
and started with coffee.

51
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:26,056
But over time,
people wanted desserts more than coffee,

52
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:29,693
then meals more than desserts.

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,430
So eventually, we started serving food.

54
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:37,667
People would come for coffee,
but the place smelled like chili oil.

55
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,737
They would come in thinking it's a cafe,

56
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:45,342
but they'd end up wondering
if they stepped into a noodle shop.

57
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:51,581
The place eventually lost its direction,
and COVID delivered the final blow.

58
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,183
It was COVID.

59
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,753
-COVID shut it down.
-It completely ended it.

60
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,590
-You're running a business too, right?
-Yes, a successful one.

61
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,058
Successful?

62
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,828
We make merch, develop original items,

63
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:10,834
and acquire intellectual property rights
to release other products.

64
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,136
-How much did you make last year?
-What?

65
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,304
You can tell us.

66
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:18,108
-I can't. People will DM me for money.
-Do you have a lot of money?

67
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,410
People ask me for money,
but I turn them down.

68
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:22,846
Every day,
someone asks me for 30 million won.

69
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:25,549
Their mom is sick one day,
then it's their dad.

70
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:29,052
But when I check their social media,
they're hanging out at a pool.

71
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,954
They're having a pool party.

72
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,823
We got carried away
and forgot to do the introductions.

73
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,492
Please introduce yourselves.

74
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:39,796
-Hello, I'm Kim Poong, and I'm an artist.
-Welcome.

75
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:41,197
KIM POONG
ECLECTIC CONSUMER

76
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,200
Hi, I'm Chicken Angel,
here to serve at Kim Poong's side.

77
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,669
CHICKEN ANGEL QUIRKY CONSUMER

78
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:48,872
-I'll take good care of him today.
-Welcome, Chicken Angel.

79
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,074
You sound like a sly courtier.

80
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:54,744
I want to mention this
before we officially begin.

81
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:59,182
This is the second time
I've met Poong in person.

82
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:02,519
The first was on <i>Happy Together</i>
about ten years ago.

83
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:06,089
There's a clip from back then
that's going viral now.

84
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:10,527
I said I learned boxing from <i>The Fighting,</i>
so I can do the Dempsey Roll.

85
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:13,964
Then you said you learned capoeira,
so you can do that.

86
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,132
We kept doing that for a while.

87
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,536
We called ourselves pacifist fighters,
so we wouldn't attack.

88
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:20,870
It was exhausting.

89
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:23,607
-It was really tiring.
-It really was.

90
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,009
-We looked like a character select screen.
-We did.

91
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,945
-Should we reenact it?
-Should we?

92
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:31,448
-Do you remember?
-It's the legendary meme.

93
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:32,515
One, two, three.

94
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:34,885
Capoeira's all about the ginga rhythm.

95
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,420
You haven't lost your touch.

96
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:38,855
No one's throwing a punch.

97
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,524
A ONE-MAN FIGHT

98
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,361
That's it. It's really exhausting.

99
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:48,765
You usually face your opponent in a fight,
but they were both facing the front.

100
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:53,069
We look at the spending habits
of celebrities on this show.

101
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:54,838
So please tell us about yours.

102
00:04:54,905 --> 00:05:00,277
If I find something that's pretty or cute,

103
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:04,247
I'll buy it right away
if it's under 30,000 won.

104
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:05,982
I used to be like her.

105
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:10,720
If I saw something I liked,
I would buy it.

106
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:15,325
Now my spending habits have shifted
toward rare things,

107
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:18,662
stuff most people wouldn't buy,
or just practical items.

108
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:24,834
We'll see if that holds up
once we pull out the items you've brought.

109
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:29,606
Here's how it works.
You'll each pick someone to defend you.

110
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:32,742
-I'd like to defend Chicken Angel.
-Why?

111
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:37,247
-She reminds me of my older sister.
-Don't say that.

112
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:42,686
The two of them have something in common.
They have a celebrity in the family.

113
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,554
-And my sister's funny.
-She is.

114
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,490
I think you guys have
the same sense of humor.

115
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,393
-She also reminds me of my sister.
-Really?

116
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,162
I'd like to defend Poong.

117
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,398
I can't be on the same team as Byungjae
because we're rivals.

118
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:57,267
Isn't that obvious?

119
00:05:57,334 --> 00:06:00,437
I'm not so sure about this.
Can I switch to a public defender?

120
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,172
My fee is 300,000 won.

121
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,506
-I'm better.
-Really?

122
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,642
Pick me and you'll get plenty of airtime.

123
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:10,313
All right, I'll defend Chicken Angel,
and Ryugyu will defend Poong.

124
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,483
I'll let you in on a little secret
since it's our last episode.

125
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,751
We decide this in advance.

126
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:16,353
SEATED BY TEAM

127
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,155
-It's true.
-I'll start first.

128
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:21,358
Poong doesn't have much to go after.

129
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:25,028
There's so much to go after.
Look at how flashy these are.

130
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:27,330
-Let's start with clothes.
-These look familiar.

131
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,132
-Let's start with clothes.
-These look familiar.

132
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,434
What matters is where you bought these.

133
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,904
-I'm sure you've all heard of T*mu.
-T*mu.

134
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,538
Yes, these are from T*mu.

135
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,541
I was shopping online one day.

136
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:44,014
And a site had models posing,
all styled up in the clothes.

137
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,018
But then I found the same thing on T*mu.
It was even styled the same way.

138
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:50,120
I couldn't tell who copied whom.

139
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:53,957
Is T*mu selling it cheap?
Or are they marking up T*mu products?

140
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:57,093
T*mu sells things
for a tenth of the regular price.

141
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,162
Guess how much this was.

142
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,064
How much was it? I'm curious.

143
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,633
This shirt went for
about 10,000 won at first,

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,337
-but when I left it in my cart…
-You kept getting alerts, right?

145
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:09,806
…it dropped to 7,500 won.

146
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:14,077
Then it dropped to 5,000 won,
then 2,500 won, and finally to 1 won.

147
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,413
-You bought this for one won?
-I did.

148
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,915
-Does the price really drop?
-It does.

149
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,318
-I get a thrill from it.
-What kind of thrill?

150
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:25,388
Let's say the other guests
show up in expensive clothes,

151
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:28,658
while I'm standing there in a T*mu shirt
I got for one won.

152
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:33,997
I'm still getting paid to be there,
and that's what thrills me.

153
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:36,132
-Wait, I have an objection.
-Okay.

154
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,169
You said it thrills you
when people don't notice it's cheap,

155
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:42,005
but what if they do?

156
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:46,409
Defconn noticed it recently
and asked if I bought it on T*mu.

157
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:49,613
Even though you didn't say anything?

158
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:53,783
At least this was cheap.
I was so surprised by this.

159
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,753
What are these outfits?
You'd see them on <i>Curious Paradise.</i>

160
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,056
I think I've seen these at Seoul Station.

161
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:01,658
-They're stylish.
-Bro!

162
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,493
She didn't buy them to wear them.

163
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,229
It looks like she got into a fight
in this outfit.

164
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,698
It looks like a curtain to keep flies out.

165
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,867
You have to lift it up to get in.

166
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:13,236
This was up on a secondhand app.

167
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:19,910
The seller took the photo from a distance,
so I didn't know the bottom was frayed.

168
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,245
That's just wrong.

169
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:24,247
Even T*mu wouldn't sell this.

170
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:25,615
THE SELLER FOOLED YOU

171
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:30,086
-What about this?
-I went to a YOASOBI concert last year.

172
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:31,855
YOASOBI.

173
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:35,091
The vocalist was wearing this.

174
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,694
Turns out it was a piece
from a collection,

175
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,996
and they only had a medium
and a large left.

176
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,064
One of each.

177
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,966
-So it was the last two pieces.
-Yes.

178
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,101
What if they were working with YOASOBI?

179
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,404
-Working together?
-Yes, together.

180
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,673
You're not going to wear it, right?

181
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,609
I wear it a lot in the fall and winter.

182
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:55,779
-But YOASOBI wore it as a stage outfit.
-That's right.

183
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,248
You're wearing it as a daily outfit.

184
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,350
True, but I've got to be a trendsetter.

185
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,886
But YOASOBI already set the trend.

186
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:04,421
-That's true.
-Then why…

187
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,223
I have to follow the trends.

188
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,725
-You follow trends.
-I'll set the trend in Korea.

189
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,493
You'll make it trendy.

190
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,329
It's hard to talk to fashion noobs.

191
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,597
NO POINT TALKING TO THEM

192
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:16,633
Every good <i>jjamppong </i>place
in Incheon Chinatown

193
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,303
has one of these at the entrance.

194
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,672
-They're pretty.
-They are.

195
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,442
-You've seen these before, right?
-They're very pretty.

196
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:29,679
I picked these up at a duty-free shop
on my way back from China.

197
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:32,816
Whenever I visit a new country,
I always buy a doll.

198
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:35,886
It's like a souvenir
to remind you of the trip.

199
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:40,357
Sometimes I lock eyes with the dolls,
and it feels a bit eerie.

200
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:43,560
-Do they freak you out?
-I don't want them to hear this.

201
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:47,430
When I move, I'm going to get rid of them.

202
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:51,434
Dolls like these will follow you
even if you throw them away.

203
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,769
While giggling manically?

204
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:55,105
They'll follow you
while calling your name.

205
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,306
What's that box?

206
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,842
There's a really cute doll in here.

207
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:02,879
I shouldn't have brought it,
so this is a big deal.

208
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:05,582
-Because it's cute?
-This god protects my kitchen.

209
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:06,683
UNBOXING

210
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,784
Oh, my gosh.

211
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,819
SCAREDY-CAT

212
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:11,888
This looks possessed.

213
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,492
I keep it in a corner of my kitchen.

214
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,060
Its hair grew, didn't it?

215
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,629
-And the eyes…
-I'm sure it did.

216
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:22,032
-There's no way they made it like this.
-No.

217
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,667
-It's human hair.
-No, it's not.

218
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,902
-It is.
-It's not.

219
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,405
Do you collect dolls?

220
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:34,144
I prefer the ones that look like animals
over the ones that resemble people.

221
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,680
-So no dolls that resemble people.
-That's right.

222
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,481
You like animal figurines.

223
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:42,252
As you just mentioned,
we have some cat figurines.

224
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:44,788
That's so cute.

225
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:46,723
He's going for the cute factor.

226
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,726
They're so cute.
They're the definition of cute.

227
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:53,763
Cats are cute, so why aren't these cute?
It's like putting caviar in a stew.

228
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,832
I was going to say that, but this is cute.

229
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,500
I told you so.

230
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,736
What about the doll I keep in the kitchen?

231
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:01,705
Seriously?

232
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:04,975
That one was also cute.

233
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,043
These don't protect anything.

234
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,912
-They do.
-You're hung up on that.

235
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:13,316
You said they don't protect anything,
but we have some that probably could.

236
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:17,187
-This looks valuable even at a glance.
-That's really cool.

237
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:21,725
-Have you seen <i>The Lord of the Rings?</i>
-Of course.

238
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,928
When Sauron's finger is cut off,
the ring comes off with it.

239
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,330
This is the One Ring.

240
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:32,302
This is a life-size replica
of the ring and the severed finger.

241
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,871
If you look closely,
you can see the Elvish script.

242
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,640
-I see.
-Isn't it incredible?

243
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:40,043
-This is absolutely incredible.
-That is pretty cool.

244
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,245
Just look at the Elvish inscription.

245
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:46,816
-What's that?
-In the second <i>The Lord of the Rings </i>film,

246
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:50,387
Gandalf the White
comes thundering down on his horse,

247
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:54,257
shouting as the elves charge with him.

248
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:56,760
-It's a miniature version of Helm's Deep.
-I see.

249
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:59,029
Gosh, you haven't seen it, have you?

250
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,331
-No wonder you don't get it.
-I'm not a fan.

251
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:04,000
SERIOUSLY?

252
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,436
-It's a bit boring.
-It's too long.

253
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:07,837
It's not that exciting.

254
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,372
Do you prefer <i>Harry Potter?</i>

255
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,640
If I have to choose, yes.

256
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:12,475
Oh, my gosh!

257
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:15,512
I used to work part-time
at a DVD rental room.

258
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,115
I worked mornings,
and my brother took the afternoon shift.

259
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:23,053
Middle-aged couples would come in
and ask for the longest movie.

260
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,288
Why would they do that?

261
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:28,158
I'd always reach for
<i>The Lord of the Rings.</i>

262
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,659
One, two, or three?

263
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:32,128
They don't care about the movie.

264
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:34,898
You're either a Tolkien fan
or a Rowling fan.

265
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:38,235
Come on, Tolkien came long before Rowling.

266
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:41,037
I've never heard it the other way around.

267
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:46,810
Tolkien is the grandfather of this genre.
He's the one who set the standard.

268
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:47,978
Who do you like?

269
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:50,447
I'm a fan of <i>The Order of the Phoenix.</i>

270
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:53,416
-You two aren't even Rowling fans.
-I'm not.

271
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,553
-Why are you acting like you like Rowling?
-You got me.

272
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,054
I like Brave Girls.

273
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:00,457
I like the author Park Wansuh.

274
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:03,493
I'm not too familiar
with Tolkien or Rowling.

275
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,196
Poong is a fan of <i>The Lord of the Rings,</i>

276
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:10,233
while Chicken Angel
seems to be a fan of <i>Shark Tank.</i>

277
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,038
It's where entrepreneurs
pitch their ideas to millionaires.

278
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:17,474
-To the potential investors.
-I know what it is.

279
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,077
If they like your idea,
they can invest and buy a stake.

280
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:24,214
They say things like,
"I'll put in 200 million won for 15%."

281
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,515
They make those deals.

282
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:30,487
So for this product,
you don't need a lot of space.

283
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:33,223
What was the response like
on <i>Shark Tank </i>back then?

284
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,526
-The millionaires tried this out.
-They gave it a try.

285
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:41,064
They were like,
"Wait a minute. This is hard."

286
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:43,800
-Can you show us how to use it?
-Please show us.

287
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,802
You stand on it like this

288
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:49,172
and have to keep your balance
without tipping over.

289
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,340
Then you do this.

290
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,575
WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE

291
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,842
It's the Dempsey Roll!

292
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:53,977
Keep going.

293
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,813
This is how you do it.

294
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:02,118
This workout seriously fires up your core.

295
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:05,589
You can get a workout anywhere.
Definitely a solid purchase.

296
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:08,291
-You don't need that board, though.
-It's well-made.

297
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:11,361
This is a free workout.
You don't need to buy a board.

298
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,297
You have to engage your muscles
to keep your balance.

299
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:15,765
-It works your core.
-Yes.

300
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,534
Step on one side.

301
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:18,768
ONE FOOT UP

302
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:21,371
What?

303
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:23,073
Engage your core.

304
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:26,877
It's not easy, is it?

305
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:30,647
It's speeding up. The faster it twists…

306
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,850
-He's struggling.
-You can't stop it.

307
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:38,321
It's harder to balance when you go slow,
but easier when you speed up.

308
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,656
I should buy one.

309
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:42,359
-Will you invest in this?
-I'm going to buy it.

310
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:43,760
I will.

311
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:48,498
Honestly, I have no clue what these are.

312
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:53,470
I've never seen these before.
I can usually guess what things are.

313
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,171
I think this is soap.

314
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:58,975
It doesn't smell like soap.
If it's not soap…

315
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,443
Why is it on a string?

316
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,045
-It's soap.
-It is?

317
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:06,550
But it's infused with a scent
that mosquitoes hate.

318
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:10,287
So if you hang it up,
it's supposed to keep them away.

319
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:13,256
It had a quick burst of popularity,
but it was short-lived.

320
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:14,658
How short-lived was it?

321
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,760
It faded out in about a year.

322
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:19,763
-That means it wasn't effective.
-You're sharp.

323
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,665
SHARP OBSERVATION

324
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:24,401
-When Id*s…
-Id*s.

325
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:28,204
When that app first came out,
I was browsing and came across it.

326
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:32,609
I bought something similar.
It was a mosquito repellent like this one.

327
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:35,679
It was supposed to emit a scent
that kept mosquitoes away.

328
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:36,947
It worked.

329
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:41,051
But if I wasn't sitting next to it,
I'd get bitten.

330
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:44,621
-That's pretty pointless.
-You have to sit very close to it.

331
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:47,691
These are also very unique.

332
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:50,293
Is this a cap for your water bottle?

333
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,763
It's supposed to keep dust
out of your cup.

334
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,832
-Really?
-But it has to fit perfectly.

335
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,436
-It'd only work with an espresso cup.
-Not many cups are that small.

336
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:02,539
-It's cute.
-It keeps dust out, and it's a duck.

337
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:03,607
It even has a beak.

338
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:06,543
It looks like you buy
a lot of fun novelty items.

339
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,745
I don't buy it if it's not fun.

340
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:12,282
Plus, you've got your shop U*DD.

341
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:15,552
This isn't just a personal purchase.
It's for your work, too.

342
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:17,020
Don't you want me?

343
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,822
That's way too close.

344
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:24,995
There's proof that Poong was hyped up
about a trending item.

345
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,998
What are you talking about?
He only buys sentimental items.

346
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,066
These are salt-bread chips.

347
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,935
GRIMACES

348
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,137
This is how much he bought.

349
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:35,205
A WHOLE LOT OF CHIPS

350
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:38,775
SALT-BREAD CHIPS
POONG THOUGHT THESE WOULD CAUSE A CRAZE

351
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:44,714
One of my biggest regrets
was with H*ney B*tter Ch*ps.

352
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:49,452
I wanted to try it so badly,
I paid ten times the price.

353
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,520
AN OUTRAGEOUS PRICE

354
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:53,189
-It was a craze.
-It was wildly popular.

355
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,525
I swore I would never
let that happen again.

356
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:57,327
That really stuck with you.

357
00:16:57,394 --> 00:17:00,697
-So I tried it when it first came out.
-The chips.

358
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:02,065
This is it.

359
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:04,968
-These are the next big thing.
-Like H*ney B*tter Ch*ps.

360
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:06,269
These will go viral.

361
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:09,039
-How many did you buy?
-I bought two boxes.

362
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,777
-He tried to predict consumer trends.
-This expired on May 8th, 2024.

363
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:20,083
The shelf life is about 6 to 8 months,
so it probably came out around that time.

364
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,854
I'd walk past the convenience store
and think, "It's still not sold out?"

365
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:28,158
-It's still sitting on the shelf.
-"Why isn't it sold out?"

366
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,060
They have a two-for-one deal on this.

367
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:31,995
EMBARRASSED

368
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:35,532
I wanted to be an influencer
who has that impact.

369
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,133
By buying this?

370
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,904
What's an influencer, really?
It's someone who's one step ahead.

371
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,540
The profile on the back says,
"Trend-Savvy Guy."

372
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:46,443
His nicknames are
Bread Manager and Trend-Savvy Guy.

373
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,979
It didn't sell out
because it doesn't taste good.

374
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:50,247
A TREND-SAVVY PALATE

375
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:53,617
-You don't want it anymore.
-There's nothing wrong with it.

376
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:56,519
-I was seriously shocked when I saw this.
-What is it?

377
00:17:56,586 --> 00:18:00,090
You must be living in a house
possessed by evil spirits.

378
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:03,493
You've filled your house
with all kinds of gods.

379
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,931
Since I brought everything
from my house and office, the Honmoon…

380
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:11,234
-It's not sealed?
-I need to hurry back and seal it.

381
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:12,869
Let me just say this first.

382
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:17,107
She needs these to ward off
that creepy doll in the kitchen.

383
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:21,745
-Does she block amulets with amulets?
-She needs 15 of these for that doll.

384
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,114
I go to Japan a lot for work,

385
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,518
and every time I do,
I stop by those sacred shrines.

386
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:33,189
-My number one wish is always money.
-I see.

387
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:39,362
I heard you can't bring back gods
from another country.

388
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,132
-They can't get through immigration?
-Right.

389
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:44,367
-Really?
-They don't have an effect here.

390
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,469
But they don't need a visa to come here.

391
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:50,840
I always carry a few amulets
in my card wallet.

392
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:53,176
You have more amulets than money.

393
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,778
-More amulets than money.
-Yes.

394
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:58,114
If you had saved that money
and put it into NV*DIA…

395
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,783
GLARE

396
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:03,787
You said you wanted money earlier.
So, how much are we talking?

397
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,990
-Ten billion won!
-What would you do with it?

398
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,926
I want to order food
without worrying about the price.

399
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:11,861
Can't you do that now?

400
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:15,131
No, I check everything
on the delivery app.

401
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:19,269
I check whether the set menu
is 500 won or 1,000 won cheaper,

402
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:22,105
or if it's priced the same
but made to look cheaper.

403
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,373
-You check that?
-Yes.

404
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,878
Are you possessed?
I think you're possessed by a money ghost.

405
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,212
Turns out I'm the ghost.

406
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,381
Yeah, you're the money ghost.

407
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:33,683
-I'm the ghost.
-Exactly.

408
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,787
The next item is an e-book reader.

409
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:38,955
What's wrong with that?

410
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:44,561
There's one, two, three, and four.

411
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:47,297
-He needs them.
-Why?

412
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:49,332
He wants to hold on to good books.

413
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,002
PERSONALIZED DEFENSE

414
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:56,606
This may be a bad joke,
but I'll just say it anyway.

415
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,742
Even Kim Jong Un,
the leader of North Korea

416
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,043
"LOOKS AWAY"

417
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,713
doesn't have four of these.

418
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,181
There, I said it.

419
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:09,386
-I can't believe you said that.
-That felt nice.

420
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,756
-Why did you buy four of these?
-They're all different.

421
00:20:12,822 --> 00:20:15,225
There's a reason I have four.

422
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:18,595
This one is good for reading poetry.

423
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,164
And this one is better for reading novels.

424
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,599
-For longer text?
-Yes.

425
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,570
But when you need to see both pages,
this isn't ideal.

426
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,071
When you read comic books--

427
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,874
Comics just feel better
when you flip through the pages.

428
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:32,676
I'm in that camp too.

429
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,345
It's really hard to keep
a comic book collection.

430
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:39,182
-There are just so many volumes.
-Right, so this is perfect.

431
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:42,219
-It's super easy on the eyes.
-Your eyes don't hurt.

432
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,587
But it's boring.

433
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:46,122
-What?
-What do you mean?

434
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:50,694
-There's a joy in flipping through pages.
-Sometimes you flip back and forth.

435
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,763
-And you think, "So he was the jerk?"
-"He was the jerk?"

436
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,034
It's a bit hard to turn the pages on this,

437
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,103
and it's also in black and white.

438
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,905
That's why I got a color reader.

439
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:05,375
-That shows a bit of color.
-It has color.

440
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,178
You can even stream videos on this.

441
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,446
Just buy a tablet.

442
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:10,647
FED UP

443
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:12,682
-But you know…
-What's wrong with you?

444
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,652
I already have them in every size.

445
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:19,689
This is designed to run a bit slowly.
When you click it, it takes a while.

446
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:20,824
That's annoying.

447
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:25,095
Poong has a total of four e-book readers.

448
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:28,398
We could give them to Kim Ilsung,
Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un.

449
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,468
-We'll see who this one goes to.
-We'll have to see.

450
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:36,306
When I think of Poong,
I think of him as an artist and a cook,

451
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:40,977
but I didn't realize
how talented he was in music.

452
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,045
Music is important.

453
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:45,382
It's more than just being talented.
He has so many instruments.

454
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:50,353
The otamatone was hard to find online,
but they had it in Nakwon.

455
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,222
Do you know how to play that?

456
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,357
Is there a song you want to hear?

457
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:57,661
Can you play the sound you hear
when the fries are done at L*tteria?

458
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:01,031
IMPROMPTU PERFORMANCE

459
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:03,266
-That's the one.
-Is that right?

460
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,701
He has perfect pitch.

461
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,469
-I'm a musician.
-You nailed it.

462
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:09,706
-This is called a steel tongue drum.
-I've seen that before.

463
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:10,774
Steel tongue drum?

464
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,278
It's an instrument meant to soothe
and calm you down.

465
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:21,017
I also bought this during COVID
when I was at home a lot.

466
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:23,019
You spent a lot of money back then.

467
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:28,325
I felt so cooped up
that I decided to try meditating.

468
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:29,993
You can even play music on this.

469
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,730
-This is one, two, three, four.
-Okay.

470
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,000
That's wrong.

471
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:45,141
-It's easy to play since it has numbers.
-Yes.

472
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,577
I bet that costs over 200,000 won.

473
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:50,647
You can buy it online
for 30,000 to 40,000 won.

474
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:52,749
-Really?
-Yes.

475
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:55,385
-You mean just the strap?
-No.

476
00:22:55,452 --> 00:22:58,722
-What is that?
-I also got this during COVID.

477
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:02,492
I was addicted to short-form videos,
and I saw a guy from Ghana use this.

478
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,397
-One, two, shake, shake.
-You're really good.

479
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:11,268
One, two, shake, shake.

480
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:14,371
-One, two, shake, shake.
-He's speeding up.

481
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:15,805
This is what he was doing.

482
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:19,943
I looked it up because it looked fun,
and it was an asalato.

483
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,679
Is there a reason
you buy unique instruments?

484
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,782
-I don't like instruments like the guitar.
-Why?

485
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,651
It comes off as showing off.

486
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:30,086
-What's wrong with that?
-It's just wrong.

487
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:35,425
You need an insane amount of practice
to look cool playing the guitar,

488
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,994
but the expectations are low
for these instruments.

489
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:40,096
These instruments may not look cool,

490
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:44,501
but when people realize
they can produce sound and music,

491
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,137
that's when the unexpected charm hits.

492
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:49,806
-Unexpected charm?
-That's the reason.

493
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:52,409
You won't take the conventional path.

494
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,744
Because if he does, he can't compete.

495
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:58,014
He doesn't stand a chance
against John Mayer and Jukjae.

496
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:01,451
But there's a small chance
he'll meet someone who can play these.

497
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:05,855
I said this on <i>Chef &amp; My Fridge,</i>
but I can't win the conventional way.

498
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:08,525
-I have to do it my way.
-I understand what you mean.

499
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:12,896
We've got someone here
who's sticking to the conventional path.

500
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:17,100
-Is that an electric guitar?
-It's an electric guitar.

501
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,570
-Look at her hold that guitar.
-Do you know how to play the guitar?

502
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:23,840
-Play something.
-I got this secondhand for 900,000 won.

503
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:26,009
You got a good deal.

504
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,311
-He wouldn't knock off even one won.
-Crazy.

505
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:30,881
-Do you know how to play?
-I took lessons.

506
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,350
-Do you have an amp at home?
-Are you serious?

507
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:36,686
-Are you trying to hit me with the guitar?
-Seriously?

508
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:37,988
Do you have one or not?

509
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:39,422
-Of course I do.
-You do.

510
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:40,557
I thought you didn't.

511
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:44,160
Did watching someone play
inspire you to learn guitar?

512
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:47,931
I started learning guitar
because of a big dream I had.

513
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:48,999
Which was?

514
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,635
I wanted to create
a middle-aged QWER band.

515
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:55,372
-I love that.
-Since QWER is too busy,

516
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:58,541
I wanted to pick up the gigs
they couldn't do.

517
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:01,778
There was a band called 50XQ,
a middle-aged version of TVXQ.

518
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:04,381
They debuted on <i>Star King.</i>
Is that what you want?

519
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:05,849
That's exactly it.

520
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:09,419
Turns out Pani Bottle can play the drums.

521
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:11,054
-It's a co-ed group?
-Yes.

522
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,023
It's not even a girl group.

523
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:15,425
It's really hard to recruit members.

524
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:19,129
My brother can't play an instrument,
so he's going to sing.

525
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:21,665
So what have you learned so far?

526
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:25,468
-I know how to hold a pick and strum.
-What?

527
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:28,338
-Can you play something?
-What?

528
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,575
C chord.

529
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,878
-Why are you mad?
-Why?

530
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,479
Why are you angry?

531
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:39,049
-I'm just mad.
-Are you mad at me?

532
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:41,851
For the final item, this is underwhelming.

533
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:44,354
You brought a dish scrubber.

534
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:47,624
-Show it some love.
-Show it love? It's a scrubber.

535
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:48,992
Is this your dog's fur?

536
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:53,196
It looks exactly like my dog,
so I had to buy it.

537
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:54,431
That makes it cuter.

538
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:57,634
I went on a family trip to Taiwan,

539
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:01,404
but nobody wanted to check out
the flea markets.

540
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:04,040
So I forced my dad to go with me.

541
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:05,141
What a good daughter.

542
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:09,212
You see, my dad smokes a lot.

543
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,615
He lives to smoke.

544
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:14,484
-I'm sure he has more to live for.
-You can't say that.

545
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:17,888
-You can't say that about your dad.
-He has a lovely daughter.

546
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,556
I knew he'd want to smoke,

547
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:25,262
so I used that to get him to come along.
I told him he could smoke and look around.

548
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:26,830
That's when I found this.

549
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:29,099
-You found the little guy.
-In Taiwan.

550
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:33,236
You've got to have a bag
when you walk your dog.

551
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:35,105
So you use it when you go for walks.

552
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:39,109
I'll hold the leash and put stuff in here.

553
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:41,077
You need to carry around poop bags.

554
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:43,780
So this bag is the perfect size.

555
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:48,919
It's just too cute to carry a bag
that looks like your dog.

556
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:50,153
It's super cute.

557
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,391
It appears to have multiple uses.

558
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:55,759
You like it, don't you?

559
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,994
-He's right.
-You like it because it's soft.

560
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:00,897
You can use it to grab hot things.

561
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:02,465
It'll melt.

562
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:05,502
-It's never there when you need it.
-Right.

563
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:08,071
It just so happens to fit like a mitt.

564
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:13,743
That's a really cute bag,
but I'll show you something truly useless.

565
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,612
I don't have anything useless.

566
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,082
This is the second time
we've seen rocks on this show.

567
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:23,253
The first guests who brought rocks
were Choi Yangrak and Pang Hyunsook.

568
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,957
Pang Hyunsook is a huge rock enthusiast.

569
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:31,995
This is different.
She bought rocks for their shape.

570
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:34,464
But he bought these… Right?

571
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:36,499
STUMPED

572
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:39,703
You gave up too early.
What do you mean, "Right?"

573
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:41,738
Can I switch to a public defender?

574
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:42,939
WANTS TO HIDE

575
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:45,809
He just bought rocks. Right?

576
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,211
-That's not it.
-Hyunsook just bought rocks, too.

577
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,846
I mean, not for the shape.

578
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:52,449
-I don't get what you mean.
-Me neither.

579
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,284
-I'll explain.
-Please do.

580
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,220
This was also during COVID.

581
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,790
-You had a lot going on.
-What were you doing back then?

582
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:03,126
Since I was stuck at home,

583
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:08,164
I turned to music
and meditation for comfort.

584
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:11,134
And also water gazing.

585
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:13,236
That was a trend.

586
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:16,406
Apparently, you need rocks
for water gazing.

587
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:19,976
Initially, I was going to get two pounds,

588
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:23,046
but two of these already hit that weight.

589
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:25,815
-With two rocks…
-That's not enough.

590
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:29,319
…it's hard to create the shape you want,
and you don't know what you'll get.

591
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:32,055
-You don't get to choose the shape?
-No.

592
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:33,390
So how much did you buy?

593
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:38,295
The difference between buying 22 pounds
and 110 pounds was just 10,000 won.

594
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,930
You had to go with 110 pounds.

595
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:42,465
-Of course.
-That was a smart purchase.

596
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:46,036
The seller's intention is so obvious.
"You can't resist now."

597
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:49,072
The 110 pounds of rocks
come in a huge sack.

598
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:53,677
When I lifted it, I was convinced
it was more than 176 pounds.

599
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:55,178
They gave you extra.

600
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:56,513
They really did.

601
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,285
It also felt boring to buy just one kind,
so I got two types of rocks.

602
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,487
-I get that.
-So I ended up buying 220 pounds.

603
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:07,857
-You have 220 pounds of rocks at home?
-Yes, I do.

604
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:10,727
They look like this
because I cleaned them.

605
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:13,930
They were originally covered in dust.

606
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:17,434
By the time I was done washing them,
the lockdown had ended.

607
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:20,470
The pandemic ended!

608
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:25,575
But what about your wife?
What did she say?

609
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:30,146
My wife was pregnant at the time,
so she avoided contact with me.

610
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:32,983
Whenever I stepped out of my room,
she'd go into hers.

611
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:36,586
So I'd sneak my purchases into my room,
and she had no idea.

612
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:39,923
When quarantine was finally over,

613
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,959
my room looked like those houses
you see on <i>Curious Stories Y.</i>

614
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:46,463
There were rocks in one corner
and instruments in the other.

615
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,964
I had odd things everywhere.

616
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,734
We've carried out today's show
with our two guests,

617
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,871
and as I said earlier,
each of you will pick a recall item,

618
00:29:54,938 --> 00:30:00,510
either something you regret buying
or something you'd want to gift to others.

619
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:03,580
Do you have an item in mind?
Go ahead, Chicken Angel.

620
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:07,717
I'll give away an amulet
that's never been used.

621
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:08,952
-An amulet?
-From Japan.

622
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,387
I told you it doesn't work.

623
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:14,224
-They don't need a visa.
-They can come here without a visa.

624
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,459
But they can't work on a tourist visa.

625
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:18,728
You should sell it to a Japanese person.

626
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:21,598
-You could send it back.
-Send it to Japan.

627
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,533
Is it one amulet or many?

628
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:26,002
-Just one?
-Only one.

629
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:28,939
-You're only giving away one?
-You have so many.

630
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:31,141
Should I give away more?

631
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:33,176
That's up to you.

632
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:36,479
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
IF IT'S ONE AMULET OR TWO

633
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:40,684
-You don't seem to care at all.
-There's no wow factor.

634
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,853
No matter the circumstance,
it'll bring results.

635
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,289
It works in any situation.

636
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:48,758
I'll be generous and give this one away.

637
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,828
Today is the final episode
of You Bought What?!

638
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:55,765
And it's about time we get an item
that no one applies for.

639
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:57,968
It's not like I'm going to live forever.

640
00:30:58,034 --> 00:30:59,603
-That's true.
-Right?

641
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:02,672
Everything we own
will end up as garbage one day.

642
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:05,308
So out of all the garbage,
I'll give away a rock.

643
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,110
NOT MUCH BETTER

644
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:09,646
-You're giving all of them away?
-Just one.

645
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:10,780
Do what you want.

646
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:11,848
GIVES UP

647
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:14,351
You two just do whatever you want.

648
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,286
I like the shape of this one.

649
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:17,587
Just give them both.

650
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:19,856
GLARE

651
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:21,424
Okay, fine.

652
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,427
Fine!

653
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:28,098
-He's generously offered up two rocks.
-My rocks!

654
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:30,333
-It seems we hit the jackpot.
-Yes.

655
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:34,738
RECALL TO SENDER

656
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:38,341
We had Kim Poong and Chicken Angel
on our show today.

657
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:40,810
Please tell us how you felt today.

658
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:45,749
There were so many questionable purchases

659
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:46,883
among Poong's things.

660
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,753
Among my things? Really?

661
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:56,126
It was also interesting to see
how everyone has their own perspective

662
00:31:56,192 --> 00:31:58,228
-when buying things.
-You're right.

663
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:02,032
-Thanks for having me.
-Thank you, Chicken Angel.

664
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:06,102
Chicken Angel's purchases
made me reflect quite a bit.

665
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:11,007
It made me wonder
if that's how others see me.

666
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:14,945
-Just by watching each other…
-I learned a lot about myself.

667
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:19,149
I realized I need to buy things
that are actually useful.

668
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:20,584
As I mentioned earlier,

669
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,220
this will be the last episode
of You Bought What?!

670
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:27,791
Starting next week, we'll be back
on Disney+ with The Quiet Interview<i>.</i>

671
00:32:27,857 --> 00:32:31,861
Please tune in next week.
Thank you for loving You Bought What?!

672
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:33,830
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

673
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,399
THANK YOU FOR ENJOYING THE SHOW

674
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,735
Laughing is strictly forbidden.

675
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:41,838
If you laugh, you'll be eliminated.

676
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:44,374
We'll use technology to detect laughter.

677
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:48,578
If you laugh,
you'll be sent to the Quiet Room,

678
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:51,715
where you'll spend
a lonely and isolated time.

679
00:32:51,781 --> 00:32:53,083
IT ENDS IF YOU LAUGH

680
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:56,453
-Don't laugh.
-I'm thinking sad thoughts right now.

681
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,088
That might be a good strategy.

682
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:01,625
Wait. Don't laugh. I said don't laugh.

683
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,560
-We're in trouble.
-It's starting now.

684
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:12,836
Now that you've debuted through SIXTEEN,
I'd like to ask how you feel about it.

685
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,939
Embracing diversity and finding harmony--

686
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,643
Sorry, there was a bug.

687
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:22,512
