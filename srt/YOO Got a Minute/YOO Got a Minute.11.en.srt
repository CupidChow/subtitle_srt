1
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:03,713
-We've got this!
-We've got this!

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,949
Once you step out of this car,
don't laugh.

3
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:08,351
I'm thinking sad thoughts right now.

4
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,020
That might be a good strategy.

5
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,389
It is. I'm really sad.

6
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm sorry, but you're hilarious.

7
00:00:14,257 --> 00:00:15,358
-Me?
-Yes.

8
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:19,062
I don't get it. What's so funny?

9
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:21,264
We can laugh right now.

10
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,468
-We're here.
-We need to stay strong.

11
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:27,437
-Let's go.
-Now?

12
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:29,539
Go!

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,484
Let's go.

14
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,611
-Hello.
-Hello.

15
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,254
Hello.

16
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:31,268
-It's good to see you.
-It's good to see you, too.

17
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,838
Thank you all for coming today.

18
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:44,047
Since you're our very first guests,
I'll quickly explain the rules.

19
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,216
You are allowed to grin.

20
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:49,953
But if we think
you're cutting it too close…

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,922
THE QUIET INTERVIEW

22
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,857
…you'll hear a beep as a warning.

23
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:56,760
Now, if you let it slip
and laugh out loud…

24
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,898
the siren will go off,

25
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:06,169
and you'll be sent to the Quiet Room
you see behind me,

26
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:09,439
where you'll spend
a lonely and isolated time.

27
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:11,207
-I'm scared.
-Scared?

28
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,076
-Hey.
-What?

29
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:16,746
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:19,950
What happens now?

31
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:23,820
I'll let this slide
since we haven't started yet.

32
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:25,855
-Thank you.
-The rules apply starting now.

33
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,525
Are you the type to smile a lot, Nayeon?

34
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,794
-I think so.
-Hey.

35
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,196
Don't laugh.

36
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:37,834
I get that you're a cheerful person,
but do you understand the rules?

37
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:40,470
-She's not very good at this.
-I see.

38
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,939
Well, you'll still have a chance.

39
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:46,676
Even if you're sent to the Quiet Room,
if you manage to make me laugh,

40
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:48,979
you can come back and join us.

41
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:53,216
So, making me laugh
might be your way back into the game.

42
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,018
Since this is our first episode,

43
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:58,722
we focused on explaining the rules,
but we haven't heard your introductions.

44
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:01,625
Let's start with Jihyo.
Can you keep it short and sweet?

45
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,493
Hello, I'm Jihyo from TWICE.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,228
It's good to have you here.

47
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,364
Nayeon, be a bit more brief, please.

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,832
I'm Nayeon.

49
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,568
Jeongyeon, please keep it even briefer.

50
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:23,980
I'd like to hear what kind of attitude
you're bringing to today's shoot.

51
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:27,250
Since we don't have time
to hear from all three of you,

52
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:31,621
let's hear from the one
who likes me the most.

53
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,290
You should take this one.

54
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,358
-What? Me?
-Go ahead.

55
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,593
You do it.

56
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,229
Can we play rock-paper-scissors?

57
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,934
-The winner or the loser?
-Rock-paper-scissors.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,105
-Rock-paper-scissors!
-Rock-paper-scissors!

59
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,341
-Me?
-Yes.

60
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,909
Don't laugh.

61
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,780
Well…

62
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,785
We'll do our best not to laugh today.

63
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,754
Let's give them a hand.

64
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:12,362
Since this will be played
on an OTT platform,

65
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:16,399
there's a gap between today's shoot
and when it actually goes live.

66
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:21,838
So even if you share your recent updates,
viewers may think it's old news.

67
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:26,042
But I trust you'll handle it like pros
and give it your best.

68
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,110
-Sure.
-Of course.

69
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:32,949
Now that you made your debut on SIXTEEN,
I'd like to ask how you feel about it.

70
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:37,754
Well, I didn't think I'd be selected…

71
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,327
but I'm overjoyed that I did.

72
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:48,665
Since I was chosen to join TWICE,
I'll do my best to become a great artist.

73
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:50,934
You've received a lot of congratulations,

74
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:55,605
but as with any survival show,
someone had to be eliminated.

75
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,642
Could you share a few words
of encouragement to Jeon Somi?

76
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,378
Hi, Somi.

77
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:04,648
Don't be too sad about being eliminated.

78
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:08,251
I'm sure we'll meet again
at music shows someday.

79
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:11,521
Thank you. That was a kind
and thoughtful message.

80
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:15,191
What kind of group
do you want TWICE to be?

81
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:21,598
We want to be a group
that brings people happiness and laughter.

82
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:28,305
I know it may seem like a long shot now,

83
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:32,943
but if TWICE were to win first place
on a music show, what would you do?

84
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,378
I think winning first place
might be difficult,

85
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:40,984
but we'd cherish every stage
and continue to do our very best.

86
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:45,989
I believe that humility
is what led you to be selected.

87
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:50,260
K-pop groups usually have
their own signature greeting,

88
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,663
but I don't think we've heard TWICE's yet.
Could you show us?

89
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,232
We don't have one.

90
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:01,204
-Could you make one for us right now?
-That's a great idea.

91
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:03,206
-It's "One in a million."
-What?

92
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:04,407
Nothing.

93
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:07,677
Something that suits us.

94
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,881
Something that will make people
want to become our fans.

95
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:14,451
A lot of K-pop groups say their greeting
with plenty of bravado.

96
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:17,020
The classic, "Hello, we're so-and-so!"

97
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,858
But I think that lacks personality
and doesn't really stand out.

98
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,261
Hi-ICE.

99
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:35,505
That's a shorter way to say,
"Hi, we're TWICE."

100
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:39,910
If your greeting is too stiff and formal,
younger idols may find it intimidating.

101
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,778
Why don't you guys try it out?

102
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,114
-One, two, three.
-Hi-ICE!

103
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,350
Let's make it even shorter.

104
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:49,119
HICE.

105
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,188
-One, two, three.
-HICE.

106
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,461
-I like it.
-From now on, that will be your greeting.

107
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:04,067
Everyone knows TWICE for the strong bond
you share with your fans.

108
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:08,271
You're truly unmatched in the way
you connect with your fans, ONCE.

109
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:12,509
So we've prepared a chance for you
to return the love you've received.

110
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:16,479
I'm sure you get a lot of requests
for congratulatory shout-outs.

111
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:19,015
Since this is our first episode
of The Quiet Interview,

112
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:22,285
-could you give us a quick shout-out?
-Sure.

113
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:23,620
One, two, three.

114
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,222
-HICE.
-HICE.

115
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:30,293
It's such an honor to be part of
the first episode of The Quiet Interview.

116
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,231
Please show it lots of love,
and we wish the show continued success.

117
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:40,870
Thank you.
Since we have a live audience with us,

118
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,073
could you give them a shout-out as well?

119
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,507
-Of course.
-We'd love to.

120
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,877
Raise your hand if you'd like a shout-out.

121
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,246
Let's hear from the person
in the back center.

122
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:54,851
My dog, Kkong, has been
really constipated lately.

123
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,856
He couldn't go for a long time,
but he finally pooped today.

124
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:02,893
So please give him
a congratulatory shout-out.

125
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,230
-Now that's something worth celebrating.
-Could you give her a shout-out?

126
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,566
-One, two, three.
-HICE.

127
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,935
A big congrats to Kkong
for finally pooping.

128
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:17,407
I hope he keeps taking his probiotics
and stays healthy.

129
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:19,175
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

130
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:24,281
Does anyone else want a shout-out?
Please go ahead.

131
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:29,886
Last night, I fell asleep to one of those
"manifest a girlfriend" recordings,

132
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,888
and today, a girl asked for my number.

133
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,323
A girl asked for your number?

134
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,226
Last night, I fell asleep to one of those

135
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:39,029
-"manifest a girlfriend" recordings.
-He listened to a recording.

136
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:41,932
-And today, a girl asked for my number.
-A girl asked for his number.

137
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:44,501
It kind of sounds like
he just memorized that line.

138
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:46,436
Could you say that again?

139
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:47,871
Last night…

140
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:51,841
Last night, I fell asleep to one of those
"manifest a girlfriend" recordings,

141
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,044
and today, a girl asked for my number.

142
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,513
Please give me a congratulatory shout-out.

143
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,915
-One, two, three.
-HICE.

144
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:02,786
Hold on, we're not done.
That was just our greeting.

145
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,924
Congratulations on meeting someone.

146
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,127
Who else would like
a congratulatory shout-out?

147
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,497
Let's hear from the brave soldier
in the uniform over there.

148
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,567
Salute! I'm Corporal Park Jiin.

149
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:22,472
Since my leave ends tomorrow,
could you give me a shout-out?

150
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,676
-Shall we congratulate him together?
-Yes.

151
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:30,280
-One, two, three.
-Your leave's over. Congratulations!

152
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:32,415
Let's congratulate him together.

153
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:35,685
-Your leave's over. Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

154
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:38,355
You've got this!

155
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:41,591
Actually, I've also got something
to celebrate today.

156
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:45,662
It's been about four or five years
since I last saw Nayeon.

157
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,531
When I saw you on
<i>Omniscient Interfering View,</i>

158
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:52,002
you said if we set your selfie
as our phone wallpaper…

159
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,238
-You still have it?
-…it would bring us wealth.

160
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:58,241
So I had your selfie
as my phone wallpaper for a long time.

161
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:01,044
-Really?
-For over three months.

162
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:05,181
That was back when I was into investing.

163
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,851
We filmed on a Friday,

164
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:12,789
and by Monday, it went downhill very fast.

165
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,328
I lost 20 million won.

166
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,066
That money was meant
for my mom's dental implants.

167
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:26,970
I thought if it turned out well,
I'd be able to get her two instead of one.

168
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:31,575
But if I'd still been holding onto it,
things could've turned out much worse.

169
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:34,978
So I'd love to hear Nayeon congratulate me
on cutting my losses.

170
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:40,283
Congratulations on cutting your losses,
but you shouldn't have done that.

171
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:42,819
-You see…
-What?

172
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:46,690
You lost the money
because you invested it.

173
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:50,827
What do you mean?

174
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:55,365
You should've done it
without setting any expectations.

175
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:58,268
If you'd done that,
you might've found money lying around

176
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:00,203
or gotten some out of the blue.

177
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,242
Basically, you would've gotten money
you never expected.

178
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,146
Hello?

179
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:13,617
Hi, Mom. I'm in the middle of a shoot.

180
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:15,886
I'm working.

181
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,089
Why would you say that?

182
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:22,359
Why do you want to eat meat?

183
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:26,296
Just eat some porridge
or drink some soy milk.

184
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:29,032
Forget the meat.

185
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:32,135
I have to go. I'm working.

186
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:37,140
Let's move on to something lighter.

187
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:39,376
It'd be nice if you were a little kinder.

188
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:40,443
I agree.

189
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:43,647
What?

190
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:47,884
Are you into investing, Nayeon?

191
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:49,019
What did you say?

192
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:55,425
-He said your name wrong.
-He said, "Nayeon."

193
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:57,661
-I called her "Nayeon."
-I guess I misheard.

194
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:00,864
I'm not that into investing.

195
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:03,066
-You're not?
-I'm not.

196
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:06,369
I'm not really into
making money like that.

197
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,506
Okay, fair enough.

198
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:12,075
We'll wrap up
the congratulatory shout-outs here.

199
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,209
Is that okay?

200
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,178
Does anyone else want a shout-out?

201
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:19,983
Is that me?

202
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,453
That's really good.

203
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,989
Caricatures tend to exaggerate things.

204
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,557
I really like it.

205
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,360
Please keep doing your sketches
throughout the show.

206
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:33,363
All right, that concludes
the congratulatory shout-outs.

207
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,731
Go ahead.

208
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:40,370
I don't really have anything to say.

209
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:45,709
-I just prepared a performance for TWICE.
-He's so cute.

210
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,410
How old are you?

211
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,145
-I'm 13 years old.
-You're 13.

212
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:51,748
-He's in sixth grade.
-He was three when we debuted.

213
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:53,917
Do you know who we are?

214
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,889
I saw you in a short-form video once.

215
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,025
So, what did you prepare for us today?

216
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,627
<i>-TT.</i>
<i>-TT.</i>

217
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:07,230
I prepared a mix of beatboxing
and the recorder.

218
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:10,700
All right. Here goes.

219
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:13,637
He's adorable.

220
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:48,772
Let's give him a big round of applause.

221
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,206
That was amazing.

222
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:52,876
-He gave us a shout-out.
-I know.

223
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,010
I want to try.

224
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:57,647
-She wants to give it a try.
-Do you want to beatbox?

225
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:00,784
I want to try playing the recorder
with my nose.

226
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,185
Can she borrow it?

227
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,721
-It's a little dirty.
-Just wipe it off.

228
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:09,426
-Do you have something to wipe it with?
-We can wipe it for you.

229
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:15,599
I used to play the recorder.

230
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,436
Put it up to your nose.

231
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:22,706
Can I put my nose on this?

232
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,774
-Of course.
-I feel bad.

233
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,215
-We have to guess the song.
-Let's hear a bit more.

234
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,556
Oh, I know this one.

235
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,227
<i>Takedown, takedown</i>
<i>Takedown, down, down, down</i>

236
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:46,997
It was <i>Takedown. </i>Thank you for that.

237
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,900
This is actually fun.

238
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:53,270
Can she have your recorder?

239
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:56,039
I need it for school.

240
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,911
-Are you sure you want it back?
-What?

241
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:02,712
I need it for music class.

242
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,615
I can buy you a new one.

243
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,252
-We'll give it back.
-Okay.

244
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,889
-It must be special to him.
-I feel so bad.

245
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,991
-I wiped it for you.
-Okay.

246
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,137
That was a lovely performance
from our little friend.

247
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:31,308
Now, we've got plenty of fun segments
lined up for you today,

248
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,143
and up next is "What's in My Bag."

249
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:37,647
We've got one of your bags here,

250
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:42,018
-and we're going to see what's inside.
-That's Jeongyeon's bag.

251
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,554
Is this your bag, Jeongyeon?

252
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:47,090
-Yes, it's mine.
-She really loves that bag.

253
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:49,492
I can tell. This key chain is…

254
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,061
It's a bit dirty, right?

255
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:53,230
It looks a little worn out.

256
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:57,367
-May I open it?
-Yes.

257
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:01,037
-Sudoku. I love doing these.
-I want one.

258
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:02,973
-I'm pretty good at it.
-Really?

259
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,208
-You've filled in a lot of numbers.
-I have.

260
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:09,045
I do it when I'm at home
or when I'm waiting around.

261
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:11,514
This is interesting.
You have a photo card.

262
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:13,450
You carry that around?

263
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:17,988
SECOND PRIZED POSSESSION:
PARK JINYOUNG'S PHOTO CARD

264
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:21,992
That's Jeongyeon's…

265
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:25,528
-Is this one of your prized possessions?
-Yes, it is.

266
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:27,964
It's kind of like Nayeon's thing.

267
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:31,601
Carrying that around
is supposed to attract wealth.

268
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:35,105
You must really like him
if you carry this around.

269
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:36,239
I do.

270
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,208
I had no idea.

271
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,977
-You must really like him.
-I do.

272
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:42,779
-He's our producer.
-What?

273
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,390
Out of all of these…

274
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:57,060
Which photo card do you like the best?

275
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:58,295
I think it's this one.

276
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:00,664
-My favorite photo card?
-Yes.

277
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,467
I like the ones
where he makes faces like this.

278
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,169
-That cheeky look?
-Yes.

279
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:09,239
-I thought you'd like this one.
-I like that one, too.

280
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,041
-You like the sexy look?
-I do.

281
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:14,344
-Those were Park Jinyoung's photo cards.
-I really like them.

282
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,280
Who is this?

283
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:19,549
Who is that?

284
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:22,118
Corporal Park Jiin,
requesting permission to speak.

285
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:23,220
That's my brother.

286
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:26,056
This is a picture of his brother.

287
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:29,292
THIRD PRIZED POSSESSION:
PHOTO OF PARK JIIN'S BROTHER

288
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:32,929
What's this?

289
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,034
This bat plushie looks like
Park Jiin's brother.

290
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:40,637
HIS LIPS TREMBLE
AT HOW ABSURD THAT SOUNDED

291
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:48,278
That's so cute. A bat plushie.

292
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,950
I'd like to thank Jeongyeon
for showing us what's in her bag.

293
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:57,387
Next up, we've prepared a fun little game.

294
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:00,924
I love chatting with you guys,
but now we're going to play a game.

295
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,159
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

296
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:08,098
You have to name the person in the photo
within three seconds.

297
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:12,002
Even if you're not sure who it is,

298
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:15,305
as long as your answer sounds believable,
we'll move along.

299
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:16,806
We'll start with Jeongyeon.

300
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,508
Did you know we share the same last name?

301
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,411
-Which Yoo are you?
-I'm Yoo from the Kigye clan.

302
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:23,947
-It's not the same.
-Really? I'm sorry.

303
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,550
-The Chinese character…
-It's Yoo as in "willow."

304
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,953
For me, it's Yoo as in "Kigye."
It's a Chinese character.

305
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,789
-What does that mean?
-What?

306
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,858
There's a Yoo clan from Kigye clan.

307
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,693
Right, but you said
it's a Chinese character.

308
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,664
-They're all Chinese characters.
-Isn't that what you asked?

309
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,033
What's your ancestral origin?

310
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,001
-That's what I asked.
-I see.

311
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:47,370
Yoo as in "willow,"
from the Jinju Angang clan.

312
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:50,140
South Chungcheong… I actually don't know.

313
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,047
-Why did you say it was the same?
-I thought it was.

314
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:59,149
What?

315
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:00,450
Who got caught?

316
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,587
-Who is it?
-It's you, Jeongyeon.

317
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:05,989
-Me?
-Maybe you got too many warnings.

318
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,791
I want to keep playing.

319
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:12,629
You have been eliminated.
Please go to the Quiet Room.

320
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:13,930
Can she laugh in there?

321
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:15,432
-Can I laugh in there?
-Yes.

322
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:16,566
Laugh your heart out.

323
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,101
-Hold on.
-Okay.

324
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,236
Okay, it's open.

325
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:33,283
Let's begin the game.

326
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,887
Once the producer holds up a photo,
you'll have three seconds to answer.

327
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:39,489
Ready, go!

328
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,258
-One, two, three.
-Dahyun!

329
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:43,994
-One, two, three.
-Haewon!

330
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:47,530
-One, two, three.
-Gong Geunsik!

331
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,068
-One, two, three.
-His brother.

332
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:54,437
-He's Park Jiin's brother.
-Really?

333
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:59,910
-One, two, three.
-Laclabeth.

334
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:01,344
That name doesn't exist.

335
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,413
-It could.
-You never know.

336
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,248
-You never know.
-You're right.

337
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,983
One, two, three.

338
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,252
-Mbappé.
-Mbappé.

339
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,421
-One, two, three.
-Lee Junhyuk.

340
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,157
But that's you.

341
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:16,693
Let it go.

342
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,863
-One, two, three.
-Sofia?

343
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,232
Sofia is a woman's name, though.

344
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,600
One, two, three.

345
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:29,773
Leearsby?

346
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,841
-Leearsby.
-Hold on.

347
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,379
Give him a warning!

348
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:40,817
She just keeps blurting out names
that don't even exist.

349
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,353
Can Jeongyeon come out now?

350
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,922
All right, let's wrap up this game here.

351
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:49,259
Since I laughed,
Jeongyeon gets another chance.

352
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,760
You can come out now.

353
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:53,563
-I think she's happier in there.
-You can't laugh now.

354
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:56,600
Okay.

355
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,168
-Did you like it in there?
-Yes.

356
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:03,240
-We've reached the final part of the show.
-Already?

357
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:06,376
So, we've prepared something meaningful.

358
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:10,814
-Jihyo has a big milestone this year.
-Okay.

359
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:14,818
-It's been 20 years since she joined JYP.
-That's right.

360
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:19,823
So we'd like to hold an awards ceremony
in honor of Jihyo's 20 years at JYP.

361
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,659
-That's so touching.
-Before we begin the ceremony,

362
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,728
we'll hear a congratulatory speech.

363
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,033
Hello, I'm Jung Heeyeon,
and I'm training to be a K-pop artist.

364
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,205
It's an honor to give this speech
for someone I deeply admire.

365
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:39,476
I heard you joined JYP in 2005.

366
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:43,980
That's actually the year I was born,
and I just joined an agency this year.

367
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:47,017
It's such an honor to finally meet you,

368
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:52,622
a living legend
I'd only heard about in myths.

369
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:55,525
Back then, there were no smartphones,

370
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:59,162
no streaming platforms,
and you had to use cassette players.

371
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:04,167
You even had to watch performances on DMB.
That must've been so tough.

372
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:07,971
I heard phones used to have
antennas sticking out of them back then.

373
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,073
That's crazy.

374
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,375
You must've watched <i>Hur Jun</i>
when it was airing.

375
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,811
That's seriously crazy.

376
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:17,681
-Did we have antennas back then?
-For two long decades,

377
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:20,183
you've witnessed
the rise and fall of K-pop.

378
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,485
You're a living legend
in the history of girl groups.

379
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:26,957
You joined JYP the day after
Park Jisung joined Manchester United.

380
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:31,461
The 16th, 17th, 18th,
19th, 20th, 21st president…

381
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:34,764
You've seen five presidents
throughout your career,

382
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:39,469
yet you're still standing tall
and steadfast at JYP.

383
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:43,873
I'd like to congratulate you
on your 20th anniversary with JYP.

384
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:49,746
-That's impressive.
-That was a heartfelt speech.

385
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:54,417
As a veteran artist,
could you share a few words of advice?

386
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:57,320
Well…

387
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:03,960
You were born in 2005
and just joined an agency this year.

388
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:06,630
You might've started a bit late.

389
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:11,334
So you'll need to work even harder,
and I hope you stay strong.

390
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:17,607
Those were words that cut deep.

391
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:20,310
Priceless wisdom
from a veteran in the industry.

392
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,579
Okay, it's time to present the awards.

393
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:24,347
We actually have a few others here

394
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:26,950
who are also celebrating
their 20th anniversary.

395
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:29,519
-Would it be okay if we honored them, too?
-Of course.

396
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:31,221
-Mr. Kang Chunggu.
-Yes.

397
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:32,622
Please come to the front.

398
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:42,299
Congratulations to your soccer club
on reaching its 20th anniversary.

399
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,767
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

400
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,503
Ms. Park Chunja.

401
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:56,413
It's been 20 years since you were named
an Intangible Cultural Heritage holder.

402
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,948
Congratulations.

403
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:05,121
This next person debuted before
the L* Chocolate phone was even released.

404
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:07,257
Jihyo, please step forward.

405
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,696
Congratulations
on your 20th anniversary with JYP.

406
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:13,763
Thank you.

407
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:15,532
Thank you.

408
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,768
Let's have the three of you
stand together for a photo.

409
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:22,005
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

410
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:27,544
Okay.

411
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,751
Congratulations once again.
You may be seated now.

412
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:36,253
Thank you.

413
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,491
They may come from different fields,

414
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:45,328
but we've honored the veterans
who've stood strong for 20 years.

415
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:48,331
Jihyo, would you like to give
an acceptance speech?

416
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:54,571
It really feels like you put
a lot of thought into today's show.

417
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:56,873
So thank you so much.

418
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,644
We're really honored to appear

419
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,079
as the first guests
of The Quiet Interview.

420
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:07,017
Thank you. I'm sure TWICE
will keep going strong past 20 years,

421
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,220
and onto 30, 40, 50, even 100.

422
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:13,723
Could we also hear how the two of you
felt about today's shoot?

423
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,528
It means a lot that you came
to celebrate with us today.

424
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:22,365
I also want to thank the people
who dressed up today.

425
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:27,137
Thank you for the caricatures
and for making today a fun experience.

426
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:29,005
That's a bad drawing.

427
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:31,541
I actually see the resemblance.

428
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,145
How was it for you, Jeongyeon?

429
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:37,647
-I really wanted to be on this show.
-Really?

430
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:42,953
I always watch your videos
on streaming platforms.

431
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,756
So when I met you,
it felt like I was seeing an old friend.

432
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:52,362
I thought we shared the same last name,
so I was shocked to learn we don't.

433
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:56,099
-Do you use the "willow" character?
-No, it's "Kigye."

434
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,701
So it's "Kigye."

435
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,636
We use different characters.

436
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:01,838
-So it's not the same.
-That's correct.

437
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:08,078
We only give guests a chance
to share their promos or closing remarks

438
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:11,248
if they all survive
without getting eliminated.

439
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:14,918
Since all three of you were…
I mean, are here today,

440
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:16,953
I'll give you…

441
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:21,324
-You just laughed.
-You need to go to the Quiet Room.

442
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:23,593
-Bye.
-Wait.

443
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,496
We'll be your hosts
starting from episode two.

444
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:29,099
Okay, I'll continue from here.

445
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:33,270
Since the three of you made it to the end,
you can share…

446
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:36,973
-We had such a lovely time today.
-…your promos--

447
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,847
We've always wanted to host a show
on an OTT platform. Right?

448
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:47,117
-That's right.
-We've never been on an OTT platform.

449
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:52,522
So we want to thank you
for giving us a chance to host this show.

450
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:57,994
We'll do our best to keep things
running smoothly from here on out.

451
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:01,965
All right, it looks like
we're just about out of time now.

452
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,167
Happy tenth anniversary to us, TWICE.

453
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:07,737
Before we go, we'd like to say goodbye.

454
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:09,039
One, two, three.

455
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,273
-HICE.
-HICE.

456
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:30,493
THE QUIET INTERVIEW

457
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:35,232
HOST: YOO BYUNGJAE

458
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:42,305
GUESTS: TWICE'S NAYEON, JEONGYEON, JIHYO
