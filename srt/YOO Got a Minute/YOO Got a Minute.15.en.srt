1
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:03,113
Hello.

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,149
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:11,721
Today's guest has a smile
that feels like a warm spring day.

4
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:16,359
It's the kind of smile that could melt
the frozen Hangang River.

5
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:19,362
But when that smile fades,

6
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:24,267
it can make the air turn icy,
letting a chill settle in.

7
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:27,504
Will a spring breeze
fill the studio today,

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:29,472
or will the chill of winter take over?

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,642
Let's quietly welcome our guest.

10
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,357
Hello.

11
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:52,562
Hello.

12
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:56,833
Where is it?

13
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,209
Hello.

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,645
Hello.

15
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:10,881
Hello.

16
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:36,539
Could you please take a look
at the audience members?

17
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:40,777
They came all this way just for you, Chuu.

18
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:44,481
Some of them look familiar.

19
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,349
Hello, I'm Chuu.

20
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,586
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for coming.

21
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,988
YUCHAN CAN PROTECT CHUU
PROTECT MY HEART, CHUU

22
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:55,792
This is amazing.

23
00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:05,035
Chuu actually joined us
on <i>No-Laughing Birthday Party </i>before.

24
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,102
I did.

25
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,971
The Quiet Interview is a bit different.

26
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,641
-So let me go over the rules with you.
-Yes, please.

27
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,543
It's simple. You can't laugh.

28
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,813
These cameras in front of us
aren't just any cameras.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,583
They're equipped with
a cutting-edge AI detection system.

30
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:20,650
What?

31
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:26,823
They detect in real-time
whether you're smiling or laughing.

32
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,927
If you let out a giggle,
you'll hear a warning sound.

33
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:32,162
A warning sound?

34
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,731
-I see.
-You'll hear that sound.

35
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:39,035
And if it's clear to everyone
that you've burst out laughing,

36
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:42,906
a much louder siren will go off.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,684
We have our "siren guy" here on set,
assisting with that.

38
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:55,752
Okay.

39
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,554
Once the siren goes off,

40
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:00,457
you'll be sent to the Quiet Room
for five minutes,

41
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:04,160
where you'll spend
a lonely and isolated time.

42
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,228
-Me?
-Yes.

43
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:08,498
-I see.
-And if I happen to laugh,

44
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,800
you'll be able to come back and join us.

45
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,969
So your strategy could be
to make me laugh.

46
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,204
Got it.

47
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:17,540
As I've mentioned before,
I'm a huge fan of yours.

48
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:19,743
And I've been watching
<i>Chuu Can Do It </i>for ages.

49
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,811
I remember almost every little moment.

50
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:24,748
What I love most is
how the show inspires people

51
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:28,785
to protect the environment
and care for the planet.

52
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,387
Thank you so much.

53
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,156
Have you been practicing
what you learned on the show?

54
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,025
Yes, I have.

55
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:39,195
My parents and friends
put a lot of it into practice as well.

56
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:42,065
-Some friends keep it up to this day.
-Really?

57
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:45,101
We were so inspired by your channel

58
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:49,105
that we've made
The Quiet Interview eco-friendly too.

59
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:52,509
-Do you see the person on the bicycle?
-Yes.

60
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,978
-The lighting and the cameras on set…
-I see.

61
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:58,949
…are currently being powered
by that bicycle generator.

62
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,517
-Really?
-Yes.

63
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,019
It's something we felt strongly about.

64
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:06,289
The Earth and every living creature on it

65
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,758
-are truly precious.
-Right.

66
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,160
That's why… Hey, you!

67
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:11,228
Hey!

68
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,697
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:15,432
Good.

70
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,940
I'm so sad.

71
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:27,410
I was actually crying.

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,281
Hey.

73
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,016
-Hey!
-Yo!

74
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,051
-Yes?
-The Earth is hurting.

75
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:36,786
It's hurting.

76
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,722
-So push through the pain.
-Push.

77
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:40,690
Keep pedaling.

78
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:44,294
Faster.

79
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,363
Faster!

80
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:47,664
So it was true.

81
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:55,639
Welcome to the eco-friendly talk show,
The Quiet Interview.

82
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,440
Chuu is our guest for today.

83
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,143
The warning sound went off earlier.

84
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,081
I know you laugh a lot
and always have a smile on your face.

85
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:09,719
So, for the first time ever,
we've prepared a special segment for you.

86
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:10,954
What kind…

87
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,323
-What did you just say?
-What kind of rule?

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,225
You see, I…

89
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:20,363
No! What do I do?

90
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,032
-You're okay for now.
-Really?

91
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,269
It's okay to laugh now.

92
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:30,807
We've prepared a special segment
where you can laugh as much as you want.

93
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:34,711
So for this segment,
we've invited a comedian

94
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,381
whose jokes land perfectly every time.

95
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:42,786
We'll give you some time
to just sit back and laugh at his jokes.

96
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:44,120
-Okay.
-Where is he?

97
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:46,590
I'm right here. Hello.

98
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:47,958
-Hello.
-All right.

99
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,827
-Should I start?
-Yes, go ahead.

100
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:55,665
What's the opposite of a stand-up cop?

101
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:57,267
A dirty cop?

102
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,369
A sit-down cop.

103
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,738
-I see.
-Okay.

104
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:08,678
What happens if Chuu gets electrocuted?

105
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,280
Pikachuu!

106
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,549
-You knew that one.
-Yes!

107
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:19,155
That was just a joke.
We don't want you to get electrocuted.

108
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:23,760
-I'm thinking of going to Japan.
-Okay.

109
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:27,864
I'm planning to go to Fukuoka.
Just going to Fuku-soak in the culture.

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,302
That was Choi Useon.

111
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,574
Goodbye, everyone.

112
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:43,513
That wraps up this segment.
Now the no-laugh rule is in full effect.

113
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,549
Let's talk about what's new with you.

114
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,952
From music to variety shows to dramas,

115
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,455
you've truly been active
across the board this year.

116
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,025
You even took on
a serious acting role this time.

117
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:56,760
-Is that right?
-Yes.

118
00:06:56,826 --> 00:07:00,397
<i>-My Girlfriend Is The Man!</i>
-Yes, it aired on KBS.

119
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,465
Thanks to your performance,

120
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:05,068
the show recorded
a remarkable 13.1% viewership,

121
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,938
-an impressive feat in this OTT era.
-What?

122
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,674
-Wait.
-I don't think it was 13.1%.

123
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,509
-My apologies.
-Yes.

124
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:14,277
Sorry, one second.

125
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,148
What? "Add it up"?

126
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:19,716
What do you mean?

127
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:24,354
-How many episodes were there?
-Twelve episodes.

128
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,488
"Add it up"?

129
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,993
You can't say it like that.
What were you thinking?

130
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,061
Seriously.

131
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,196
Just because the ratings weren't great…

132
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:35,131
No show gets 13% these days.

133
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,601
Yeah, that's crazy.

134
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:42,272
So you added up
all 12 episodes to get 13.1%?

135
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:44,107
Okay.

136
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:45,375
She's laughing!

137
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:47,744
Are you laughing?

138
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:52,749
Let's talk about your variety shows.
You're a regular on so many.

139
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:56,887
You've got your channel, <i>Chuu Can Do It,</i>
and you were also on <i>Steel Troops.</i>

140
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:01,491
They received so much love,
and I enjoyed watching them too.

141
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:05,128
-Really?
-Yes. You were also on <i>The Devil's Plan…</i>

142
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:06,796
One second.

143
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,903
Why did you write this?
What's wrong with you?

144
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:18,708
Did you do the research?
She wasn't on <i>The Devil's Plan.</i>

145
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,678
-I was on it briefly.
-Hey.

146
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,948
I watched that show twice,
from beginning to end.

147
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,285
-I was on it.
-I watched it twice.

148
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:33,256
I only went to pee once.

149
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,594
This is ridiculous.

150
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,570
I must have appeared
when you went to the bathroom.

151
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:49,873
I apologize,
it seems there was a slight error.

152
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,509
But rules are rules,
so please head to the Quiet Room.

153
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:53,643
-Me?
-Yes.

154
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,546
I just want to make it clear
that I did appear on the show.

155
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,348
You must've peed for a long time.

156
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:01,618
I was on the first and second episodes.

157
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:10,093
Unfortunately, our guest has been confined
to the Quiet Room.

158
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,429
But our show must go on.

159
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:16,800
We anticipated this situation
and invited a substitute in advance.

160
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,203
This person is bright, bubbly,
and has puppy-like features,

161
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,671
just like Chuu.

162
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,139
Really? Who is it?

163
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:27,711
They asked to be introduced
as the "Second Chuu."

164
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:28,778
Who is it?

165
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,380
Let's welcome them.

166
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:40,223
No way!

167
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,559
Hello, I'm Chuu.

168
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,660
What? No!

169
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,095
Thanks for coming today.

170
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:46,897
Good to see you, Chuu.

171
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,565
That's not Chuu.

172
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:55,038
I feel like I'd get in trouble
if I don't ask you to do this.

173
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:59,109
Could you show the viewers
your iconic "biting heart"?

174
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:06,716
That's great.

175
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,685
-No.
-Let's keep it going.

176
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:11,421
Could you show us
the viral "Frozen Cat Challenge"?

177
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,491
Oh, my goodness.

178
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,360
A cat walks across
the frozen Hangang River.

179
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:25,468
A cat walks across
the frozen Hangang River.

180
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:33,677
Final question.

181
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,413
You just had a smoke, didn't you?

182
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:41,151
-I'm Chuu, so--
-No.

183
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,653
You just smoked a cigarette, right?

184
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,056
Well…

185
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,525
-I'm just--
-I'm asking because I can smell it.

186
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:49,893
Yes, I did.

187
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:55,131
Sorry, but we can't have smokers here.
Please go back to your seat.

188
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,199
Thank you.

189
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,874
It's been five minutes,
so you can come back.

190
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:06,810
I'm the real Chuu.

191
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,478
-Yes, please come back.
-Okay.

192
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,813
Thank you.

193
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,951
We weren't trying to collect
heartwarming stories about you,

194
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:20,223
but someone on our crew said
they worked with you before

195
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,592
-and had a good story to share.
-Really?

196
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,629
Do you recognize anyone here?

197
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:26,796
Yes.

198
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,531
-I see.
-I know him.

199
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,534
He worked as a producer on <i>Chuu Can Do It…</i>

200
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,303
-I know.
-…and now works with us.

201
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,871
-Do you remember him?
-Of course.

202
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,606
I recognized him right away.

203
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:40,277
Please start by introducing yourself
and then share your story.

204
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:43,079
-He wrote a letter.
-Really?

205
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,885
Hi, I'm Park Sanghyeok,
a former producer on <i>Chuu Can Do It.</i>

206
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,321
Park Sanghyeok! Sorry.

207
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:55,425
Chuu is the most professional celebrity
I have ever met.

208
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:56,526
Really?

209
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:59,296
When I would nap during breaks on set,

210
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,898
she'd personally go and buy me hot coffee.

211
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,400
-What?
-You're very kind.

212
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:06,369
Looking after the crew
during shoots isn't easy.

213
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:10,140
I've read a lot of comments
that talk about how nice you are.

214
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,275
She poured the hot coffee on my thigh.

215
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:17,414
When I screamed,
she kicked me in the shin a few times

216
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,183
to remind me we were on set.

217
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:24,821
CHUU WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

218
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:28,225
-Chuu always carried a magnifying glass.
-How cute.

219
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,061
She would use it to burn ants
when shoots ran long.

220
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,331
Then one day, she said we had to film

221
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:37,567
a sequel to the "Frozen Cat Challenge,"
but with a dog this time.

222
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:42,739
She told me to fetch a golden retriever
and freeze the Hangang River.

223
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:43,974
I see.

224
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,642
It was August.

225
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,311
I managed to find a dog,

226
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:51,681
but since it was a labrador retriever
and not a golden retriever,

227
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:55,619
she hit me with brass knuckles,
leaving me with short-term memory loss.

228
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:56,686
Oh, dear.

229
00:12:56,753 --> 00:13:02,592
Despite his short-term memory loss,
he came here to share this story.

230
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,060
So let's give him a hand.

231
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,531
How is this a heartwarming story?
Also, that was all a lie.

232
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,433
Was it a lie?

233
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,003
-Yes, it was.
-Which part?

234
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:16,406
The only true thing he said was
that he was a producer on <i>Chuu Can Do It.</i>

235
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:20,610
But he said you were the most
professional celebrity he's ever met.

236
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,479
I'm not a professional.

237
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,715
I'm still an ama-Chuu-r.

238
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:31,021
All right, thank you for clearing that up.

239
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:33,890
Yes?

240
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,093
Do you have more to say?

241
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:42,198
Hi, I'm Park Sanghyeok,
a former producer on <i>Chuu Can Do It.</i>

242
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:45,802
Chuu is the most professional celebrity
I have ever met.

243
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,905
-When I would nap during breaks on set…
-What?

244
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,040
…she'd personally--

245
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:51,441
-We…
-What's going on?

246
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,176
Maybe you should try again later.

247
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,145
Sorry about that.

248
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:58,615
Let's continue with the questions.

249
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:03,153
One of the reasons I became
such a big fan of yours

250
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,523
is because of your bright,
positive energy.

251
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,692
What do you think your real charm is?

252
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:10,660
My real charm?

253
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:13,396
I want to be everyone's sunshine.

254
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,932
-Everyone's…
-Sunshine.

255
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:19,603
-Do you want to be the sun?
-No.

256
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,171
Sunshine.

257
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,672
-Like spring sunshine?
-Yes.

258
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,809
But what does that even mean?

259
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,645
Some celebrities get called
the girl next door or sweetheart.

260
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,480
-The heart-stealer.
-That's right.

261
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:33,483
They get a lot of nicknames like that.

262
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,455
But I don't want to be labeled like that.

263
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:41,791
I just want to be someone
who feels warm and approachable,

264
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:44,294
-like sunshine.
-Someone who feels like sunshine.

265
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,831
Now that I think about it,
I don't think anyone has been called

266
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:49,499
-"everyone's sunshine."
-Right?

267
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,001
I want to be the first.

268
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,704
That's great. This is something
I always ask everyone.

269
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,741
What's a N*tflix show
you've enjoyed recently?

270
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:59,676
I enjoyed <i>You and Everything Else.</i>

271
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,811
-It's the best.
-It's so good.

272
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:06,583
It's a bit difficult to get into at first
because it's not sensational,

273
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,685
but everyone who's watched it
recommends it.

274
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:11,788
-It's serene, and the acting was great.
-It's the best.

275
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,624
-Anything else you've watched?
-On N*tflix?

276
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:15,692
<i>The Devil's Plan.</i>

277
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,961
That was also a huge hit.

278
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:20,463
-There are hardcore fans of that genre.
-Yes.

279
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,235
Could you recommend a N*tflix show
to our viewers on Disney+?

280
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:26,636
I almost forgot.

281
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:29,940
You asked,
so I just said what came to mind.

282
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:32,208
<i>You and Everything Else…</i>

283
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:35,545
Disney+ has the best shows.

284
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:39,649
-Don't do this to me.
-What are you watching?

285
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,551
-On Disney+?
-Yes.

286
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:55,098
Right! I saw <i>Big Bet.</i>

287
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:56,399
That's unexpected.

288
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:01,338
And also this show.
Sorry, that took me a minute.

289
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:03,740
I saw The Quiet Interview!

290
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:05,709
Our show hasn't aired yet.

291
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,577
Exactly! Oh, right.

292
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:15,552
It just felt like…

293
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:18,288
-We have a liar with us today.
-Help me, Sanghyeok.

294
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,523
-Let's move on.
-Okay.

295
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,227
You're making strides
as both a singer and an actor.

296
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,629
How are they different?

297
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:32,035
On stage, I can go wherever my heart
and my fans lead me.

298
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:37,173
There's a sense of freedom in being able
to connect with my fans directly.

299
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,610
With acting, when I memorize my lines…

300
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:42,312
I'm still learning, of course.

301
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,680
Talking to the director

302
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:48,018
and trying out different ways
to deliver a line is really fun.

303
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,587
And when I watch it later,

304
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:55,292
I feel this sense of pride and joy.

305
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:59,296
That's wonderful.
Let's move on to the next question.

306
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:03,767
-Hi, I'm Park Sanghyeok.
-Hold on. There he goes again.

307
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,337
Chuu is the most professional celebrity
I have ever met.

308
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,105
-You said that…
-When I would nap…

309
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:10,941
-You said that already.
-Sorry.

310
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:12,075
Sanghyeok.

311
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:14,778
I apologize. Let's keep going.

312
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:21,084
You're known for your bright
and lovable personality.

313
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,687
But after watching
a lot of your videos and content,

314
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:29,159
I felt like you have
a bit of a tough side too.

315
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:33,496
So I thought it'd be fun to bring that out
with a short acting scene.

316
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:37,100
-Can we act out a scene together?
-I love doing improv.

317
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,401
-I really do.
-Great.

318
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:41,338
Instead of doing improv, we have a script.

319
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,872
I'll play Sukwoo.

320
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,742
-You can play Cha Moosik.
-Okay.

321
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:50,847
"Moosik, can you lend me
just 100 million won? Please?"

322
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:52,515
"Are you done already?"

323
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,790
Sorry, I wasn't happy with my acting.
Let's do that again.

324
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:03,860
I need to act more pathetic.

325
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:09,165
"Moosik, can you lend me
just 100 million won? Please?"

326
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:10,901
"Are you done already?"

327
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,673
"Yeah. I have absolutely nothing
right now. I'm penniless."

328
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,475
"Is that so?"

329
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,045
"Is that…"

330
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,950
"Is that all you had?"

331
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:37,627
CAUGHT UP IN THEIR ACTING,
THEY FORGOT THE NO-LAUGH RULE

332
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:39,863
I'm so sorry, I'll go again.

333
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,131
So…

334
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,067
"Is that so? Is that all you had?"

335
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,943
Applause, everyone.

336
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,814
Seriously, this is a tough role.

337
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:01,451
I said I was a fan first,

338
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:03,954
-but I think the feeling's mutual.
-You're right.

339
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,056
We love each other's content.

340
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:11,027
So I've prepared a quiz about me.
You should be able to get these right.

341
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:15,832
"Which of the following messages
was written in Yoo Byungjae's yearbook?"

342
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,767
-Okay.
-"Who are you?"

343
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,036
Oh, no.

344
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:24,874
"Thanks for switching seats with me.
Take care."

345
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:26,376
Oh, my gosh.

346
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:30,547
"Thanks for a great year, Changseop.
Let's hang out again."

347
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:31,748
Changseop?

348
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,318
-"No one wrote anything."
-No way.

349
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,956
I feel like you were popular, though.

350
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:42,292
You're a bit shy,

351
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,761
but everyone likes you
because you're funny.

352
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:48,632
I bet they wanted to carry you around
like a little Pocket Girl.

353
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:50,100
Sorry, you're not a girl.

354
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,837
I meant, P*k*mon.

355
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:57,641
No, wait. Sorry, I meant Pocket Man.

356
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:05,348
I can't believe I said P*k*mon.

357
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,086
Sorry, I meant Pocket Man.

358
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:14,891
I'm sorry, I used to be a Pocket Girl.

359
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,694
I was always the shortest
or second shortest in class.

360
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:22,132
I heard you were too, so I figured
you might've been a Pocket Man.

361
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:23,333
You said "P*k*mon."

362
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,302
I'm so sorry.

363
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:30,140
The siren went off,
but since I laughed while we were acting,

364
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,208
-I'll let it slide.
-I'm sorry.

365
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:38,848
You're so expressive that
some people call you the human emoji.

366
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:42,619
That's why we've prepared
a little emoji interview.

367
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:46,356
I'll ask you a question,
but instead of answering out loud,

368
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:48,959
-you'll reply with an emoji.
-Okay.

369
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:54,197
What would you like to say to our viewers
watching The Quiet Interview?

370
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:57,968
Hello, viewers of The Quiet Interview!
This is Chuu.

371
00:20:58,034 --> 00:20:59,869
Nice to meet you!

372
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,373
-That was very cheerful.
-Yes.

373
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,043
-I'll take this since you've used it.
-Wait, but earlier…

374
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:13,216
Which emoji best represents Kim Jiwoo?
Please hold up an emoji.

375
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,151
Oh, my gosh.

376
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:18,288
I can't use any of these. Maybe this one?

377
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:20,891
Why that one?

378
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:23,660
-I use this emoji all the time.
-Really?

379
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,730
When I ask my friends where they are,
I always send this emoji.

380
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:33,503
So when they saw it was my most used one,
they said they weren't surprised.

381
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,872
-This and--
-That emoji is so you.

382
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,775
I'll probably think of you
when I see that now.

383
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,344
Please give that to me.

384
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:46,883
-But…
-Please let go. We have to move on.

385
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:56,426
I heard you had a very special reason
for appearing on our show today.

386
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,464
The Quiet Interview?

387
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,167
How many questions are left?

388
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:06,069
-Three.
-Three?

389
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:09,639
The Quiet Interview?

390
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:11,775
-Pick one.
-I guess this one.

391
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:13,510
What does that mean?

392
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,178
I actually don't know.

393
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:18,949
I don't even know
if I'm getting paid to be here.

394
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:22,085
Then, is it okay if we don't pay you?

395
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,529
Before we move on,

396
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:35,532
let's get a quick thumbnail
and a few still photos.

397
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,269
-You're taking it from there?
-Yes.

398
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:41,438
-Let's look at that camera.
-Okay.

399
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:42,939
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

400
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,442
Wait, you're not in the frame, Byungjae.

401
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:48,378
Wait, you're not in the frame, Byungjae.

402
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,180
-Please move closer to Chuu.
-Okay.

403
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:51,948
-You stay. I'll move.
-Okay.

404
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:53,950
-Okay, here we go.
-Sure.

405
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,390
Sorry, Byungjae, but your face
looks three times bigger than hers.

406
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:02,759
-Could you step back just a bit?
-Okay.

407
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,161
-Farther.
-We can edit it later.

408
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:06,596
-A little more.
-Really?

409
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,632
-Go way back.
-His face isn't that big.

410
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:10,634
-Keep going.
-How's this?

411
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,502
Keep going until I tell you to stop.

412
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:16,139
You'll have to step down.

413
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:17,707
Keep going.

414
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,877
He's going to fall off the stage.

415
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:22,279
No, it's not enough.

416
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,314
How about you just go home?

417
00:23:30,186 --> 00:23:33,223
-Can you go farther back?
-This is as far as I can go.

418
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,558
We'll shoot it later.

419
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:36,660
Okay. I guess there's nothing we can do.

420
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:40,196
You can send a picture of yourself later.

421
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:43,033
They can edit it in.
It's easy to do these days.

422
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:48,905
It's already time for the final segment
of The Quiet Interview.

423
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:50,607
We've prepared…

424
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:53,343
-Hey!
-I can't do this anymore.

425
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,546
The Earth is hurting!

426
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:58,114
My butt hurts so much.

427
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:01,251
I said the Earth is hurting.

428
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:02,652
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:03,720
Keep pedaling.

430
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:07,557
-Keep going! Faster!
-He's quite muscular.

431
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:14,331
You're watching The Quiet Interview,
an eco-friendly talk show.

432
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:16,099
To be perfectly honest,

433
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,202
we've let you off the hook
more than any other guest.

434
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,404
You just couldn't stop laughing.

435
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,939
-I'm sorry.
-So, we…

436
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:28,712
-Could I ask for a personal favor?
-Sure.

437
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:30,881
Can we act out <i>Big Bet </i>one more time?

438
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,183
Really? How's that a personal favor?

439
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,619
I personally loved the show.

440
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:38,388
-Really?
-I just want to act it out one more time.

441
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,257
-Did I do a good job before?
-Of course.

442
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:43,360
-Really?
-Yes, just add your own flair to it.

443
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,130
-"Moosik."
-"Are you…" Sorry.

444
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,700
THE QUIET INTERVIEW

445
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:59,776
"Moosik, can you lend me
just 100 million won? Please?"

446
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:01,311
"Are you done already?"

447
00:25:03,346 --> 00:25:07,851
"Yeah. I have absolutely nothing
right now. I'm penniless."

448
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,856
"Is that so? Is that all you had?"

449
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:16,159
"I lost 20 billion won."

450
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,762
"So you only started with 20 billion won?"

451
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:24,267
"From the way you were gambling,
I thought you were a chaebol CEO."

452
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,770
"I guess…"

453
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,140
"I guess you've really got--"

454
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:38,415
"I guess you've really got
to snap out of it now."

455
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:40,250
The siren went off.

456
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:44,955
"Hold on. Ten days? Write me an IOU."

457
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,691
"Hey, bring me paper and a pen."

458
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:50,994
"Hey! Bring me paper…"

459
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:54,831
You can say your final goodbye
from the Quiet Room.

460
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:57,867
-Okay.
-I wanted to try this one more time.

461
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:01,137
-Can I try this scene from the room?
-Sure.

462
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:04,741
I can do better.
I really enjoy acting, you know?

463
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,243
-It's fun.
-It really is.

464
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:10,614
All right, so that wraps up
my personal request.

465
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,617
-We were supposed to…
-This is hilarious.

466
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:16,453
We were supposed to hear
Chuu's closing thoughts

467
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,656
-or a quick promotional message.
-But…

468
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:22,859
But instead, we'll give that chance
to someone in the audience.

469
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:26,263
Would anyone like to say a few words?

470
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:28,164
-I would.
-No, wait a minute!

471
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,966
Then why did I do all this?

472
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:34,137
Hi, I'm Park Sanghyeok,
a former producer on <i>Chuu Can Do It.</i>

473
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:37,874
Chuu was the most professional celebrity
I have ever met.

474
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,810
-When I would nap during breaks on set…
-What the heck?

475
00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:41,878
…she'd personally go

476
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:43,980
-and buy me hot coffee.
-…buy me hot coffee.

477
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:47,017
-She poured the hot coffee on my thigh.
-…hot coffee on my thigh.

478
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,720
When I screamed,
she kicked me in the shin a few times

479
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:54,324
-to remind me we were on set.
-To remind me we were on set.

480
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,894
-Chuu always carried a magnifying glass.
-A magnifying glass.

481
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,262
She would use it

482
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:01,565
-to burn ants when shoots ran long.
-To burn ants.

483
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:03,600
-What the heck?
-She said we had to film

484
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,870
a sequel to the "Frozen Cat Challenge,"
but with a dog this time.

485
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,273
That wraps up this episode
of The Quiet Interview with Chuu.

486
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,976
-Thank you.
-What? Thank you.

487
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:14,778
Thank you.

488
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:17,581
<i>Hi, I'm Park Sanghyeok,</i>
