1
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:03,847
Hello.

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:07,217
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:12,856
Our guests today are the last people
you'd ever describe as quiet.

4
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:17,227
They light up any room
with their bubbly energy,

5
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:19,462
and nothing ever holds them back.

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,198
But today,
they'll have to hold back their laughter.

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,201
Will they be able to hold it in?

8
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:28,939
Let's welcome our guests quietly.

9
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,381
What's the vibe?

10
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,516
Hello.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,051
I'm curious.

12
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:46,923
It's very romantic here.

13
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:49,526
It feels like an escape room.

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,569
It's starting.

15
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,873
What do I do?

16
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:09,880
I CAN'T HOLD BACK MY LAUGHTER

17
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,365
-We haven't started yet, right?
-Right?

18
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,602
No laughing.

19
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,604
-Hello.
-Hello.

20
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,540
-Welcome.
-Hello.

21
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:41,044
All four members
of KISS OF LIFE are here today.

22
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,779
Here, on The Quiet Interview…

23
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:57,594
The interview hasn't started yet,
so we'll let this slide for now.

24
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:02,332
This is the largest number of guests
we've had on this show.

25
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:07,504
What is that?

26
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:13,109
No…

27
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:18,949
-Thank you for inviting us.
-Thank you.

28
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,016
Right.

29
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,087
I'll explain the rules as we go,

30
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:27,691
but for now, could you greet our viewers?

31
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,160
Yes. One, two, three.

32
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,929
-Hello! We're KISS OF LIFE.
-Hello! We're KISS OF LIFE.

33
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:41,838
We're so happy and honored
to be on The Quiet Interview.

34
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:44,507
I think we're going to have
a really fun time today.

35
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:45,575
I agree.

36
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:48,111
Let me briefly explain the rules.

37
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:50,413
It's very simple. You can't laugh.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,449
If you laugh,

39
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:56,052
you'll be sent to the Quiet Room
you see behind me,

40
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,356
where you'll spend
a lonely and isolated time.

41
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:00,523
That's so sad.

42
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,659
Those aren't just regular cameras.

43
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,629
They're equipped with state-of-the-art AI.

44
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:06,696
-Really?
-Yes.

45
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:11,635
They will compare your facial expressions
with human expression patterns.

46
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:16,306
If it detects that you smile a little,
you'll hear a warning sound.

47
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:17,374
That's cool.

48
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:21,144
-Oh, my gosh.
-That's what you'll hear.

49
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:25,282
If it's obvious that you laughed,
like just now,

50
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:28,418
a much louder siren will go off.

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,794
Let's see if…

52
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,300
You've been laughing way too much.

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,104
So we'll start now.
I'll let everything before this slide.

54
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:52,475
If I laugh, you'll be able to come back,
so that could be a good strategy.

55
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,378
-We should make him laugh.
-Let's begin.

56
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:58,114
Okay. Seriously, let's not laugh.

57
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,249
-Wait.
-I'm serious.

58
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:01,418
-Don't laugh.
-Just think about our lives.

59
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,891
Ready, set, go.

60
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,560
All right.

61
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,362
Do you know who I am?

62
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:14,731
-Of course.
-I'm a big fan.

63
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,166
Great.

64
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,735
We'd love to hear each of your mindsets
going into today's interview,

65
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:22,105
but since we're short on time,
let's hear from the member

66
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:26,142
who thinks I look handsome in person.

67
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:35,886
Okay.

68
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,021
You're very handsome.

69
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,592
I'm handsome?

70
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,927
That's not really a mindset.

71
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,363
I'll do my best today.

72
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:47,898
We've got this.

73
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:55,205
As you know,
this show will go up on Disney+.

74
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:59,976
So there's a bit of a time gap
between filming and it being uploaded.

75
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,745
-I see.
-It's a big gap.

76
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,247
We're going to talk about
what's new with you,

77
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,149
but this will go up around December.

78
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:10,453
So let's talk about what KISS OF LIFE
might be doing around that time.

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,556
-Sounds good.
-That sounds good.

80
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:15,191
Your iconic song, <i>Igloo,</i>

81
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:18,361
has unexpectedly hit
the Billboard Hot 100.

82
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,530
We have to make that happen, right?

83
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,365
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

84
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,600
That's a lot of pressure.

85
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,669
And to celebrate,

86
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,338
you generously donated
one billion won to charity.

87
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:30,407
-What?
-Sorry?

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,983
Which one of you took the initiative
to donate the one billion won?

89
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,086
It was me.

90
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,022
-It was BELLE's idea.
-Yes.

91
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,893
But that's strange.
It says you only contributed 57,000 won.

92
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,996
-Yes.
-That's what it says.

93
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:55,699
If you contributed 250 million won each…

94
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:04,441
-Who laughed?
-Who?

95
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:05,875
-Who laughed?
-It wasn't me!

96
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,444
JULIE?

97
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,511
Me?

98
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,014
I think JULIE laughed.

99
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,849
Please go to the Quiet Room.

100
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,985
-I didn't… Did you see me laugh?
-What?

101
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,052
You're lying.

102
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,823
She tends to smile a lot,
so she gets misunderstood a lot.

103
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,360
This won't take long.
We'll bring you back very soon.

104
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,328
You'll look like a painting in there.

105
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:27,898
Can you laugh in that room?

106
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,566
Yes, you can.

107
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,736
Did HANEUL change her name?

108
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,839
-Yes, she did.
-I did.

109
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,274
Why "Park Pyeongsik"?

110
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:42,812
I heard you changed your name

111
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,682
to "Park Pyeongsik"
and switched back to "HANEUL."

112
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:50,153
I changed it briefly
and then switched back.

113
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,023
What is the meaning of that name?

114
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,559
"Park Pyeongsik" means

115
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:01,698
"Let's roar with laughter,
and eat peacefully."

116
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:08,805
She wanted both laughter and good health,
so she changed her name to Park Pyeongsik,

117
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,740
then switched back to HANEUL.

118
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:13,877
-That's right.
-What possessed you to do that?

119
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:15,979
This is amazing, NATTY.

120
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:18,882
You bought your parents a house…

121
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,919
-with your paycheck.
-Yes.

122
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:24,721
That must've been a big decision.

123
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:28,825
It was. I was a trainee for a long time.

124
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:31,795
-So you wanted to treat your parents.
-Yes, that's right.

125
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:37,434
I decided to flex a little
with the money I earned.

126
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,605
You went all out and bought them a house
to show your appreciation.

127
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,340
-We're able to do that now.
-Yeah.

128
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,041
BELLE did something similar.

129
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:48,945
She treated her parents
to N*pong N*epong with her first paycheck.

130
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,448
That place is so yummy.

131
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,183
N*pong N*epong.

132
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,518
Your dad loves that place.

133
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,123
I heard you ordered the Cheese Ragu Ppong.
That dish is a delicacy.

134
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:04,461
-That's right.
-My mouth is watering right now.

135
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:09,232
Before we officially begin the interview,
we're going to…

136
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:16,006
N*PONG N*EPONG

137
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:22,512
Before we officially begin the interview,

138
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,549
our audience members have prepared
an opening performance.

139
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:30,186
And since the time is up,
let's bring JULIE back.

140
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:32,923
We can watch the performance together.

141
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,292
I don't know why,

142
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,662
but I have a feeling
that kid is going to be really funny.

143
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:39,930
It's actually his turn.

144
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:45,602
I hear the kid has something special
prepared just for you.

145
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,171
He's so cute.

146
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,140
Look at those chubby cheeks.

147
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,977
Could you introduce yourself?

148
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:56,947
I'm Lee Juyeol, and I'm in sixth grade.

149
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:58,582
-So cute.
-Are you 13 years old?

150
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:01,051
-Yes.
-May I ask how tall you are?

151
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,387
-No.
-What?

152
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,690
-I don't know.
-Come on, you know.

153
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:07,924
How tall are…

154
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,493
You know how tall you are.

155
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,628
You know.

156
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:13,230
You know.

157
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,065
I'm 5 foot 4.

158
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,266
I see.

159
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,068
How about you?

160
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:20,837
Me? I'm around…

161
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:24,174
-Probably around 4 foot 11.
-That's all?

162
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,778
Our friend here…

163
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:35,418
Our friend prepared a special performance,
so let's give him a round of applause.

164
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,788
-You can give the mic to…
-I saw his foot.

165
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:39,856
Let's go.

166
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:55,572
He's good.

167
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:06,750
He's really good.

168
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,652
A big round of applause, please.

169
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,522
-That was amazing.
-You've got talent.

170
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:13,590
You really do.

171
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:15,625
Wait a second.

172
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,696
It says a monkey who's a KISSY
is here with us. Is that true?

173
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:23,099
That's me.

174
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,835
It's me.

175
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:32,242
My name is Monkey.

176
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,445
There's a reason
why I like KISS OF LIFE so much.

177
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,047
-What is it?
-What's the reason?

178
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:40,684
KISS OF LIFE is so pretty.

179
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,053
-Thank you.
-They dance well.

180
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,288
They're tall, too.

181
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:48,158
That's why I love KISS OF LIFE.

182
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,894
I love you, KISS OF LIFE!

183
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:56,266
Hey, mister. That was you, wasn't it?

184
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:02,739
It wasn't the monkey.

185
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,612
You opened your mouth and said that.

186
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:11,381
-But you know…
-Seriously?

187
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,825
Please enter the Quiet Room, NATTY.

188
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:30,100
Although today is the first time
I'm meeting KISS OF LIFE in person,

189
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,969
I discovered something
while doing some research.

190
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:37,040
-We share some deep parallels.
-Really?

191
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:41,077
Each of you has something
in common with me.

192
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,813
Let's delve into that.

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,881
Okay.

194
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,383
First up is…

195
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,920
-NATTY.
-I want to know, too.

196
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,590
First up is NATTY.

197
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,827
You're an INFP like me, right?

198
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:00,897
I can't hear.

199
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,037
-You can come back now.
-Okay.

200
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,539
Are you a bit shy?

201
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:11,875
Yes, I'm a bit shy when I meet people

202
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,777
-for the first time.
-You're shy.

203
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:18,114
But once I get comfortable, I talk a lot,
and I enjoy being around people.

204
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:21,451
So NATTY and I have INFP in common.

205
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:24,621
Next up is BELLE.

206
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:28,158
I think we have the strongest connection
out of the four.

207
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,493
Any guesses?

208
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:33,597
-Not at all.
-You say that, but…

209
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:37,834
It's Gwangmyeong City, Gyeonggi Province.

210
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,669
Gwangmyeong.

211
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:42,439
I lived in Cheolsan-dong
from 2011 to 2015,

212
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,945
in the Cheolsan Jugong 4th Complex,
right across from the commercial district.

213
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:52,482
Then we probably
ran into each other many times.

214
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:53,783
Exactly.

215
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,686
I was pretty famous back then,
doing <i>SNL Korea </i>and all.

216
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:57,754
Really?

217
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:00,790
I lived across from M*rio Outlet.
Where you catch bus 11-2.

218
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:03,360
-M*rio Outlet?
-Where K*m's Club is.

219
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:05,262
I was kind of a big deal in Cheolsan.

220
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,796
-Really?
-A big deal?

221
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,434
Yes, I was.

222
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:16,339
I'm surprised you never
heard of me while you lived there.

223
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:18,608
Why haven't I?

224
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,846
Yoo Byungjae of Cheolsan…
I never heard of you while I lived there.

225
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,882
And I don't know why,
because Yoo Byungjae was quite famous…

226
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:27,250
Did you say "Yoo Bangjae"?

227
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:37,260
I have something in common
with JULIE, too.

228
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,696
-It's Hawaii.
-Hawaii?

229
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:40,997
Are you from Hawaii?

230
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:43,300
-Did you visit Hawaii?
-Yes.

231
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,435
I see. Hawaii's nice.

232
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,772
-You were born in Hawaii.
-Yes, I was.

233
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:52,842
-How long did you live there?
-Until I was about 13 years old.

234
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,078
-So nearly half your life…
-Yes.

235
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,846
For more than half your life.

236
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:59,216
When we think of Hawaii,

237
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:01,885
we picture that romantic,
movie-like image.

238
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:02,953
So…

239
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,093
Stop that.

240
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:12,696
Did he see a ghost?

241
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,065
-Don't cry.
-It's okay.

242
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:16,700
Why is that so funny to me?

243
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,134
It's really funny.

244
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:21,071
Don't make eye contact with that artist.

245
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:22,939
He'll draw you.

246
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,307
He'll draw your face.

247
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,343
PARK PYEONGSIK

248
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,451
That's HANEUL.

249
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:45,862
JULIE laughed.

250
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:50,033
How can you not laugh at that?

251
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,902
-Who is that?
-That's HANEUL.

252
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:54,537
-It's HANEUL.
-It's obviously her.

253
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:55,605
That's me?

254
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,008
That's so mean.

255
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,978
I've seen a character like
that on <i>Jeon Woochi.</i>

256
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:04,581
-I thought it was from that.
-You're talented.

257
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,416
Please go to the Quiet Room, JULIE.

258
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:15,292
Is the ostrich sleeping?

259
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,662
It woke up.

260
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:25,869
Lastly, what HANEUL and I
have in common is…

261
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:30,006
We may be the youngest,
but we're the most mature.

262
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:34,444
I've heard that's what many people
say about you.

263
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,479
-Is it true?
-Yes, it's true.

264
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:38,882
Are you also the youngest in your family?

265
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:41,351
-Yes.
-How many siblings do you have?

266
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:43,820
I have an older sister and a brother…

267
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,259
I told you to stop that.

268
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,662
Is he actually playing a game?

269
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:55,131
He's a big fan of VR games.

270
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:58,935
-He's sad now.
-He's an employee at our company.

271
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,237
I see.

272
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:04,174
I'm also the youngest,
but I'm the most mature one in my family.

273
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:05,842
In case you don't believe me…

274
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:10,146
I'm going to…

275
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:12,782
-Who is he calling?
-His older sister?

276
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:13,884
Older sister?

277
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,951
Hello?

278
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,153
<i>-Hi, Son.</i>
-Mom.

279
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,221
<i>Yes?</i>

280
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:20,090
What kind of son am I?

281
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:22,025
<i>-You?</i>
-Yes.

282
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:24,794
<i>You're the youngest,</i>
<i>but you're the most mature.</i>

283
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,863
-Right, I agree.
-Is this staged?

284
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,368
Okay, I'm filming right now,
so I'll call you back later.

285
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:32,836
<i>Wait, Byungjae.</i>

286
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:34,971
-Yes?
<i>-Wait a minute.</i>

287
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,975
<i>Could you send me some money?</i>

288
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:42,946
-Money?
<i>-Yes.</i>

289
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,014
What for?

290
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,816
<i>I want to do a L*b*bu unboxing.</i>

291
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,487
A L*b*bu unboxing?

292
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,422
I guess she likes L*b*bus.

293
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,591
<i>-Just send me five million won.</i>
-She's Gen Z.

294
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,526
-Five million won?
<i>-Yes.</i>

295
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:58,695
Okay, I'll call you back when I'm done.

296
00:16:58,762 --> 00:16:59,829
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Bye.

297
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:00,997
<i>All right, bye.</i>

298
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:06,002
-See? I'm very dependable.
-You really are mature.

299
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,138
My family relies on me a lot.

300
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:09,906
-They trust you a lot.
-No wonder.

301
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:13,209
Those were what I had in common
with the four of you.

302
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:15,512
Let's bring JULIE back to her seat.

303
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:24,487
Before we move on,
can we take a quick photo?

304
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:27,457
This is for the thumbnail.

305
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,659
-Okay.
-We'll take one while we pause.

306
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,329
-I'll stand in the back.
-Okay.

307
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:33,997
-Here?
-That's good.

308
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,065
Let me see.

309
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,103
Okay, one, two…

310
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:45,642
I'm really sorry, Byungjae,
but something looks a bit off.

311
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,077
-Could you step back?
-Here?

312
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:48,645
-Yes, that's good.
-Okay.

313
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:49,713
Let me check.

314
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,485
I'm really sorry,

315
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:58,655
but your face is too big.

316
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:01,057
Your face looks like an ostrich egg

317
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,660
while theirs look like quail eggs.

318
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,195
-Move back a bit.
-This way?

319
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:07,230
-Yes.
-Got it.

320
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,099
-Good?
-I'll take the photo.

321
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:14,104
Right now, you…

322
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:17,140
-You look like a monster.
-A monster…

323
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:19,576
Could you crouch down in the front here?

324
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,280
-He listens well.
-You're way too nice.

325
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:25,248
-Here? In the middle?
-Yes, there.

326
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:26,683
-Got it.
-It's not true.

327
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,385
-A bit more this way.
-This way?

328
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,089
Sh*t.

329
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:34,157
What?

330
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,393
-You look ugly.
-What's going on?

331
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,161
-That's mean.
-No way.

332
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:39,329
Your neck's too short.

333
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,265
Can you be less ugly next week?

334
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,903
-No, he can't.
-Don't say that.

335
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:49,940
I'll take it next week.

336
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,711
-He's not taking the photo?
-Did he just leave?

337
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,079
That's so mean.

338
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:57,948
We don't want a photo.

339
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:05,956
KISS OF LIFE is loved
for being such a bright, cheerful group.

340
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:09,726
I heard this from a psychology expert.

341
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:12,862
Like a true INFP,
I can't express anger well.

342
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:17,067
I just bottle things up,
but that's bad for your mental health.

343
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,501
I heard that people

344
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:23,206
who let out their anger
tend to live healthier lives.

345
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:25,942
That's why I prepared this next segment.

346
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,480
I'll ask questions in an angry tone,
and you'll respond in the same tone.

347
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,815
Got it.

348
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:35,418
-I'll ask questions in an angry manner.
-We can blow off steam here.

349
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,655
-And you can respond in the same tone.
-Okay!

350
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,624
-Got it!
-I understand.

351
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:42,759
You guys are so cool!

352
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:44,527
-Thanks!
-Thank you!

353
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,096
-You're the best!
-Thanks!

354
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,565
No one can compare to you.

355
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:49,633
We know!

356
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,301
-No one can touch you.
-Thanks.

357
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,802
I get it!

358
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,272
-BELLE!
-What?

359
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,041
You know how your voice
jumps up an octave?

360
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,976
-What's your point?
-It's amazing.

361
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,678
But please say nice things.

362
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:02,746
Right, sorry.

363
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:07,183
-I got it!
-It's amazing.

364
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,719
I replayed that part so many times!
Did you know?

365
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:11,021
Don't lie.

366
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,924
Why don't you show us?

367
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:21,264
I'm not warmed up! Why are you making me?

368
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,834
-JULIE.
-Yes?

369
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:28,104
Why do you only rap?
You're good at singing, too.

370
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:31,341
-Why do you only rap?
-Thanks!

371
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,509
You should sing, too!

372
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:35,845
Just do what you're told.

373
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,981
Do you understand?

374
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:39,049
I understand!

375
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,417
"What you're told"?

376
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:44,087
Don't hide your true self. It's annoying.

377
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:45,155
Okay?

378
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:47,824
I'm touched!

379
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,259
You're so charming!

380
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:51,127
-You're handsome!
-You're the best!

381
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:52,829
Seriously!

382
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,130
Don't lie to me.

383
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,137
Say something to your biggest fans, KISSY.
Hurry up, we're short on time!

384
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:04,641
-Hey, KISSY! We love you!
-Hey, KISSY! We love you!

385
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,042
-Love you.
-Love you.

386
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,278
That's enough of that!

387
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:12,449
Out of all our interviews,

388
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:15,118
the audience prepared
the most performances today.

389
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:19,656
Once again, we have a special performance
from one of our audience members.

390
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:23,526
We've brought in someone
who has a level of fitness

391
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:26,029
-that's right up there with our guests.
-Muscle?

392
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:28,198
Please welcome Mr. Olympia

393
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,367
with a big round of applause.

394
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:36,606
I'm excited.

395
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:47,984
Could you introduce yourself?

396
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:49,619
Muscles never betray you.

397
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:52,322
-I'm Lee Heetae, a fitness trainer.
-Okay.

398
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,625
You're wearing Und*r Arm*ur.

399
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,262
-My total for the big 3 is 220 pounds.
-Big 3?

400
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:00,931
It's 220 lbs.

401
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:03,133
By that you mean,

402
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,468
your grandfather, father,

403
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:10,807
and you lift a total of 220 lbs combined.

404
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,042
-That's right.
-Yes.

405
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:15,011
-Could you check our squats?
-Of course.

406
00:22:15,078 --> 00:22:18,215
Could one of you demonstrate for us?

407
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,684
-I'll try.
-Great.

408
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,751
But…

409
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,554
Your legs look like they're going to snap.

410
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:27,357
-He's going to correct your form.
-I see.

411
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:28,558
I'll check your form.

412
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,831
For squats, your knees shouldn't…

413
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,236
-Keep holding this.
-Okay.

414
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:42,172
-It's heavy.
-It's too heavy.

415
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,074
-He must be tired.
-You can drop it.

416
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,542
-I'll hold it.
-Okay.

417
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,444
-I'll take it.
-I'll hold one.

418
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,511
Thank you.

419
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,313
How do you usually do squats?

420
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,849
I grab a weight and do it like this.

421
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:58,755
Hold on. Your posture is wrong.

422
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:01,358
When you do a squat…

423
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:04,294
Your nipple…

424
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,432
N*pong N*epong? Who said that?
I heard someone say that.

425
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,701
His shirt's so big
his nipples keep showing.

426
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:14,804
Look somewhere else.
That's the downside of a muscle shirt.

427
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:19,609
When you do a squat,
your hips need to stay locked in.

428
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,679
But your hips aren't locked in right now.

429
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:24,614
Let me demonstrate.

430
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:25,849
Great.

431
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:29,452
Engage your core.

432
00:23:34,157 --> 00:23:35,191
I can't look.

433
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:38,228
He usually doesn't do squats
while holding weights.

434
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,296
Thank you.

435
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:41,831
Please give it up for Lee Heetae.

436
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,301
You can leave now.

437
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:46,336
Don't do that.

438
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:53,176
I wonder how much he weighs.

439
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,948
Someone is going to sing
<i>Lips Hips Kiss </i>for us.

440
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:59,683
Who is it?

441
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:00,917
Oh, it's you.

442
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:02,919
-Oh, my.
-Please come up to the stage.

443
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,554
Why are you angry?

444
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:10,360
Please introduce yourself.

445
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:13,897
I'm Jung Taewoong,
a web drama director from Busan,

446
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:15,365
representing Ooh-ah Studio.

447
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:17,033
-Welcome.
-Hello.

448
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,403
-He came all the way from Busan.
-Web dramas.

449
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,839
Will you be singing the song?

450
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:23,907
Yes, that's right.

451
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:26,543
-Whenever you're ready.
-That's amazing.

452
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,156
<i>I'm free at six, six, six, six, ooh</i>

453
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:45,595
<i>Following my senses</i>
<i>I chase you, hide and seek</i>

454
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,706
<i>The perfect night</i>

455
00:24:56,773 --> 00:24:57,774
What was that?

456
00:24:57,841 --> 00:24:59,910
-Thank you.
-A big round of applause.

457
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:10,587
-Is that your real hair?
-Is it real?

458
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:12,422
Yes, it is.

459
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:13,490
Seriously?

460
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,395
Repeatedly asking if it's real could be…

461
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:26,202
BELLE has been eliminated,
so please enter the Quiet Room.

462
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,472
How do you not laugh at that?

463
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,479
What an incredible performance.

464
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:40,850
When you think of dance,
you think of KISS OF LIFE.

465
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:45,922
Dance and performance
are a big part of your identity.

466
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:51,628
I love all your songs,
but <i>Sticky </i>is my favorite.

467
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:57,467
A special guest has prepared
the twerking choreography from <i>Sticky.</i>

468
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:01,771
Before we bring them out,
could you show it to us, NATTY?

469
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:04,341
Sure, I can do that.

470
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:05,976
-If you sing it.
-Let's sing.

471
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,211
One, two, three, four.

472
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:13,516
<i>The moment I saw you, I fly high</i>

473
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:20,056
<i>Dive right in, into our ocean dive</i>

474
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:23,193
<i>This strange feeling melts away</i>

475
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,598
Great.

476
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:34,237
As usual, a flawless performance
from NATTY of KISS OF LIFE.

477
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:40,410
But today, someone dares
to challenge NATTY's throne.

478
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:41,545
How dare they?

479
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:46,616
They say this dancer's moves
are unforgettable.

480
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:49,019
Let's give them a big round of applause.

481
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:52,989
What?

482
00:26:58,662 --> 00:26:59,863
Hello, sir.

483
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,669
I heard you need to get ready.

484
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,470
Please go ahead. I was told…

485
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:21,418
Oh, no!

486
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:29,259
Shake it.

487
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:34,497
Should we all sing for him?

488
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:37,067
-Okay.
-One, two, three, four.

489
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:42,072
<i>The moment I saw you, I fly high</i>

490
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,311
<i>Dive right in, into our ocean dive</i>

491
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:51,381
<i>This strange feeling melts away</i>

492
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,291
<i>The moment I saw you, I fly high</i>

493
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,898
<i>Dive right in, into our ocean dive</i>

494
00:28:07,964 --> 00:28:10,867
<i>This strange feeling melts away</i>

495
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,406
Big round of applause!

496
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:20,377
Get out of that thing.

497
00:28:20,443 --> 00:28:22,112
Can he… Oh, he can.

498
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:30,754
Thank you, sir.

499
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:34,724
He left it there.

500
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,031
I'm told all three of you
have been eliminated.

501
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,633
The ostrich must have a sore back.

502
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,101
How is he doing that?

503
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:47,470
-I think he's doing this.
-How?

504
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:48,538
Like this.

505
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,410
That ostrich should get paid well today.

506
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:56,713
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Unfortunately,

507
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,115
all of you must enter the Quiet Room.

508
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,218
-Then who…
-Who will you talk to?

509
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,787
-It's time to wrap up anyway.
-I see.

510
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:14,231
<i>The moment I saw you, I fly high</i>

511
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:15,532
Can we laugh in here?

512
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,435
One, two, three!

513
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:27,944
We didn't expect all four of you
to be eliminated today.

514
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:31,815
The audience will get
to say the final words.

515
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:36,186
If there's anyone here
who wants to see me up close,

516
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:38,889
I'll invite them up here. Anyone?

517
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:48,164
-The ostrich.
-Is your hand raised?

518
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:50,667
The ostrich raised their hand.

519
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:56,339
Since no one volunteered…

520
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,610
we'll wrap it up here. Thank you.

521
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,312
This is how it ends?

522
