1
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,544
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

2
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,813
-Yooha, Yooha, Byungha, Byungha.
-Gyuha, Gyuha.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,281
We're the hosts of You Bought What?!

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,849
-I'm Yoo Byungjae.
-And I'm Super Ryugyu.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:21,955
We started You Bought What?! on YouTube
in a small room, just doing our thing.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,458
And now, it's finally on Disney+!

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,293
WELCOME

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,161
CELEBRATION FANFARE

9
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,763
How does it feel?

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,298
To be honest, I'm so nervous.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,169
This means our show will be displayed
next to <i>Star Wars, </i>right?

12
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,838
What I'm looking forward to the most

13
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:42,009
is seeing how they subtitle what you say
in other languages.

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,076
TRANSLATION DIFFICULTY: HARD

15
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,413
We started this show on YouTube

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,483
to see the quirky ways
celebrities spend their money.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,186
And through that,
reflect on our own habits as well.

18
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,988
Let's start by taking a look
at our own spending habits.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,958
Sounds good.
How do you usually spend your money?

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,162
In the past,
I used to buy things out of insecurity.

21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,732
I used to throw money at outfits
with loud designer logos

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,268
to feel better about myself.

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,304
-But I've changed a bit lately.
-How so?

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,140
-I tend to shop under the influence.
-"Under the influence"?

25
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,409
The image makes it seem
like it's one item,

26
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,811
but I end up with 1,000 cotton swabs
and 700 floss picks.

27
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,280
My spending habits are now worse
because I shop when I'm drunk.

28
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,082
How do you spend your money?

29
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,418
This is how I've always been,

30
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,187
but I don't like to buy
what everyone else is buying.

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,289
I'm more of an early adopter.

32
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:33,327
Even if it's inconvenient,
if there's one cool feature,

33
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,897
I'll buy it first
and wait for it to become a trend.

34
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,266
I don't think that's quite right.

35
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,235
-You're a requester.
-What do you mean?

36
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,604
This happened ten minutes
before today's shoot.

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,306
The dryer at our place broke down.

38
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,042
So I asked him to look for a new one
since I'd be covering the costs.

39
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,779
He responded by asking me
to get a new washer while we're at it.

40
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,581
That's what he requested.

41
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,518
-You conveniently left that part out.
-No, I…

42
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,686
Our first guests are here,

43
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,122
and they couldn't be
a better fit for this show.

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,625
-Both of them are maximalists.
-Total maximalists.

45
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,194
One of them is super easy to influence.

46
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,964
When someone recommends something,
she just has to buy it.

47
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,866
-That's right.
-That's how she spends her money.

48
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,868
Our other guest
is a my-way-or-the-highway type.

49
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,803
No matter what anyone says,
he buys what he wants.

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,772
Right. He's a bit like me.

51
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,641
I told you. You're a requester.

52
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,076
Let's bring out our first guests.

53
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,144
Come on out.

54
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,214
-It's nice to see you.
-It's nice to see you, too.

55
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,448
-Hi, Joshua.
-Hello.

56
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,050
-Hello.
-It's nice to see you.

57
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,451
You can park it right here.

58
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,519
GUESTS ENTER

59
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,188
Could you introduce yourselves?

60
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,491
-Hi, I'm Sunmi. It's great to be here.
-It's great to have you.

61
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,559
SUNMI
EASY TO INFLUENCE

62
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,194
Hi, I'm Joshua.

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,029
-Thank you for having me.
-Thanks for coming.

64
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,163
JOSHUA
MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY

65
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,166
We've run into Sunmi a few times

66
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,868
-while working.
-That's right.

67
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,571
So I have a question for Joshua.

68
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,672
Do you know who we are?

69
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,107
-Of course I know you. I do.
-Really?

70
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,375
CANNED REACTION

71
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,510
I'm serious.

72
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:00,814
We're here today to take a deep dive
into your spending habits.

73
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,983
I'm curious how you spend your money.

74
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,418
Let's start with you, Sunmi.

75
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:09,590
I have a tendency
to collect beautiful trash.

76
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,692
What do you mean by that?

77
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,994
If something is beautiful,
it's usually useless.

78
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,396
-And I know that it's useless.
-I understand.

79
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:20,033
-But I still buy and collect them.
-I see.

80
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,804
Do you go through reviews and ratings
before you make a purchase?

81
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,405
No, I don't.

82
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,708
-What if it doesn't fit?
-If it doesn't,

83
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,478
I just stash it away
or give it to someone who needs it.

84
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,547
How would you describe
your spending habits, Joshua?

85
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,716
I'm not easily influenced by other people.

86
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,286
If something catches my eye,
I just buy it and see if it works for me.

87
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,256
If someone recommends a product,
do you lose interest?

88
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,259
Let's say you find something pretty,
like a designer bag,

89
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,160
-and you're considering buying it.
-Okay.

90
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,531
Then someone like me comes along and says,
"This is pretty. You have to get it."

91
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,798
-Would you--
-I wouldn't buy it.

92
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:52,866
TEARS

93
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,334
I'M JUST KIDDING

94
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,903
I try not to hop on trends

95
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,472
-that have blown up too much.
-I get what you mean.

96
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,843
We'll each team up with one of you
and will be defending you.

97
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,045
Who would you like in your corner?

98
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,680
For me…

99
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,315
I wasn't asking you.

100
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,884
What's wrong with you?
You're supposed to defend them.

101
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:11,985
Can't I weigh in?

102
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,456
I was watching the two of you
during the opening segment,

103
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,861
and it seemed like Super Ryugyu
was really hammering his point in.

104
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,629
There's always logic behind my arguments.

105
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,398
I didn't really see any logic.

106
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,832
HE'S FUN TO ROAST THOUGH

107
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,937
I had Byungjae in mind from the beginning.

108
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,205
I feel like you'd back me up

109
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,573
-with solid logic.
-Of course.

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,741
Should we team up
with the person we're sitting next to?

111
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,748
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

112
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,852
Let's dive right into You Bought What?!

113
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,421
We'll start by taking a look
at what Sunmi brought.

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,488
What is this?

115
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,824
-These are the perfumes I use.
-Perfume.

116
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,427
-I only use these two.
-Really?

117
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,963
It doesn't look like
your typical perfume bottle.

118
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,268
These are travel-size bottles
that you can carry around.

119
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:05,639
I really love this perfume,
but it's been discontinued.

120
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,641
-Oh, no. Is that your last bottle?
-Yes.

121
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,078
I don't know why they discontinued it.
It smells amazing.

122
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,847
-There's no reason to discontinue it.
-You're right.

123
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,148
Why would they do that?

124
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,184
-What?
-Who are you asking?

125
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:21,255
You said you only use these two bottles,
so from where I'm standing,

126
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,956
it feels like overconsumption.

127
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,658
-What?
-You only need one.

128
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,093
Now you're just pushing it.

129
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,694
No, I'm not.

130
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,797
You only need one scent
to make a statement about who you are.

131
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,799
So, having two seems a bit excessive.

132
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,234
-Did you call this excessive?
-I did.

133
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,502
I'll show you what excessive is.

134
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,837
This is…

135
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,405
This is really…

136
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,441
Even people who research perfumes
don't have this much.

137
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,876
-Should I take it all out?
-I'll help.

138
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,444
This might take a while.

139
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,714
These are all Joshua's perfumes.

140
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,516
I also have that Tom Ford perfume.

141
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,852
Guess you won't be using it anymore.

142
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,387
NO COMMENT

143
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,923
Roughly speaking,
how many bottles do you own?

144
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,458
I think I have about 110 bottles.

145
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,626
You own 110 bottles?

146
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,395
I just really love perfumes.

147
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,931
Compared to that,
mine is kind of underwhelming.

148
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,465
PERFUME WEALTH GAP

149
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,035
There's a reason he has so many perfumes.

150
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,102
Let's hear it.

151
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,872
I think scents have the power

152
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,474
-to bring back memories.
-That's right.

153
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,410
That's why I pack one perfume
when I'm on tour.

154
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,578
-I see.
-Always.

155
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,614
So every perfume represents a tour.

156
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:25,586
And that scent brings back
all the memories from that tour.

157
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,589
I think that's why I really like perfumes.

158
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,591
-If you look here…
-Yes?

159
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,460
…some of these bottles look untouched.

160
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,195
It's about fulfillment and abundance.

161
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,097
-What?
-Abundance.

162
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,234
The bottles come in all sorts of shapes,

163
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,269
-so I have to arrange them.
-When you display them.

164
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,737
Where do you display them?

165
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,206
I have a display case for my perfumes.

166
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,841
That could look a bit creepy.

167
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,176
-What?
-It's just a bit creepy.

168
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,812
-Creepy?
-It's just rows and rows of perfumes.

169
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,315
Just looking at it makes me happy.
The bottles are pretty.

170
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,784
Can you tell all these scents apart?

171
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,386
Of course. They all smell different.

172
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,854
Let's do a blind smell test.

173
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,423
Can you name the perfume
just by smelling it?

174
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,059
He's an expert.
You mentioned a blind test, right?

175
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,028
-Are you up for it?
-Of course.

176
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,162
Can we choose the perfume?

177
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,198
Can I smell them first?

178
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,700
-Of course. Go ahead.
-Just once.

179
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,570
You don't remember
the scents that you wear?

180
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,006
-That means…
-That's weird.

181
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,942
-This is the definition of excessive.
-What's your favorite?

182
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,046
My favorite perfume
is the one with the Dubai horse on it.

183
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,583
I like that one.
I can also guess Another right away.

184
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,819
This is going to be a walk in the park,
so just close your eyes.

185
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:33,887
Okay.

186
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,489
Did you prep him?

187
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,058
No, he told me he was sad
because it reminded him of a tour.

188
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,694
-Pick the one he barely used.
-Got it.

189
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,297
Oh, come on. That's just mean.

190
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,866
PERFUME THAT'S ALMOST BRAND NEW

191
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,636
Here we go.

192
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,840
Is this Memo?

193
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,875
THAT'S INCORRECT

194
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:55,943
-Memo.
-Maybe not.

195
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,746
I don't remember the name,
but it's the one that has balloons on it.

196
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,148
-What?
-Am I right?

197
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,616
INSISTING HE'S RIGHT
HAPPY HE'S WRONG

198
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,885
-You're right. It has balloons on it.
-Okay.

199
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,620
You can open your eyes.
Did he get it right?

200
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,622
-He got it wrong. It was Van Cleef.
-No.

201
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,457
-It was Van Cleef.
-Was it Van Cleef?

202
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,327
It's because I just bought that one.
Look at the bottle.

203
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,828
BRAND NEW

204
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,763
-I haven't used it yet.
-In that case,

205
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,499
-let's go with the ones you do wear.
-Do the ones I wear often.

206
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,368
-This is your last chance.
-Okay.

207
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,170
SNIFFING

208
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,240
STILL SNIFFING

209
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,141
TRICK QUESTION: NO SCENT

210
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,744
HE SNIFFS BYUNGJAE'S NATURAL SCENT

211
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,147
I don't smell anything.

212
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,716
-You don't smell anything?
-No.

213
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,317
You can open your eyes. See?

214
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,119
If there's no scent, he says so.

215
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,454
What else would he say?

216
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,589
-I didn't spray anything.
-You didn't, right?

217
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,258
It's just my natural scent.

218
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:48,262
Let's check out the next item
Sunmi brought today.

219
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:49,997
These are all imported.

220
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,365
CHERRY-FLAVORED COKE
&amp; CEREAL

221
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,400
-What flavor is this?
-It's cherry flavored.

222
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,303
-I've never seen Coke this size before.
-Me neither.

223
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,305
I saw it for the first time in the States.

224
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,806
Why did you buy this?

225
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,709
It's really good,
but they don't sell it in Korea.

226
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,779
So I keep ordering it from abroad.

227
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,447
Doesn't it taste like Dr Pepper?

228
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,782
No, it doesn't.

229
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,118
-You can buy Dr Pepper here.
-It's totally different.

230
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,221
-It tastes the same.
-I agree. They both taste the same.

231
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,624
Have you tasted this?
Do you want to try it?

232
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,227
-It's really good.
-Let me try it.

233
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,664
It really tastes good.

234
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,098
-What?
-It tastes like Dr Pepper.

235
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,233
No, it doesn't!

236
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,368
-It really tastes the same, right?
-No, it doesn't.

237
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,471
It tastes exactly like Dr Pepper!

238
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,473
-It's more Dr Pepper than Dr Pepper.
-It's the same.

239
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,676
-That doesn't make any sense.
-I'm serious.

240
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,743
No way.

241
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,846
Let me have a sip.

242
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,280
SUNMI'S BACKUP HAS A SIP

243
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,684
-You have to be honest.
-It's totally different.

244
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,019
It's smoother than Dr Pepper.

245
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
Is it really?

246
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,823
-Hold on. You're on my team.
-I'm sorry.

247
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,627
The next items we'll look at
are in the wellness category.

248
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,629
DEEP SEA WATER
&amp; ROOIBOS TEA

249
00:09:55,696 --> 00:10:00,067
I've been drinking a lot of tea lately.

250
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,602
It's good for your health.

251
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,505
It even helps reduce inflammation.

252
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,540
-This is…
-It's deep sea water.

253
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,408
Yes, that's right.

254
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,045
It says, "Say no to nanoplastics"
and "Give me clean water."

255
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,649
As you can tell from those phrases,

256
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,619
-this doesn't contain any nanoplastics.
-I see.

257
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,988
There's a story behind this.

258
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:25,526
Park Jinyoung kept nagging me about this.

259
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:29,396
He just wouldn't stop.
I swear my ears were ringing.

260
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,566
He'd tell me not to drink anything
from plastic bottles.

261
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,735
And that microplastics are so bad for you.

262
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,838
Hearing that over and over
just stressed me out.

263
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,941
-Tell him, "Mind your own business."
-"I'll take care of myself."

264
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,409
"You do you."

265
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,179
I did tell him that in the beginning.

266
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,813
-Okay.
-I said that at first.

267
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,615
But after a while,

268
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:52,319
I decided to listen to him
since he's older than me.

269
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,254
Have you ever seen microplastics?

270
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,756
No.

271
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,959
Why would you ask her that?

272
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,995
-There's nothing to roast here, right?
-No, there isn't.

273
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,931
You must pity people who consume plastic.

274
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,699
ANNOYING

275
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,168
-You're so annoying.
-That's not what I said.

276
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,403
MICROPLASTICS ARE DELICIOUS

277
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,172
Jokes aside,
microplastics are a serious issue.

278
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,007
-We need to be more mindful.
-Right.

279
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,344
I recently added something to my diet,
and I highly recommend it.

280
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:21,048
I drizzle some extra virgin olive oil
over Greek yogurt,

281
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,516
then add a bit of honey.

282
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,617
That had mold on it.

283
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,219
I threw that out and bought a new jar.

284
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,753
Can honey grow mold?

285
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,821
I just learned that myself.

286
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,790
You should buy honey sticks instead.

287
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,226
Are honey sticks microplastic-free?

288
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,293
Probably not.

289
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,563
-Why would you ask that?
-I was just curious.

290
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,402
I had no idea
Joshua was into this kind of thing.

291
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,770
SOUS VIDE MACHINE
&amp; SODA MAKER

292
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,038
What is that?

293
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,276
-I'm personally a big fan of steak.
-It's delicious.

294
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:55,015
But thick cuts are hard to cook evenly,
so I bought a sous vide machine.

295
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,718
-How do you use it?
-This comes with a container,

296
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,820
but I couldn't find it.

297
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,055
That must mean he doesn't use it.

298
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,657
-It's at home.
-I bet it's somewhere nice.

299
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,192
It's somewhere nice.

300
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,862
I've never seen this before.
How did you come across it?

301
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,966
One of my favorite cooking YouTubers
uses this machine a lot.

302
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,002
You seem easy to influence.

303
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,404
-No, he only bought two things.
-I only bought two.

304
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,472
And he uses it.

305
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,408
But you bought everything
the YouTube person recommended.

306
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,210
It's YouTuber, not YouTube person.

307
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:24,878
Who even says that?

308
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,180
What is this?

309
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,848
This is a soda maker.

310
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,352
I usually drink a lot of carbonated water,

311
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,421
so I figured this would help me
save some money.

312
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,489
It's a huge money-saver.

313
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,924
So, do you use it?

314
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,194
I buy Trevi regularly, like once a month.

315
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,662
HE GAVE HIMSELF AWAY

316
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,697
It's a hassle to use this thing.

317
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,100
-It takes ages to fill this up with water.
-It is a hassle.

318
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,503
It's not like you're scooping water
into the bottle.

319
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,471
You just have to stand there.

320
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:52,940
It feels like a waste of time.

321
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,176
I think it's neat.
I wanted one since I like sparkling water.

322
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,444
Would you like to try it?

323
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,079
-Can we?
-Yes, of course.

324
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,147
Is it battery-operated?

325
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,417
No, it's not battery-operated.
There's a carbon dioxide canister.

326
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:08,255
After you attach the bottle,
you have to press this button.

327
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:09,323
Look at that.

328
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,792
ADDING BUBBLES

329
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:12,893
That's pretty cool.

330
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,162
Just look at that. It's making soda water.

331
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,296
ALL DONE

332
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,364
Is it done already?

333
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,299
-We now have soda water.
-Let me try.

334
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,469
FIZZ-MERIZING WATER

335
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,071
You don't like it, do you?

336
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,273
It's because it's not cold.

337
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,409
It tastes just like soda water
when it's cold.

338
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,912
Isn't it pretty good?
I used this yesterday.

339
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,715
CLEARLY NOT ENJOYING IT

340
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,885
-Maybe it needs a few more pumps.
-Should I do it again?

341
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,419
-It's a bit off.
-Yeah.

342
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,822
TASTE TEST BEFORE ADDING MORE FIZZ

343
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,091
-Hold on.
-It's not usually like this, right?

344
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,026
-No, it needs more fizz.
-That's odd.

345
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,294
PUMPING HARDER THIS TIME

346
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:50,330
-That looks a bit difficult.
-Why isn't this working?

347
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,966
TASTE TESTING THE EXTRA VIRGIN SODA WATER

348
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,034
WHAT?

349
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,702
Is it still not fizzy?

350
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,970
There's a bit of fizz.

351
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,672
Really?

352
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,607
Is it not good?

353
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,342
While you were making that,

354
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,710
I bought Trevi.

355
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,146
-It'll be delivered soon.
-I bought it.

356
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,848
I really bought it.

357
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:12,252
I can totally relate
to these massage products.

358
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,121
I have a lot of products.

359
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,556
IT'S A BOTTOMLESS BOX

360
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,990
What made you buy all this?

361
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,927
Well, there's a gym that I go to.

362
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:25,199
Whenever I feel sore,
I go there to get rid of any tightness.

363
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:30,037
If I like the product,
I ask my trainer where he bought it.

364
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,039
And then I purchase it for myself.

365
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:35,342
Don't all of these
more or less do the same thing?

366
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,910
-No, they don't.
-You lie on this.

367
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:41,548
You're supposed to sit on this
and rock back and forth.

368
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,884
And it really stretches your hamstrings.

369
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,752
This would work just as well.

370
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,488
You can stretch your hamstrings
as well as your back with this.

371
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,691
It's not the same.
They even look different.

372
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,426
TESTING IT OUT

373
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,594
The thing is…

374
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,830
-It works, right?
-It does work.

375
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,765
But it doesn't cover a wide area.

376
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,134
It only releases tension
in targeted spots.

377
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,670
All of these were recommended
by a professional.

378
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,173
But I heard that
this isn't the case for Joshua.

379
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,641
-I have that, too.
-Right?

380
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,776
-It's amazing, right?
-It is.

381
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,279
He bought different devices
for different body parts.

382
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,982
This company has devices
for the scalp, legs, and trapezius muscle.

383
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,149
That's correct.

384
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,351
What's wrong with this?

385
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,954
Why not just get
a full-body massage chair?

386
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,389
You're completely clueless.

387
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,857
-Where do I even begin?
-I know.

388
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,993
I have a massage chair at home.

389
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,262
But you still bought all of this?

390
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,898
The reason I bought these
is because massage chairs

391
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,234
-don't have the same precision.
-Exactly.

392
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,836
Then what's this?

393
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,071
-It's for your scalp.
-It massages your scalp.

394
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,439
-How does it work?
-Scalp?

395
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,676
You wrap it around your head.

396
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:46,980
And it feels like someone's
giving you a massage by hand.

397
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,482
-You're lying.
-I'm serious.

398
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,652
-Some say there's a hand in there.
-This thing is too flimsy.

399
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,687
PUTTING IT ON

400
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,056
The strap's too short for his big head.

401
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,224
It is a bit tight.

402
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,458
IT BARELY FITS

403
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,526
Oh, no.

404
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,128
STAFF CRACKING UP

405
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:03,664
-Should you be laughing that loud?
-That's it.

406
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,766
-This feels amazing.
-I know.

407
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,801
-It feels so good.
-Right?

408
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:12,906
-I've seen these products on Instagram.
-You're right.

409
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,676
-It's all over the ads.
-Always saying they sold thousands.

410
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,644
Joshua seems easy to influence, too.

411
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,546
-No, that's not true.
-I disagree.

412
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,249
-I have the first model at home.
-He does.

413
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,951
This is the second version.

414
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,519
He wasn't influenced by anyone.

415
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,821
I've used it myself
and thought it was great.

416
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,158
That's why I'm recommending it.
It's really nice.

417
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,193
Look how much wear it has.

418
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,095
I haven't seen those on Instagram.

419
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,497
-It's definitely on Instagram.
-You haven't seen it.

420
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,434
This has 190,000 likes on Instagram.

421
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,735
It's because it's expensive.

422
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:44,605
They've got the budget to run ads.

423
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,007
-Do you have the scalp massager, Sunmi?
-No, I don't.

424
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,309
-It's great.
-It helps reduce puffiness in the morning.

425
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,677
-Really?
-That's the best part.

426
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,845
It's good for your health.

427
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:56,083
These next items that Sunmi brought
are the highlight for today.

428
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,818
-It's pretty heavy.
-Be careful.

429
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:59,186
It's really pretty.

430
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,988
Oh, my goodness.

431
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,122
It's so pretty.

432
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,524
It's gorgeous.

433
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,825
It is pretty, but…

434
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:05,893
LAMPS

435
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,427
I heard you have more than ten of these.

436
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,097
I'm really into lighting fixtures,

437
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,966
so I've got a chandelier
over the dining table,

438
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,871
and even a mother-of-pearl lamp
in the bedroom.

439
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:21,909
As someone who has also bought
expensive lighting fixtures,

440
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,912
I have to say that
you're easily influenced.

441
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:28,682
Do you know what a Mandalaki lamp is?
The one that gives off rainbow light.

442
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,117
You mean those aesthetic lights?

443
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:33,220
He saw G-Dragon use it on Instagram,
so he bought it.

444
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,322
That's not true. It was Jennie.

445
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,757
It was Jennie?

446
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,792
What about the second one over there?

447
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,194
-It's a lamp.
-How do you turn it on?

448
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,495
That I don't know.

449
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,596
What?

450
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,566
What? Did you just say you don't know?

451
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,835
EMBARRASSED

452
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,371
Out of all the lamps here,

453
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,640
this is the only one I actually use.

454
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,309
So the other three lamps…

455
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,110
-She doesn't use them.
-…sit in the dark.

456
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,746
Does that really matter?
It's part of the decor.

457
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:04,051
So it's a tree-shaped lamp,
but without the bulb, it's just a tree.

458
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,118
That's right.

459
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:09,156
Did you have no intention of turning it on
when you bought it?

460
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,525
No, I planned to use it initially,

461
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:15,696
but I just don't know how…

462
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,364
-You don't know how to turn it on.
-Yeah.

463
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,968
Well, let's have a look.
There's got to be a way.

464
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,270
-It has to be on the bottom. Take a look.
-Okay.

465
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,673
-What?
-It's not there.

466
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,909
-If it's not there, we're out of luck.
-I wonder why.

467
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm sorry, but the only way to light this
would be to light it on fire.

468
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,449
-The switch…
-Why would you say that?

469
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:36,817
There's no switch.

470
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,920
I heard you bought some items
that are just collecting dust.

471
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:42,022
You bought a lot of good books.

472
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,292
-Do they all have different purposes?
-They do.

473
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,296
I bought these books to read,
and the others are display pieces.

474
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,999
This looks like it's purely decorative.
Have you read it?

475
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,467
-No, I haven't.
-There's no need.

476
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,003
Are you trying to dominate someone lately?

477
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,371
No, that's not it.

478
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,340
It's a book on dark psychology.

479
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:03,610
I'm not the best judge of character,

480
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,513
so I picked it up hoping it would help me.

481
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,482
Did someone recommend this to you?

482
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,150
I saw it on YouTube.

483
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:14,087
Hold on a minute.
It's all from YouTube or Instagram.

484
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,155
This book is…

485
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,523
BEGGING FOR HELP

486
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,725
-You know this book, right?
-It's a well-known book.

487
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,695
You need to help him out, Byungjae.

488
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,064
-Truth is, we're all easy to influence.
-You're right.

489
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,967
-We're just great listeners.
-That's true.

490
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,304
These next few items
look quite familiar to us.

491
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,072
Sunmi wore them when she was performing.

492
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,209
-Did you buy these yourself?
-Yes, I did.

493
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,412
I put this scarf on with these sunglasses

494
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,316
and performed the song "Gashina."
So that's what I wore.

495
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:47,020
If I thought it fit the concept,
I'd go ahead and buy it.

496
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,957
But between writing songs and producing,

497
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,226
there was just too much on my plate.

498
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,760
I see.

499
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:58,432
That's why I've been talking
with the A&amp;R team and stylists.

500
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:04,137
We discuss ideas together,
and that's how things come together now.

501
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,674
I get that this is part of your job,
but I brought these up for a reason.

502
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,078
I heard that once an idol wears something
for a performance,

503
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,713
they can't wear it again.

504
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,348
-We can't.
-Absolutely not.

505
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,816
Why is that?

506
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,084
Well…

507
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,318
THINKING HARD

508
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:23,123
Since we play quite a big role
in setting new trends,

509
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,827
wearing the same things more than once
can be a little bit…

510
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,495
-It feels wrong.
-Right.

511
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,931
That doesn't apply to us
in our line of work.

512
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:34,968
I do get styling help,
but once, I found something in my pocket.

513
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,403
It was Yang Sehyung's plane ticket.

514
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,273
People with similar builds share clothes.

515
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,043
One time, I saw Byungjae wear the outfit
the stylist wore the day before.

516
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,346
-You're kidding, right?
-No.

517
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,614
-Really?
-Really.

518
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,484
I should at least get to wear it first.

519
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,186
They bought it, so they wore it first.

520
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,022
I heard you have some good news, Sunmi.

521
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,257
I have a new release coming out soon.

522
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,992
Congratulations.

523
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,060
Finally.

524
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,630
I'll be singing
while playing the bass guitar.

525
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:06,533
-Can you tell us about the song?
-The title is "Blue."

526
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,070
We all go through
a phase in life called youth.

527
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:16,276
This song is about pouring your heart
and loving fiercely during that time.

528
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,212
It's a bold rock song.

529
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,448
I'm really looking forward to it.

530
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,717
It'll be released
in the last week of August.

531
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:24,785
GIVE IT LOTS OF LOVE

532
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,653
We'll look forward to it.

533
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:28,722
Joshua, what's this?

534
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,525
-This is one of my absolute favorites.
-Dior.

535
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,060
It was my first designer bag.

536
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,862
-It's special.
-I bought it myself.

537
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,530
-You know how special that is.
-Of course.

538
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:41,235
A member of my group
had the same bag in a different color.

539
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,505
When I was contemplating
whether to buy it or not,

540
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,240
he let me borrow his.

541
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,909
-That's cute.
-I borrowed it for about a week

542
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,445
and took photos and videos of it
during that time.

543
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:55,349
I realized how much I liked the bag
and decided to buy it.

544
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:59,119
-But my hands were trembling.
-I'm sure they were.

545
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,922
I had never spent
that kind of money before.

546
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,593
Ryugyu, don't you splurge on luxury items
when it's not within your budget, too?

547
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,128
How did this become about me?

548
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,631
Do you recall
the first designer piece you bought?

549
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:15,802
The first piece I bought was from Moncler.
It was a puffer bag.

550
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,037
How much was it?

551
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:21,074
-It was around 2.5 million won.
-That's expensive.

552
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,876
-Who were you living with at the time?
-What?

553
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,245
Why are you asking him who he lived with?

554
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:26,747
Were you living with me?

555
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,081
Yes, I was.

556
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:32,386
When you bought that bag,
who was paying the rent?

557
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,521
-You were paying the rent.
-So I was paying.

558
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,223
-And the maintenance fee?
-You paid.

559
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,091
-The security deposit?
-You paid.

560
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:40,427
THIS IS FUN TO WATCH FROM THE SIDELINES

561
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:43,463
I was the one paying
for all of our expenses,

562
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,265
but you bought a Moncler bag
for 2.5 million won.

563
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:47,134
I can lend it to you for a week.

564
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,938
I'm tearing up. That's so nice of you.

565
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:52,873
Do you remember
your first designer piece, Sunmi?

566
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,544
The first designer purchase I made
was for my parents.

567
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,979
-I got them wallets.
-I see.

568
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,315
So this is what follows my part?

569
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,218
A STARK CONTRAST
THAT AMPLIFIES HIS SELF-INDULGENCE

570
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:09,356
If there's anything that sums up
Sunmi's spending habits,

571
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:10,958
it's probably these items.

572
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,327
I'm calling them
the "display-only collection."

573
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,397
I have these displayed in a glass case.

574
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,733
-It's only meant to be looked at.
-Right.

575
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,868
Ta-da!

576
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,236
IT'S A HAIRPIECE

577
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,137
-You're supposed to wear it like this.
-It's a party.

578
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,806
How many times have you worn it?

579
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,541
I bought this
with the intention of wearing it.

580
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,177
This was when I was promoting "LALALAY."

581
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,879
Since this has butterflies,

582
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:36,550
I thought it would be perfect
for the album cover shoot.

583
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,453
That's why I bought it,
but it wouldn't stay on my head.

584
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,421
So I've never used it.

585
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,390
-This…
-It's Supreme.

586
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:46,660
…is an unopened Supreme cassette.

587
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,262
-Why didn't you open it?
-Why?

588
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:49,530
I don't get it.

589
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,998
I just wanted to display it.

590
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,699
-Just like that?
-I see.

591
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,769
It'd be the same thing
as displaying an empty box.

592
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,105
Oh, you're right.

593
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,376
-It's not the same thing.
-When did you buy it?

594
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,245
Four or five years ago.

595
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:08,115
-It doesn't make sense, does it?
-I don't get it.

596
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,683
That's totally on brand for them.

597
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,185
-They've sold bricks before.
-They did.

598
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:13,554
That's not the point.
Whether it's a brick or a pebble,

599
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,122
-you should at least unbox it.
-I agree.

600
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,990
I'm saying you should open it.

601
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,560
-It's being unboxed after three years.
-Is it your first time seeing it?

602
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,362
That's pretty neat.

603
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:23,463
It's pretty.

604
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,566
I think it'd look better
sitting out like this.

605
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,568
-You know what? I agree.
-Yeah.

606
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:32,706
These also prove how unwavering
Sunmi's preferences are.

607
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:35,042
-She didn't open this either.
-No, she didn't.

608
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,810
-Why would she?
-Isn't it adorable?

609
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,680
It's not just that one.
This is unopened, too.

610
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,781
CARE BEARS

611
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:41,882
CUTENESS OVERLOAD

612
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,251
ONE'S NEVER ENOUGH
YOU WANT TO COLLECT THEM ALL

613
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,987
Can you tell us what these are?
I've never seen them before.

614
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:50,524
These bears have unique images
that represent themselves

615
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,659
-on their bellies.
-I see.

616
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:57,497
These adorable little guys
are trapped inside that packaging.

617
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,032
They're suffocating.

618
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,602
Why would you unbox it?
It's meant to be stored like this.

619
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,504
Why haven't you opened these two?

620
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,106
It just looks so cute like this.

621
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:11,211
I like to imagine what it'd be like
if our things had feelings.

622
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,281
Would these little guys
be happy right now?

623
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:18,418
These were meant to dry someone off.

624
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,621
These were meant to be held and used.

625
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,523
And this was meant
to light up someone's space.

626
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,558
But if they're not fulfilling
their purpose,

627
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,462
it makes me wonder
if we're doing right by them.

628
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,465
-They are fulfilling their purpose.
-She's protecting them.

629
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,834
She's keeping them safe and admiring them.

630
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:35,502
Why do people buy pretty things?

631
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,372
-To admire them.
-Exactly.

632
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:40,807
So they are fulfilling their purpose.

633
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,110
Come to think of it, you've got a point.

634
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,212
That actually makes sense.

635
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,047
How are you going to explain this?

636
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,816
You're a my-way-or-the-highway type,
but aren't these trending?

637
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:53,086
Labubu dolls are the rage right now.
They're super popular.

638
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:55,556
-This is Love.
-It's so cute.

639
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,857
-Love.
-It's adorable.

640
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:58,959
-And this is Hope.
-It's hopeful.

641
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:00,727
You gave her a hard time about this,

642
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:02,596
-but these are all in boxes, too.
-I know.

643
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:05,999
-They're all unboxed.
-They're displayed outside of the box.

644
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:10,037
It's so refreshing to look at Labubu dolls
after looking at Care Bears.

645
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,471
-What are you talking about?
-What?

646
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,106
-These are cuter.
-This is a collection.

647
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,975
These are way cuter.

648
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,276
They look a little hot.

649
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,578
Here's how I see it.

650
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:22,316
-Labubu dolls are trending right now.
-It's just the current craze.

651
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:24,718
But Care Bears have history.

652
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,620
-It's so old.
-What?

653
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:28,889
No, I didn't mean that. I'm so sorry.

654
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,591
-It's so old.
-It's so old.

655
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:32,292
Out of all the items you showed us today,

656
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,761
each of you will pick one
that you regret purchasing.

657
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,563
That will be the recall item.

658
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,332
Viewers can enter for a chance to win,

659
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:41,201
and we'll be giving it away
to one lucky person.

660
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,836
Have you made your picks?

661
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,072
-I'll give away one Labubu doll.
-Really?

662
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:46,573
I'll go with the Labubu doll.

663
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,141
Which one will you give away?

664
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,447
HE CAN'T CHOOSE

665
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:55,015
I don't know. Hold on.

666
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,819
It's not too late
to go with the soda maker.

667
00:26:58,886 --> 00:26:59,987
A SPARKLING SOLUTION

668
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,321
The soda maker?

669
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:03,357
-That one?
-I'll go with the Labubu doll.

670
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,058
-I'll add a card, too.
-He's adding a card.

671
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,426
What about you, Sunmi?

672
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:09,496
-Would it be okay to have a look first?
-Go ahead.

673
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:13,500
I'll go with this.

674
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,335
Are you sure about that?

675
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,404
I'm really attached to this,

676
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,574
-but I think my fans will appreciate it.
-I'm sure they will.

677
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,042
Let's start with you, Sunmi.

678
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,045
Please send a message to the person
who'll be taking this home.

679
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:28,782
This is something that holds
a lot of sentimental value for me.

680
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:34,521
I hope you'll cherish it
and take good care of it.

681
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:36,023
Thank you so much.

682
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,993
Can I give away my perfume, too?

683
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,396
-After hearing all that…
-Of course.

684
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:47,167
I hope you think of me
when you wear this perfume.

685
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:51,171
You can also attach this doll to your bag.

686
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:53,173
Please think of me
when you carry it around.

687
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:01,715
We just wrapped up You Bought What?!
with Sunmi and Joshua.

688
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,050
How did you guys find it?

689
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:06,220
It was so much fun,
I didn't realize how quickly time flew by.

690
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,789
-But a thought crossed my mind.
-What's that?

691
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,592
It felt like Byungjae was on our team.

692
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:12,860
Why'd you feel that way?

693
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:15,896
He kept going after the items
Joshua brought.

694
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,298
I couldn't help it,
so I did go back and forth.

695
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,666
Are you ganging up on me?

696
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,435
IT WAS 3 AGAINST 1

697
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:23,203
I wanted to be on this show,

698
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,540
so I want to thank you
for taking good care of me

699
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,842
and making this a welcoming experience.

700
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:32,880
I also want to thank you
for being so warm and easygoing.

701
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:34,281
That's very sweet.

702
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:38,519
This was our first time filming together,
and you seem like a wonderful person.

703
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:41,355
-It was a real pleasure to meet you.
-Thank you.

704
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:44,858
Thank you for joining us today
despite your busy schedules.

705
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:46,593
Thank you!

706
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,795
THANK YOU!

707
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:50,831
-What was that?
-Thank you.

708
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:51,899
What was that?

709
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,501
I'm Orbit, a science communicator
who shops rationally.

710
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,104
I'm Moon Sanghoon,
and I believe money can buy happiness.

711
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:59,973
They're practically part of our crew.
That's how close we are.

712
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,609
I bought it to make up
for what I missed out as a kid.

713
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:06,113
But that's in the past.
You don't need this now.

714
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,550
What are you talking about?
I genuinely, absolutely need this.

715
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:10,617
Why do you need it?

716
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:11,985
What's with the adverbs?

717
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,054
I hold on to those childhood memories.

718
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:15,489
You just bought stuff.

719
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:16,557
They're my friends.

720
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:18,859
-Don't talk about my friends like that!
-Friends?
