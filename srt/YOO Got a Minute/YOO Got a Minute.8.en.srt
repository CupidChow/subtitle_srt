1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,703
-Is this a designer chair?
-It is.

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,438
-Is it an art piece?
-It's not fake.

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,672
I bought it at a store.

4
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,674
I asked if it was an art piece.

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,576
-Really?
-Anything you want to confess?

6
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,678
I'm into alien vibes.

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,381
-It's pretty if you wear it right.
-You look different.

8
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:18,051
Doesn't this make me look sleepy?

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,193
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,063
This marks the eighth episode
of our show on Disney+.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,599
And today,
I want to start with a confession.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,838
Do you remember when I grilled Jasson
for buying a foot callus remover?

13
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,139
Well, he bought one for me.

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,742
He sent me a link,
and it actually got delivered.

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,010
Now I use it every day.

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,513
At this point, it's become a hobby.
It's gone beyond grooming.

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,549
I feel like I'm losing weight from it.

18
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,517
-I'm serious.
-What if you get shorter?

19
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,519
That'd be a problem.

20
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,123
But I look forward to using it daily,
hoping there's a lot of buildup.

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,758
That's what this show is about.

22
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,662
We get to call out the way
celebrities spend their money,

23
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,966
but we also get to discover hidden gems
that are good purchases.

24
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,568
Who are our guests today?

25
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:12,439
Our guests today have taken down…
I mean, taken over the streaming world.

26
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:16,510
Why are you messing up your lines?
It's just one sentence.

27
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,678
SORRY

28
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,683
Our guests today have shaken over…

29
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,151
APOLOGETIC SMILE

30
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,154
-Can we come in?
-No, wait.

31
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,689
Give me one last chance.

32
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,756
Let's start over.

33
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,692
Who are our guests today?

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,761
Our guests today
have taken over the streaming world.

35
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,030
They have a massive amount of subscribers.

36
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,333
So it's no surprise
their purchases are unique.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,435
SIGH OF RELIEF

38
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:44,838
Let's find out who our guests are today.

39
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,173
Please come out.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,042
Hello.

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,577
Hello.

42
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:51,645
GUESTS ENTER

43
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,681
I'm sorry for making you wait.

44
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,450
-Hello.
-You're wearing heels.

45
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,952
Can you introduce yourself?

46
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,422
Hello, I'm Lee Sabae,
and I'm a beauty content creator.

47
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,091
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

48
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,158
LEE SABAE

49
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,994
Hello, I'm RALRAL.

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,362
It's nice to meet you.

51
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,097
RALRAL
A COLLECTOR OF UNIQUE ITEMS

52
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,299
What did you say in the introduction?

53
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,035
-Did you say "shaken over"?
-They've taken over.

54
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,204
-Shaken over?
-Taken over.

55
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,573
-They've taken over?
-Taken over!

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,974
LAUGHS

57
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,410
Both of our guests are content creators.

58
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,179
How long have you been doing this?

59
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,481
It's been about five years.

60
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,216
What about you, Sabae?

61
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,051
It's been ten years for me.

62
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,755
-Did you start in 2015?
-Yes, I started creating content in 2015.

63
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,859
-It's been 14 years for me.
-That's a long time.

64
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,661
-Respect.
-UCC.

65
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,096
You were creating content
back in the UCC days.

66
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,334
As content creators,
what are your spending habits like?

67
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,537
I don't buy things I don't need.

68
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,339
-You're sensible with money?
-Yes.

69
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:57,611
I only buy things
that I think are worth keeping forever.

70
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:02,282
As you can see from my outfit,
I'm into unique clothes.

71
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,554
This style is more common overseas,
so it can be quite pricey to buy here.

72
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,524
But, even if I love it,
I don't buy it unless it's on sale.

73
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,660
-That's super sensible.
-I'm very sensible with my spending.

74
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,664
But considering what you said,
your cart's pretty full right now.

75
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,501
You'll think they're really worth it
when you see them.

76
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,670
-They must be worth the price.
-They are.

77
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,840
They're also worth holding onto forever.

78
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,009
-I think I'm going to lose.
-Why?

79
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,979
I don't think in terms of lifetime value.

80
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,113
What about you?

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,883
I don't waste money,
but I also don't wait for sales.

82
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,287
My taste is very unique,
so it's hard to find things I like.

83
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:44,458
-So if it catches your eye, you buy it.
-I do. But even then, there isn't much.

84
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,593
So if it's a unique item,

85
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,732
I have to buy it right away
no matter how expensive it is.

86
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:57,404
On this show, we each take a side
and defend your purchases.

87
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,606
Who would you like to have defend you?

88
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,844
I'd like Byungjae to defend me.

89
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,348
Absolutely not.
Ryugyu can't even say his lines properly.

90
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,850
EMBARRASSED

91
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,985
Sabae and I were both born in 1988

92
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,355
and started creating content
around the same time.

93
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,126
We even go to the same salon.
We've already met a few times this week.

94
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,196
-You must've seen each other today.
-We met this morning.

95
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,764
Shouldn't we trade then?

96
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,099
-It's not fair.
-What's going on?

97
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,670
I don't want a partner
who keeps messing up his lines.

98
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,872
You can defend yourself.

99
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,041
Me? Then why is he here?

100
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,375
I'm here to cheer you on.

101
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,711
-He can be supportive.
-Cheer me on? Really?

102
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,881
-All right, I'll defend Sabae.
-And I'll defend RALRAL.

103
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,417
He's not her first choice,
but we'll roll with it.

104
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,619
Why don't you kick things off, Ryugyu?

105
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:50,123
I think you made a mistake.
It seems you brought your niece's outfit.

106
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,492
-No, those are for her dog.
-Are they?

107
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,062
-Do you wear these?
-Yes, I do.

108
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,131
Women's clothes usually run in sizes…

109
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,368
-They're typically size two or four.
-Or a size small.

110
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,070
May I ask what size this is?

111
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,938
-Is this a size negative two?
-Negative?

112
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,576
No, that size doesn't exist.
It's between a size zero and a two.

113
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,913
Look at it.
It looks like a toilet paper holder.

114
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,148
When you wear it, it stretches.

115
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,452
You can use it as a bag
to carry pears or peaches.

116
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,288
You can't put fruit
in such a beautiful thing.

117
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,857
-It's really cute.
-You're right.

118
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:24,992
FINALLY GETTING ALONG

119
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,562
Sabae bought clothes that fit her.

120
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,697
So why are you asking about them?

121
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,368
I can understand the clothes,
but this pillow?

122
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,970
MINI PILLOW
A MUST-HAVE FOR BEAUTY, SLEEP, AND HEALTH

123
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,073
Who just laughed? Was it the director?

124
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,510
My head is so big,
I could use this as an eye mask.

125
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:47,147
It's the perfect size for an eye mask.
Are you sure this is a pillow?

126
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:51,985
I've tried so many pillows
and spent a lot of money.

127
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,120
All for better sleep.

128
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:58,759
Yes, because I get headaches
and also neck pain.

129
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,128
You're supposed to lie on it like this.

130
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,664
There's a space here
so your neck stays straight.

131
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,832
That way, you get fewer neck wrinkles.

132
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,167
-Really?
-Yes.

133
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,037
-I see why you wouldn't get wrinkles.
-Right.

134
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,305
You don't want wrinkles.

135
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,042
You're a beauty content creator,
so it sounds convincing.

136
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,612
A pillow isn't good
just because it's big and fluffy.

137
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,883
You need one that's right for you,
and this one's perfect for me.

138
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,885
So this is the only one I'll be using.

139
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,722
-Is this okay for your neck?
-It will smooth out your wrinkles.

140
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,524
-Your wrinkles are gone.
-Really?

141
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,025
They were there earlier.

142
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,994
-What?
-Never mind.

143
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,265
-You can't get rid of wrinkles.
-They're hard to get rid of.

144
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:41,768
You can't get rid of them,
but you can prevent new ones.

145
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,872
You're touching your neck, Director.
You're interested, right?

146
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,408
-Doesn't that mean it's a good purchase?
-You've totally convinced me.

147
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,078
Money or plastic surgery
can't erase neck wrinkles,

148
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,047
which is why they're seen
as a sign of consistent care.

149
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,718
-Where can you buy that?
-I think I need it.

150
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,421
-Are you picky about your pillow?
-No, I use whatever pillow I've got.

151
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,557
-You can't fool me!
-What?

152
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,359
You're on the opposing team.

153
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,494
Why the heck did you buy this?

154
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,062
Why did you buy that?

155
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,531
What happened to the script?

156
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,566
THAT'S JUST HOW OUR SHOW IS

157
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:17,604
The clothes and pillow are a bit small,
but they're not weird.

158
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,072
I'll show you what weird is.

159
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,441
-She doesn't own anything weird.
-I don't.

160
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,310
Here they are.

161
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,145
-They're not weird.
-They're not weird.

162
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,181
This is weird, and so is this.

163
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,248
UNIQUE OUTFITS

164
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,518
-Actually, there's a lot I couldn't bring.
-What else do you have?

165
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,155
I have so many clothes.
If it's colorful and unique, I'll buy it.

166
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,225
I love colorful things,
so everything I own is vibrant.

167
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:42,196
There's an artistic side to my style,
like <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

168
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,531
-What was the name?
-What?

169
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,266
-Oompa Loompas?
-No.

170
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,035
The really famous author.

171
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,369
-Mark Twain.
-No.

172
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,105
-Hwang Sunwon.
-No, famous for their art…

173
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,774
-Yi Munyeol.
-No.

174
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:57,010
I'm supposed to be criticizing
your purchases,

175
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,913
but flashy makeup and outfits
suit you very well.

176
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,686
I buy unique things
and then create content based on them.

177
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,121
In a way, these are all works of art.

178
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,925
-What does that mean?
-That was a good jab.

179
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:16,730
When RALRAL creates a character,
she pours her heart into it.

180
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,966
So her outfits themselves
become works of art.

181
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,601
-Am I right?
-Yes. Nicely put.

182
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,269
This doesn't look too expensive.

183
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,771
-It's not.
-It seems like it's reasonably priced.

184
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,140
-These aren't expensive.
-This looks cute.

185
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,176
-How do I look?
-You look great.

186
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,178
-It looks good on you.
-It does.

187
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,412
That's crazy.

188
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,381
-Can I have this?
-Of course.

189
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,184
-Really?
-It even matches your hair.

190
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,820
-It's my size, too.
-I told you it's cute.

191
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,657
-You look like the character from <i>Batman.</i>
-Poison Ivy?

192
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,660
-I'm burning this outfit.
-I told you it looked weird.

193
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,028
NOT EASY TO PULL OFF

194
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,132
I think RALRAL will really like this one.

195
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,302
-If she does, I want to give it to her.
-What is it?

196
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,970
Just a second.

197
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,040
There are so many things,
it'll take a while to get them out.

198
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,476
-Eyelashes.
-Eyelashes?

199
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,877
EYELASHES &amp; MAKEUP BRUSHES

200
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,346
First of all, thank you.
I'll put it to good use.

201
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,917
-I didn't realize how nice you were.
-Right?

202
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,153
Wearing lashes like these

203
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,991
turns your eyes into
a beautifully crafted work of art.

204
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,994
I've tried getting these
to portray one of my characters,

205
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,863
-but they're hard to find.
-Really?

206
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,097
They're rare.

207
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,433
-They're hard to find overseas, too.
-I know.

208
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,870
I used to have long, pretty lashes
when I was young,

209
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,673
but as I got older,
they thinned and fell out.

210
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,843
So I've always wanted long eyelashes.

211
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,944
You want to try?

212
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,579
-Can I?
-Of course.

213
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,415
-Which lashes?
-I think these will look good on him.

214
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,319
Since you're wearing black,
these sexy lashes will suit you.

215
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,255
-You'll look sexy.
-I'm in. I have big, pretty eyes.

216
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:49,756
Close your eyes.

217
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,858
GETTING A MAKEOVER

218
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,192
He looks so pretty.

219
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,195
Don't open your eyes yet.
Only one side is done.

220
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,099
This reminds me of those rare butterflies,
like the Holly Blue.

221
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,902
-Butterflies?
-The ones that are rare catches.

222
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,871
-Keep your eyes closed.
-Okay.

223
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,974
-They're so long.
-I haven't seen them yet.

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,609
-They're long.
-They're so bold.

225
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,878
-Do you want them?
-No, I don't.

226
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,279
SHE REFUSES

227
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,248
Your voice sounds different now.

228
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,417
-She also owns brushes.
-Look at his hands.

229
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,854
She uses those brushes for makeup.

230
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,090
-Here, take one.
-That's right. I do.

231
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,626
Here. Take a makeup brush.

232
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,228
These are the brushes
that she actually uses.

233
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,230
-You can open your eyes.
-Can I?

234
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,901
Look at you.

235
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,235
SEDUCTIVE

236
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,906
Doesn't this make me look sleepy?

237
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,410
I look tired, even though I'm not.

238
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,512
Am I supposed to open my eyes wide?

239
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,780
Usually…

240
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,015
LIKE THIS?

241
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,084
-He looks like Jigsaw.
-Do this.

242
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,853
I can feel the breeze.

243
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,921
AUTUMN BREEZE

244
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,990
It's better when I open my eyes wide.

245
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,158
It suits you.

246
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,893
-Should I take them off?
-Yes.

247
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,199
Don't you get confused
with so many brushes?

248
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,468
-Are you questioning my expertise?
-No, not at all.

249
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,405
I've been doing makeup for 15 years.

250
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,473
Amateurs can get confused.

251
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,175
That was an amateur question.

252
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,144
-Come on.
-"Don't you get confused?"

253
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,079
Each brush has a specific use.

254
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:25,052
They differ in shape, material,
and the way they're cut.

255
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,321
What do you apply with this brush?

256
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,423
This is for applying powder.

257
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,092
What about this one? They look the same.

258
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,094
This smaller brush is for finer areas.

259
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,063
THE AMATEUR TRIES TO MAKE IT CONFUSING

260
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,664
What about this brush?

261
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,067
-It's for cleansing.
-And this?

262
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,304
I think the next item
is the largest we've ever had.

263
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,873
Is it comfortable to sit on?

264
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,009
I haven't sat on it,
but it's got a lot of gaps.

265
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,711
You sound so uncultured.

266
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,147
That was a good one.

267
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,484
Chairs are not only for sitting,
but also for decoration.

268
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,154
-Is it more for display?
-Yes, just to look at.

269
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,891
I don't know the exact price,
but I have a rough idea.

270
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:08,161
This has to be at least a million won.

271
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,565
-I'd say it's way over a million won.
-I agree.

272
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,867
Why get something you won't even sit on?

273
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,537
A chair like that
only gets more valuable over time.

274
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,172
-That's true.
-The older it is.

275
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,940
-Is this a designer chair?
-It is.

276
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,008
Is it an art piece?

277
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,710
It's not a fake piece.
I bought it at a department store.

278
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,412
I asked if it was an art piece.

279
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,314
-Really?
-Anything you want to confess?

280
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,851
-Have you bought a fake before?
-This isn't a fake piece!

281
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,919
This is pretty.

282
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,054
-It is really pretty.
-Right?

283
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,057
There's only one of these in the world.
Guess how much it is.

284
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,559
I think it's 15 million won.

285
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,194
This is one of a kind.

286
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,431
This looks mid-century,
and furniture from that era is expensive.

287
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,800
-The only one in the world?
-Yes.

288
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,337
-I think it's 20 million won.
-20 million won?

289
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:54,308
These dripping details
are all hand-painted. See here?

290
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,311
-It must be a designer piece.
-Look at the details.

291
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,213
This is by a designer named RALRAL.

292
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,282
She's a content creator.

293
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,251
-You made this?
-Yes.

294
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,119
SPEECHLESS

295
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:10,791
I bought a basic white chair
and painted the design.

296
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,759
-How much was the chair?
-One million won.

297
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,528
So it's worth a million won.

298
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:18,298
Since I painted it, the value's gone up.
It's worth 20 million.

299
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,300
It does look very artistic.

300
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,935
-Did you study art?
-No.

301
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,337
I can tell.

302
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,606
-It's really pretty.
-What's wrong with you?

303
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,475
-It's just not conventional.
-She hit him so hard.

304
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:33,146
I'm a little jealous
about these next items.

305
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,549
-But this is insane.
-It's too much.

306
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,718
This is too much.

307
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:41,688
-No, it's not.
-This is way too much.

308
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,824
Who cares for their hair like this?

309
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,693
I was shocked
when I first heard about this.

310
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,496
Who has enough hair
to use all these products?

311
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,731
What?

312
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,834
I'll tell you the order I use these in.

313
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:59,039
First, spray this treatment,
then apply the protector.

314
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,175
Both go on dry hair.

315
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,778
Next, wet your hair and use the shampoo,

316
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:09,149
followed by conditioner or treatment.

317
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,119
-Then the scalp treatment.
-To protect the scalp.

318
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,888
After that, you have to rinse it out.

319
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:19,126
Towel dry your hair
and apply the hair foam.

320
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:24,064
Before you blow-dry your hair,
spray the scalp tonic.

321
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:28,502
Everyone, scalp tonic is really important.

322
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,270
ALL HAIL THE SCALP TONIC

323
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:33,540
You spray it on your scalp
and massage it in.

324
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:38,145
Your scalp is part of your skin.
When it ages, your face ages too.

325
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:43,283
Even if you take great care of your face,
that won't matter if your scalp ages.

326
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,688
Unless you're doing ASMR content,
who does all this every single day?

327
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:51,658
-I've only seen this in ASMR content.
-How long does all this take?

328
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,160
At least 40 minutes.

329
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,062
How do you do this every single day?

330
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,098
You invest that much time?
I barely even wash my hair.

331
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,301
She has to because her hair is so damaged.

332
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,370
He's right. My hair is damaged.

333
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,472
If your hair isn't damaged,

334
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,877
you can keep it simple
and use the shampoo and treatment.

335
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,979
As well as these three products.

336
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,981
How is that simple?

337
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,649
You only took out two things.

338
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,685
Since women have long hair,
drying it is a lot of work.

339
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,422
So if they're not going out,
many just skip washing it.

340
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,892
-But you use these every day.
-Almost every day.

341
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,760
It's my daily routine.

342
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:31,365
I invest in my body
more than in anything else.

343
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,134
Makes sense.
That's why she's a beauty influencer.

344
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,370
Not only that,

345
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:41,141
I'm also the CEO of a company,

346
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,411
so I have to take care of
both my health and appearance.

347
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,682
Which is why we look so different,
despite being the same age.

348
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,718
I don't take care of myself, but she does.

349
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,821
-He was born with it, and I worked for it.
-Born with it?

350
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,190
WHAT IS SHE IMPLYING?

351
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,758
I have something to say.

352
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,695
Everything you said makes sense,
but why not just stop dyeing your hair?

353
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,164
You color your hair to look glamorous.

354
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,701
You put it through so much.
That's why you use all these products.

355
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:13,907
Even if I don't dye it,
pollution and sunlight damage my hair.

356
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,711
Then what about me?
My hair falls out just from touching it.

357
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:20,347
-Don't touch it then.
-You need to take medicine.

358
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,715
A LOOK OF DEFEAT

359
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:25,085
Instead of asking her,
get a doctor's prescription.

360
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,855
You have to take medicine
and use scalp tonic spray.

361
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,523
I really recommend this product.

362
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,124
-Okay.
-Why are you nodding?

363
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,426
NODS IN AGREEMENT

364
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,929
-That's incredible.
-These next items take up the whole cart.

365
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,299
RALRAL bought these but never uses them.

366
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,367
UNUSED PURSES

367
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,102
This bag is full of purses.

368
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,437
-Awesome.
-What is it?

369
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:49,109
I love buying these tiny, cute purses,

370
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,211
-but I don't use them.
-What?

371
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,646
Then why do you buy them?

372
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:55,015
Because they're cute and pretty.

373
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,985
Whenever I see something I like, I buy it.

374
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,787
Why buy so many purses
if you don't use them?

375
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,155
I don't use them.

376
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:06,159
So you don't use them,
but you still want to buy more?

377
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:10,063
It's not that I want to.
I just buy them because they're pretty.

378
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,465
Another cushion foundation.

379
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,368
I have about 20 of them
because I keep losing them.

380
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,203
-You said you have ADHD.
-Yes.

381
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,604
Were you diagnosed?

382
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,906
Yes, I'm on medication.

383
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,174
-Really?
-Yes.

384
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,746
I can't set priorities
or plan things out step by step.

385
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,349
My mind never rests.
It's like having 300 TVs on.

386
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,187
When I wake up tomorrow,
I'll I think about what I want to do

387
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,855
or what content I want to make.

388
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,423
I just can't stop thinking.

389
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,659
-That's great for your job.
-Right.

390
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,727
I was born in the right era.

391
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,630
-Actually, RALRAL--
-What is all that?

392
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:47,234
Her style isn't only about being flashy.
She has a favorite color.

393
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:48,969
-That's so cool.
-A pink princess?

394
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,537
PINK OUTFITS FOR COOL SKIN TONES

395
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,240
I never used to wear pink,

396
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:56,009
but my color analysis said
I'm a cool winter.

397
00:17:56,076 --> 00:18:00,214
-Cool winter?
-Yes, so I changed my whole wardrobe.

398
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:04,651
But cool winter shades include deep tones
like black and icy blue.

399
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,887
-That's right.
-Deep tones, right?

400
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,188
So why only pink?

401
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,559
People tell me I look good in it.
It even looks good on camera.

402
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,062
Byungjae,
they're all different shades of pink.

403
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,064
-No, they're not.
-Yes, they are.

404
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,433
They're all different,
like the makeup brushes.

405
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,769
I know that's hot pink.
It's like the <i>Squid Game </i>color.

406
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,538
Try it on.

407
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,473
Some shades make my face pop.

408
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,475
-Can you tell?
-Let me see.

409
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,511
Yes, it suits you.

410
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,145
-It looks good.
-You're right.

411
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,581
So I changed everything to pink.

412
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:38,919
-But some of them are a bit small.
-This is my size.

413
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,787
This is Seobin's.

414
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,391
-My daughter is a cool summer.
-Your daughter?

415
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,860
How do you do a color analysis on a baby?

416
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:51,431
I tried different outfits on my daughter,
and she looks better in vibrant colors.

417
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,401
Your daughter is a cool summer,
and you're a cool winter.

418
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,503
Can you tell ours just by looking at us?

419
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,742
Since dark shades suit you,
I think cool tones will look good on you.

420
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,544
I think Byungjae has warm undertones.

421
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,514
I always thought I had warm undertones,
but I have cool undertones.

422
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:10,384
-I see.
-Why do you look pleased?

423
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,953
Doesn't this look better?

424
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,022
-You're right.
-Right?

425
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,657
LOOKS BETTER IN BRIGHT COLORS

426
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,726
Byungjae has cool undertones,
and you have warm undertones.

427
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:21,461
-This doesn't suit you.
-Which one?

428
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,630
-It's not like that.
-It's not?

429
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,801
-No, but I have cool undertones.
-Then try one of the pink outfits.

430
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,505
I'm discovering a side of Sabae
that I didn't know.

431
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:35,108
-I never knew she had an alter ego.
-What's that?

432
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,745
It's probably because I work with makeup.

433
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:43,050
Isn't this pretty?
I think it'll look good on you, Byungjae.

434
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,853
-Lee Junghyun's <i>Give to You.</i>
-It has that vibe.

435
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,888
-Is that a plate stand?
-A plate stand?

436
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:51,258
-Like where you stack dishes.
-No.

437
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:55,028
Back in the day, we used that.
You could even buy it at temples.

438
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:56,697
That's also a headband.

439
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,267
-Really? I thought it was a beard.
-No, it's not.

440
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:03,770
-You wear it on your head.
-They're bangs.

441
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,340
You look pretty.

442
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,243
-It's pretty if you wear it right.
-You look different.

443
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,178
-Put it on top of your head.
-On top?

444
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:13,413
-It suits your outfit.
-You look cute.

445
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,949
Doesn't it look like
we're all from outer space?

446
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,017
-Yes.
-Yes.

447
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,418
SAVE THE PLANET

448
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,655
I'm into alien vibes.

449
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,724
Alien vibes? What does that mean?

450
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,527
-I'm similar to RALRAL.
-You like unique things.

451
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,963
I like unique things
and love cosmic colors.

452
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,533
-It's really beautiful.
-Cosmic beauty.

453
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,636
Like Esperman from the <i>Ureme </i>films.

454
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,404
IMPRESSED BY THE PERFECT EXAMPLE

455
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:41,708
Also, in <i>Vector Men,</i>
beautiful women always played that role.

456
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:44,811
-They were usually villains.
-I get what you mean.

457
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:49,316
If your goal is to look like an alien,
you should wear this.

458
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:52,019
-Can you pass me that?
-Wait!

459
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,455
If you wear this,
you'll look like an alien.

460
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,225
DEMONSTRATION

461
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,761
READY FOR A TRIP TO SPACE

462
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,229
That looks cool.

463
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:03,363
-Really?
-Yes.

464
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,600
-Yeah, that's perfect.
-What is she doing?

465
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,969
She's attaching a wig, and it looks good.

466
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,871
Am I an alien, or is this my future?

467
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:11,939
BALD

468
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:15,409
Are these all makeup accessories?

469
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,645
A VARIETY OF MAKEUP ACCESSORIES

470
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:22,716
I create a lot of content
with celebrities,

471
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,786
and these are some of the accessories
that I use.

472
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:29,256
-What's this?
-You stick this on.

473
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:35,195
I have a variety of contact lenses
because celebrities wear them quite often.

474
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:38,298
So as you can see,
I've got a range of colors.

475
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:43,070
-These lenses are unique.
-Yes, there are green ones, too.

476
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,673
When Sion from NCT Wish
came on my channel,

477
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,010
we created a look to match his character.

478
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:56,316
So he wore purple contacts,
and we put these jewels on his face.

479
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,953
Can someone like Byungjae wear them?

480
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,290
-"Someone like Byungjae"?
-Was that a bit rude?

481
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:07,594
I've always wanted to try contacts,
but I've been too scared.

482
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,963
-Pick a color.
-I want something bold.

483
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,031
Okay.

484
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:14,334
This is one of my favorite contacts.

485
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,171
-Would you like to try these on?
-Yes.

486
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,706
-I'm so curious.
-You're trying everything today.

487
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,510
Keep your eyes open
or you'll hurt yourself.

488
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:25,512
-I am.
-Keep them open.

489
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,448
-This isn't going to work.
-Keep them open.

490
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,117
I'll keep them open.

491
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,385
A HELPING HAND

492
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:36,023
-Okay.
-Look up. Look at my fingers up here.

493
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,226
-These lenses are so pretty.
-Right?

494
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:40,761
You should buy them.

495
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,462
HE CHECKS HIMSELF OUT

496
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,231
Aren't they mesmerizing?

497
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,666
I look good.

498
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,167
He's acting cute.

499
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,703
-Look at his hands.
-Are these expensive?

500
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:53,607
-No, they're not.
-Should I buy some?

501
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:58,512
We had Lee Sabae
and RALRAL on the show today.

502
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,248
Each of you will pick an item
that you regret buying.

503
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:05,586
Our viewers can enter the drawing,
and we'll send it to the lucky winner.

504
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,287
Can you each select an item?

505
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:08,589
I'm choosing a big one.

506
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,457
-Which one?
-This is huge.

507
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:11,959
Don't tell me it's the chair.

508
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,393
It's the chair I made.

509
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,695
REALLY?

510
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,897
-Not the six million won one?
-No way.

511
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:20,767
Is it okay to accept that?

512
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,703
Why doesn't anyone look excited?

513
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,172
It took me 16 hours to paint that chair.

514
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,008
We're just overwhelmed with gratitude.

515
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,043
I don't know if we can accept that.

516
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,546
I take it back!

517
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,616
-Should I give away a purse?
-I like the one you bought recently.

518
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,886
It still has the tag on it.
I'll give away this cute purse.

519
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:42,222
Since it's festival season,

520
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:47,027
I'll give away some cute stickers,
and these beads that are quite popular.

521
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,830
-That's cute.
-These are really to wear on these days.

522
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:52,599
You can put these on your face
or your fingernails.

523
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:57,304
Instead of your everyday makeup,

524
00:23:57,371 --> 00:24:01,808
I hope you can use these items
to express a different side of yourself.

525
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,150
We took a look
at your spending habits today.

526
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:12,519
So how was it for you, Sabae?

527
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,088
It was so much fun.

528
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:19,893
To be honest, I get asked
about my purchases all the time.

529
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,462
And I feel like
I finally got to explain myself.

530
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,865
You all related to my purchases,

531
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,967
but also told me
what you didn't agree with.

532
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:32,172
I plan to stick to my spending habits
and enjoy life to the fullest.

533
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,141
Everyone, buy what you want!

534
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,377
-That was awesome.
-So confident.

535
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:39,680
I had so much fun, too.

536
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:43,383
But Sabae did make me reflect on
the purchases I made.

537
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,787
Before I buy something,
I need to see if it has lifetime value.

538
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:49,756
I need to stop buying things
that I think are pretty or unique.

539
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,226
I will be more frugal from now on.

540
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,463
-Thank you for coming on the show.
-Thank you.

541
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,832
A BIG THANKS TO SABAE AND RALRAL

542
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,368
-You've met Cha Eunwoo and Byeon Wooseok.
-Yes.

543
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:02,736
What do you think?

544
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,271
So typical of the newly rich.

545
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:08,609
They go at each other
like it's a UFC fight.

546
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,512
-It's a German trash can.
-Germany's mad.

547
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:14,047
It can crush plastic bottles.

548
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,316
If I do this…

549
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:19,753
FLUSTERED

550
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,591
Apparently, a tribal chief
in Côte d'Ivoire used this stool.

551
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:27,194
-I bought it in Seongsu-dong.
-How did it get there?

552
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,328
I paid 400,000 won.

553
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:30,864
That's a steal.
