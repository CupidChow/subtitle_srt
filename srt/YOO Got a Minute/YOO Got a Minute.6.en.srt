1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,304
-Isn't that called "miserly"?
-What?

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,240
You're such an amateur.

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,841
It must be so tough for you.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,443
-What?
-I feel bad for you.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,214
I'm actually really upset and annoyed.

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,385
I can't believe I acted with someone
who hasn't even read <i>Slam Dunk.</i>

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,154
-We're from different generations.
-It's absurd.

8
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,161
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

9
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:32,232
Before we proceed with the show today,
let's get this out of the way.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,500
Today's our first shoot.

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,370
It's a lot of pressure,
but we're going to push through.

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,807
To ease some of this pressure,
we've got amazing guests with us today.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,309
We do.

14
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,878
DID YOUR VOICE JUST CRACK?

15
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,949
One claims to be a minimalist,
while the other says he's a maximalist.

16
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,085
But as we've seen before,
we have to hear them out first.

17
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,188
People aren't aware
of their spending habits.

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,458
Let's welcome today's guests.
Please, come on out.

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,561
Hello.

20
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,863
-It's good to see you.
-Hello.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,665
-Nice to meet you.
-Have a seat.

22
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,767
Hello.

23
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:07,835
OFF TO A TENSE START

24
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,537
Could you introduce yourselves?
Where should we look?

25
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,672
Go ahead.

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,739
NO, YOU GO FIRST

27
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,577
-This is Park Jihwan.
-This is actor Ro Woon.

28
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,879
It's great to have you.
Thank you for coming.

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,117
We'll cover this again later,
but you're starring in a drama together.

30
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,253
-We are.
-Could you tell us about it?

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,659
We worked on Disney+'s
first original historical drama.

32
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,628
It's called <i>The Murky Stream.</i>

33
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,397
We're here to spread the word
about our drama today.

34
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,532
That's right!

35
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,537
Could you tell us
about your spending habits?

36
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,340
I'm not that much of a spender.

37
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,376
Even if I see something I want,
I usually just walk away.

38
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,111
-Do you buy expensive things?
-No.

39
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,681
-What about designer brands or watches?
-No.

40
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,717
-What about cars?
-No.

41
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,485
Really? What about you, Ro Woon?

42
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,387
I don't buy many things either.

43
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,924
But if I decide to buy something,
I don't hesitate much.

44
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,726
What's something you bought recently?

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,564
Well, I like whiskey,
so I picked up a bottle recently.

46
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,766
I also got a bottle
of Mo**ai in Hong Kong.

47
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,234
You must like drinking.

48
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,870
-You have to be careful with Mo**ai.
-Why?

49
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,807
-You can't tell if it's real or fake.
-I heard that, too.

50
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,910
I bought it from a reputable place.

51
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,445
-Everyone says that.
-Really?

52
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,081
I've heard plenty of stories.
It's a great liquor.

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,751
But there's a chance
you might end up with a fake.

54
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,252
This actually happened to me.

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,489
An acquaintance bought me a bottle,
so I took a sip.

56
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,193
But it didn't taste quite right.

57
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,929
They asked if it was good and took a sip.

58
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,032
Then they said it was a fake
and took it away.

59
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,635
You briefly told us
about your spending habits,

60
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,939
so now, let's take a look at
the items you brought today.

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,407
I'll go first.

62
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,276
Honestly, I don't know
what to make of this.

63
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,079
Here it is. This is…

64
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,147
LONG OVERCOAT

65
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,083
This is from Ro Woon's closet.

66
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,653
What's wrong with that?
He's tall and he's into fashion.

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,556
-I understand that.
-It's totally normal.

68
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,459
I'm just wondering why
he hung a blanket on a hanger.

69
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,927
Is that a bathrobe?

70
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,330
I got that as a gift.

71
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,100
A brand I worked with
gave that to me as a gift.

72
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,335
How tall are you?

73
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,670
-I'm 6 feet, 2 inches tall.
-Must be nice!

74
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,339
THE WOES OF BEING SHORT

75
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,374
Can you try this on?

76
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,576
I don't wear this that often.

77
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,512
-That looks good on him.
-It does.

78
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,848
We measured it,
and that coat is 55 inches long.

79
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,950
You should try it on.

80
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,352
I don't know.

81
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,654
-It might be uncomfortable.
-Why?

82
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,990
-If it suits him, can he have it?
-Of course.

83
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,125
NOT MUCH TO SCAN

84
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,227
SAME COAT, DIFFERENT VIBE

85
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,328
<i>Galaxy Express 999.</i>

86
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,231
-Do I look like that character?
-Yes.

87
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,933
Why are these pants so short?

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,735
They're too short for me.

89
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,436
I see.

90
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,173
He brought them because they're too short.

91
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
What?

92
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,341
HEM LENGTH IS FINE

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,410
They come up to here?

94
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,879
-It must be so tough for you.
-What?

95
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,147
I feel bad for you.

96
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,016
NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE

97
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,919
I wanted to ask about these.

98
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
-Those are Jihwan's.
-We see a lot of books on this show.

99
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,157
-Even from a distance, I can tell.
-Tell what?

100
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,325
That he loves books.

101
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,827
I'm serious.
Look at how faded the colors are.

102
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:26,800
I assumed you bought these ages ago,
but it turns out you buy used books.

103
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,068
Yes, I do.

104
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,804
You don't get the sentiment
behind buying used books.

105
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,207
You could buy it new,
so why go for a used copy?

106
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,710
You might as well just get an e-book then.

107
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,781
When it's out of print or hard to find,
I'll buy a used copy.

108
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,917
Is there a particular book or author
that's memorable to you?

109
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,687
I suffer from literary amnesia.

110
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,324
A few days after I finish a book,
it all fades away.

111
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,894
-That's convenient.
-It is.

112
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,531
I really enjoyed the book he recommended.

113
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,866
-What was it?
<i>-The Crazed.</i>

114
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,000
<i>The Crazed.</i>

115
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,368
<i>-The Crazed.</i>
-Crazy person?

116
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,037
-It was my first time crying over a book.
-Oh, dear.

117
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:08,342
I told him I loved the book,
so he recommended a bunch more.

118
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,510
What's the book about?

119
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,411
I also have a bad memory.

120
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,113
That's pretty convenient.

121
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,384
We heard you gave away the book

122
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,319
-that Jihwan gave you.
-What?

123
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,855
-Books are meant to be shared.
-Yes, of course.

124
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,824
HE INSTANTLY SWITCHES GEARS

125
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,859
-I heard a slight pause.
-No.

126
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,329
-You ruined our plan by going off-script.
-What was the plan?

127
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,634
-I don't think you should give away gifts.
-They're meaningful.

128
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,369
-You're a jerk.
-No, wait.

129
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,204
What a jerk.

130
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:41,375
I gave it to an actor friend
and told him it was a gift from Jihwan.

131
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,709
So you told him.

132
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,511
He gifted it with love.

133
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,747
Weren't you going to side with me earlier?

134
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,683
-You did pause a bit earlier.
-No, I didn't.

135
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,887
That gift carried his emotions,
his experiences, and even his tears.

136
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,724
I have a question for you.
I have a friend who also likes used books.

137
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,128
He bought the same book
for one million won.

138
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,829
This is a masterpiece.

139
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,132
It's like owning a moon jar.

140
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,266
A moon jar.

141
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:10,037
Someone told me to read
<i>Misunderstanding </i>by Won Jaegil.

142
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,471
He said it was really good.

143
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,843
But there were only three copies
in the whole country.

144
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,678
So I bought all three copies.

145
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,112
-You bought all three?
-Yes.

146
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,148
-Like Kim Seondal?
-Yes.

147
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,917
-Someday, I'll gift it to someone.
-Thank you.

148
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,019
-He's thanking him.
-Thank you so much.

149
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,455
Who was it that bought this book?

150
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,558
-Me. I bought it.
-Thank you.

151
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,796
-How about 1.1 million won?
-Okay, 1.1 million.

152
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,565
We looked into another one
of Ro Woon's items.

153
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,434
This was surprising.

154
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,302
It's his favorite.

155
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,338
-Really?
-Yes, I really like it.

156
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,240
But you know,

157
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:51,178
experts say that vinyl and cassette tapes
sound worse than digital masters.

158
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,446
There he goes again.

159
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,883
It's better to listen to digital masters,
so what made you buy this?

160
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,384
You don't get it.

161
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,754
-It's about the vibe it gives.
-It's about the vibe!

162
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,589
He doesn't get it.

163
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,225
No matter how good the hi-fi is,
lo-fi has its own feel.

164
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,195
I just sounded pretty cool.
Anyway, it's about the vibe.

165
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,698
You can listen to music
by pressing a few buttons on your phone.

166
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,569
But with this, you have to find the tape
and rewind it when you're done.

167
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,873
Honestly, with the move
from MiniDiscs to CDs to MP3s,

168
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,276
I don't understand
the nostalgia for going back.

169
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,245
You say you don't understand,
so I brought something.

170
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,081
Some people bought these
when they came back as a trend.

171
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,018
I think Byungjae forgot about this.

172
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,887
-That looks so cool.
-How can you explain this?

173
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,289
-Give it to me.
-I want it.

174
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,458
-You can carry this around.
-I can carry this, too.

175
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,826
This one is light.

176
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,029
And this one looks nicer.

177
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,263
Does it have this?

178
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,167
An antenna? I can add that.

179
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,702
This runs on batteries.

180
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,737
Mine too. It can run wired or wireless.

181
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,974
-It records and even has pitch control.
-Mine, too.

182
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,510
But there's a big difference.

183
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,879
-Did you buy this when it first came out?
-Yes.

184
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,581
He bought one of the reissues.

185
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,783
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

186
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,552
If you knew what was inside,
you wouldn't say that.

187
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm curious.

188
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,822
Did you see what was inside?

189
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,624
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

190
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,259
Then why did you gasp?

191
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,395
Let me show you… How do I take it out?

192
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,432
-You don't know how?
-He never even turned it on.

193
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,467
SHIN HAECHUL

194
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:24,505
-I own all of his tapes and CDs.
-Really?

195
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,175
It might sound sad, but I play this
on the anniversary of his passing.

196
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,177
It'll probably play <i>Good Bye.</i>

197
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,311
Can you play it?

198
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,713
STRUGGLING

199
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,649
Should I play it here?
I don't know how to use this.

200
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,619
Since you don't use it,
why don't you give it to them?

201
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:43,323
-They have jobs and earn money.
-Ro Woon said he wants it.

202
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,195
-Is this show about giving things away?
-No, it's not.

203
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,364
To be honest, I don't use this that often.

204
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,633
I can understand why he bought this.

205
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,569
But this doesn't look like
it can pick up frequencies.

206
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,371
-What is it?
-Be careful.

207
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,505
VINTAGE RADIO

208
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,040
Did Thomas Edison make that?

209
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,175
PROUD

210
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,910
-Does this work?
-Yes.

211
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,278
<i>Cultwo Show </i>should be on.

212
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,781
I don't listen to any other station.
I only listen to 93.1.

213
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,349
-What's that?
-Classical music.

214
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,318
I see. Can we try tuning in?

215
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,320
What year is this from?

216
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,391
I don't know.
I saw it at a vintage furniture store.

217
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,260
I loved how it sounded, so I bought it.

218
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,496
-When did you buy it?
-Five years ago.

219
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,564
I see.

220
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,933
UNRESPONSIVE

221
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,001
Are you sure it works?

222
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,204
You can do it.

223
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,839
I know you can.

224
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,641
-Is it a <i>djembe?</i>
-It can be.

225
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,876
BOUGHT IT FOR THE SOUND

226
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,412
Why did you buy this?

227
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,380
I like vintage things,

228
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,250
so I went to a vintage furniture store
in Itaewon.

229
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,985
-Hey.
-It's working.

230
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,119
A SIGN OF LIFE

231
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,254
It's not tuning in.

232
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,156
Wait.

233
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,092
Look what he did.

234
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,728
FREQUENCY MAESTRO

235
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,363
-Do you have to hold that?
-No.

236
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,365
-It's working.
-Is that the antenna?

237
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,833
So this is the antenna.

238
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,237
I have to tape it to the wall.

239
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,571
Really?

240
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:09,309
I probably shouldn't say this
considering this show's setup,

241
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,944
but why did you buy that?

242
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,781
-I heard you got it as your wedding dowry.
-I did.

243
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:18,485
There's a music show that plays
every day from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.

244
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,388
-I know it.
-I really love that show.

245
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:27,261
I wanted to listen to it on that radio,
so I begged my wife for it.

246
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,428
It's expensive, right?

247
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,431
Once you get into that world,
it can get really pricey.

248
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,766
-It was cheap.
-How much?

249
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,537
-Around 600,000 won?
-They say when it comes to hobbies--

250
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,639
Eating costs the least,
listening costs more,

251
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,040
and seeing is the priciest.

252
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,342
-Once you get into art…
-There's no going back.

253
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,278
It's very expensive.

254
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,413
Someone once showed me a porcelain jar.

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,949
-Goodness.
-You talked about the moon jar earlier.

256
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,485
I know. When I saw it, I thought…

257
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:54,421
I'm glad you brought up hobbies, Ryugyu.

258
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:58,625
If you fall too deeply into this,
it can really destroy your life.

259
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,994
Can you tell us about this whiskey?

260
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:05,132
I don't drink good whiskey by myself,

261
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:10,971
but when I drink with other people,
I bring a bottle of good whiskey with me.

262
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,673
What's the most expensive one?

263
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,543
It was hard to find,
but I got a bottle of Hi**ki 30.

264
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,611
GASP

265
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,179
That's incredible.

266
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,981
How much is a shot at a bar?

267
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,217
-Around 500,000 won.
-Exactly.

268
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,985
-One shot?
-It's worth that radio.

269
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,387
I'm sorry,
but one shot is worth that radio.

270
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:31,625
But let me ask you this.
Do you know what good whiskey tastes like?

271
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,993
You can get mad at him.

272
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,695
People just look at the label.

273
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,764
Some even say they're all the same
once you get drunk.

274
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,132
I enjoy it for the aroma.

275
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,634
Can you tell the difference?

276
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,136
-Of course I can.
-You can?

277
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,073
I'm not proud of it,
but I can prove that I love drinking.

278
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,141
My liver enzymes hit 2,000 last year.

279
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,410
-I'm all better now.
-Really?

280
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,080
I'm fine now,
but that's how much I loved drinking.

281
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,148
I know what good whiskey tastes like.

282
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,452
Say one bottle costs 100,000 won
and another 200,000 won.

283
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,088
Does the pricier one taste twice as good?

284
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,890
-No.
-It's precisely twice as good.

285
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,124
I disagree.

286
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,760
-How do you drink your whiskey?
-Neat.

287
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,329
-You don't put anything in it?
-In the whiskey?

288
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,998
You're trying to test me.

289
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,701
-Some people add a pinch of MSG.
-No, not that.

290
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,503
-Anything else?
-He has no clue.

291
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,238
I know what you're talking about.

292
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,641
Some people add a splash of crab sauce.

293
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,742
Crab sauce? No.

294
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,177
I know what it is.

295
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,112
Some drink it with a dash of <i>tsuyu.</i>

296
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,513
-No.
-What is it?

297
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,582
If you add a splash of hot water,

298
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,352
an 8-year whiskey can taste like a 12.

299
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,223
-Isn't that called "miserly"?
-What?

300
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,791
-Miserly?
-No.

301
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,159
-Do you know?
-No.

302
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,327
HE MEANT <i>MIZUWARI</i>

303
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,462
You're such an amateur.

304
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:47,701
We're going to do a blind taste test
to see if his love for whiskey is real.

305
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,936
Can you get it right?

306
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,038
-I'll try.
-Get this right and you're legit.

307
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,073
I'm sure you'll get it right.

308
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,175
-I brought these from my house.
-They're his.

309
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,780
These three glasses hold
a Ro**l Sa***e 32-year, a Bal**nie,

310
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,417
and a cheap bottle of whiskey
from the convenience store.

311
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,553
-Let's do the test.
-I've never had Ro**l Sa***e before.

312
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,090
You'll earn my respect
if you can tell these three apart.

313
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,659
But what do I gain from this?

314
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,461
You'll gain his respect.

315
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,597
It'll just bump up my liver enzymes.

316
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,265
TAKES A SNIFF

317
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,400
THEN TAKES A SIP

318
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,471
I think… I think this tastes the worst.

319
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,040
You think that's
from the convenience store?

320
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,777
NEXT WHISKEY

321
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,048
What if he gets drunk?

322
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,617
-Bal**ni!
-Bal**ni.

323
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,785
Convenience store whiskey
and Ro**l Sa***e.

324
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,420
What's the answer?

325
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,723
Bal**ni.

326
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,760
VICTORY CEREMONY

327
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,198
-He's the real deal, and you're the phony.
-How did he do that?

328
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,168
If you're so sure of yourself,
why don't you give it a try?

329
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,304
PREPARED THREE OF THE SAME WHISKEY

330
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,439
TASTE TEST

331
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,377
-Ro**l Sa***e.
-You got that from one sip?

332
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,412
It has a unique flavor.

333
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:08,715
The 32-year tastes better than the 30.
Precisely 2 years better.

334
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,817
I think he just buys the expensive one.

335
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,520
SAME WHISKEY, SECOND GLASS

336
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,923
This tastes nasty.

337
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,560
I don't know why people would drink this.

338
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:25,098
Maybe I should have had it on the rocks.
I'm starting to feel it.

339
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,734
-It's taking him a long time.
-Is there a difference?

340
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,770
Ro**l Sa***e, store whiskey, Bal**ni.

341
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,238
All three are Ro**l Sa***e.

342
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,241
-You said it tasted nasty.
-You said that.

343
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,375
EMBARRASSED

344
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,545
-All that talk about two years…
-He said it tastes better.

345
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,180
That's not the problem.

346
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,416
Why did you pour so much?

347
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,854
That's half the bottle.
You're just going to throw it out.

348
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,590
You guys did me dirty.

349
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:54,528
This is the first time
we've seen these on the show.

350
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:57,297
-They're chrysanthemum seeds.
-What?

351
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,167
Why? What's wrong with that?

352
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,169
You usually buy plants, not seeds.

353
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,272
I don't get why this is a problem.
It's a cool hobby.

354
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,108
You actually plant these seeds, right?

355
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:12,179
I wanted to see them sprout and bloom.

356
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:16,683
So there's a little place in Yeongwol
where I scatter the seeds.

357
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,519
WORRIED

358
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,920
It's private property.

359
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,422
-Is that allowed?
-Can you do that?

360
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,757
The owner is my friend.

361
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,226
-It's fine, then.
-Thank goodness.

362
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:30,297
-I plant them in the yard.
-I see.

363
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,766
-He's sharing them for free.
-The seeds?

364
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,067
Everyone can enjoy them.

365
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,704
-How do you plant the seeds?
-Can you show us?

366
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,972
-Can I do it here?
-Yes.

367
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,309
-I just throw them.
-What was that?

368
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,444
-That's it.
-You didn't even look.

369
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,813
Why did you look the other way?

370
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,248
NO NEED TO LOOK

371
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,750
He really loves plants.

372
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,652
No, I just like looking at them.

373
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,854
A DEFENSE THAT COMPLETELY FELL FLAT

374
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,222
I mean, I love them.

375
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,426
We know that Ro Woon
takes good care of himself.

376
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,761
-Is this deodorant?
-Yes.

377
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:01,828
That's a must.

378
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,865
I used this a lot when I was filming.

379
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,133
How do you use it?

380
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,372
If you apply this before makeup,
it keeps your face from sweating.

381
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,608
-You apply it to your face?
-Yes.

382
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:18,378
But sweat helps release toxins
from your body.

383
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,480
So I don't think that's good for you.

384
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,283
-It blocks it?
-Yes, but your knees will start sweating.

385
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,518
Apply it to your knees.

386
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,386
You'll sweat somewhere else.

387
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,589
Really? That's so weird.

388
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:33,160
Since we filmed 98% outdoors,
it was really hot.

389
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:39,333
But this kept my face from sweating,
so I needed fewer makeup touch-ups.

390
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,437
We touched on this earlier,
and I think the cast is amazing.

391
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:48,876
But I really love Director Choo Changmin
and Writer Cheon Seongil.

392
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,144
Can you tell us what the drama is about?

393
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,915
It's called <i>The Murky Stream.</i>

394
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:59,653
Jang Siyul, the character I play,
has to conceal his identity.

395
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,989
After getting caught up in an incident,

396
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,526
Jihwan's character takes me in
as one of his men.

397
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:09,162
There are three characters
who try to build a world they desire.

398
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:13,000
They dream of creating a better world,

399
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,270
but the reality they face is harsh.

400
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:21,108
And so they're forced to compromise

401
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:24,211
between the society they want
and the reality they face.

402
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,480
That's the heart of the story.

403
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,085
Father.

404
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,126
<i>I am sick of this life.</i>

405
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,928
<i>I will be lucky to die.</i>

406
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,963
<i>THE MURKY STREAM</i>

407
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,364
AVAILABLE ON SEPTEMBER 26

408
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,334
We'll definitely watch the show
that you worked hard on.

409
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,738
The next item is what Ro Woon uses
to stay in shape.

410
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,274
I enjoy eating this too,

411
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,777
but I've never seen anyone
take it this far.

412
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,645
If you're on a diet, listen up.

413
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:01,915
If you eat this for a week,
you'll lose 11 pounds.

414
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:05,719
Most people who are on a diet eat this.
I eat it quite often.

415
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,088
He puts them in his noodles.

416
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:12,726
Me? I do enjoy spicy noodles
with sous vide chicken breast.

417
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:17,564
I blend the chicken with water
and drink it.

418
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,133
-Without milk or honey?
-No.

419
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,702
-As a meal replacement?
-Yes.

420
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:26,707
-How much water do you add?
-Around a one-to-one ratio.

421
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,276
Then I add the chicken.

422
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,045
-In a week--
-Why close it?

423
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,648
-I have to blend it.
-You have to add seasoning.

424
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:35,883
HE'S NOT A FOODIE

425
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,051
-And green onions.
-That's it?

426
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,853
WHIRRING

427
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,357
-Unless your BMR is 300 calories--
-It smells good.

428
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,592
-It smells good, right?
-It does.

429
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:48,762
-Let's try it. You go first.
-I'll try it.

430
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:52,766
TASTE TEST

431
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,802
-This is really good.
-It's not bad, right?

432
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,571
It tastes like meat soup.

433
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,141
SURPRISED

434
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,110
What's with that look on your face?

435
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,778
-Would you like some?
-Let me try.

436
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,013
That's pretty rank.

437
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:13,487
-It's so rank.
-Your bottom lip is trembling.

438
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:14,555
It's good.

439
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:19,826
Trust me. Try adding some MSG,
some chili powder, and ginger.

440
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,428
You need some green onions.

441
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,431
He should add ginseng, jujubes,
and green onions.

442
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,333
-Add some rice, too.
-Exactly.

443
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,636
Since you're an actor,
you must work hard to stay in shape.

444
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,605
-I run a lot.
-I see.

445
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,675
He's also got other items
to help him stay in shape.

446
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,277
He always has these in his car.

447
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,345
DUMBBELLS

448
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,981
-They're so heavy.
-Why are we even talking about this?

449
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:45,953
He's an actor who wants to work out.
What's wrong with that?

450
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,155
Aren't they too light?

451
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:49,356
-The weights?
-Yes.

452
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,291
I'm not very strong.

453
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,628
-Really?
-Yes, I don't have a lot of muscles.

454
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:58,031
My friends told me that as you age,
you lose muscle and get weaker.

455
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:01,435
They told me to work out,
so I got these dumbbells,

456
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:02,903
but I've never used them.

457
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,105
-Wait, but they look old.
-They do.

458
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,374
-They look used.
-They've been rolling in my car.

459
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:08,942
In your car?

460
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,512
If you care about mileage,
don't lug this around.

461
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,248
-It's heavy.
-I'll have to take them out.

462
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,351
I used to work out when I was younger,

463
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,654
so I can tell right away
if someone's well-built.

464
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,322
When I looked at you, I knew…

465
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,624
SOFT

466
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,527
I don't have that kind of body.

467
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,061
SURPRISED

468
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:32,266
That's why, I'm always reaching
for Jihwan's elbow during shoots.

469
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,333
It feels nice.

470
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,068
-It really does.
-Right?

471
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,136
He kept doing this.

472
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:39,139
-He just wouldn't let go of me.
-I'd squeeze him like this.

473
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:42,509
How do you work out with these dumbbells?

474
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,746
My goodness. I do a few of these.

475
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,781
I do some curls.

476
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,049
Aren't you overdoing it?

477
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,920
And some arm raises.
I can't do it anymore.

478
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,422
Are you tired already?

479
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,491
We're seeing a new side of you.

480
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,826
We've seen how you take care of your body.

481
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,496
Now let's see some items
that are related to your hobbies.

482
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:05,032
-This is unusual.
-It suits him.

483
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,934
-It's a surprising hobby.
-It's cute.

484
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,335
It's called being a "kidult."

485
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:11,805
An adult who grew up
but never let go of their inner Peter Pan.

486
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:14,041
Just look at that. It suits him.

487
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,244
PETER PAN

488
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,579
Isn't it heavy?

489
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,914
RO WOON IS JIHWAN'S FAN

490
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,049
It's light.

491
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,617
Tell us about that.

492
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,385
I love this character.

493
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,255
Every Friday night,
my son and I have a movie night.

494
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:29,923
That's so nice.

495
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,094
We watched <i>Toy Story,</i>
and my son loved the character.

496
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,963
-Buzz Lightyear?
-Yes, he loved him.

497
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,765
I told him I loved the character, too.

498
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,268
That's why I bought him this.

499
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:45,439
But after playing with it for two days,
he just shoved it in a corner.

500
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:48,542
-Just like in the movie.
-Like <i>Toy Story.</i>

501
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,777
-Isn't it nice?
-It even has a cool feature.

502
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,179
What's that?

503
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,614
That must be expensive.

504
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,649
I personally love <i>Toy Story.</i>

505
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,085
You also have something similar.

506
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,655
To be honest,
I don't know where this is from.

507
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:05,225
-But I've seen this character before.
-You haven't seen <i>Jujutsu Kaisen?</i>

508
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,828
-I know what it is.
-I can't even talk to you.

509
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:10,330
I grew up loving anime.

510
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,431
A DETACHED LOOK

511
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,667
But I can't relate to this.

512
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,436
-Where did you get it?
-I got it as a gift.

513
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,108
There's a producer at TBS
who's in charge of <i>Jujutsu Kaisen.</i>

514
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:24,011
He gave this to me
when I told him I was a fan.

515
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,579
Is that the main character?

516
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,781
-His name is Gojo Satoru.
-Okay.

517
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,750
You could say he's the main character.

518
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:33,086
He helps the main character,
but he's also the main character.

519
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:36,256
-What does that mean?
-You have to watch it to get it.

520
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,892
You should really watch it.

521
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,995
How is he the main character
when he helps the main character?

522
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:43,130
Just watch it.

523
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,933
-Is he the second lead?
-No, you just have to watch it.

524
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,334
At least explain it to me.

525
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:50,437
-I keep asking, but you won't tell me.
-Go watch it.

526
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:53,006
Is <i>Jujutsu Kaisen </i>your favorite anime?

527
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,641
-It's <i>Akira.</i>
-I see.

528
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,777
-Have you seen it?
-No.

529
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,279
It came out in 1988.

530
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:03,851
I've only seen <i>Slam Dunk </i>and <i>Dragon Ball.</i>

531
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,586
-Have you seen <i>Slam Dunk?</i>
-No.

532
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,589
I can't defend you on this one. Seriously.

533
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,857
SHOCKED

534
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,325
But you're so tall.

535
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,995
He's right. That's strange.
I'm short, but I've seen it.

536
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,197
I don't like basketball.

537
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:19,333
-Basketball is fun.
-What?

538
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,702
-Try it.
-But you don't play basketball.

539
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,036
Why would you think that?

540
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:26,707
-He can't play.
-I played basketball every lunch break.

541
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,842
Please convince him to watch <i>Slam Dunk.</i>

542
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,247
It starts off
as a simple basketball animation,

543
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,716
but once you get into it,
it unfolds into a story

544
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:38,519
about friendship, the past,
challenges, teamwork,

545
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,623
-and life itself.
-It captures everything about life.

546
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,691
That's why people call it a bible.

547
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,761
It shows the journey
of overcoming obstacles, building a team,

548
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:52,199
and striving for the top
despite adversity.

549
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,904
The idea of "failing is okay"
isn't just tacked on awkwardly.

550
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,407
It's woven in so beautifully
and powerfully.

551
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,509
It leaves a lasting impression.

552
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:04,711
You put that so well.

553
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,549
I'm actually really upset and annoyed.

554
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,719
I can't believe I acted with someone
who hasn't even read <i>Slam Dunk.</i>

555
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,123
-We're from different generations.
-It's absurd.

556
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,193
Is there anyone here
who hasn't seen <i>Slam Dunk?</i>

557
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,329
Regardless of your age,
raise your hand if you haven't seen it.

558
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,397
Please leave.

559
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,132
-Two directors haven't.
-I know.

560
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,800
Have you seen <i>Jujutsu Kaisen?</i>

561
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,502
-No.
-I see.

562
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:29,636
Please leave.

563
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,441
Out of all the items
we showed on our show today,

564
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:39,746
you're each going to choose one item
to be your recall item.

565
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,916
Then we'll send those to people
who really need them.

566
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,852
-Have you decided?
-From my things?

567
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,653
Yes. Do you want to give away his?

568
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,057
-No, that's not what I meant.
-Which of his would you give away?

569
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:54,294
I promise to watch <i>Slam Dunk,</i>
so I'd like you to watch <i>Jujutsu Kaisen.</i>

570
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:55,863
They talk about life, too.

571
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,032
I've had this guy on my bookshelf
for a while now.

572
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,300
Really?

573
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,369
What about you, Jihwan?

574
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,104
I'll go with the seeds.

575
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:07,941
Aren't you always giving them away?

576
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,710
No, I'll go with the seeds.

577
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:13,213
If no one applies for them,
we'll send them back to you.

578
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,183
It's hard to get seeds like these.

579
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,418
I didn't know that. Are they hard to get?

580
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:22,122
-The popular ones are always sold out.
-I see.

581
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:29,963
We really enjoyed having the two stars
of <i>The Murky Stream </i>on the show today.

582
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,832
How was it for you both?

583
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:38,071
While it was great to promote our show,
I had a great time today.

584
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:39,773
Please watch <i>The Murky Stream.</i>

585
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,677
My wife told me that acting
is the only thing I know how to do.

586
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:47,281
-And I confirmed that today.
-That's not true.

587
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:50,450
<i>The Murky Stream</i>
will be released on Disney+.

588
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:52,819
-Please…
-I was sold right away.

589
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,722
-I think it'll be good.
-We'll definitely watch it.

590
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,191
Thank you for joining us.

591
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,693
-Thank you.
-Please watch <i>The Murky Stream.</i>

592
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,628
-Please watch it.
<i>-The Murky Stream.</i>

593
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:03,497
What is this for?

594
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,132
Act your age.

595
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,868
Both of them are a bit weird.

596
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,536
I can't believe you own this.

597
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:13,907
Since I enjoy drinking,
I hung it up in my bar at home.

598
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:15,375
It's for decoration.

599
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:16,543
Where did you get it?

600
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,846
Did you take this from a gas station?

601
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,348
Skateboarding looked cool,
so I tried it out.

602
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,783
How are you using this now?

603
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,952
I currently use it as a plant stand.

604
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,186
It's so useless.

605
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:30,457
