1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,303
Hello.

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,341
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,177
Life is often compared to a game of Go,

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,413
a constant tug of war
between black and white.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,048
And this place is no different.

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,951
At the crossroads of laughter
and composure,

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,356
let's see what brilliant move
our guest will bring to the table today.

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,426
Please join me
as we quietly welcome today's guest.

9
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,563
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

10
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,180
-It's nice to meet you.
-Hello.

11
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:25,252
-We've never met before, have we?
-No.

12
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,454
Not once in my entire life.

13
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,424
-Do you know who I am?
-Of course.

14
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,659
I've seen you on various shows,

15
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,396
so I actually feel like
I know you already.

16
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,800
Great. Before we dive into the show,

17
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,370
I was wondering how I should address you.

18
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,241
Some people call you "Master,"
some say "Pro," others go with "9-Dan."

19
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,110
And since your book came out,
you're also an author.

20
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,946
Which title would you be
most comfortable with?

21
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:58,418
Any title you're comfortable with is fine.
We can just go with that.

22
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,053
May I ask your age?

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,690
-I was born in 1983.
-Why don't I call you "Older Brother"?

24
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,960
I was born in 1988,
so there's a five-year age gap.

25
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,299
You don't seem to like that.

26
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:16,436
-Does anyone call you "Mr. Lee"?
-"Mr. Lee"?

27
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,308
I guess that's not appropriate either.

28
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:26,380
-I will just address you as "Lee Sedol."
-Okay.

29
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,450
This might be a bit new to you,
so let me quickly go over the rules.

30
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:34,087
It's actually quite simple.
You're not supposed to laugh.

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,524
If you do laugh, you'll be sent
to the Quiet Room behind me,

32
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:42,529
where you'll spend
five long, lonely minutes.

33
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,897
Should I try laughing?

34
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,736
You might be wondering
how we decide what counts as a laugh.

35
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,106
The cameras you see in front of us
are not just ordinary cameras.

36
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,510
They're cutting-edge AI cameras
that use deep learning

37
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,279
to read every facial expression
down to the nanosecond.

38
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,183
That means if you so much as
crack a tiny smile,

39
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,719
you'll hear a warning sound.

40
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,690
But when it's absolutely undeniable

41
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,827
and there's no doubt
that you've burst out laughing…

42
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,738
-You'll hear that.
-Okay.

43
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,242
This cutting-edge system
analyzes your emotions and expressions

44
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,410
with pinpoint accuracy.

45
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:36,183
There's hardly any field
untouched by AI these days.

46
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,455
We truly live in the age of AI,
and our show is no exception.

47
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:45,325
We also have a crew
that's armed with cutting-edge AI tools.

48
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,660
Giung No. 1.

49
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:53,467
Greetings. I am Giung No. 1,
a member of the cutting-edge AI crew.

50
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,203
It is nice to meet you.

51
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,337
Nice to meet you.

52
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:02,476
I have prepared a fascinating
science experiment for you today.

53
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,412
I have a bottle of carbonated C*ke.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,281
It's C*ke.

55
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,716
When I drop a few M*ntos inside--

56
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,153
It's going to explode.
You're putting way too many.

57
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,355
Please stop.

58
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,456
It explodes.

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,927
Why isn't it exploding?

60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,497
Crap, I brought B*attles instead.

61
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,302
No wonder they were so small.

62
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,404
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

63
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,209
Don't you have something else prepared?

64
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,978
Yes, I'll show you Greg from <i>Superstar K</i>

65
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,915
giving Lee Sedol
a ride on the back of his motorcycle

66
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,585
while singing <i>I Miss You.</i>

67
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,721
That seems highly unlikely.
Lee Sedol and Greg--

68
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,324
<i>Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi</i>

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,391
<i>Mi, mi, mi, mi</i>

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:56,263
<i>The memories of loving you like crazy</i>

71
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,365
<i>Those memories</i>

72
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:03,704
<i>Are searching for you</i>

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,341
<i>But I can no longer keep you captive</i>

74
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:12,613
<i>In the name of love anymore</i>

75
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,287
I've never seen that before.

76
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:24,391
That was a performance
I never expected to see.

77
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:29,630
Of course, when we talk about Lee Sedol,
we can't leave out AlphaGo.

78
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,899
Since it's been nearly a decade,

79
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:38,205
many of today's younger generation
might not be familiar with you.

80
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:43,343
Is there anyone here today
who doesn't know who Lee Sedol is?

81
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,881
The baby over there.

82
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,950
Do you know who Lee Sedol is?

83
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,960
He doesn't know who you are.

84
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,828
He's probably too young,

85
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:07,100
but I've been told that
he is quite the prodigy.

86
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,735
How old is he?

87
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,438
Two weeks old.

88
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,173
That's incredible.

89
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,109
I also heard you can speak Japanese.

90
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,380
Tanjiro Kamado.

91
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,082
Akaza.

92
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,951
From <i>Demon Slayer.</i>

93
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,653
-Right.
-To be honest,

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,825
babies like him, who can't even talk yet,
may not know how great you are.

95
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,162
So, we put together a quick visual
to introduce who you are.

96
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,364
I'm proud to introduce
a member of our crew,

97
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,267
equipped with a high-speed
motion control system.

98
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:44,071
Lightning No. 1.
Please bring me the poster.

99
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:54,481
She's known for her incredible speed…

100
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,787
and she's going to grab the poster for us.

101
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,430
This might take a while,
so let's use the monitor for now.

102
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,371
Please put it in the middle.

103
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,240
To really understand
how great Lee Sedol is,

104
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:24,111
let's start from the beginning.

105
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,412
First…

106
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,547
ENIAC

107
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,182
…there was ENIAC.

108
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,919
Developed in 1946, it was the world's
first general-purpose computer.

109
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,687
Then came something better.

110
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,022
-Deep Blue…
-Yes.

111
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,524
…the chess AI program developed by IBM.

112
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,861
It was the first computer
to defeat the world chess champion.

113
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,030
What was better than that was…

114
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,331
ALPHAGO

115
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,399
…AlphaGo.

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,468
Go has 10 to the power of 50
more possible moves than chess,

117
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,604
but this AI beat a professional player
at Go.

118
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:54,508
Its overall record was
73 wins and 1 loss out of 74 matches.

119
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,076
That's an astonishing record.

120
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,046
The one who dealt that single loss was…

121
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,381
Lee Sedol.

122
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,984
With 18 world championships
and the 2nd most titles,

123
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:08,088
he's become a symbol of hope against AI.
Lee Sedol!

124
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,456
Thank you.

125
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,395
But he was defeated by…

126
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,930
KIM HARIN

127
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,365
…Kim Harin.

128
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,368
Justin Min, Tinno,

129
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,239
Kyuhyun, Kang Jiyeong, Son Eunyu, 7high,
Choi Hyunjoon, Yoon Sohui, Jeong Hyungyu.

130
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,976
The final winner of <i>The Devil's Plan</i>
was Jeong Hyungyu.

131
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,279
But do you think
the greatest human out there…

132
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,947
JEONG HYUNGYU

133
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,282
…is Jeong Hyungyu?

134
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,851
We don't think so.

135
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,920
He was nominated for Best New Entertainer

136
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,456
at the 4th Blue Dragon Series Awards.

137
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,927
But unfortunately,
he wasn't able to take home the award.

138
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:51,398
The one who took home the award
was none other than…

139
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,400
MOON SANGHOON

140
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,701
…Moon Sanghoon.

141
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:58,839
Then is Moon Sanghoon
the greatest human out there?

142
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:02,743
We'll have him answer that question.

143
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,679
-I see.
<i>-I'm the greatest human?</i>

144
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,914
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

145
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,550
<i>Compared to Byungjae,</i>
<i>I still have a long way to go.</i>

146
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,886
<i>I'm still far behind him.</i>

147
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,857
<i>No matter how hard I try,</i>
<i>he'll always be ahead of me.</i>

148
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,560
<i>I'll always look up to Byungjae.</i>

149
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,531
Then are you the greatest…

150
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:31,338
Unfortunately, I will always be
one step ahead of Moon Sanghoon.

151
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,841
Let's review our findings.

152
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,510
YOO BYUNGJAE, MOON SANGHOON,
JEONG HYUNGYU, YOON SOHUI

153
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,711
Byungjae, Moon Sanghoon,

154
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,547
Jeong Hyungyu, Yoon Sohui,
Choi Hyunjoon, 7high, Son Eunyu,

155
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,917
Kang Jiyeong, Kyuhyun, Tinno,
Justin Min, Kim Harin, Lee Sedol.

156
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,853
Your position is…

157
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,957
right around here.

158
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,126
We went ahead and ranked
who the greatest humans are.

159
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,329
Do you agree with our findings?

160
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,401
Let's go ahead and move on.

161
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:06,640
You've said many memorable things
that have become iconic quotes.

162
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,776
So we made a list of…

163
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:18,352
That part is over.
Can you bring the one with his quotes?

164
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,287
We're done with that part.

165
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,923
I mean, since she's here…

166
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,959
I'll continue using the monitor.

167
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:30,130
You've said many memorable quotes,
so we tried ranking them.

168
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,367
"When I see a move, I play it."

169
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,935
Did you really say this?

170
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,305
Yes, I said that about 20 years ago.

171
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:43,210
I think I was simply sharing
my honest thoughts

172
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:48,215
about Go in a very casual way.

173
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,921
This might be the one that people
have quoted and parodied the most.

174
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,090
As an author, I have to say,
it's very well-phrased.

175
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:01,061
The word "confidence"
isn't usually paired with "losing."

176
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,665
You said, "I'm not confident I'll lose."
Do you remember when you said this?

177
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,801
I was playing against Wang Xi,
so I think it was 2004.

178
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,938
-So about 21 years ago.
-Yes.

179
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,407
I had won the first game of the finals,

180
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,743
and someone asked
if it would be over tomorrow.

181
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,980
They asked me that
because it was a best-of-three match.

182
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,648
So I said, "I'm not confident."

183
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:23,884
They asked why I thought that.

184
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,753
-"Why aren't you confident?"
-"I'm not confident I'll lose."

185
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,022
You said it in a joking way.

186
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,126
It was a joke, but at the same time,
I wanted to show how confident I was.

187
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,863
That's great. Let's see the next one.

188
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,098
"IT WASN'T MANKIND THAT WON. IT WAS ME."

189
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,934
"Mankind didn't win, I did."
When you beat AlphaGo--

190
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:45,138
I didn't say that,
but people always ask me about this quote.

191
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,076
And it always comes up during interviews.

192
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,246
I hear it so often that
sometimes I wonder if I did say it.

193
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,315
You actually said this
when you lost to AlphaGo.

194
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,684
"It wasn't mankind that lost. It was me."

195
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,587
-But people took it out of context.
-That's right.

196
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,189
Let's look at the next quote.

197
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,826
"THIS BASTARD'S SHIT AT PLAYING GO."

198
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,195
What?

199
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:09,863
Did you…

200
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,368
Usually, in games like League of Legends,

201
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:19,673
it's something you say as a compliment
to someone who's really good.

202
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,976
-Yes, it could be a compliment.
-Right.

203
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,547
But I don't think
I would've said something like that.

204
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,182
You keep…

205
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,386
Regardless of my true feelings.

206
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:38,425
You know how players use trash talk
to throw off their opponents?

207
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,327
Is there something like that in Go?

208
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,663
Yes, it's called
"crushing someone's spirit."

209
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,767
-"Crush their spirit"?
-Yes, you say things like, "You lost."

210
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,670
Does the opponent get affected by that?

211
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,173
-It does affect them.
-So it's effective.

212
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,808
If you tell them that they lost,

213
00:12:54,875 --> 00:13:00,814
they can't help but question
if they can turn the game around.

214
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,449
All right.

215
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,086
"Is there a hammer or a club here?"

216
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,022
I wanted to ask if you really said this.

217
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,426
You supposedly said this
because you wanted to smash AlphaGo.

218
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,296
That's what I really felt like doing.

219
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,232
You felt that way during the match.

220
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,502
To be honest, I was quite frustrated.

221
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,338
I don't think I said that,

222
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,875
but I certainly felt
that level of frustration.

223
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:33,013
Now that we're done with the quotes,
could someone take this monitor away?

224
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,257
Lightning No. 1

225
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,060
We're done with the quotes,
so please return to your seat.

226
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:58,138
-Do they actually know how to play Go?
-Yes, they do.

227
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:02,276
-They know how to play Go.
-Okay.

228
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,679
Could you take a look
and tell us how the game is going?

229
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,950
White versus black.

230
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,654
You lost.

231
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,324
-Yeah, you lost, so hurry up.
-Who lost?

232
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,392
Did white lose?

233
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,893
-Someone lost.
-Someone.

234
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,930
-He can't tell you who.
-It would be coaching.

235
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,998
-Look at the board.
-Let's go back.

236
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,604
I heard you're a heavy smoker.
Do you still smoke?

237
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,006
-Yes.
-What do you smoke?

238
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,042
I smoke D*nhill L*ghts.

239
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,677
Do you smoke?

240
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:41,515
-I vape.
-I see. You betrayed us.

241
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,351
What do you mean?

242
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,189
Everyone's vaping now.
No one smokes cigarettes anymore.

243
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,291
May I ask when you started smoking?

244
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,461
-Okay, got it.
-Yes.

245
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,931
-I'm not trying to promote smoking.
-Of course not.

246
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:01,134
Smoking is bad for your health.
That's what I…

247
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,003
Smoke break.

248
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,341
Smoke break.

249
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,408
Smoke break?

250
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,878
He's two weeks old.

251
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,881
-Absolutely not.
-No.

252
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:19,253
We mentioned it briefly at the start,
but are you a board game developer now?

253
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:24,091
-Developer, designer. It's all the same.
-I heard you're active in that field.

254
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,027
-What board games would you recommend?
-I like Acquire.

255
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,462
I've heard of this one.

256
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,098
I don't know much about it,
but I've heard of it.

257
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:35,335
It's a game about stocks.
It's one of my favorite games.

258
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,470
I see.

259
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:39,139
My favorite game is B*skin-R*bbins.
Do you know it?

260
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,541
-B*skin-R*bbins?
-Yes.

261
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:45,179
If you're up for it,
would you play the game with us?

262
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,347
-Sure.
-Let's all shout it together.

263
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,684
-B*skin-R*bbins 31!
-B*skin-R*bbins 31!

264
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,119
1, 2, 3.

265
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,555
-4, 5, 6.
-7, 8, 9.

266
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,590
10, 11, 12.

267
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,025
13, 14, 15.

268
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,660
16, 17, 18.

269
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,396
19, 20, 21.

270
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,734
I think we're at 24.

271
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,503
25, 26, 27.

272
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,171
28, 29, 30.

273
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:17,845
He hasn't gone yet.

274
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,081
It wasn't my turn?

275
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,552
We're going around in a circle.

276
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,688
But we could also go this way.

277
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,690
But he hasn't gone yet.

278
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:33,360
-I guess if we're going that way--
-This could get confusing.

279
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,896
-Let's just play a new game.
-Okay.

280
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,431
I created this game.

281
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,701
I made a game based on
the 12 months of the year.

282
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,102
This is how it starts.

283
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,771
Regular month, leap month,
regular month, leap month.

284
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,342
Then, when someone says a month,
we'll count the number of days it has.

285
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,810
Let's give it a go.

286
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:53,013
Regular month, leap month,
regular month, leap month!

287
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,182
August! 1, 2, 3.

288
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,719
-4, 5, 6.
-7, 8, 9.

289
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,288
10, 11, 12.

290
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,790
13, 14, 15.

291
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,692
16, 17, 18.

292
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,929
19, 20, 21.

293
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,268
-We're at 24.
-25, 26, 27.

294
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,537
28, 29, 30.

295
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:20,941
September 1.

296
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:27,681
There are 31 days in August.

297
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,149
July, August.

298
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,152
Right, August. Wait, what?

299
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,956
January, February, March,
April, May, June, July, August.

300
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,526
August has 31 days!

301
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:42,462
January, February, March,
April, May, June, July, August.

302
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,934
You're supposed to use your knuckles.

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,238
It's January, February, March,
April, May, June, July, August.

304
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,007
-March, April, May, June, July, August.
-See?

305
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,510
Byungjae, August has 31 days.

306
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,578
What the heck?

307
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,850
We won!

308
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,019
We beat Lee Sedol!

309
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,223
We beat the guy
who became a symbol of hope against AI!

310
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,958
There are 31 days.

311
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,426
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

312
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,962
December doesn't end on the 30th.

313
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,532
You have to count the last knuckle twice
before going back, right?

314
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,733
You're right.

315
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,134
I almost fell for that.

316
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,638
I heard you recently
started using Inst*gram?

317
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:25,706
Yes.

318
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,942
We were a bit surprised
because we saw that

319
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:32,546
you don't follow OH MY GIRL,
but you follow STAYC.

320
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,015
I don't follow OH MY GIRL?

321
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:36,917
Let me check right now.

322
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,820
I don't really keep up with that.

323
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,090
You don't follow OH MY GIRL.

324
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,226
So we thought you had a change of heart,

325
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,996
especially since you're a big fan
of OH MY GIRL.

326
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:54,935
I actually met YooA just a few months ago.

327
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:57,271
It just never occurred to me
to follow them.

328
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:01,275
I see that you're not following me either.

329
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,677
-I just followed you.
-I see.

330
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:04,811
Could you…

331
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:08,682
I promise I will.

332
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,086
-Do you have your phone?
-I do.

333
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,057
Really? Then you could do it now?
Could you follow me?

334
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,760
I don't have Inst*gram on my phone.

335
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,827
What?

336
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:23,830
-I only use it on my computer.
-What?

337
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,670
I just saw you upload a Story.

338
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:30,737
That was on…

339
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,507
Your computer?

340
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:37,744
I use my computer or I ask other people.

341
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,181
I have people who upload things for me.

342
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,752
Do you really promise to follow me?

343
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,354
-Of course.
-Okay.

344
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,122
Can you add it to your highlights?

345
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,925
"Mutuals with Byungjae"
and add today's date?

346
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:57,064
-I'll think about it.
-Okay, you need to think about it.

347
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,198
Got it.

348
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,935
-It's not on your phone?
-No.

349
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,971
Can I take a look at your wallpaper?

350
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,038
My wallpaper?

351
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,642
Here it is.

352
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,011
I see. Wait.

353
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,747
You have Inst*gram.

354
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,483
Do I have Inst*gram?

355
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,454
-You have it right there.
-I see.

356
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,861
All right.

357
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,231
Up next is our promo segment.

358
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,734
We'll be promoting things
on behalf of our guest.

359
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,571
-I heard you published a new book.
-Yes, that's right.

360
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:42,009
Even as we film this,
it's already selling incredibly well.

361
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,445
We even bought copies in advance.
Please bring it over, Lightning No. 1.

362
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,014
Does it have to be her?

363
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,616
-She wanted--
-Is there a No. 2?

364
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:56,890
She wanted to do it.

365
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,359
-Since it's something she enjoys doing…
-I see.

366
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,295
…she asked if she could handle it.

367
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:06,233
There's a line in chapter two that says,
"Concentration also requires strategy."

368
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,569
Byungjae, we have to do a quick mic check.

369
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,870
-Okay.
-Excuse us.

370
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,672
We're almost done.

371
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,474
-It should take another 30 or 40 minutes.
-No worries.

372
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,845
One, two, three. Hello. One, two, three.

373
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:18,912
Thank you.

374
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,781
Let's keep going.

375
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:26,086
There's a line in chapter two that says,
"Concentration also requires strategy."

376
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,021
Do you remember what this was about?

377
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,591
Concentration is a finite resource.

378
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,162
This is true when playing Go
and even when studying.

379
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:39,466
I think it's important
to manage and use it wisely.

380
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,668
In line with what you just said,

381
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:46,406
we've prepared an observation challenge
to test your concentration skills.

382
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:50,177
The crew member who was just on stage
will come back out again.

383
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:54,348
If you observed him
with a high level of concentration,

384
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:59,186
you should be able to notice
one very subtle change.

385
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,889
-Let's see--
-I wasn't paying attention.

386
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,558
We're very excited about this

387
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,128
-since you possess concentration skills.
-Okay.

388
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,564
All right. Please come out.

389
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,169
Ten.

390
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,138
Nine. Eight.

391
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:19,806
Seven.

392
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:23,277
-Six. Five.
-Are you sure something's changed?

393
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,680
Four. Three.

394
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:27,814
His underwear.

395
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:29,416
Is that correct?

396
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:32,152
-That is correct.
-That is correct!

397
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:39,960
Earlier, he was wearing gray boxer briefs,

398
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:43,530
but now he's changed into these boxers.

399
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:45,966
-Okay, you can go back.
-Thank you.

400
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:50,804
As expected, you have once again proven

401
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,240
your incredible eye for detail.

402
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,109
We've reached the final part of our show.

403
00:22:56,176 --> 00:23:00,614
We'll now take some time
to talk to the audience.

404
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,918
Sorry, we're done with the book.

405
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,187
Please return to your seat,
Lightning No. 1.

406
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:08,889
But…

407
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:19,399
If anyone has something to say
to Lee Sedol,

408
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,969
please feel free to speak up.

409
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:25,172
-Is there anyone?
-I have a question for him.

410
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,373
Very well.

411
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,843
I recently entered
an amateur Go tournament,

412
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,213
but was eliminated in the final round.

413
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,349
I've replayed the game over and over,

414
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,886
but I still can't figure out
what move I should've made.

415
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:42,789
So if you don't mind,
could you take a look at the game record

416
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,359
and tell me
what the best move would've been?

417
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,426
The game record?

418
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:50,264
-Would that be okay with you?
-Of course.

419
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,232
-Please come up here.
-Thank you.

420
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,834
Where's the game record?

421
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:58,071
It's a great honor
to get advice directly from Lee Sedol.

422
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,474
-Please come to the center.
-Okay.

423
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,976
If you show it to him,
he'll give you some tips.

424
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:09,550
-Please show him the game record.
-Okay, one second.

425
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:14,188
I painted it on my body
so I wouldn't forget.

426
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,469
Please take a look.

427
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,607
How does it look?

428
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,079
It's a hopeless situation,
a really tough one to deal with.

429
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:42,149
I kept thinking about it,
but I couldn't figure it out.

430
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:46,053
-There's a fold over here.
-Right.

431
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,288
There's a stone here.

432
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,926
I don't know Go very well,
but isn't this where…

433
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:58,398
-You're playing as black here, right?
-Right.

434
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,467
Then from that perspective…

435
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,106
Is this show R-rated?

436
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,075
This seems like an R-rated problem.

437
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:12,212
I almost went to the Quiet Room just now.

438
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,049
This stone is just one move away
from being captured.

439
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:19,119
There are one, two, three, four liberties.

440
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:20,954
If white plays here, it's captured.

441
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,290
-It's surrounded.
-All four liberties are blocked.

442
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,559
-So you need to connect over here.
-Okay.

443
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,261
Is it already connected?

444
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:32,199
This is just…
I think he's just pale over here.

445
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:33,300
I see.

446
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,003
-It's not easy for white either.
-It's not?

447
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,572
-Even for white…
-That spot isn't…

448
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:42,276
It's not a good spot for black,
but it's not good for white either.

449
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:44,778
You're saying it's not
an advantageous situation.

450
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:50,484
-So, this is the best possible move.
-Yes, that's right.

451
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,952
-Let me mark it.
-Okay.

452
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,494
-That's excellent.
-Great. I hope that helped.

453
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,431
I've practically taught you

454
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:07,968
the rules of Go just now.

455
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,238
Now you know that if you're surrounded,

456
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,407
you're busted.

457
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,979
Sorry, that may have been inappropriate.

458
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:22,749
You're busted if you're surrounded.

459
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:25,853
-Thank you for being so brave, Jinyeong.
-Thank you.

460
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,155
-Please return to your seat.
-Okay.

461
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,891
Thank you.

462
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,428
-Here?
-That's right.

463
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,029
Mama.

464
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,399
His passion for Go is so strong
that he painted it on his body.

465
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,436
We spent some time with Lee Sedol
on The Quiet Interview,

466
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:44,605
where you're not allowed to laugh.

467
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,140
I'd like to ask for your thoughts today.

468
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,011
The show itself feels very original.

469
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,446
Everyone here…

470
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:56,216
I don't know where Lightning No. 2 is,
but No. 1 worked so hard today.

471
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,052
-The first guy--
-Giung No. 1.

472
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,855
And even those two…
I don't know what they're doing.

473
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:03,423
But does that even come off?

474
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,428
As far as I know,
it's not going to come off that easily.

475
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:14,835
He needs to burn it off
with acetone and formaldehyde

476
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,403
since it's oil-based.

477
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,006
-He needs to burn it off?
-He's very passionate.

478
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:22,209
It wouldn't hurt to burn it off a bit.

479
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,111
Don't you think so?

480
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:26,280
-What do you mean?
-His body…

481
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,950
-If he could burn off the fat--
-Barbecue.

482
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,451
Is that what you want?

483
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,155
But he's a person.

484
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,992
-Right, sorry about that.
-Barbecue.

485
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:44,164
For those who haven't read
your latest book yet,

486
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,300
could you say a few words to them?

487
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:50,304
I feel like there were many parts
that were lacking,

488
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,943
but it's still a book
that I wrote with great sincerity.

489
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,077
So I hope…

490
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,513
Please check it out.

491
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,648
-Thank you.
-Please go read it.

492
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:02,716
Thank you.

493
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:08,155
All right, that concludes
The Quiet Interview with Lee Sedol.

494
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:09,289
Thank you.

495
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,926
Thanks for all your hard work today.

496
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,069
THE QUIET INTERVIEW

497
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:26,874
HOST: YOO BYUNGJAE

498
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,847
GUEST: LEE SEDOL
