1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:02,646
It's a German trash can.

2
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:04,080
That's so pretentious.

3
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:06,616
It can crush plastic bottles.

4
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:08,885
If I do this…

5
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:09,953
What the heck?

6
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:12,322
FLUSTERED

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,160
Apparently, a tribal chief
in Côte d'Ivoire used this stool.

8
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,763
-I bought it in Seongsu-dong.
-How did it get there?

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:20,897
I paid 400,000 won.

10
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,966
Really? That's a steal.

11
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,308
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

12
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:34,578
-You can look forward to our guests today.
-Right.

13
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:40,050
In the past, we've had couples, friends,
and all kinds of guests on the show.

14
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,919
And at times, there were staged banters,

15
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:45,755
scripted conflicts,
and exaggerated performances.

16
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:48,458
But today's guests are a little different.

17
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:53,930
They throw shade and roast each other
like they're in a UFC fight.

18
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:58,268
You know how guys like to show off,
claiming they make more money?

19
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:02,205
-"I make more money."
-"I'm more successful since I earn more."

20
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:06,943
But these two kept pointing at each other
as the big earner and spender.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,348
They also criticized
each other's spending habits.

22
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,217
Well, let's bring out our guests.
Please come out.

23
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,554
It's great to have you, Joonbin.

24
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:20,223
-And here's Kid Milli.
-Kid Milli!

25
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,893
-Hello, I'm Kid Milli.
-Welcome, Kid Milli.

26
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,960
KID MILLI

27
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:27,097
-Is this our first time meeting?
-Yes, it is.

28
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:31,401
I only knew you through your music,
but you seem really cool in person.

29
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:32,669
We're friends on social.

30
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:36,907
-We are!
-What's with that reaction?

31
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,008
I'm a little hurt.

32
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:41,244
It took me a second
to understand what you meant.

33
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,079
Joonbin, why don't you say hello?

34
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,248
Hi, I'm Kwak Joonbin,
a travel content creator.

35
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,349
Welcome.

36
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,417
KWAK JOONBIN

37
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,219
You're on so many shows now,

38
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:51,588
yet you still go by
"travel content creator."

39
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:56,126
-Yes, that's my original job.
-You're staying true to your roots.

40
00:01:56,192 --> 00:02:01,097
Since I'm on so many shows these days,
people wonder if I still travel.

41
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,400
That's why I always emphasize my job.

42
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,402
As we mentioned in the opening,

43
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:10,941
you two really roasted
each other's spending habits.

44
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,477
So could you tell us
about your spending habits?

45
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:18,081
-I'm a maximalist.
-You're admitting it upfront.

46
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:21,685
People think travel content creators
always travel cheap,

47
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,420
so people tell me I've changed.

48
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:27,190
But I've never traveled on a tight budget.
They're confusing me with Pani Bottle.

49
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:30,894
He plans his trips carefully
and travels on a budget.

50
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,532
He's very frugal,
while I've always been a big spender.

51
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,302
But I try to keep my purchases
under a million won.

52
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:41,338
-So that's your rule of thumb.
-Yes.

53
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:43,039
You're not a full-on maximalist.

54
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:44,608
What about you?

55
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:48,645
I used to be like him,
but had no rule of thumb.

56
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:52,315
I'd blow over a million won
just like that.

57
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:56,953
But these days,
I'm starting to plan for my future.

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,924
I'm into investing now,
so I've been saving and cutting back.

59
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:06,429
You mentioned investing for the future.
What exactly do you mean by that?

60
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,565
I don't know who I'll end up with,

61
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:13,536
-but I've always wanted to get married.
-I see.

62
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:17,073
So you're saving up
to buy things like a house.

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,175
-The stuff he already has.
-Hold on.

64
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,243
A SUDDEN BLOW

65
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,813
-What do you have?
-He has a fiancée and a house.

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,815
You made your relationship public.

67
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:31,054
I did. I'll probably be married
by the time this is released.

68
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,089
Why are you suddenly acting shy?

69
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,625
-He's just shy.
-I am.

70
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,694
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

71
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,429
CONGRATULATIONS

72
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:44,768
On our show,
we each take sides to defend our guests.

73
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:49,072
I like Kid Milli,
but I don't know what it is with Joonbin.

74
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,242
I can't explain it in words,

75
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:58,181
but I feel like I can step into his shoes
and really speak for him.

76
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:03,753
I know what you mean.
I can relate to Kid Milli's items,

77
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,557
but when I saw Joonbin's items,
I thought they were Byungjae's.

78
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:12,562
Okay, I'll defend Joonbin,
and Ryugyu will defend Kid Milli.

79
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,731
-Why don't you start first?
-Okay.

80
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:18,535
These are what I'd call
the ultimate splurges.

81
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:19,603
FIGURE COLLECTION

82
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:25,308
When someone suddenly makes it big,
they always have a bunch of these at home.

83
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,711
Like a Gen Z gangster.

84
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:30,313
EXTREMELY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

85
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,782
This is probably the cheapest one.

86
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:34,951
I got it
when I first started making money.

87
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:37,821
I looked it up on Kr**m
and got a good deal for it.

88
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:41,258
This one's expensive.
This costs over 300,000 won.

89
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,794
I bought it because I got excited
when I started making money.

90
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,263
I'm sorry about that.

91
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,499
Don't apologize.
You didn't scam anyone to make that money.

92
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,937
I was thrilled at how much I was making,
so I thought I'd collect figures.

93
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:58,208
But I got sick of them pretty quickly,
so those were the last ones I bought.

94
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,809
Those are expensive, right?

95
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:04,214
Those were the last figures I bought,
and they cost me 1.2 million won.

96
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,882
You ignored your rule of thumb.

97
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:08,985
I travel the world, so I had to buy it.
It's holding a globe.

98
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:11,888
But you did ignore your…
Oh, right. I'm on your side.

99
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:12,956
HE ALMOST SLIPPED UP

100
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,258
-Do you not like me?
-No, it's not that.

101
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:18,128
Do you check for new items
on Kr**m all the time?

102
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:20,997
I do. I recently bought
a Lab*b* blind box on Kr**m.

103
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:24,601
-So typical of the newly rich.
-I try to buy it if it's trendy.

104
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:26,703
As I said earlier, I can speak for him.

105
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,440
I also go on Kr**m every day
to see if I missed anything.

106
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:34,444
It's basically a catalog,
so if I see anything I like, I buy it.

107
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,979
I totally understand him.

108
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,448
So instead of digging,
you just follow trends.

109
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,418
-What's "digging"?
-Like looking for things.

110
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,821
So finding cool items is called "digging,"

111
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,924
and we're just harvesting
what's already out there.

112
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:51,027
-We dig for things on Kr**m, too.
-You're right.

113
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:54,097
We have to choose among the popular items.

114
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:56,333
I actually buy things
that are less popular.

115
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,468
-So it's not obvious?
-He prefers rare items.

116
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,136
I don't want it to be too obvious.

117
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:02,472
Can you guys tell us
how much you've spent?

118
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,241
Let me check my purchase history.

119
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:07,143
I haven't bought that much.
I have 97 purchases.

120
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,379
-That's a lot.
-He has 97 purchases.

121
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,581
But I've been using Kr**m for years.

122
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,383
It's not a food delivery app.

123
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,718
I have 292 purchases.

124
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,386
-He has 292 purchases?
-See?

125
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,857
-What's your most recent purchase?
-Lab*b* and K*p*tal.

126
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,392
Do you like K*p*tal?

127
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,861
This is hilarious. They're so similar.

128
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:28,331
I bought S*preme underwear
and a body balm from D*ptyque.

129
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:29,733
I bought those too.

130
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,801
Why do you buy D*ptyque from Kr**m?

131
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:34,905
They don't sell the body balm I use
on other sites.

132
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,873
You can just buy it at the store.

133
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,111
You're a travel influencer.
You can buy K*p*tal when you go to Japan.

134
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:47,183
It's hard to find things at the store
because resellers pick it up first.

135
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,718
Do they hide things from you?

136
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,025
You can make fun of the items,
but don't make fun of him.

137
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:56,560
This is only the first round.

138
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,828
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-You didn't.

139
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,430
He just bought these items.

140
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,800
You talked about
splurging on things earlier.

141
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:07,938
-Can you splurge on a frying pan?
-That's not a frying pan.

142
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,407
This next item is rumored to be

143
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,443
the most expensive item
in the history of our show.

144
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,214
It's a huge carpet.
Can you tell us why you bought this?

145
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,218
It cost several million won.
It was around four to five million won.

146
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:23,386
THEIR JAWS DROP

147
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:26,656
-This carpet was custom-made.
-It's not store-bought?

148
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:30,193
I couldn't find a store
that sold a carpet this size.

149
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,797
It's about 32 feet long.
That's how big it is.

150
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:37,901
I got this carpet
to cover the entire living room.

151
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:42,038
I wanted brick-colored floors,

152
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:47,277
but since I was renting my house,
I couldn't redo the flooring.

153
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:51,114
That's why I had it made,
but it's useless now that I've moved.

154
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,783
-This is really nice.
-You seem to want it.

155
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,586
-Do I need to criticize it?
-No, it's okay to like it.

156
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,456
It's nice. It's really nice.

157
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,224
What about that light fixture?

158
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,659
This light fixture…

159
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:05,862
-Is this the whole thing?
-It is. It's a wall mount.

160
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,864
The same one's hanging up there.

161
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:11,201
-You're right!
-We have good taste.

162
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,503
You can't buy this on Kr**m.

163
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,573
Then where did you get it?
We only shop on Kr**m.

164
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,807
Where can you buy this?

165
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,277
You could stick a light bulb
on a frying pan instead.

166
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,445
You can get one
in Cheonggyecheon for 120,000.

167
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:25,849
-That's a lot.
-You could get it for 100,000 won.

168
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,119
You guys buy stuff from Kr**m.
You wouldn't go to Cheonggyecheon.

169
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:32,722
Do you still use
this carpet and light fixture?

170
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,492
No, I don't. That's the problem.

171
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,363
Joonbin has been eyeing this carpet.

172
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,132
My fortune lacks the fire element,

173
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,936
so they say it's good for me
to own brick-colored items.

174
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:50,740
Is fire the only element you're lacking?
What else are you lacking?

175
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,309
-Aren't you on my side?
-I am.

176
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,178
I lack the water element.

177
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,748
If you're okay with it,
you could sell it to Joonbin.

178
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:00,450
Why don't you make an offer?

179
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:02,886
Make an offer? I thought we were friends.

180
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:05,222
That's why we need to be more careful.

181
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:07,791
If you need something,
I'll give it to you.

182
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:11,428
-I'm open to a trade.
-I'll give you two B**rbr*cks.

183
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:14,931
-Come on. You're getting on my nerves.
-Give him three.

184
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:17,567
-Pikachu is hard to find.
-Why are you so stingy?

185
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,202
P*k*mon has a new release soon.

186
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,539
I don't think I've ever seen this before.

187
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,474
Only really rich people buy this.

188
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,709
ARTWORK BOUGHT ONLINE

189
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,911
It's artwork.

190
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:32,682
I think this is a great hobby,
but I do see some stains here.

191
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,618
How is this a hobby?

192
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,587
-How do you store it?
-I just roll it up.

193
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:39,122
FRUSTRATED

194
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:40,657
Why did you buy it then?

195
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,092
I bought it two years ago.

196
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:45,762
You've had it for two years.
It's still in good condition, though.

197
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:48,832
Why didn't you hang it up
instead of tossing it in a corner?

198
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,068
I need to get it framed,
but I don't know how.

199
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,437
So now I only buy ones
that come with a frame.

200
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:58,141
I'd like to hear what he has to say
about this purchase.

201
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,911
-I bought it on Kr**m.
-Kr**m?

202
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,314
-They're stealing the spotlight today.
-Do you work for them?

203
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:08,351
Kr**m used to sell artwork for a while.

204
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,021
-Is that the artist's signature?
-Yes, it is.

205
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:14,824
-This is authentic?
-If it's on Kr**m, it's authentic.

206
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:18,028
They made 45 prints,
and this is number 30.

207
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:21,298
-It's a limited edition.
-Yes, so I bought it.

208
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:24,467
I've never seen anyone buy artwork
without seeing it in person.

209
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,803
But you bought it on Kr**m.

210
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,638
You're supposed to look at artwork.

211
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:31,608
Byungjae doesn't have this
because he missed it on Kr**m

212
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,009
when it went up.

213
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:36,046
-I took a short break from Kr**m.
-You would've bought this.

214
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:41,084
I like watching videos of celebrity homes,
and they always have artwork hanging up.

215
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:45,121
It's not just celebrity homes.
I check out other people's homes, too.

216
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:48,258
Successful people,
like the owner of L*ndon B*gel M*seum.

217
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:51,061
I've watched that five times.
The one in Hannam-dong.

218
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:55,632
And when I see those homes,
they always have artwork on the walls.

219
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,269
I bought this
hoping it would go up in value.

220
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:00,403
Great purchase.

221
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,239
-I'm investing in art.
-You are.

222
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:06,076
I like how honest he is.
Even if he collects art as a hobby,

223
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:09,145
admitting he bought it
to impress others isn't easy.

224
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:10,213
IS IT MY HOBBY?

225
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,648
You could call it a hobby.

226
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,350
This cost 800,000 won.

227
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,118
AN UNBELIEVABLE PRICE

228
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:16,253
What?

229
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,622
What a steal!

230
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,290
What the heck?

231
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:24,194
Honestly, 800,000 won is cheap
for a piece of art.

232
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,329
But let's talk about this comforter.

233
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,832
-I woke up wrapped in this today.
-It's so light.

234
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,500
It's very light.

235
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:35,272
It's good to invest in quality bedding.
You spend a third of your life in bed.

236
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:38,742
But most people
invest in pillows or mattresses.

237
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,044
A comforter just keeps you covered.

238
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,280
-Come on, now.
-You're so clueless.

239
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:45,582
A bad comforter can hurt your neck.

240
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,084
-Really?
-A comforter?

241
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,452
How can it hurt your neck?

242
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,822
A comforter that's too heavy
can leave you with a stiff neck.

243
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,357
It's just a comforter.

244
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:58,194
-It's not Goku's gi from <i>Dragon Ball.</i>
-It's not the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

245
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:01,097
-That's ridiculous.
-A 50,000-won comforter is enough.

246
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:03,767
You get better sleep
with a nice comforter over you.

247
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,402
Instead of something like this,

248
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,972
you can go to any bedding store
and they'll recommend a comforter,

249
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,508
like the pink ones our mothers use.

250
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:14,644
Those are way better,
and they don't leave marks on your face.

251
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:15,879
He's right.

252
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,415
-You just haven't tried it.
-Have you tried this?

253
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,250
Don't touch my comforter.

254
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,885
When he said that, I let go.

255
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,220
JUST NOW

256
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:26,356
-I thought he was talking to me.
-You can't get a stiff neck

257
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:28,425
if you don't have one.

258
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:30,727
BLOOD PRESSURE GAUGE: MAX

259
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:32,529
That's why you two can't relate.

260
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:35,699
I always say this,
but what do you think this is?

261
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,267
I have a neck.

262
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:38,401
That's your shoulder.

263
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,837
-This is my shoulder?
-Yes, that's right.

264
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,672
-It's my neck.
-That's his shoulder?

265
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,074
HEAD, SHOULDERS, KNEES, TOES

266
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,543
It's light, but the price isn't.
How much was it?

267
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,545
-It was two million won.
-Oh, my gosh.

268
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:52,349
But they always seem to have it on sale,
so I got it for 800,000 won.

269
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:54,251
That's the original price.

270
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:57,220
They raised the price
just to make it look like a discount.

271
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,990
You're one to talk.
You buy stuff from resellers.

272
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,725
Why are you so skeptical?

273
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,026
You might not agree,

274
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:07,597
but I think I could get a better comforter
for 300,000 won.

275
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:11,034
I disagree.
It's like wearing a quality puffer jacket.

276
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,535
It's light and fits well.

277
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:14,337
Have you ever regretted buying this?

278
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:16,273
-I've never regretted it.
-Really?

279
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,209
I strongly recommend this comforter.

280
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,844
Can you try using this?

281
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,479
Okay, where should I lie down?

282
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:25,181
-See if it's really good.
-What if I fall asleep?

283
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:26,483
He'll fall asleep.

284
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,288
Tell us honestly how it feels.

285
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:34,824
-Ryugyu!
-He can't hear you because he's sleeping.

286
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,092
Really?

287
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,061
This feels like some dated comedy bit.

288
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,396
EMBARRASSED

289
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:41,264
-That's outdated comedy.
-You knew.

290
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:44,401
-I wanted him to do it.
-You knew what I was going to do.

291
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,437
You really buy everything that's trending.

292
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:49,673
-Everyone has one these days.
-He's right.

293
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:52,642
-This is a trend?
-It's not a trend, it's a must-have.

294
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:53,843
It's a steady seller.

295
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,048
I saw this item on <i>I Live Alone.</i>

296
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:59,950
Hyunmoo gave this to Kian,

297
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:02,552
so I looked it up
and bought it right away.

298
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:08,892
You hang it on your front door
to keep out bad luck or negative energy.

299
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,126
That's right.

300
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:15,899
I just redecorated my place
and laid red tiles at the entrance.

301
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:19,269
-Because you lack the fire element?
-I wanted the energy to come in.

302
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:23,073
I also bought a 330,000-won stool.

303
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,710
It was too heavy to bring,
but it's also red.

304
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:30,013
I put it by the front door
to bring in more fire energy.

305
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,481
You own a lot of red items.

306
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,617
I don't like red, but it's for feng shui.

307
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:36,486
When did you start believing in feng shui?

308
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,655
-After I started doing well.
-Really?

309
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:40,557
Yes, I didn't before,

310
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:43,927
but after things picked up,
I figured it was due to good feng shui.

311
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:46,630
Do you believe in feng shui
or fortune-telling?

312
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,198
I've never seen this before,

313
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:52,135
and I was shocked to find out
everyone has this.

314
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:54,604
You can have this.
It'll ward off bad luck.

315
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,006
So, give me the carpet.

316
00:14:57,073 --> 00:15:00,544
We pool together small items,
so please consider giving him the carpet.

317
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,345
SCAN

318
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:04,514
-I don't want it.
-It'll ward off bad luck.

319
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,715
No, I'm okay.

320
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:09,619
The next item is very big.
Should I place it on the table?

321
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:11,688
Why am I the only one with big items?

322
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:12,923
A UNIQUE TRASH CAN

323
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:14,591
It's a German trash can.

324
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:16,192
A TRASH CAN WITH AN ORIGIN

325
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,327
That's so pretentious.

326
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:20,730
-It's sold out, so you can't even get it.
-Really?

327
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:23,667
A lot of people are looking for it
on secondhand sites.

328
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,937
You can find these at the park.

329
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,605
-Just in a different color.
-Right.

330
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:33,510
But they don't have this function.
It can crush plastic bottles.

331
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:34,678
It crushes it for you.

332
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:36,246
-At home?
-Yes.

333
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:39,549
-Let's try it. Do you lift this first?
-Yes, lift the lid.

334
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:41,785
Is it too far for you to reach?

335
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:42,852
Just press down.

336
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:44,921
If I do this…

337
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:45,989
What the heck?

338
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:47,624
What?

339
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,826
TA-DA

340
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,394
FLUSTERED

341
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,564
-Isn't this faster?
-It is.

342
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:57,567
-Do it at the same time.
-Point is, it does that.

343
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,969
-Race time.
-See who's faster.

344
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:01,271
Don't do it slowly on purpose.

345
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,406
One, two, three.

346
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:06,710
The speed might be similar.

347
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,278
TURNS AWAY

348
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:10,447
The compression isn't good, though.

349
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,716
But it has that function.
That's what counts.

350
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:15,518
-You were all surprised earlier.
-It is pretty cool.

351
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:17,921
-You liked it.
-I did. It was amusing.

352
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:21,091
I figured I'd need two,
so I bought two of these.

353
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:23,860
But it was bigger than I thought,
so I only use one.

354
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,462
It holds a lot.

355
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,264
Then give me one.

356
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,066
It's like a spaceship.
It's perfect for a travel influencer.

357
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,269
I thought you said you didn't like it.

358
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,638
Why do you want it
when you travel so much?

359
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,940
-Yes, why?
-My home is where I find comfort.

360
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,541
-But you like red.
-He does.

361
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,544
I have enough red. I need something black.

362
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,245
SPEECHLESS

363
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:45,015
But seriously,
you should give one to Joonbin.

364
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,216
As a wedding gift.

365
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,018
-Deal?
-I want something bigger.

366
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:49,953
I want the carpet.

367
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,222
THE GROOM-TO-BE IS EAGER
TO FURNISH HIS PLACE

368
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,623
The rich always want more.

369
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,326
I saw this listed as a pillow,

370
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,495
but if this is a pillow,
there's a problem.

371
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,630
-This is for the bathtub.
-What?

372
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,332
A CHEAP SPA PILLOW

373
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,400
What's this?

374
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,835
One of them fell off.

375
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,605
Since I've always had a thing for baths,

376
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:11,041
I recently moved into a place
with a bathtub.

377
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:13,677
So I bought this pillow
that you stick to the tub.

378
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,613
You can lie on it and look at your phone.

379
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,048
You're always lying down.

380
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:19,683
BATH POTATO

381
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,252
-Hey.
-Just let him be.

382
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,221
There's pus on it.

383
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,623
A DISTINCT YELLOWISH STAIN

384
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,824
That's not pus.

385
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:31,228
Believe it or not,
I use yellow bath powder.

386
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:34,631
That's not hard to believe.
Do you use the ones they sell at L*sh?

387
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:35,932
Those are too expensive.

388
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,402
-I buy a big container of bath powder.
-That's cute.

389
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:41,671
So annoying.

390
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:45,242
It was cheap,
so the quality's not that great.

391
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:47,177
-It doesn't stick well?
-It doesn't.

392
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,979
So you regret buying this.

393
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:52,415
Yes, it's supposed to stick,
but it doesn't.

394
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:54,117
Let me ask you something.

395
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:58,221
Can you give me your permission
to make a really mean joke about you?

396
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,257
I don't want to, but go ahead.

397
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:01,324
CURIOUS

398
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,061
STICKS LIKE A CHARM

399
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,797
HE'S NOT CRYING

400
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:10,867
-I'm sorry.
-You're such a joker.

401
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,103
That was mean.

402
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,771
-You're so mean.
-He is.

403
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:17,007
-You can make fun of my height.
-His height.

404
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:18,074
I'm sorry.

405
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,611
I've been collecting these
for about four years.

406
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:22,679
That's cool.

407
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,348
Do you have bad eyesight?

408
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:29,119
-No, these are non-prescription glasses.
-I see.

409
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,353
FOR FASHION ONLY

410
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,956
I collected them
without planning to wear them.

411
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:39,195
But then I started noticing
a lot of people wearing glasses.

412
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:42,165
I just kept buying them,
and now I've got a collection.

413
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,233
They're nice.

414
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,268
People tell me I look good in glasses.

415
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:46,670
-You wear them often.
-I do.

416
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:50,040
Do you have anything
that might look good on me?

417
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:52,108
-Try on the rimless ones.
-I have some.

418
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,176
Not these ones.

419
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,312
HE HESITATES

420
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,013
I don't think these will fit.

421
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,081
They will.

422
00:18:58,148 --> 00:18:59,683
AN UNEXPECTED SCENE

423
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:02,085
They're the same width as my eyes.

424
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:04,487
-Come on, it'll fit.
-I can put them on.

425
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,523
But I might have to apologize afterwards.

426
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,091
-Can I put them on?
-Of course.

427
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,361
-They look really good on you.
-They do.

428
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:14,731
-You look good in Chr*me H**rts.
-Do I really?

429
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,766
Which glasses would suit Joonbin?

430
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,969
-Try these on.
-These will look good on me.

431
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,036
KID MILLI'S CHOICE

432
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:23,506
Those look good on you. They really do.

433
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:27,477
-Can you focus on me?
-I am focusing on you.

434
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:31,715
-This…
-No, don't do that. Come on.

435
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:34,651
You said you'd only do that once.

436
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,719
YOU PROMISED

437
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:38,622
You like the backward hat
and glasses look, right?

438
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:39,689
I copied that look.

439
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,893
-What do you mean?
-The backward hat and glasses look.

440
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,361
I haven't seen you do that.

441
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:46,263
People confused me for someone else.

442
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:47,831
-Confused you with who?
-Him.

443
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:48,965
LOST FOR WORDS

444
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,433
We look alike.

445
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,435
-I've--
-We do look alike.

446
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,337
-I've heard this.
-Yes.

447
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,940
-I used to wear them like this.
-You look cute.

448
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,175
You're a good-looking guy.

449
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,911
I want to look like him.

450
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:05,015
Can you wear your hat backward?
Like how Kid Milli did.

451
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:09,386
-Hey, he looks good.
-He does.

452
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:11,221
<i>Indigo, we just go</i>

453
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,823
HELP ME

454
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,125
I'm genuinely curious.

455
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:18,762
-You've met Cha Eunwoo and Byeon Wooseok.
-Yes.

456
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,664
How do you feel when you see this?

457
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,399
When I see "this"?

458
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,768
That's so mean.

459
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,070
-He's nicer than you.
-Really?

460
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,538
LAUGHING

461
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:33,176
You know those big barbecue restaurants
where they do company dinners?

462
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:35,946
This is a good purchase. It's so cute.

463
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:37,681
This is…

464
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:42,385
A lot of celebrities, including Kid Milli,
buy vintage furniture.

465
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:43,787
I didn't know that.

466
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,022
You said they buy vintage furniture,

467
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:50,193
but just because the wood is old
doesn't make it vintage.

468
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,328
What do you mean?

469
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,597
It should be made by a designer.

470
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:56,299
-A designer from Côte d'Ivoire made it.
-Really?

471
00:20:56,366 --> 00:21:01,137
Apparently, a tribal chief
in Côte d'Ivoire used this stool.

472
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:03,740
-I bought it in Seongsu-dong.
-How did it get there?

473
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,875
They were selling it there, so I got it.

474
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,277
You bought it in Korea?

475
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:09,779
Yes, I wasn't able to go to Côte d'Ivoire.

476
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:11,014
I paid 400,000 won.

477
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,116
Really? That's a steal.

478
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:16,653
BACKPEDALING TO KEEP THE PEACE

479
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,389
-I bought this online.
-I see.

480
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,491
-Without seeing it?
-Like the artwork.

481
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:23,093
It was smaller than I thought.

482
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,696
-You thought it'd be bigger.
-It was too small to put next to the sofa,

483
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,465
so it's just sitting there.

484
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:32,068
-But I was impressed when I saw it.
-The details are intricate.

485
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,703
Details?

486
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,605
-Don't laugh.
-That's ridiculous.

487
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:39,242
I love the details on this stool.
These cracks make it look amazing.

488
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:41,511
-It has that Côte d'Ivoire feel.
-It does.

489
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:44,948
This carries the spirit
of the tribal chiefs from Côte d'Ivoire.

490
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,883
-But you got it in Seongsu-dong?
-Yes.

491
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,854
It's from Seongsu-dong.
They sell a lot of these stools there.

492
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,956
I bet they were surprised you bought it.

493
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,424
Oh, come on.

494
00:21:54,491 --> 00:22:00,196
I was hunting for diet food options,
and these are what I finally found.

495
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:03,033
These are low-calorie noodles.

496
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:06,202
It's 186 calories,
but it tastes like C*p N**dles.

497
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,705
Why are you on a diet?
You look great right now.

498
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:11,541
-For myself.
-Do you have a target weight in mind?

499
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:14,878
I want to lose about six kilograms.

500
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:16,346
You look great right now.

501
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:19,616
-Loco's very fit.
-Yeah, he is.

502
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:23,853
I got curious while I was working out,
so I asked him his height and weight.

503
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:27,057
His height minus his weight is around 110.

504
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:29,326
Is that the standard people aim for?

505
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:31,962
That's when clothes look best on you.

506
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,163
Ryugyu's around there.

507
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,733
No, not quite.
I'm 173 cm tall and weigh 66 kg.

508
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,336
-You're close to the ideal weight.
-Very close.

509
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:42,839
It's because he has a big head.
Otherwise, he'd be around 110.

510
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:45,375
-He has a big head.
-It's true.

511
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:49,079
-I started jump roping because of boxing.
-That's cool.

512
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:52,983
I used the jump ropes
they had at the boxing gym,

513
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:55,051
but they were too rigid.

514
00:22:55,118 --> 00:23:00,657
Then I saw someone at the gym using this,
and it looked nice.

515
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:02,359
But there's no rope.

516
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:04,527
There's an app that counts your jumps.

517
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:07,397
So I can just do this?

518
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:08,698
No, you have to jump.

519
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,400
How does it detect the jumps?

520
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,768
Stop trying to trick it.

521
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:13,103
ASHAMED TO BE ON HIS TEAM

522
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,772
He's clearly new to this.
He's swinging it backwards.

523
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,240
Don't swing it backwards.

524
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:18,642
So how does this work?

525
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:23,780
You're supposed to pretend there's a rope.
You have to jump.

526
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:27,050
How does it detect that?
Doesn't it count this as a jump?

527
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:30,453
-That's up to your conscience.
-I get it now.

528
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,289
You have to keep yourself in check.

529
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:35,458
-That's it.
-You can't cheat if you want to slim down.

530
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:36,826
-This is nice.
-Good job.

531
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:37,994
JOONBIN IS JUMPING ROPE

532
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:40,564
How long have you been boxing?

533
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,698
About a year.

534
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:44,334
-I see.
-Here we go again.

535
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,503
Why do you ask? Do you box?

536
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,837
When it comes to boxing,

537
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:51,107
you could say I'm an expert.

538
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:55,011
I started boxing earlier
than some of the current active champions.

539
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:56,947
-He started early.
-In middle school.

540
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,916
-You've been boxing ever since?
-I boxed for two years.

541
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,818
-Can you show us your form?
-My form?

542
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:03,453
A YEAR'S WORTH OF TRAINING

543
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,122
I see. You fight like a chicken.

544
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,892
You're throwing wide punches.

545
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,929
I can jump rope and throw punches.
I can even weave.

546
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:14,264
What do you think?

547
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:18,768
-He can even do the Dempsey Roll.
-He's really bad.

548
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:21,504
WASTED HIS MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS

549
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:25,508
We had Kid Milli and Joonbin
on our show today.

550
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:28,945
You're each going to pick one recall item,

551
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:32,682
and we're going to send that
to one of our viewers.

552
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:35,485
Which item would you like to give away?

553
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,121
-I was thinking about this earlier.
-Okay.

554
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:40,190
This item brought me good energy.

555
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:43,526
My income increased a lot
after I bought it.

556
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:44,961
I'll give away this figure.

557
00:24:45,729 --> 00:24:49,299
This figure brought me
a lot of good energy.

558
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:54,170
I hope this brings you the same energy
it brought me four years ago.

559
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:55,805
-Thank you.
-It's great.

560
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:58,108
I'll give away the light fixture.

561
00:24:58,174 --> 00:24:59,976
-Really?
-Yes.

562
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:04,214
I'm actually a viewer of this show, too.

563
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,550
Me too.

564
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:10,754
-I wanted to give away something nice.
-Thank you.

565
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,161
We had these two on our show today.

566
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:21,097
So how was it for you, Kid Milli?

567
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:24,334
It was great to be on a show
I've always enjoyed watching,

568
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:27,470
and it was fun filming
with a close friend.

569
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:29,039
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

570
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:34,477
I've been watching this show for a while,
so I'm glad I got the chance to be on it.

571
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:37,681
I've never had the chance
to show my items before,

572
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:42,752
so it was a lot of fun
showing you what I bought.

573
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:46,656
It also made me reflect on my purchases,
so thank you so much.

574
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:47,724
Thank you.

575
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,759
A BIG THANKS TO KWAK JOONBIN AND KID MILLI

576
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:52,963
-Why are you mad?
-Why?

577
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,165
I'm just mad.

578
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,167
Can I switch to a public defender?

579
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:59,636
His colleague is her brother.

580
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,105
Oh, my gosh.

581
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:03,440
This looks possessed.

582
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:06,409
When I move, I'm going to get rid of them.

583
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:09,579
Dolls like these will follow you
even if you throw them away.

584
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:10,881
These will go viral.

585
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:13,683
I wanted to be an influencer
who could have that kind of impact.

586
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,685
They have a two-for-one deal on this.
