1
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:03,079
Hello.

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:06,816
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:13,890
Friends can bring you
joy, comfort, and a sense of security.

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:17,060
But here, in a place where laughter
is strictly forbidden,

5
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:20,263
friendship can be the most
dangerous bond of all.

6
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:24,434
How will today's guests
overcome this challenge?

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:27,804
Let's welcome them quietly.

8
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,377
-Don't laugh today.
-I won't.

9
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:37,447
I only laugh for the cameras.
I don't really laugh otherwise.

10
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:38,782
Yeah, you don't.

11
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,618
-I'm mostly bitter, actually.
-I see.

12
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,553
-Nothing is funny.
-Life is bitter.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,021
Yeah, life is bitter.

14
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:48,625
But the cameraman looks funny.

15
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:49,826
Don't say that.

16
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:51,494
It's true, though.

17
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:55,031
Are those nose-clip glasses?

18
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:59,269
Come on, don't ask him
questions like that.

19
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:01,471
-Can I laugh now?
-No, you can't.

20
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:03,240
-Do we go this way?
-No, that way.

21
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,709
Here? You're right, it's this way.

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,779
They really went all out
building this set.

23
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:11,815
-Is this it?
-It's a little predictable.

24
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:14,885
-Hello.
-Hello.

25
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,419
-Hello.
-Hello.

26
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,856
Hello.

27
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:24,527
Please have a seat.

28
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:26,162
It's been a while.

29
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:28,298
It sounds like it's raining.

30
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,168
Is there a gas leak somewhere?

31
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:33,303
Did someone fart?

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,209
-Welcome.
-Hello.

33
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,812
Before we start the interview,

34
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,248
please take a moment
to greet our audience.

35
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:56,426
Since it's your first time
on The Quiet Interview,

36
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,194
let me explain the rules.

37
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,329
-Okay.
-It's simple.

38
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,397
Okay.

39
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:02,499
Sorry about that.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,736
It's very simple. You can't laugh.

41
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:07,804
If you do,

42
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:11,241
you'll be sent to the Quiet Room
for five minutes,

43
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:14,311
where you'll spend
a lonely and isolated time.

44
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:17,781
You're probably wondering
how we determine when you laugh.

45
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:22,352
These cameras you see in front of us
are equipped with state-of-the-art AI.

46
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,789
It's trained to read
human facial expressions,

47
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,425
so it analyzes your faces
in real-time and…

48
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:34,931
-Does this count as a laugh?
-No, it doesn't.

49
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:39,603
When it's slightly ambiguous,
you'll hear this warning sound.

50
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:42,305
Okay, got it.

51
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:44,774
Is a computer observing us for real?

52
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,409
-Yes.
-Really?

53
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:48,211
That's the warning sound.

54
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:51,715
When it's totally undeniable
that you've laughed,

55
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,584
you'll hear a much louder siren.

56
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:55,852
It goes like this.

57
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:07,664
When that warning siren sounds,

58
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:13,503
the one who laughed will be sent
to the Quiet Room behind me.

59
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,714
You scared the poor baby.

60
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,217
Is he the comedian who speaks English?

61
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,027
Today, he's not the…

62
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:41,164
Are we okay?

63
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,899
Can we keep going?

64
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,468
-Let's continue.
-Is this a bit?

65
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,270
-No, it's not.
-I see.

66
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,472
-It happened last week too.
-What a mess.

67
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:56,746
He does look like that comedian,
but he's actually not.

68
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:57,847
He's a baby.

69
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,015
-Of course.
-Yeah.

70
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,455
I heard that even Heihachi
cries like a baby sometimes.

71
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:15,865
Okay.

72
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:20,170
We've spent so much time discussing
the rules with the two of you

73
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:23,139
that we haven't properly greeted
the viewers yet.

74
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,742
Please look at the camera and say hello.

75
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,911
Hello.

76
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:32,649
I'm Nucksal, and I'm here with O3ohn today
to do the no-laugh interview.

77
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,351
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

78
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,053
Go ahead, O3ohn.

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,589
Hello, I'm O3ohn. It's nice to meet you.

80
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,824
Nice to meet you.

81
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:49,266
These days, when people, including myself,
watch and listen to content…

82
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:56,406
Watch and listen to content…

83
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,447
They're playing H*lli G*lli.

84
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,518
Since you like board games, we…

85
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,155
So, we've just greeted our viewers.

86
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:17,694
Sometimes I eat when I'm watching content,
but even then,

87
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,629
I give it my full attention.

88
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:24,067
But sometimes, when I'm doing the dishes,
I only listen with my ears.

89
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:25,902
For those viewers,

90
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,240
could you verbally describe
what the other person looks like?

91
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:33,343
-Nucksal can describe O3ohn and so on.
-Each other?

92
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,646
Please describe each other
using only your words.

93
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:42,118
Nucksal looks like he could be
a character from <i>SpongeBob.</i>

94
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:48,024
You're going to laugh at your own joke?

95
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,527
Not like a crustacean or shellfish,

96
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,462
-but a fish.
-He looks like a fish.

97
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,764
Stop playing, you guys.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,036
O3ohn also looks like a fish.

99
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:03,273
They don't even have eyes
when you go below 1,500 meters.

100
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,041
Because there's no light.

101
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,844
The fish down there even have feet…

102
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,746
But I have eyes.

103
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,681
I mean, I'm just…

104
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:15,318
Actually, O3ohn's hairstyle
reminds me of a character

105
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:19,122
from an old movie I love
called <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

106
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:24,027
-He looks like Samuel L. Jackson.
-Samuel L. Jackson.

107
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,662
He keeps coming for me.

108
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,330
You can't make me laugh.

109
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:29,232
-I'm just being honest.
-Fine.

110
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:32,102
It seems like you both know
exactly what part to play

111
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:34,104
when it's time to be funny.

112
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,205
Well…

113
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:40,343
Nucksal teases people
and makes fun of things,

114
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,647
and you tend to take the hits, O3ohn.

115
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:48,485
I can totally relate to that,
but sometimes, it can get a bit…

116
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:49,686
Hey!

117
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,691
Why are you still playing?
I told you to stop!

118
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:56,927
Put that down.

119
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,895
Put the bell down.

120
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:00,797
You keep playing that.

121
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:02,132
WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER

122
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:05,902
Darn it.

123
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:16,713
Both of you laughed.

124
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,750
It's tough when you do it in succession.

125
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,719
The chain of events…

126
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,222
It's hard to hold it in.

127
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:29,259
I'm sorry, but you two will have to go
to the Quiet Room for five minutes.

128
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,528
This was planned.

129
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:34,965
I knew you guys planned that
so you could yell, "Hey!"

130
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,234
But I couldn't hold it in
when he started crying.

131
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,436
The bit we did earlier was staged.
This wasn't.

132
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,937
I was genuinely angry.

133
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,540
-Is he the comedian who speaks English?
-Yes.

134
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,181
I told you so. I knew I recognized him.

135
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,383
-Can we laugh in here?
-Yes.

136
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,918
You're not gassing us, right?

137
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:58,955
Our guests may be locked up,
but our interview must continue.

138
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,023
We laughed too soon.

139
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,593
We'll invite a stand-in
to answer in their place.

140
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,929
-He also calls himself Nucksal.
-A stand-in?

141
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:07,364
Please have a seat.

142
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,165
What the heck?

143
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,670
Who uses a stand-in for an interview?

144
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:16,740
This place is intense.

145
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,477
Baby Nucksal has joined us today.

146
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,979
You're about to become
a father to two children.

147
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:26,182
Could you say a few words to your family?

148
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:29,719
How does he make that sound?

149
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:35,759
That's great.

150
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:39,329
Baby Nucksal had a lot to say.

151
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:40,463
So annoying.

152
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,500
-Wait, Nucksal…
-I don't want to laugh at that.

153
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,701
The baby…

154
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,703
What is this? Is this a thing?

155
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,505
What's PPAP?

156
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:51,474
It says here you can do "PPAP,"
whatever that is.

157
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,643
Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen.

158
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:59,816
I have a sea worm. I have a fish roe soup.

159
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,785
How many years has he been doing that?

160
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,487
Sea worm, fish roe soup!

161
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:08,391
Don't grab yourself like that!

162
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,560
He's been doing that for ten years!

163
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:16,299
Very good.

164
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:19,202
Your time is up,
so please return to your seats.

165
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:20,604
-Don't laugh.
-I'm sweating.

166
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,871
I'm done laughing now.

167
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,340
Seriously, don't laugh.

168
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,276
I've met the two of you before,

169
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:29,880
but there's something
I wanted to share with you today.

170
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:35,118
If we strip away everything else
and just judge by looks alone,

171
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:37,921
we're all genuinely good-looking.

172
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,823
I really think so.

173
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,725
-Including yourself?
-All three of us.

174
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,627
Why are you grouping us together?

175
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,695
No, why am I…

176
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,566
Putting all the general sentiment aside,

177
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,735
I'm proud of how I look.
I'm sure you are too.

178
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,037
So, we prepared this today.

179
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:56,873
A way to objectively verify
our facial features.

180
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,843
-What's this?
-It's called a 3-D face stamp.

181
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,746
-Children probably…
-Children play with this.

182
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,282
It sticks out like this.

183
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,117
Come on.

184
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:08,985
You're such a child.

185
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:11,454
-Can you try, O3ohn?
-Me?

186
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:32,475
Can you see?

187
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,812
Isn't that Caesar?
From <i>Planet of the Apes?</i>

188
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:40,083
-Why don't we try together?
-Okay.

189
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:50,994
What's wrong with my cheeks? And my face?

190
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:52,529
Why am I so fat?

191
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,197
Why are my eyes bulging?

192
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,136
Let's get a close-up of O3ohn.

193
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:02,205
-What?
-You get O3ohn.

194
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,840
-A tight shot.
-Okay.

195
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:06,009
-Did you get it?
-Yeah, I got it.

196
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:07,510
I'll film O3ohn.

197
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:10,247
This is also…

198
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:11,815
-How can we…
-But…

199
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:15,151
-How much of this is a bit?
-O3ohn's looking a bit rough.

200
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:18,688
I don't think he washed his face.
He's got some dry patches too.

201
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:21,892
-Do you want to film Byungjae then?
-No, he's even worse.

202
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,027
Let's just say
his factory settings were off.

203
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:25,929
-Factory settings?
-Then you take O3ohn.

204
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,732
But his facial features are…

205
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:31,334
Wait, one, two, three.

206
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,670
He's missing something.

207
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,640
One, two, three.

208
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,175
-I'll take Byungjae and O3ohn.
-Are you sure?

209
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:42,913
-What if it ruins the lens?
-We're throwing this away anyway.

210
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:43,980
You take Nucksal.

211
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,682
But Nucksal's also…

212
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:50,120
His face looks infected.

213
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,156
Like a rotting fish or something.

214
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:56,693
I can't believe we have to film them.

215
00:11:57,394 --> 00:12:00,497
Would you subscribe to Disney+
just to watch them?

216
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:01,698
No way.

217
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:04,301
I would rather watch Jun Jihyun
and Gang Dongwon.

218
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,669
Who would watch this?

219
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,238
-He looks worse than a zombie.
-Crap, the mic.

220
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:13,076
He said I looked "infected."

221
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:22,052
You laughed too hard, Nucksal.

222
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:24,287
Sh*t.

223
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,491
I'd like to ask you a question.

224
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,827
Have you ever wanted to be reborn?

225
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,829
I sometimes think about that too.

226
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:33,997
Don't laugh!

227
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,935
Let's say you were going to be reborn.

228
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:40,804
A lot of people play this game.

229
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,273
I'll give you 200 points.

230
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,709
Split them between
your ideal height and weight.

231
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:47,944
Out of 200?

232
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,815
If I pick 180 cm, do I have to be 20 kg?

233
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,187
You have to balance it.

234
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,023
-You have to choose.
-Out of 200?

235
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,458
-Yes.
-He's overthinking it.

236
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:09,866
I'd like to be 150 cm tall
and weigh 50 kg.

237
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:13,069
-That's generally seen as healthy.
-Right.

238
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:15,605
Your ideal weight is your height
minus 100 or 110.

239
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:17,574
I want to be healthy… No, wait.

240
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,809
I'll take 180 cm and 20 kg.

241
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,214
150 cm… I'll take 155 cm and 45 kg.

242
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,917
-155 cm and 45 kg.
-155 cm and 45 kg?

243
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,718
That's my answer. 155 cm and 45 kg.

244
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,120
That's your answer.

245
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:34,224
Since that might be too little,
I'll give you 50 more points.

246
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:38,828
But you must distribute it
among height, weight, and IQ.

247
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:39,930
Crap…

248
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,631
That's hard.

249
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:44,534
Wait, it doesn't add up.

250
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:47,637
I think 50, 50, and 150 sounds just right.

251
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:51,541
Isn't that you right now?

252
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:56,446
What counts as a high IQ? 100?

253
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:58,415
You said 250, right?

254
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:00,750
Dolphins have an IQ between 60 and 70.

255
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:05,655
I chose 150 and 50,
and you gave me 50 more.

256
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:08,158
That's 100…

257
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,361
You're giving me 50 points?

258
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,863
How many times are you going to ask?

259
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,999
-He didn't answer me.
-You're right.

260
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,702
-I get 50 more, right?
-Out of 250…

261
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,343
What? Is it me?

262
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:31,047
Since I laughed,
you've earned one revival token.

263
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:33,850
You can laugh once
without being sent to the room.

264
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,151
Let's continue.

265
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,187
I'm adding 50 more,

266
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:40,357
making it 300, for height,
weight, IQ, and life expectancy.

267
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:41,625
-Okay.
-I'll try it too.

268
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:44,527
First, my height is locked at 185 cm.

269
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:47,764
-I want to be tall for once.
-How old do you have to die?

270
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,799
If you use 185, you only have 115 left.

271
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,601
And my weight is 70 kg.

272
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,970
At 185 cm and 70 kg,
I'd basically be a model.

273
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:57,007
Then you have 45 left
for IQ and life expectancy.

274
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,644
-What was the total?
-O3ohn's behind on the math.

275
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,448
If I can't be tall,
I'd rather be really short.

276
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:07,517
What was the total?

277
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:11,321
-Was it 300? I can't remember.
-Stop it.

278
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,156
You can do it with 250 or 300.

279
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:16,293
-That's it for now.
-Just look it up when you go home.

280
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,596
We have a few more questions
for our guests.

281
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,498
By the time this airs,

282
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,501
there will be a precious
new family member in your life.

283
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,836
Your second child is due soon.

284
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:30,106
-Yes.
-How long until the due date?

285
00:15:30,173 --> 00:15:32,609
There are 21 days left as of today.

286
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:35,312
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

287
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,916
Nucksal's anticipating the birth
of his second child.

288
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,785
You must have a lot on your mind.

289
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:46,890
The thought of becoming a father
of two children is setting in.

290
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:50,460
-And…
-They changed their game.

291
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:54,998
Since I've done it once before,

292
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:59,102
I have a general idea
about how to raise the second one.

293
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:00,904
I know how to change diapers now.

294
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:04,407
-Your first is Yunwoo, right?
-Yes, and my second is Yungeon.

295
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:05,775
That's a cool name.

296
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:08,445
But was the conception planned?

297
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,347
Or was it…

298
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,417
Conception…

299
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:16,920
That's not a common word,
but you're using it.

300
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:20,757
Yes, we wanted to have our kids.

301
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,201
That can't have been staged.

302
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:37,841
O3ohn, you mentioned on another show
that you're in a relationship.

303
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,377
You said it's been
about eight and a half years.

304
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:44,014
-And you're living together.
-Yes, we are.

305
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,316
You said you were in
a common-law marriage.

306
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:50,487
I've never tried to hide it,
but people think I have.

307
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,856
You've also worked with her.

308
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:54,457
-And it wasn't a secret.
-No.

309
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:56,326
Do you get much advice about…

310
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:58,161
Bring that here.

311
00:16:58,995 --> 00:16:59,996
You little…

312
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:02,365
That's enough.

313
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,270
Play the monkey game.

314
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:10,640
That one doesn't make as much noise.

315
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:14,344
What's driving me crazy
is the lady sitting in the back.

316
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,846
I don't know what she has up her sleeve.

317
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:20,417
-Will she do something at the end?
-She's not going to do anything.

318
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,988
You know those swords don't go in there.

319
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,896
There's something else
I wanted to ask the two of you.

320
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:35,966
What part of your body
are you most confident about?

321
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:37,901
If I may start, mine are my eyes.

322
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,603
Mine are my lips.

323
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:40,737
-Your lips?
-Yes.

324
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,138
Lips?

325
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:45,575
How about you?

326
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:48,044
I've always liked my lips, too.

327
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,980
You really do have plump lips.

328
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:53,416
-They're plump and shaped well.
-You have nice lips.

329
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,886
The thing about O3ohn's lips is that…

330
00:17:55,952 --> 00:18:00,824
When you look at his side profile,
you can tell that his lips

331
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:04,895
stick out too much.

332
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,297
-That's…
-They really stand out.

333
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:11,534
My partner barely has to lean in.
My lips are already halfway there.

334
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:14,704
-My lips are already sticking out.
-No.

335
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:19,309
And even though my lips stick out,
my tongue can't reach far.

336
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:24,447
My lips do stick out,
but it's not like my tongue's short.

337
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:28,251
-Who asked about you kissing?
-I wasn't talking about that.

338
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,220
I wasn't talking about kissing.

339
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,495
You'll have to go back…

340
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:40,797
-I have a revival token.
-That's right.

341
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:42,032
-Let me use it.
-Okay.

342
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:45,535
He says his lips stick so far out
that his tongue can't reach far out.

343
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:49,205
-It's true. But my tongue isn't short.
-That's ridiculous.

344
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:51,775
-My pronunciation's fine, right?
-Yes.

345
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,877
Let's move on to the next segment.

346
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:55,045
Just a moment, please.

347
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,014
We changed the battery,
so we need to clap the slate.

348
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,417
Okay. We'll take a five-minute break.

349
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:01,618
-Is this real?
-Yes.

350
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:05,355
-Okay.
-I don't know what's real or not.

351
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:08,291
-Do you have anything to do after this?
-No, I don't.

352
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:10,093
Clapping in three, two, one.

353
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:18,935
What the…

354
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:29,813
All right, today we have
two amazing artists as our guests,

355
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,848
but they're not the only artists here.

356
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:36,853
I heard that we also have a writer
in our audience today.

357
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,623
Yes. I've been waiting for her.

358
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,092
-She's elegant.
-Hello.

359
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:44,294
-Hello.
-I'm Ryu Yeonhwa.

360
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:48,999
I've been enjoying your content
for a long time now,

361
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:53,303
and I'm a huge fan of both of you.

362
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,941
So, I wrote a novel with the two of you
as the main characters.

363
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,142
I see.

364
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:05,048
If it's okay with you, may I read it here?

365
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:07,083
-Yes, we'd be honored.
-Is that okay?

366
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,653
-You wrote a novel about us?
-Yes.

367
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,454
What's the title?

368
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,290
It's called <i>The Board Game Club.</i>

369
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:16,293
She wrote a story titled
<i>The Board Game Club.</i>

370
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,528
-Let's give her a hand.
-What an honor.

371
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:19,763
Thank you.

372
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,234
"A deserted island.

373
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:28,471
As he reached for the dice,

374
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:35,212
Nucksal's slender fingers
brushed against O3ohn's damp hand.

375
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:43,119
O3ohn quickly tried to withdraw his hand,
but Nucksal suddenly gripped his wrist.

376
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,656
'Don't run from this.'

377
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:52,162
As Nucksal's glimmering eyes drew closer,

378
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:58,501
a familiar face began to flash
in O3ohn's mind.

379
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,572
'Stop it.
Jeongwon can't find out about this.'

380
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:10,247
O3ohn finally broke free
and fled into the bathroom.

381
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,682
He quickly turned on the shower,

382
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:18,121
thrusting himself
under the hot stream of water."

383
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:19,289
"Thrust himself"?

384
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:24,294
"It was as if he was trying to wash away
his burning desire.

385
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:29,132
But then, the door opened with a creak,

386
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:34,638
and Nucksal stepped closer
through the heavy steam.

387
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,607
'You want to shower together?'

388
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:44,581
As O3ohn trembled,
Nucksal firmly pulled his curved waist…"

389
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:46,516
-I hate this so much.
-What is this?

390
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,385
"…and whispered softly."

391
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:50,153
What are you talking about?

392
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,923
"'Make sure you wash thoroughly.'

393
00:21:54,291 --> 00:22:00,363
A thick fog of steam enveloped the two,
shutting them off from the world.

394
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,567
It was a deserted island."

395
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:08,171
Let's end this with a round of applause.

396
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:21,484
We'll have both of you enter the room.

397
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,154
-That was humiliating.
-Ma'am, this is Disney…

398
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:26,990
-But we…
-Ma'am…

399
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:31,528
The interview must continue.
So, let's bring in Heihachi.

400
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:34,731
Now I can't stop thinking
about the steamy shower scene!

401
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:39,035
Why did you have to say "thrust himself"?

402
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,905
And why is he walking backwards?

403
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:46,509
Seriously, I was trying so hard
not to laugh.

404
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:52,249
Stop it!

405
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,919
I don't know what that is, but stop it!

406
00:22:55,986 --> 00:23:00,156
What are you planning to do
after today's show?

407
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:03,159
My mind's a mess right now.

408
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:05,929
I must train hard now.

409
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:08,765
Let me ask this.

410
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,668
What do you actually do for a living?

411
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:14,304
I'm a drummer.

412
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,310
I'm the drummer for the band Bobby Pins.

413
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:23,079
He plays the drums in a band.

414
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:25,448
Let's give a round
of applause for Heihachi.

415
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,652
No wonder he's stylish.

416
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:30,687
Please return to your seat.

417
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:34,624
Do your bandmates know you're doing this?

418
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:35,926
No, they don't.

419
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,132
That guy's not normal.

420
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,000
-You can come back now.
-Okay.

421
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,602
We're going back and forth.

422
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:47,537
What do you mean, your mind is a mess?

423
00:23:47,604 --> 00:23:50,807
We've prepared a final segment
that is truly like a gift

424
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:52,876
for the two of you.

425
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,044
Okay.

426
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,346
We're going to talk about your good deeds.

427
00:23:56,413 --> 00:24:00,750
Everyone knows you've both been
such kind and hardworking people.

428
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:04,387
We received so many anecdotes
about your good deeds.

429
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:10,093
Someone in the audience wants to share
an anecdote about Nucksal's good deeds.

430
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,995
-The drummer?
-All right.

431
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,464
Great. Let's get him a microphone.

432
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,301
He's holding it there?

433
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:19,736
He's very flexible.

434
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:22,739
Don't you remember me, Nucksal?

435
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:25,875
Stop kidding around.

436
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:28,678
I'm Wonseok
from the 7th Division Recon Unit.

437
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:30,313
What?

438
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,448
I'm Wonseok.

439
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,384
Wait a minute. Wonseok?

440
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:37,254
-The 7th Division.
-I really was in the 7th Division.

441
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,189
I think I remember the name Wonseok.

442
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,492
-I was a rookie when you were there.
-Really?

443
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,594
But why are you dressed like that?

444
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:46,263
Nucksal was…

445
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,298
He turned away when I tried to look.

446
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:51,134
He never spoke harshly to a rookie.

447
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:57,374
He never slacked off once
and always led by example.

448
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,444
He was kind to me
and let me sleep next to him.

449
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:04,014
-I still remember…
-Sleep next to him?

450
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,851
-There's something I want to do for you.
-Okay, Wonseok.

451
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:10,320
-Salute!
-What's wrong with you?

452
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:11,688
You can do it!

453
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:15,492
It's "We can do it."
Are you sure you're not lying?

454
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:19,563
You got discharged after me, didn't you?

455
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:22,198
Thanks for back then, Nucksal.

456
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:26,736
Thank you for sharing
that touching story about Nucksal.

457
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:31,241
We also have an anecdote about O3ohn.

458
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:35,212
-You probably didn't expect this.
-There shouldn't be any.

459
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,317
I've been told that a special person came
to share a story about O3ohn in person.

460
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:41,551
Let's welcome her.

461
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,453
Really? What's going on?

462
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:46,423
-What?
-What?

463
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:49,392
I don't know her.

464
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,530
She's actually an elderly woman.

465
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:57,834
-Hello.
-Hello.

466
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,637
I'm Kim Bonghee, and I'm 79 years old.

467
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:02,172
Nice to meet you.

468
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,773
Hello, ma'am.

469
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,510
Not long ago, at my son's suggestion,

470
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:12,749
I went to the gym to sign up for
a boxing class for the elderly.

471
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:13,884
That's amazing.

472
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,856
But when I arrived,
I was too scared to go in.

473
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:20,924
I know that feeling.

474
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:25,795
That's when this young man came up to me.

475
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:30,667
She was afraid to go in,
so O3ohn kindly helped her out.

476
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:36,106
He waved me over
and invited me into the ring.

477
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:41,711
He said dentures weren't allowed

478
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:46,650
and handed me a mouthguard.

479
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:53,223
The moment I put it in,
I immediately blacked out.

480
00:26:57,561 --> 00:27:04,134
And I will never forget what he said next.

481
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,136
What was it?

482
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:13,009
"Even when a lion hunts an old rabbit,
it gives everything it's got."

483
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,912
-Oh, my gosh.
-This is great.

484
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:19,716
-What a memorable quote.
-That was funny.

485
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:22,118
Did you really do that?

486
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:23,887
My type of humor.

487
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:30,460
Her hair was tied up back then,
so I thought she'd dyed it white.

488
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:34,331
She does look young for her age.

489
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:35,565
Right.

490
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:37,234
Sorry, I didn't know.

491
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:42,339
The viewers might think
we made up this story.

492
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,874
Ma'am, where was that boxing gym?

493
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:48,044
It's Guryong Boxing in Yangjae-dong.

494
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:51,081
It's true. He goes there.

495
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,284
From a sportsman's perspective…

496
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,754
Yes, of course. Age is irrelevant.

497
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,123
And dentures are dangerous when boxing.

498
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,425
-They seriously are.
-Very well.

499
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:05,795
Let's give her another round of applause.

500
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:14,137
The segment is over,
but since both of you laughed,

501
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:16,673
you'll have to go to the Quiet Room again.

502
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,410
-The old lady was great. I laughed.
-Goodness.

503
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:22,979
-This isn't fair.
-Dang it.

504
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,248
What about the old rabbit?

505
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:29,319
"Even when a lion hunts an old rabbit,
it gives everything it's got."

506
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:36,126
We usually allow our guests
to say a few words

507
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,762
if they don't get sent to the Quiet Room.

508
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:41,865
But since both of you failed
and ended up in the Quiet Room,

509
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:45,035
we have someone
who's prepared a final message.

510
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:46,770
Please come up to the stage.

511
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,673
Is he going to sleep through
the whole show?

512
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,976
WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER

513
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:56,112
Please say what you want to the camera.

514
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,349
Hello, I'm Yoon Jihong,
and I'm a clapping expert.

515
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,218
A clapping expert.

516
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:04,054
Even if I get blisters
and calluses on my hands,

517
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,757
I will not stop
until I break the world record.

518
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:09,459
-Really?
-Thank you.

519
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:12,262
When I say,
"This has been The Quiet Interview,"

520
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,798
could you show them how you clap?

521
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:18,134
Thanks for watching.
This has been The Quiet Interview.

522
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:22,138
Thank you.

523
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:24,241
-Thank you.
-How does he do that?

524
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:33,416
