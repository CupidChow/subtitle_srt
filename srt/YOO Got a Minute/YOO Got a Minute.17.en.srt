1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,203
Hello.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,178
There are times when we have to smile
even when we don't want to.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,614
I'm sure most of us can relate.

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,184
But the opposite isn't easy either.

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,420
Today on The Quiet Interview,

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:25,792
we'll reflect on what a true joy it is
to be able to smile and laugh freely,

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,429
even in moments
when you absolutely shouldn't.

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,233
Let's welcome our guest quietly.

10
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,220
That's from <i>Gap Dong!</i>

11
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,191
-It was a show on t*N, right?
-Yes.

12
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,595
-It's been forever.
-This is from that show where you acted

13
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,296
alongside Yoon Sanghyun.

14
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:42,536
We're so grateful to have you as a guest
on The Quiet Interview today.

15
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,239
Let me briefly explain the rules.

16
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,673
You can't laugh.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,043
The cameras in front of us
aren't just regular cameras.

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,313
They're equipped with
cutting-edge AI technology.

19
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,182
They analyze and compare

20
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,052
your real-time facial expressions
with human expression patterns.

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,356
If it detects even
the slightest hint of a laugh,

22
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,958
a warning sound will go off.

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,031
And if it's clear that
you've burst into laughter,

24
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,866
a much louder siren will…

25
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,509
Once the high-tech siren goes off,

26
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,246
you'll be temporarily sent
to the Quiet Room behind us.

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,649
His vocal projection is incredible.

28
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,285
-He's a professional vocalist.
-Really?

29
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,554
He's our Siren Guy.

30
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,223
-You were born in February 1988?
-Yes.

31
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,160
The whole "early-year" thing
doesn't really apply anymore,

32
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,363
but do you still think of yourself
as an early-year kid?

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,098
It's a bit ambiguous for me.

34
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,367
I went to kindergarten for an extra year.

35
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,435
Why?

36
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,472
My mom thought
I was kind of slow back then.

37
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,711
So while my friends who were born in 1987
moved on to elementary school,

38
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:01,248
I stayed behind and did another year.

39
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,187
We're roughly the same age,
so I remember you were an <i>ulzzang.</i>

40
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,323
I bet you had a ton of fans in school.

41
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:14,027
If I'm being honest,
I was in my prime back then.

42
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,362
-Really?
-Yes.

43
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,664
How popular were you?
Like on Valentine's Day…

44
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,499
I couldn't carry it all.

45
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,537
My hands were so full,
I was dropping things.

46
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,640
-Because you received a lot of gifts?
-Like that cartoon.

47
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>-Hansel and Gretel?</i>
-Yes.

48
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,078
-That's a fairy tale.
-Right, it's not a cartoon.

49
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,348
They weren't dropping things
because their hands were full.

50
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,284
They were leaving breadcrumbs
to find their way back home.

51
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:41,188
Yes, of course. I totally knew that.

52
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,457
Since this show is on
a global OTT platform,

53
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,727
and viewers from all around the world
may be tuning in,

54
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,465
we've invited an interpreter
to ensure communication is seamless.

55
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,334
-Really?
-Is it okay if he steps in?

56
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,402
Sure.

57
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,675
Could you say a few words to the viewers?

58
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,915
We brought an interpreter for you.

59
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:14,788
I thought he was going to translate
my English into Korean.

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,293
-Sorry.
-He'll translate it into English for you.

61
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,427
Right.

62
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,529
I misunderstood.

63
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,531
I'm still a bit slow.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,702
Hello, I'm Lee Joon.

65
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,840
It's truly an honor to be on
The Quiet Interview.

66
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,610
I've been enjoying this show
for a long time.

67
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,780
So I'm very happy to be here
and share this moment with you.

68
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:43,984
I intend to approach this interview
with complete sincerity.

69
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,118
Thank you.

70
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,730
Is that it?

71
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,501
You said you enjoyed watching our show,

72
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,270
but we haven't aired it yet.

73
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,974
You're right.

74
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,477
Our first episode airs next Monday.

75
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,180
Could you tell us
how you're approaching today's shoot?

76
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,650
The truth is…

77
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,153
-I don't laugh much.
-You don't?

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,089
Yes, because…

79
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,092
When I watch comedy shows,
I find them funny,

80
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,996
-but it doesn't make me laugh out loud.
-So you don't burst out laughing.

81
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:33,934
I do think it's funny,
but I don't crack up out loud.

82
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,805
So I figured I could maintain
a serious demeanor on this show.

83
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,608
I felt quite confident about that.

84
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,410
Could you translate that?

85
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,050
-He said a curse word.
-H*ll yeah.

86
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,351
Is that allowed?

87
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,120
We told him not to.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,589
He cursed right from the start.

89
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,858
Okay, please take your seat.

90
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:03,330
We'll officially begin The Quiet Interview
with Lee Joon…

91
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,398
<i>Delivery.</i>

92
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,409
He's just leaving like that?

93
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,945
He must be juggling multiple jobs.

94
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,415
He's here as an audience member,
but he also works in food delivery.

95
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,484
-Kind of like the show <i>Workman.</i>
-I see.

96
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,255
I remember something
from your past interviews.

97
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,390
You said you never make bets.

98
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,292
-That's right.
-Not even once?

99
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,461
They make you bet on things
on shows sometimes.

100
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,662
-For fun, right?
-Yes.

101
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,332
Whenever they do that,
I can't control my expression.

102
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,168
-Really?
-Yes, it's weird.

103
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,670
It must be my childhood education.

104
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,771
What do you mean?

105
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:50,043
My mom always used to tell me
to, you know, like, that stuff…

106
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,982
Like, you know, that stuff…

107
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,719
In a previous show we did together,

108
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,456
you were called the "Efficiency Man"
for being very frugal and practical.

109
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,659
What was your best purchase this year?

110
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,995
I haven't bought anything.

111
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,732
But it's October.

112
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,268
I seriously haven't bought anything.

113
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,571
-Nothing except the basics?
-Right. Nothing besides consumables.

114
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,507
Maybe soap?

115
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,211
Soap is a basic necessity.

116
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,116
We're at that awkward age

117
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:33,120
between being a young man
and a middle-aged man.

118
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,488
What do you think?

119
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:38,358
Do you consider yourself a young man
or a middle-aged man?

120
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,195
If I'm being honest,
I'm a middle-aged man.

121
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,598
-I see.
-Because at some…

122
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,235
This really is a reality show.

123
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,505
Did you really make a delivery just now?

124
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,076
-Yes.
-That's so crazy.

125
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,045
I heard this is trending.

126
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,782
Since opinions can be split
on whether you're middle-aged or not,

127
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,952
many people are asking ChatGPT.

128
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,320
Let's ask ChatGPT

129
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,889
-since we're both well-known.
-Sure.

130
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,159
-I tried this already.
-You did? What did it say?

131
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,127
-It said I was a middle-aged man.
-Really?

132
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,431
Is Yoo Byungjae a young man
or a middle-aged man?

133
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,834
<i>Yoo Byungjae's sharp wit</i>
<i>and small, adorable proportions</i>

134
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,771
<i>give him the charm of a cute young man</i>
<i>you'd want to carry in your pocket.</i>

135
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,973
You're a young man.

136
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,409
It said I'm a young man.

137
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,178
-I'll ask about you.
-Okay.

138
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,449
Is Lee Joon a young man
or a middle-aged man?

139
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,852
<i>Lee Joon was born in 1988.</i>

140
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,388
<i>He's between</i>
<i>a young man and a middle-aged man.</i>

141
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:44,258
<i>But since he's still naive</i>
<i>and somewhat immature,</i>

142
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,227
<i>he's a young man</i>
<i>who retains an innocent boyish charm.</i>

143
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,131
I don't feel great about that.

144
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,135
It's saying you're innocent and untainted.

145
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,436
Right…

146
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,773
Is Im Haryong young or middle-aged?

147
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,778
<i>Im Haryong has a mischievous,</i>
<i>puppy-like charm</i>

148
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,148
<i>that makes him feel like a young man</i>
<i>you just want to look after.</i>

149
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,057
Is Kim Koo a young man
or a middle-aged man?

150
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:22,196
<i>With model-like proportions</i>
<i>and strikingly broad shoulders,</i>

151
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:26,466
<i>Kim Koo is a young man</i>
<i>who captures the hearts of women.</i>

152
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,870
That's very accurate.

153
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,371
Wait…

154
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:33,807
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,384
This is…

156
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,153
I mean…

157
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,623
How can ChatGPT answer like this?

158
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:53,961
Since you laughed,
you'll have to go inside the Quiet Room.

159
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,662
But it's Kim Koo…

160
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,698
-He's a young man in our hearts.
-But…

161
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,032
We're here thanks to him.

162
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,667
This is ridiculous.

163
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,204
Please have a seat there.

164
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,377
I can't believe this.

165
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:15,449
Our sole guest
is currently in the Quiet Room,

166
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:19,019
so let's welcome a stand-in
to continue the interview.

167
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:24,291
I don't think Lee Joon ever imagined
this person would show up.

168
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,895
This is someone who shares
a deep connection with Lee Joon.

169
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,299
-Really?
-They've spent many years together.

170
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,236
-Let's welcome Thunder to the show.
-For real?

171
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,074
Is it really him?

172
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:51,018
Thank you for taking the time to join us
despite your busy schedule.

173
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:55,422
I recently offered my congratulations
because you got married.

174
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,359
Is it true that Lee Joon sent
a huge amount of congratulatory money?

175
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,634
This is so ridiculous.

176
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,137
He did send a huge amount.

177
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,440
Our "Efficiency Man," Lee Joon,
went above and beyond.

178
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,976
How did they come up with this?

179
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,479
Thank you again
for making time to be here.

180
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,615
-Thank you.
-I really thought he came.

181
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,750
That was Thunder, everyone. Thank you.

182
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,661
Time's up, so let's bring
Lee Joon back to the guest seat.

183
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,630
This is crazy.

184
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,503
We're with Lee Joon, the young man
who retains his innocent, boyish charm.

185
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:47,307
We've prepared a fun game
to go with the interview.

186
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,543
-Okay.
-Please bring up the monitor.

187
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,313
I just realized who he's dressed up as.

188
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,149
It's when MBLAQ sang <i>Y, </i>right?

189
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,219
That's right. He even has the hair.

190
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,491
We've prepared a game

191
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,661
called "Guess the price."
I used to watch this on video platforms.

192
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:13,467
We buy things all the time
without thinking about the actual price.

193
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:14,968
How about you?

194
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,436
I think I have a rough idea.

195
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,538
-Really?
-Yes.

196
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:21,575
I know you don't make bets,
but you sound confident.

197
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:24,878
-You win if you get five questions right.
-Okay.

198
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,713
But if you get fewer than five,

199
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,349
then as a light penalty,

200
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,386
why don't you buy snacks
for everyone who came today?

201
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,688
-Sounds good.
-That's great.

202
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,657
Let's start the game.

203
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,925
"Guess the price."

204
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,662
The Seoul Metropolitan Subway fare.

205
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,731
That's 1,380 won.

206
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,201
-You said 1,380 won.
-Right.

207
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,336
The price is 1,550 won.

208
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,271
-Probably…
-Why did it go up?

209
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,242
I don't think it was ever 1,380 won.

210
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,777
Back when I worked part-time,

211
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,613
-the hourly wage was 3,850 won.
-Per hour?

212
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,282
So I think I was just used to
the numbers three and eight.

213
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,851
THAT'S NEVER BEEN MINIMUM WAGE

214
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,519
Next question.

215
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:10,357
The current monthly subscription fee
for the Disney+ standard plan.

216
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,659
You use Disney+, right?

217
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,396
I subscribed and then canceled.

218
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,804
Were you planning to watch today's episode
through the rough cut we send you?

219
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,377
No, I wasn't.

220
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:31,745
Okay, you weren't.

221
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,147
I mean… I should subscribe again.

222
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,650
The reason I didn't was…

223
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,455
Well…

224
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,460
How much do you think Disney+ costs?

225
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,862
It's 17,000 won.

226
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,964
It's 9,900 won.

227
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,466
That's really cheap.

228
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,334
That's a good deal.

229
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,136
I think you'll get this one.

230
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:59,139
The price
of K*mbap H*aven's kimchi fried rice.

231
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,609
How much was it when you ate it?

232
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,446
-I used to eat there over ten years ago.
-Okay.

233
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,851
Back then, my manager paid
with the company card,

234
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,120
and I ate it in our van.

235
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,491
Maybe around 7,000 won? 7,500 won?

236
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,760
KIMCHI FRIED RICE

237
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,094
That's amazing.

238
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,865
I got it…
By the way, you're in great shape.

239
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,301
I bet you're on a strict diet.

240
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,003
There's a guy eating kimchi fried rice.

241
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,538
You're right.

242
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,507
He's also on a strict diet.

243
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,011
Next question.

244
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:43,383
Your autographed album was up for sale
on a second-hand website.

245
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,818
That's my real signature.

246
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes.

247
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:50,424
This includes shipping,
and it hasn't sold yet.

248
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,993
-So this is currently listed?
-Yes.

249
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,629
It says,
"Price negotiable for quick sale."

250
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,165
I can see that it's our first album.

251
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,501
-From 2009.
-It includes <i>Oh Yeah.</i>

252
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,103
The original retail price
was around 10,000 won.

253
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,039
-Right.
-It must've been around 10,000 won.

254
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,708
How much do you think it costs?

255
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,810
Maybe around 8,000 won?

256
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,714
ALBUM SIGNED BY LEE JOON
6,000 WON

257
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:16,850
Last question.

258
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:22,122
An album signed by Cho Saeho
and Nam Changhee.

259
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,359
It's in good condition,
and they're selling it before they move.

260
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,094
"Feel free to make an offer."

261
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,530
Is it 3,000 won?

262
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,398
ALBUM SIGNED BY CHO AND NAM

263
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,699
It's 5,000 won.

264
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,902
Both were exactly 2,000 won off.

265
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,237
You overestimated your own value

266
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:41,875
and underestimated others' value
by 2,000 won.

267
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:46,880
We played the game,
and since he only got one correct,

268
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,817
Lee Joon will be buying the snacks today!

269
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,622
How about something simple
like frozen yogurt?

270
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,124
It won't be too expensive.

271
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:58,292
Yes, of course.

272
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,893
-From Y*ajung.
-Of course.

273
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,829
One "Your Froyo Your Way" costs 4,500 won.

274
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,565
-That's a great deal.
-Yes.

275
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,835
-3 more servings will cost 6,500 won more.
-Okay.

276
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,304
-Should we add choco shells?
-Yes.

277
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,105
-Dubai choco shells?
-Great.

278
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,874
-Strawberry milk shells?
-Yes.

279
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:15,642
-N*tella choco shells?
-Hurray!

280
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,377
-Mango shells?
-Yes.

281
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,447
-A large pack of granola?
-Sounds great.

282
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,282
-Fruit L**ps?
-Yes.

283
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,917
C*nnamon T*ast Cr*nch.

284
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,053
-Is this the…
-We're adding toppings.

285
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,255
-Toppings.
-It won't cost much.

286
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,425
Melon pop. Or*o crumble.

287
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,327
Is there anything else…

288
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,697
Did you add banana brûlée?

289
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,332
-Banana brûlée?
-Yes.

290
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,533
I'll add it.

291
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,368
And mint pop pop?

292
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:42,469
Mint pop pop.

293
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,239
Could we also get some
brown sugar mochi cubes?

294
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,874
-Brown…
-Sugar.

295
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,108
-Sugar…
-Mochi cubes.

296
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,243
-Mochi cubes.
-Yes.

297
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,215
So, with 20 items, the total is…

298
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,519
-It's 4,725,000 won.
-Oh, my gosh.

299
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,930
This is ridiculous.

300
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:15,202
Who eats 4.72 million won
worth of frozen yogurt?

301
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,572
We'll need you
to return to the Quiet Room.

302
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,209
I was estimating around 400,000 won.

303
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,717
-We're going to place the order now.
-Okay.

304
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,519
Seriously?

305
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,189
Who's going to deliver that?

306
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,256
<i>Delivery.</i>

307
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,360
Is he picking it up?

308
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,431
The order went to him
since he's right here.

309
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,800
How can it be 4.7…

310
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:52,706
Our guest has entered the Quiet Room
for the second time today.

311
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,975
Let's continue the interview.

312
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,878
Let's welcome Thunder back one more time.

313
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,585
Let's welcome Thunder back.

314
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,721
-Thunder…
-Sorry…

315
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,189
What's wrong?

316
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,926
Thunder had to leave
for his next appointment.

317
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,496
What about the show then?

318
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,065
-Go get him.
-I'll go get him.

319
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,132
He can't go yet.

320
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,069
Thunder!

321
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:25,239
What was that?

322
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,011
-What?
-Byungjae!

323
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,648
Donghyeok was hit by thunder and died.

324
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,890
The delivery guy died?

325
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,498
What the heck is this?

326
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,735
Please come back to your seat, Lee Joon.

327
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,781
Okay, let's switch up the mood
and continue the interview.

328
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,158
Isn't he the one who died?

329
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,726
No, it was someone else.

330
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,462
Someone… Is he someone different?

331
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,931
I need a photo.

332
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,940
There's really frozen yogurt in there.

333
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,777
-Let's eat this while we finish the show.
-It's real.

334
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,112
You've never had Y*ajung?

335
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,115
Go ahead. Is this product placement?

336
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,183
No.

337
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,652
We're just eating this
in the middle of the show?

338
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,928
-Thank you, Lee Joon.
-You're welcome.

339
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:55,996
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

340
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:57,598
-Am I paying?
-Yes.

341
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,537
Lee Joon treated us all
to this delicious snack today,

342
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,305
so we're enjoying it together.

343
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,009
It's time for our audience members
to return the favor.

344
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,812
If anyone would like to say
a few words to Lee Joon…

345
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,515
Do you have something to say?

346
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,551
Hello.

347
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:28,962
Hello…

348
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,238
"Arthur Fleck" over here
has a special talent.

349
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,439
What is it?

350
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,507
Well…

351
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,442
I can…

352
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,213
I can eat an Oh Y*s! and pretend I didn't.

353
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,716
MBLAQ's debut song was <i>Oh Yeah,</i>
so there's a connection there.

354
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:52,386
You're going to eat it
and act like you didn't?

355
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,655
You're going to eat the whole thing?

356
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:57,624
Can you show us?

357
00:20:58,525 --> 00:20:59,927
How is that possible?

358
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,298
That's incredible.

359
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,501
It was possible.

360
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:10,170
It really looks like
you didn't eat anything.

361
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:26,413
It was like watching a scene
from <i>Whiplash </i>or <i>Secret.</i>

362
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,614
That was cool.

363
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,682
We saw…

364
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,985
a wonderful collaboration.

365
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:33,053
Actually, you…

366
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:38,692
Seeing so many people come
and give such wonderful performances

367
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,529
makes me appreciate
just how great a person you are.

368
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:44,798
We have some anecdotes
about your good deeds.

369
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:45,933
This is my favorite.

370
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,602
You tried to stop a school bully
and ended up

371
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,170
-getting hit.
-Yes.

372
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,140
It's both a strength
and a weakness of mine.

373
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:57,277
If something feels wrong,
I speak up immediately.

374
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:03,483
Bullying is clearly not okay,
and that's why I called it out.

375
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,320
It sounds simple,
but it takes a lot of courage.

376
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,222
What an admirable story.

377
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,958
It's also widely known
that you reported drunk drivers

378
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,626
-on two separate occasions.
-Yes.

379
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:14,895
If you suspect someone, do you trail them?

380
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:16,930
So if I suspect someone…

381
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:20,801
To be clear, I don't think I'm some hero.

382
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:23,904
I think anyone would've done that.

383
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,839
I knew you'd say something like that.

384
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,909
People like you don't call attention
to their own good deeds.

385
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,744
You probably don't even realize it.

386
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:35,148
We figured you wouldn't talk about it,
so we invited someone here.

387
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,851
They volunteered to share

388
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:41,455
-a story about your good deed.
-Really?

389
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:44,324
Let's welcome the person
who submitted this story.

390
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,403
Hello.

391
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,406
Do you remember her?

392
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,876
-Yes.
-Please introduce yourself.

393
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:07,981
I'm Kim Nangyeong,
and I work at a café near Jamsil.

394
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:09,816
Nice to meet you.

395
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,586
I heard you wanted to share
a story about Lee Joon.

396
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:13,654
Yes.

397
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,989
You wrote a letter.

398
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:24,264
Not long ago,
Lee Joon visited our café to film <i>Workman.</i>

399
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,135
He was a bit clumsy at the job,

400
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:32,840
but I was impressed
that he never slacked off

401
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,908
despite being a celebrity.

402
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,544
If you're a celebrity,

403
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:41,915
you can just pretend to work
when the cameras are rolling.

404
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:46,019
But to have a celebrity do the dishes…

405
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:50,390
It's not easy for a celebrity to mingle
with regular people like us,

406
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,326
wearing the same uniform,

407
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:55,896
talking the same way,
breathing the same air,

408
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:58,866
and even sharing the same space.

409
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,301
Even if it's just a show,

410
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:04,771
our esteemed celebrity actually got
his hands wet doing the dishes,

411
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,641
setting such a great example
for all of us.

412
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,644
Thanks to his actions,

413
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:14,047
I felt a sense of pride as a café manager

414
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:18,118
even though I don't earn
ten million won a month.

415
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,854
Your boundless grace
fills me with gratitude.

416
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,827
-You're bowing…
-Yes.

417
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,668
She bowed three times,
touching her head to the ground.

418
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,207
Is she leaving?

419
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,277
I didn't even say goodbye.

420
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,945
Yes, she's leaving.

421
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,947
Please enter the Quiet Room.

422
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:48,849
She came just for that?

423
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:52,920
But…

424
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:02,796
All right. We've reached
the end of The Quiet Interview.

425
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:05,199
That was our last segment,

426
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,268
but since our guest
has entered the Quiet Room,

427
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:11,872
the chance to say the final words
goes to our audience.

428
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:14,741
If anyone wants to say something…

429
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:15,809
Yes, sir?

430
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:27,020
Let's get rich from side hustles!

431
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:31,258
Hello, I'm Kang Gyeongwan,
the master of side hustles.

432
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:36,864
I'm here today to recommend
a super simple side hustle.

433
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,467
You've done that one-won verification
when connecting your bank account

434
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,569
on your phone, right?

435
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:46,440
After repeating this one-won verification
10,000 times,

436
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,408
do you know how much I made?

437
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:51,712
<i>Delivery.</i>

438
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:54,681
I'll tell you next time.

439
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,783
Thank you.

440
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:05,259
That concludes The Quiet Interview
with our guest, Lee Joon.

441
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:06,326
Thank you.

442
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,105
THE QUIET INTERVIEW
