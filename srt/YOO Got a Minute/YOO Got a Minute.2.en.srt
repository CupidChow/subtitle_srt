1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,202
I like niche things.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,470
If it's too mainstream, I'm out.

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,605
What about this?

4
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,741
Everyone loves Marvel, right?

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,142
It was trending.

6
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,344
But <i>Star Wars…</i>

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,212
No one knows what it is.

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,149
I've never met a <i>Star Wars </i>fan
who was lame.

9
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,551
I think we might today.

10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,487
How embarrassing.

11
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,494
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

12
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:31,565
Our two guests today
are good friends of ours.

13
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:35,269
I was surprised when I was doing
a little research on them.

14
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,738
One of our guests is quite talkative,

15
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,775
but surprisingly,
a minimalist when it comes to shopping.

16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:46,180
The other guest
seems laid-back and easygoing,

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,482
but turns out to be a full-on maximalist.

18
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,616
Yes, that's right.

19
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,687
One of them is a rational consumer,
and the other is an emotional consumer.

20
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,523
Our guests today
are people we're very close to.

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,592
They're basically part of our crew.

22
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,061
-If I say that…
-Well, they are.

23
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,431
They're practically part of our crew.
That's how close we are.

24
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,532
Let's bring them in.

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,167
-Please come out.
-Come on out.

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,837
-Good to see you.
-Hello.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,873
-Hi, Sanghoon.
-Hello.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,941
Hello.

29
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,609
Please come closer to the middle.

30
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,710
Hi, Orbit.

31
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,478
EVERYONE TAKES A SEAT

32
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,381
Could you both introduce yourselves?

33
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,384
I'm Orbit, a science communicator
who shops rationally.

34
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,553
It's great to have you here.

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,889
I'm Moon Sanghoon,
and I believe money can buy happiness.

36
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:29,957
You're right.

37
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,024
RATIONAL CONSUMER

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,928
We heard from our writers
that they called you prior to this show.

39
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,432
They said you both threw
a fair amount of shade at each other.

40
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,000
I heard it was savage.

41
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:43,470
To be honest,
I'm pretty close with Sanghoon.

42
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,538
That's right.

43
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,806
So I held back a bit.

44
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,908
If he were a stranger,

45
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,678
I wouldn't have let a lot of things slide.

46
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,481
I heard you were pretty hardcore
with the roasting, though.

47
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,617
The keyword is "cockroach."

48
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,253
Did I say that?

49
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,822
-I'll tell you more about it later.
-Okay.

50
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,358
Sanghoon,
what did you criticize Orbit for?

51
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,127
I didn't really criticize him.

52
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,229
It's just that there are
certain types of people

53
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,698
I can't seem to understand.

54
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,000
You think you're efficient?

55
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,903
If you're so efficient, then why…

56
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,838
-Right.
-I did have those thoughts.

57
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,507
-You're questioning it.
-Exactly.

58
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,409
That's not even a full sentence.

59
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,345
I use ellipses to achieve peak efficiency.

60
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:29,149
Anyway, my philosophy on spending
is about optimizing efficiency.

61
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:33,053
To put it more simply,
I practice intellectual consumption.

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,855
-Intellectual?
-Yes.

63
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,090
And Sanghoon is the polar opposite.

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,927
For me, it's about the experience.

65
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,994
That's great.

66
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,498
I could get the exact same thing online
for way cheaper.

67
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,202
But to me, even the scent that hits you
when you step into the store

68
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,537
is part of the experience.

69
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,073
You say you're all about the experience,

70
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,310
but let's see if your purchases
really back that up.

71
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,913
From what I heard, you just bought stuff.

72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,981
GUILTY

73
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,217
-Stuff.
-Don't call them that. They're friends.

74
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,284
They're my friends.

75
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,286
-Don't talk about my friends like that!
-Friends?

76
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,821
What counts as a friend?

77
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,989
-I--
-Don't answer that.

78
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,057
We'll be here all day.

79
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,959
-It'll take forever.
-Okay.

80
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,095
Just to clarify,
we haven't picked sides yet.

81
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,930
-He's right.
-Really?

82
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,667
We each have to defend a guest.
How would you like to split the teams?

83
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,971
How about we split into
Team STEM and Team Humanities?

84
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,173
-It'd be three against one, then.
-I'm Team STEM.

85
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,308
-No, you're not.
-What do you mean?

86
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,911
I crunched numbers
and used Excel in high school.

87
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,579
-Excel?
-That means I'm Team STEM.

88
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,816
If Sanghoon and I had our blood drawn,

89
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,685
it'd probably spell out "Humanities."

90
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,555
It runs through our veins.

91
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,124
-So I'll defend Sanghoon.
-Okay.

92
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,728
-We're going to humble those STEM folks.
-All right.

93
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:52,266
It's time to kick off You Bought What?!
as we look at the items you brought.

94
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,333
Sounds good.

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,068
You said these things were your friends.

96
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:59,239
I can understand why you would buy these,
but you buy friends for your friend.

97
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,575
Instead of buying just one,

98
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,911
-he buys two of them.
-They're so cute.

99
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,245
These are your friends.

100
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,880
These really are Sanghoon's friends.

101
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,749
What are you implying?

102
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,185
-There are three.
-He bought sets of three.

103
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,886
There must be a reason.

104
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,289
-Have you seen <i>Toy Story?</i>
-I'm sad just thinking about it.

105
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,326
People usually only buy Buzz Lightyear
when they go to the stores.

106
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,563
The rest of his friends are sad
because they're left behind.

107
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,364
That's why I always buy the whole gang.

108
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,366
Two is better than one,
and three is better than two.

109
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,835
-This one is--
-Three?

110
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,237
-Hey!
-Sorry.

111
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,472
-Why did you say three?
-Hold on.

112
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,540
Why is everyone…

113
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,409
Three, three, three.

114
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,178
-What? Hold on.
-What is this, then?

115
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,547
-Three, three, three, three.
-Three, three, three, three.

116
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,249
That's wrong.

117
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,483
-Is it?
-It's wrong.

118
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,419
-Let me tell you something.
-Go ahead.

119
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,154
They all have souls.

120
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:51,225
When we go home,
they hang out and talk to each other.

121
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,960
-They do that when the door closes.
-It's true.

122
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,063
Toys and dolls don't move.

123
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,165
-I--
-They're just objects.

124
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,067
The only thing that moves here

125
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,235
is him.

126
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,137
These little guys only move
when we're not looking.

127
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,739
How can you refute that?

128
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,307
It's Schrödinger's dolls.

129
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,643
-Schrödinger's…
-That's quantum mechanics.

130
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,311
Is Schrödinger's cat alive or dead?

131
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,479
No one knows.

132
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,748
This is what you call
anti-intellectualism.

133
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,183
I SEE!

134
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,255
Since you claim to be a rational consumer,
I'd like to talk about this item, Orbit.

135
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,891
-It's a laptop adapter.
-A laptop adapter.

136
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,628
My laptop shut down
because I was overworking it.

137
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:32,866
It's important to ensure compatibility
with the voltage, current, and amperage.

138
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,769
That's right.
If they don't match, it could short out.

139
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,272
So I made sure to check all that
before buying it.

140
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,975
Because I brought this in today,
my monitor at home won't turn on.

141
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,343
That's so sad.

142
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,345
That's just how it is.

143
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,415
I only bought this one
because I needed it.

144
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:49,950
He's a rational consumer.

145
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,520
How long have you had that monitor?

146
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,656
I've had it for about ten years now.

147
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,691
Have you ever felt sorry for it?

148
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,161
Would you feel sorry for someone
who's been your friend for ten years?

149
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,665
But that's your friend.
Your monitor is doing all the labor.

150
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,601
It's not labor. It's a collaboration.
We're co-workers.

151
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,369
-It wants to show him things.
-Exactly.

152
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,172
You should let it rest. It worked so hard.

153
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,774
It rests when I'm not working.

154
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,075
Why do you think that?

155
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,044
-How are you so sure?
-How do you define "rest"?

156
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,545
That's a very good question.

157
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,247
How do you define "rest"?

158
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,449
Scratch that. We know how it rests.

159
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,485
Are you going to keep asking questions?

160
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,188
There's this thing called
the default mode network.

161
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,991
Our brain doesn't rest only when we sleep.

162
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,627
Are you thinking about anything right now?

163
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,928
No, I'm not.

164
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,496
THE VERY DEFINITION OF "RESTING"

165
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,498
-I was resting for a second.
-This…

166
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,567
At any rate, you need it for work.

167
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,837
It's the foundation
of all your activities.

168
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,905
That's right.

169
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,008
If your monitor breaks,
and you buy a new one,

170
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,178
you can look forward to doing fun things
with your new monitor.

171
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,714
And you can thank your old one
for helping you for the past ten years.

172
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,384
A new monitor would have a higher
refresh rate and a better display.

173
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,219
-You'd be more productive.
-Exactly.

174
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,088
-You'd benefit from it.
-I agree.

175
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,123
And more people would learn about science.

176
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,128
The human eye can only perceive
so much resolution.

177
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:12,766
A better monitor with higher resolution
doesn't make much of a difference.

178
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,103
Are you saying the people
who work for Samsung and LG

179
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,938
-are all idiots?
-No, of course not.

180
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,640
-To an extent--
-Are they wasting their time?

181
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,875
Are you trying to shake up the industry?

182
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,711
I'm using equipment that suits my needs.

183
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,749
Why would I replace
a perfectly good monitor?

184
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,951
The OECD countries…
Do you know about this?

185
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,019
OECD?

186
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,887
We're in a climate crisis.

187
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,122
A climate crisis?

188
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,424
I zoned out for a bit,
so I don't know how we got here.

189
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,092
Weren't we talking about monitors?

190
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,460
Does OECD stand for Organization
for Economic Cucumber Development?

191
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,528
Developing cucumbers.

192
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,864
Is this how you want to skip over that?

193
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,766
There's a gene that makes
some people hate cucumbers.

194
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,834
SIGH

195
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,769
Why did the production crew sigh?

196
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,672
OH, HE CAN HEAR US

197
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,308
I thought you had
a lot of affection for things.

198
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,144
-I think things need to fulfill a purpose.
-I agree.

199
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,912
That's how we appreciate them.

200
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,113
SPORT-SPECIFIC SHOES

201
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,883
-He has so many shoes.
-Do you work out, Sanghoon?

202
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,652
I was surprised by how dumb this was.

203
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,722
Who asks why you bought shoes?
You buy shoes to wear them.

204
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,390
-These are running shoes.
-Right.

205
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,659
-What are they for?
-Running.

206
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,294
Do you go running?

207
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,463
-Let me explain.
-Okay.

208
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,965
These are running shoes.

209
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,166
-Right.
-Yes.

210
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,602
-These are basketball shoes.
-Basketball shoes.

211
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,770
You can jump better
when you wear these shoes.

212
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,838
ZERO EXPLANATION

213
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,340
-You should explain.
-Basketball shoes.

214
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,909
-The cushion is important.
-You can jump higher.

215
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,978
I wear weightlifting shoes
when I go to the gym.

216
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,547
-These are recovery shoes.
-What's that?

217
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,582
Recovery is important when working out.

218
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,084
-You recover with it.
-Yes.

219
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,255
His cleats and weightlifting shoes
are all brand new.

220
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,790
But his recovery shoes are worn out.

221
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,559
-Just those.
-Have you been resting?

222
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,995
Everyone's busy and tired these days.

223
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,229
There's jelly on them.

224
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,697
-Let me explain.
-Go ahead.

225
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,533
When I was a kid,

226
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,569
-I asked my dad to sign me up for a gym.
-Okay.

227
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,304
He said, "I'll sign you up if you go."

228
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,705
BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

229
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,374
So I said, "You have to sign me up first."

230
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,010
Then he said,
"I'll sign you up if you'll actually go."

231
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,112
It's the classic
chicken or the egg debate.

232
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,613
So he never signed me up.

233
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,084
Once I started making money,
I wanted to start going to the gym.

234
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,986
And to go to the gym, I needed gym shoes.

235
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,155
-They're weightlifting shoes.
-Oh, right.

236
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,424
-These are weightlifting shoes.
-In conclusion--

237
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,660
In conclusion, your dad was right.

238
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,894
Your dad was right.

239
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,130
IF HE WANTS TO WEAR THEM,
HE HAS TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR

240
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,766
I need to lose some weight
before I start running.

241
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,634
But I have to be careful.

242
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,170
-You're right.
-I could hurt myself because of my weight.

243
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,039
But to lose weight, I need to run.

244
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,476
And to run, I need to lose weight
so I don't hurt my knees.

245
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,378
So, how am I supposed to lose weight?

246
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,446
We live in a broken society.

247
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,548
How do you quit nicotine gum?

248
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,616
Next up.

249
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:46,220
How are you going to explain this
after coming after us like that?

250
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,956
I haven't said this word in a long time.

251
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,057
Binoculars.

252
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,728
A telescope looks at a very narrow area,
but in extremely fine detail.

253
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:58,699
On the other hand,
binoculars are often used

254
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,402
when we want to observe
a broader section of the sky.

255
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,973
Since the field of view is much wider,
it allows us to see things more clearly.

256
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,175
-What do you see?
-Right now?

257
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,110
FIDDLING

258
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,780
It's too close, so I can't see anything.

259
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,148
Have you used it before?

260
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,517
Yes, it works fine outdoors.

261
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,252
Why did you buy it?

262
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,720
I bought it to stargaze.

263
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,221
Can you see stars with this?

264
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,723
Yes, you can.

265
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,994
If you're on a rooftop
or somewhere that's dark,

266
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,763
these binoculars will give you
a remarkably clear view.

267
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,867
You can see that much with the naked eye.
You can also zoom in using your phone.

268
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:37,471
There was someone in the past
who could see very well.

269
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,473
He was an astronomer named Tycho Brahe.

270
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,277
His vision was so good,
he didn't even need binoculars.

271
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:47,581
-Generally speaking--
-What if he just claimed to see very well?

272
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,516
He lied and said he saw the Big Dipper.

273
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,553
His observations were extremely precise.

274
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,489
And based on those records,
an astronomer named Kepler…

275
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:58,692
-Kepler.
-…discovered Kepler's Laws.

276
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,929
And since those laws
are still widely used today,

277
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,866
you could say Tycho Brahe's records
were extremely precise.

278
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,903
-When was the last time you used that?
-I used it last month.

279
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,506
I bought it last month,
so I was testing it out.

280
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,210
-How much was it?
-I bought it for about 120,000 won.

281
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,314
It's a great deal
if you can see stars for 120,000 won.

282
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,683
This one's a little weird.

283
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,052
I never knew Sanghoon liked this.

284
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,653
I really wanted that!

285
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,590
FIGURINES

286
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,325
You're a <i>Star Wars </i>fan?

287
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,962
COMING IN STRONG WITH THE OST

288
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,530
Do you like <i>Star Wars?</i>

289
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,599
-I love <i>Star Wars.</i>
-Why would you ask that?

290
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:42,102
He owns Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker,
so isn't it obvious?

291
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,403
"I am your father."

292
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,506
I didn't know he was a fan.

293
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,375
Name the original trilogy.

294
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,610
EYES DARTING

295
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,744
4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3.

296
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,813
-What's he saying?
-No, he's right.

297
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,216
It's 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9.
That's the order.

298
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,851
What are the titles?

299
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,721
-"The Beginning of the War."
-What?

300
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,723
It is "The Beginning of the War."

301
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,758
-"The Middle of the War."
-"The Middle…"

302
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,528
The first one is <i>A New Hope.</i>

303
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,730
<i>-A New Hope.</i>
-What's the second one?

304
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,833
-"Beware of Fires."
-"Beware of Fires."

305
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,101
"Beware of Fires."

306
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:17,838
-And then there's "Endless Hope."
-"Endless Hope."

307
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,874
<i>Star Wars </i>is a story about hope.

308
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,376
Do you know who they are?

309
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,645
He just said it earlier.
Didn't you hear him?

310
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,648
-"I am your father."
-This is the father. This is the son.

311
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,316
"Sign me up for the gym." "No."

312
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,186
"You have to sign me up first."
"You won't go."

313
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,554
HOW DO JEDI'S LOSE WEIGHT?

314
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,355
They're father and son.

315
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,991
-Did you watch it?
-No.

316
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,060
I don't like the story of <i>Star Wars.</i>

317
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,462
-Then what do you like?
-I like the visuals.

318
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,565
-You won't believe this.
-What is it?

319
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:49,837
When Sanghoon buys figurines,
he likes to buy ones that are not famous.

320
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,839
And this is what he bought.

321
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,540
-This isn't famous?
-Apparently.

322
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,078
It isn't well-known,
but everyone on this planet knows.

323
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,313
I'm so frustrated.

324
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,781
I like niche things.

325
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:01,849
What?

326
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,350
FRIENDSHIP OVER

327
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,985
If it's too mainstream, I'm out.

328
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,386
What about this?

329
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,554
-Please explain.
-Okay.

330
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,657
Start with why you like to buy
figurines that are not famous.

331
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,593
If I were you, I'd watch what I say.

332
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,495
Everyone loves Marvel, right?

333
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:20,200
Marvel helped figure collecting
go mainstream in Korea.

334
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,268
True.

335
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,404
There's always a figurine
when you go to a ramen shop.

336
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,173
A rich man…

337
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,609
He has a life-sized Iron Man figure.

338
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,411
Everyone had it because it was trending.

339
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,080
But <i>Star Wars…</i>

340
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,015
-No one knows what it is.
-Yes.

341
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,351
What do you mean?

342
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,419
Have you seen <i>Star Wars </i>in a Japanese bar?

343
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,487
I haven't.

344
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,723
Have you ever seen it in a ramen shop?

345
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,125
-I've only seen ones that do this.
-I know.

346
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,761
-So it's not in ramen shops.
-That's right!

347
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,997
I've never met a <i>Star Wars </i>fan
who was lame.

348
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,064
Me neither.

349
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,666
I think we might today.

350
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,269
<i>-Star Wars.</i>
-How embarrassing.

351
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,172
I think we met the first one today.

352
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,508
I didn't think Orbit would give us
this much grief about the figurines

353
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:05,946
because the biggest item is this one.
It's a plastic model.

354
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,381
He's going to cry.

355
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,949
Please handle it with care.

356
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,051
Sun Guard.

357
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,419
-Dagan.
-Dagan?

358
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:16,023
-I liked plastic models when I was a kid.
-I see.

359
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,128
But I couldn't afford them.
They were too expensive.

360
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,998
So I told myself I would buy them
once I became an adult.

361
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,902
But they still felt expensive
when I was an adult.

362
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,172
It was expensive when I was a kid,
and prices have only gone up since.

363
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,308
But it felt like my childhood heroes

364
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,345
would be standing in front of me
if I bought this.

365
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,447
I really needed this.

366
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:43,951
I bought it to make up
for what I missed out on as a kid.

367
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,786
Kind of like overcoming trauma.

368
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:49,356
But that's in the past.
You don't need this now.

369
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:50,691
You're wrong.

370
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:54,228
What are you talking about?
I genuinely, absolutely need this.

371
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,295
Why do you need it?

372
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,598
What's with the adverbs?

373
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,933
Tell us why it was so necessary.

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,135
It's like my basketball shoes.

375
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,637
You didn't even assemble it.

376
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,539
I've assembled some of my friends.

377
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:06,773
Your friends?

378
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,175
-What?
-You called them "friends."

379
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,777
<i>Toys and dolls are just objects.</i>

380
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,845
HE NEEDS HIS FRIENDS

381
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:16,350
Patricia set a record for key chains,
but someone just broke it.

382
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,684
-Key chains?
-Yes.

383
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,421
This is five times more
than what Patricia had.

384
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:27,594
What's wrong with buying key chains?
People buy them because they're pretty.

385
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,230
You told Patricia
that you wouldn't buy key chains

386
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,066
unless you were a prison guard.

387
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,434
He has five times more.

388
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,205
I've come to realize that
buying a key chain is a smart move.

389
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,107
-What?
-It makes you happy.

390
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,708
Take it away, Sanghoon.

391
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,077
I have a souvenir from New York here.

392
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:48,081
-And this one's from Fukuoka.
-I like that character.

393
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,217
-Hey, where are your keys?
-Keys.

394
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,353
-There are none.
-It's not a key chain without keys.

395
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,788
He's just collecting them.

396
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:57,691
-You guys don't understand Gen Z.
-What?

397
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:00,527
The most popular thing Gen Z
buys is key chains.

398
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,628
Right.

399
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,398
They like <i>mala tang, </i>key chains,
and shaved ice.

400
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,233
People usually hang them on a bag,

401
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,036
but you've hung a key chain
on a key chain.

402
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,538
-It's Schrödinger's key chain.
-There he goes again.

403
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,739
What is Schrödinger?

404
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,509
Schrödinger is the name of a scientist.

405
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,578
-What kind of scientist?
-A cat lover.

406
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,879
THAT'S WHY…

407
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:19,947
He raised cats.

408
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,416
Some say he didn't.
You don't know until you look.

409
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,184
Should I talk about him?

410
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,421
-How long will it take?
-I'll try to make it short.

411
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,724
Tell us how many hours it will take,
and we'll decide.

412
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,894
I have to start with Isaac Newton
for the duality of light.

413
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,230
Let's just say
the key chains were a mistake.

414
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,865
SHUTTING HIM DOWN

415
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,334
I got a tip. You should talk about this.

416
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,970
You use AirTags so you don't lose things.

417
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,304
-You can track it.
-Yes.

418
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:48,942
Sanghoon buys a lot of AirTags,
so he doesn't lose his key chains.

419
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,578
But he loses his AirTags.

420
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,913
-I see.
-That's adorable.

421
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,848
-I bought four tags.
-It's cute.

422
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,850
But I don't know where they are.

423
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:01,922
We went through his key chains
and found Sanghoon's AirTags.

424
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,323
It was in here.

425
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,826
-There it is.
-Are you serious right now?

426
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,928
-It was buried in here.
-This is amazing.

427
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,630
That's why you couldn't find it.

428
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,466
-You didn't register them?
-You have to do that?

429
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,102
Some people do.

430
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,538
WHO REGISTERS THEIR AIRTAGS?

431
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,506
What's wrong with key chains?

432
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,475
-I bought another one today.
-Good job.

433
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,678
The problem is
you're too stressed out right now.

434
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:25,746
No, that's not it.

435
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,514
-What did you buy?
-What's this?

436
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:30,918
I went to HIGGS COFFEE and bought these.

437
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,220
-Today?
-Yes.

438
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:34,721
What character is this?

439
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,691
It's my key chain called
"Astronaut Orbit."

440
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,994
I bought this, and I was so happy.

441
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,663
There's nothing wrong with them.

442
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,965
HE CHANGED HIS MIND

443
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,533
Let's move on.

444
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,504
When I saw this,
I told our production crew not to lie.

445
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,073
-Did Orbit…
-Oh, that.

446
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,676
…really buy something so inefficient?

447
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,910
What's wrong with that?

448
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:59,513
-It's a <i>gachapon.</i>
-That's a game of chance.

449
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,849
That's why it's inefficient.
You have to keep playing it.

450
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,652
No, playing until you get
what you want, is not good.

451
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,154
This is also…

452
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:10,757
Because of various reasons,

453
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,060
I need this in my life.

454
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,498
It reduces my stress.

455
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,900
<i>Gachapon?</i>

456
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,637
If I bought this with my own money,

457
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,106
it wouldn't reduce enough stress.

458
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,174
You stole it?

459
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,343
No, he didn't steal it.

460
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,647
Then you insert a coin, you spin it,
and you hope for what you want.

461
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,383
That's the experience you enjoy, right?

462
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,819
No, the moment it comes out,

463
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,988
my cortisol levels drop.

464
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,357
You bought that experience.

465
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,860
No, I saw the results
of my cortisol decreasing.

466
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,196
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

467
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,199
-These are pants.
-I love these pants.

468
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,835
They're nice. They suit you, Sanghoon.

469
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:57,137
-They suit him.
-They're cute.

470
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,639
Why did you buy them?

471
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,908
When he bought them, they were too small.

472
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,376
-What?
-Really?

473
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,378
You can see the effort.

474
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,013
Wait, what is this?

475
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,515
Someone made a hole right here.

476
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,984
-It's as if someone who was locked up…
-I'm dizzy.

477
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,886
…scratched their way out of these pants.

478
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,054
Yeah, you're right.

479
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:18,692
This button is the only one
that's different.

480
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,062
I tried so hard to wear these pants.

481
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,297
You really liked them.

482
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,600
Can you find something weird here?

483
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,202
-I can't.
-Is it the back?

484
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,469
There's something missing.

485
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,038
It's missing something.

486
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,006
I took the back pocket off

487
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,776
and used it to extend the waist.

488
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,711
What did you say?

489
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,080
Where is the pocket? Which part?

490
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,548
-This part.
-I see.

491
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,117
This is the pocket.
You can tell from the back.

492
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,687
This isn't just tailoring.
It's the work of an alchemist.

493
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,754
It is.

494
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:52,492
Sanghoon's pants may be called "pants,"
but you could also call it "Frankenstein."

495
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,195
He modified it.

496
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:59,533
He took off small parts
from different places to create this.

497
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,101
Did you buy these online?

498
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:02,970
I bought them in person.

499
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,204
Then how did you…

500
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:09,176
I lie down when I try on pants
in the dressing room.

501
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,611
-You lie down?
-Yes.

502
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:16,984
But it didn't fit,
so I put my legs up on the wall

503
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,119
and tried to button them lying down.

504
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,688
You also strap the ECG monitor
to your finger, right?

505
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:22,756
I do.

506
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,459
Aren't we on the same team?

507
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:26,827
Why are you being so mean?

508
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,629
-We're on the same team.
-Sorry.

509
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:29,863
Let's move on.

510
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:33,901
This came from very far away.

511
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,770
It's in a very pretty glass cup.

512
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,539
Please tell us what this is.

513
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:40,908
Ta-da!

514
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,576
What a good purchase.

515
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,645
Goodness.

516
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:50,584
I went to the North Pole
and dug this coal from an abandoned mine.

517
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,753
WRAPPING IT UP
BEFORE HE TALKS ABOUT SCIENCE

518
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,521
What country is the North Pole in?

519
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,290
Let me explain the North Pole--

520
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,625
-No. You know where it is.
-The North Pole…

521
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,428
-You said you wanted to go.
-The South Pole is

522
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:04,731
a continent surrounded by the sea.

523
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,367
The North Pole is a sea
surrounded by a continent.

524
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,470
The countries in the polar region
are part of the North Pole.

525
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,540
Did you bring this as a gift
for one of us?

526
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,608
Did you?

527
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,845
Hey, he's looking at you.

528
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:22,382
The value of this might be
about the same as Sanghoon's…

529
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,319
-Oh, my.
-…basketball shoes.

530
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,621
Those Jordans are expensive.

531
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,289
How about we do a trade?

532
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,924
Trade them for the basketball shoes?

533
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,493
-Do it for the experience.
-I'll give you this experience.

534
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,895
-I…
-It was a grueling

535
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,531
fifteen days to the North Pole.

536
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,066
-But I--
-A dire situation.

537
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,168
This isn't the experience I want.

538
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,304
I'll give you a picture of me
meeting a polar bear.

539
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,506
That's nice.

540
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,176
-Did everyone else like this gift?
-Of course.

541
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,645
Lim Youngwoong has one of these.

542
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,982
So does Jeon Hyunmoo.
That's to name a few.

543
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,684
Park Jeongmin and Lee Malnyeon
also have one.

544
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,153
Today, it's Moon Sanghoon!

545
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,826
YAY

546
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:10,063
But when it comes to sentimentality,
nothing beats this.

547
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,399
-Poetry.
-I can't hold back.

548
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:15,536
This is how humanity is saved.

549
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:16,770
Have you read them all?

550
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,372
What?

551
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,174
I haven't actually read them yet.

552
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,042
You haven't read these poems yet?

553
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,677
He's saving it.

554
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,080
As you know,
Sanghoon is a huge best-selling author.

555
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,582
As a best-selling author,

556
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:31,118
buying a book of poems
is investing in himself.

557
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:32,452
What's the title of your book?

558
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,155
<i>I Decided Not to Misunderstand What I Say.</i>

559
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:37,491
Isn't that contradictory?

560
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,659
What does that mean?

561
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:42,796
There were times when I would
misunderstand what I said

562
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,665
and criticize myself for it.

563
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:45,732
Me too.

564
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,835
So I decided not to misunderstand…

565
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,970
-I can relate to that.
-…what I say.

566
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,140
The title itself is inefficient.

567
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,910
-Inefficient?
-The subject appears twice.

568
00:22:56,977 --> 00:23:00,480
It could have been
<i>I Decided Not to Misunderstand My Words.</i>

569
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:06,687
But it's
<i>I Decided Not to Misunderstand What I Say.</i>

570
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:07,921
"I" is there twice.

571
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,957
I feel a strong sense of narcissism.

572
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:16,263
By adding that redundant word twice,

573
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,666
he's showing off how cool he is.

574
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:20,868
SLIGHTLY ANNOYED

575
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:25,272
<i>I Decided Not to Misunderstand What I Say.</i>

576
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,608
Hold on. Art can't be created this way.

577
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,276
-Do you want an example?
-Yes.

578
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:31,011
-"Ring Ding Dong."
-Right.

579
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,446
-"Ring Ding Dong."
-Yes.

580
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,315
<i>-Ring diggy diggy diggy ding ding dong</i>
-Okay.

581
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:37,951
-That's repetition and inefficiency.
-Right.

582
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,152
But a work of art was born.

583
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,955
-This example is flawed.
-He's right.

584
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:44,324
What's the title of the song?

585
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,692
-"Ring Ding Dong."
-Right?

586
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,929
The title is not
"Ring Ding Dong, Ring Ding Dong."

587
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,564
-It's "Ring Ding Dong."
-Dong.

588
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,499
-"Ring Ding Dong."
-"…Ding Dong!"

589
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:56,136
Someone else might also misunderstand me.

590
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,404
Look at this book.

591
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,307
<i>We Close Our Eyes to Kiss. </i>It's nice.

592
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,242
But what if Sanghoon wrote it?

593
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,512
<i>-When We Kiss, We Close Our Eyes.</i>
<i>-We Close Our Eyes.</i>

594
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,880
That's not right.

595
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:09,349
That's narcissism.

596
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:11,518
I'm so upset right now.

597
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:14,555
How dare someone who studied STEM
give grammar advice

598
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,857
to someone who studied the humanities?

599
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:19,927
I bet this will make a lot of people
who studied the humanities angry.

600
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,461
I'm worried about that.

601
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,430
It's a joke.

602
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:26,867
I actually bought a book for Sanghoon

603
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,803
with my own money.

604
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,438
You brought a book as a gift.

605
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:32,806
A book is always nice.

606
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:33,907
Sanghoon.

607
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:38,278
I brought a book called
<i>I Misunderstood Cockroaches.</i>

608
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,114
-Seriously? Cockroaches?
-I…

609
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:44,284
It's not
<i>I Misunderstood Cockroaches. I did.</i>

610
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:46,320
-But I--
-There's only one "I."

611
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:51,158
It's about a scientist who falls in love
with the cockroaches he hated.

612
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,727
Cockroaches are actually really important.

613
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:56,630
Look at this.
They're easy to keep as pets.

614
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,866
<i>I Misunderstood Cockroaches.</i>

615
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,636
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

616
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,373
In the final segment of You Bought What?!

617
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,342
we choose an item to recall.

618
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:12,946
Among all your items,
you can choose one that you regret buying,

619
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:16,683
or one you think you should give
to someone else.

620
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,952
You can choose one item each.

621
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,321
Have you made a decision, Sanghoon?

622
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:24,191
I'll choose the item
with the richest backstory.

623
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,959
-What?
-The Jordans?

624
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,761
No, the pants.

625
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:28,829
-What?
-What?

626
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:30,130
The Frankenstein pants?

627
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,132
-Mr. Frankenstein.
-This is…

628
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,468
-This one?
-I don't want to give it away.

629
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:37,237
-I really don't want to.
-They're nice.

630
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,739
We're missing a back pocket.

631
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,140
What about you, Orbit?

632
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:44,545
There are people
who expect things from me,

633
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,680
so I'll choose something related to space.

634
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,849
-Binoculars?
-Yes.

635
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,217
I choose the binoculars.

636
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,123
Our viewers can enter to win

637
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,894
and two lucky viewers will take home
Orbit's binoculars and Sanghoon's pants.

638
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:03,230
-Should we sign them?
-That would be great.

639
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:05,332
Could you please leave a message

640
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,101
to the lucky viewers
who will receive these items?

641
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,671
What they should be aware of
or how you'd like them to use it.

642
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,842
This little guy has a weak button.

643
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,011
Only the second button is loose.

644
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,480
The reason for that is,

645
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:25,319
this guy acted as the main button
because this one couldn't.

646
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:30,524
So please take good care
of the second button.

647
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,528
If you're left-handed,
you can't use the back pocket.

648
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:37,965
Your arm has to go all the way around.

649
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:43,937
And only people with a waist size
of 38 or more should apply.

650
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:46,974
I've walked around a lot in these.

651
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,910
I'm saying this out of concern,
but I really hope

652
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:52,946
they don't go to someone
who will cut up the pants

653
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,148
to make something else.

654
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,416
To all space lovers,

655
00:26:56,483 --> 00:27:01,755
you can take a closer look at space
just by lifting your hands

656
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:05,759
and holding these binoculars
up to your eyes.

657
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,998
May the light
from hundreds of millions of years ago

658
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,235
find its way into your hearts
through these binoculars.

659
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,737
Thank you.

660
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,205
RECALL ITEMS SELECTED

661
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,440
This is a very familiar pairing for us.

662
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:24,578
We've always gotten help from these two,
and today they joined us.

663
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,848
-How was it today, Orbit?
-I had a great time.

664
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:29,750
While I was preparing for this,

665
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,221
I thought I'd never question my purchases.

666
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:35,789
But as I was listening,

667
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:38,792
I realized I still have
more to think about

668
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,160
when it comes to consumption.

669
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:44,898
And in some ways,
there were things I could learn

670
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,534
from Sanghoon's shopping experiences.

671
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:52,673
I'm sure there's a lot here
that Orbit and Super Ryugyu

672
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,975
might not understand.

673
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:57,744
But I don't regret a single thing.

674
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:58,912
Yes, that's important.

675
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:01,615
I've decided not to misunderstand
what I've said.

676
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:02,783
That's right!

677
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,251
I don't have any regrets.

678
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:07,054
I've decided not to regret my purchases.

679
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,489
-I agree with you.
-Exactly!

680
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:10,557
I'm the best!

681
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:15,596
-I really like myself.
-I like myself.

682
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,598
-I really like myself.
-Like myself.

683
00:28:17,664 --> 00:28:20,701
-I really like myself.
-I really like myself.

684
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:21,869
A BOLD SELF-LOVE ENDING

685
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,337
I'm happy.

686
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:24,638
Thank you both so much.

687
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,139
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

688
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:29,910
I'm your cutie, Choi Yangrak.

689
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:32,379
Hello, it's your queen, Pang Hyunsook.

690
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,983
Out of all the episodes I've done so far,
you're the biggest maximalist.

691
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,819
I earn my own money and spend it.

692
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:39,920
I buy everything I want.

693
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:42,523
I don't have that many of these.
I only have 30.

694
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,591
There's a reason. It's good news!

695
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:46,860
You hope you get good news?

696
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:50,063
But 30 is a lot unless you work
in customer service.

697
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,668
I'm over 60, and it's the only thing
I've bought a lot of.

698
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,537
You don't make mistakes while drunk.

699
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,272
-No.
-What are you talking about?

700
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:00,774
You peed more than once
at someone else's house.
