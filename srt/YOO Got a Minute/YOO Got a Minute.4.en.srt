1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,569
I want to see you in that orange robe.

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,973
-Well, then--
-I just wanted to picture it in my head.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,307
No need to show me.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,876
You can wear it on top of your clothes.

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,577
This is from…

6
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,678
<i>Dragon Ball!</i>

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,413
It's Master Roshi.

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>Dragon Ball.</i>

9
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,184
It looks really nice.

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,691
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

11
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,260
You Bought…

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,128
What?!

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,130
THEY'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF SYNC

14
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,365
Your cue…

15
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,701
We changed up the set a little.

16
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,671
At the back,
we've lined up all the recall items.

17
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,176
All the recall items
our guests have given us are behind us.

18
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,679
If you enter the drawing,
we'll select winners

19
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,049
and send these items to you.

20
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:53,220
Our guests today are alike in some ways,
but different in others.

21
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:58,158
I agree. Because of that,
I'm actually looking forward to today.

22
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,826
Could you elaborate?

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,028
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

24
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,665
-When people are alike, they…
-Yes.

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,999
CAN'T SPEAK

26
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,902
Why don't you step in?

27
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,070
Everyone.

28
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:14,408
Super Ryugyu is also getting paid
to come on here.

29
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,443
GUILTY

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,547
Before we start the show,
we take inserts of the guests

31
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,883
-while they wait backstage.
-Right.

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,353
-We've had a married couple on the show.
-We have.

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,121
We've also had close friends.

34
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,693
This is the first time
we've filmed so much physical contact.

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,728
-There was some touching.
-We don't know why,

36
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,698
but someone was touching someone else
quite a bit.

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,700
-You're wearing a tank top.
-I need to.

38
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,834
EVIDENCE SUBMITTED

39
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,169
-Your body…
-Hey!

40
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,471
You have a nice body.

41
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:49,343
We're about to dive into
the spending habits of today's guests.

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,811
Let's find out who they are.

43
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,112
Please come out.

44
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,416
-Hello.
-Hi.

45
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,419
-Hi.
-Good to see you.

46
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,555
I'll move this over here.

47
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,690
-Hello.
-Hello.

48
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,826
What's this about touching?

49
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,829
-I only do that if they're worth touching.
-That's right.

50
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,198
Please introduce yourselves.
Let's start with Sukchun.

51
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,800
Hello, I'm Hong Sukchun,
the king of touch.

52
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,502
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

53
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,871
I'm Ahn Jaehyeon,
the man who's been touched.

54
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,106
Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,141
HE'S DEEMED WORTHY BY THE KING OF TOUCH

56
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,477
I really didn't want to be on this show

57
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,580
because the hosts
aren't very good-looking.

58
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,916
-You're picky about who you touch.
-I am.

59
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,250
Your standards are high.

60
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,086
Since I'm gay,
people think I like all men.

61
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,254
Absolutely not.

62
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,822
-Men like him… Seriously.
-What?

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,559
Hold on, between the two of you--

64
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,729
-I really wanted to ask you this.
-Be serious. Tell us for real.

65
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,098
-It's so hard.
-I wonder who he'll pick.

66
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,834
If I had to pick one of you…

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,736
-Let's say the world's about to end.
-Sure, let's go with that.

68
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,638
NERVOUS

69
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,540
ACTS CHARMING

70
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,475
Then I choose you.

71
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,477
What's the reason?

72
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,046
You seem better than him.

73
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,948
SHOCKED

74
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,685
We take a look at people's spending habits
on this show.

75
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,621
So, can each of you share yours with us?

76
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,923
People assume I'm the type who splurges,

77
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,125
but in reality,
I hardly have time to shop.

78
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
You're always busy.

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,531
Other than treating people to meals,
I'm generally tight with my wallet.

80
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,934
-So a friend gave me a nickname.
-What is it?

81
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,904
He calls me
"the guy who'd sue a coupon and win."

82
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,306
-Because you're so stingy?
-I'm that stingy.

83
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,408
I just don't waste money, that's all.

84
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,845
I'm pretty similar to you.
I'm not stingy when it comes to food.

85
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,748
-But I have a goal.
-Which is?

86
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,583
I want to become a landlord.

87
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,320
-Until then, I don't want to spend money.
-Really?

88
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,689
When you buy things,
they eventually disappear.

89
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,293
And without my own space,
it feels like nothing lasts.

90
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,895
I don't have a place to put it.

91
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,031
Is your current place spacious,
or is it on the small side?

92
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,099
It's a bit--

93
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,400
I'll visit you sometime.

94
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,103
-Okay? I'll help you sort your clothes.
-You will?

95
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,905
It's better if we meet outside.

96
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,607
Come on, just invite me over.

97
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,009
I feel exhausted already.

98
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:06,246
Now we'll each take a side and defend you.

99
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,215
Defend us? Did we commit a crime?

100
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,918
-We'll defend your spending habits.
-I see.

101
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,222
I immediately wanted to defend Sukchun
because we're from the same region.

102
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,492
I'm from Hongseong
in South Chungcheong Province.

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,329
And I'm from Cheongyang,
which is only 15 minutes away.

104
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,464
-It's known for its peppers.
-Peckers?

105
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:28,402
-I meant chili peppers.
-I did grow up eating chili peppers.

106
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,305
-They even hold festivals.
-Miss Chili Pepper pageants, too.

107
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,574
Jaehyeon and Ryugyu, how old are you guys?

108
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,409
-Born in 1986.
-I was born in 1987.

109
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,611
-You were born in 1986?
-Yes.

110
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,679
How old does he look?

111
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,314
He looks a bit young.

112
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,748
-Thank you.
-He looks young.

113
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,650
-Are you married?
-No.

114
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,853
SUKCHUN'S FACE LIGHTS UP

115
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,355
-Did my score go up?
-Yes.

116
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,257
We live together.

117
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,826
-You two?
-Yes, it's been 17 years.

118
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,561
That's why we--

119
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,696
You need to break up.

120
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,564
Or just come out of the closet.

121
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,068
We get that misunderstanding a lot.
There's even fan fiction about us.

122
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,669
-Really?
-Seriously?

123
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,071
That's so cool.

124
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,339
It was pretty raunchy.

125
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,675
The writer never finished it,
but they did start it.

126
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,078
Anyway, I'll be defending Sukchun.

127
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,381
-I'll defend Jaehyeon.
-Nice. I trust Ryugyu.

128
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,584
I heard you're in good health, Sukchun.

129
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,920
-He's the definition of healthy.
-He is.

130
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,155
This is black goat extract.

131
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,725
-This isn't an ad or anything.
-Okay.

132
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:29,830
I dropped by Hong Sungwoo's hospital
to say hello to him.

133
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,900
-And I had my testosterone levels checked.
-Okay.

134
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,937
-Apparently, the average is around 5.4.
-The testosterone level?

135
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,742
I figured mine would be high,
and got tested.

136
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,311
But I only got 2.4.

137
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,913
-Did you say 2.4?
-Yes.

138
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,615
-That's really low for my age.
-I see.

139
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,285
If your level is low,
does that mean you won't live long?

140
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,620
Well, I don't think that's the case.

141
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,988
It's not like HP in games.

142
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,057
-It doesn't affect your lifespan.
-I see.

143
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:01,061
So I was shocked
and didn't know what to do,

144
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,464
and a friend recommended this to me.

145
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,502
He said it was beneficial
for both men and women.

146
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,003
So I gave it a try.

147
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,072
This is a true story.

148
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,408
-I can prove that it's good for you.
-Okay.

149
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:19,346
TENSION FILLS THE SET

150
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,849
-It's great.
-I see.

151
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,784
And it goes up.

152
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,918
-What?
-What?

153
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,421
-He means the testosterone level.
-The numbers go up.

154
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,189
-The numbers…
-It makes a difference.

155
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:34,728
Jaehyeon looks healthy,
but let's see if he really is.

156
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,564
I was shocked when I saw this.

157
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,533
This is a symbol of wealth.

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,902
I've never seen anyone
take this many supplements.

159
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,770
AN ENDLESS STREAM OF SUPPLEMENTS

160
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,440
-This is…
-Are you sick or something?

161
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,575
-This is vitamin C.
-Is it?

162
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,279
I feel like I'm maintaining my health
because of these supplements.

163
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,981
How many do you take per day?

164
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,950
-What's wrong?
-It's concentrated, so it's super sour.

165
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,585
This is punishment-level sour.

166
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,587
You have to take it with water.

167
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,956
-It's a mega dose.
-This is really sour.

168
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,458
You should brace yourselves.

169
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,993
-I like sour stuff.
-Really?

170
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,294
It's on another level.

171
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,030
Be careful.

172
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,699
-It's very strong.
-No wonder you're not healthy.

173
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,134
It's too sour.

174
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,703
I honestly believe that
by taking these supplements,

175
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,441
I look younger than my age,
and I feel like it helps me maintain that.

176
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,478
They're not exactly cheap,
so it feels rewarding in a way.

177
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,914
I can afford them because I work hard.

178
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,282
Are they expensive?

179
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,484
They cost about 50,000 to 70,000 won each.

180
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,552
That's right.

181
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,721
-These are multivitamins.
-Multivitamins.

182
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,892
I also take theanine before I go to bed.
It helps reduce stress.

183
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,960
This one's for my liver.

184
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,962
Joints. Gums.

185
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,530
Your gums are weak?

186
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,831
-I look after them.
-Prevention.

187
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,800
-It's all about prevention.
-Right.

188
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,536
-Have you always been a little frail?
-I have.

189
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,139
-Have you heard of the placebo effect?
-What?

190
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,842
After I take these,
I feel better for some reason.

191
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,678
You're taking care of yourself,
so that also feels good.

192
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,348
Don't you feel healthier
when your urine looks more yellow?

193
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:06,620
What I wonder is whether supplements
are actually good for you or not.

194
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,188
So many articles say different things.

195
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:12,092
"Take them in the morning and night,
but never during the day."

196
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,795
-You know, my liver enzyme level--
-Was it high?

197
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,263
It shot up to 2,000.

198
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,132
-Oh, no.
-So I quit all of them after that.

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,237
Your eyes look a bit bloodshot.
Maybe your liver…

200
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,707
No, I just haven't recovered
from that whole pepper talk.

201
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,175
After hearing that…

202
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:32,513
This is really bad for your liver.
You can't eat all of these.

203
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,815
Why not? He takes these,
then one to fix his liver.

204
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,016
Rinse and repeat.

205
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,485
He could practically live forever.

206
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,954
-Right, I could be immortal.
-Yes.

207
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,757
-People stick plant food in flower pots.
-They do.

208
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,592
They stick them in to help them grow.

209
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,794
You want someone to stick it in you?

210
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,162
CAUGHT OFF GUARD

211
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,230
I don't know what--

212
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,332
-I'm talking about supplements.
-In that case, yes.

213
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,400
What's this?

214
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,503
-You're definitely not the frugal type.
-What?

215
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,207
You've got gym clothes
that you wear to the gym,

216
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,076
-and ones that you wear at the gym.
-That's right. I do.

217
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,612
But he wears all of them, so you can't--

218
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,582
He doesn't. He doesn't work out in these.

219
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,918
He wears it more as a fashion statement.

220
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:15,489
-Then what do you wear when you work out?
-What?

221
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,892
I wear the gym clothes they give you
at the fitness center.

222
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,162
But if there are a lot of guys at the gym,

223
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:27,267
I'll stay in the clothes I came in
and work out looking sexy.

224
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,137
There must've been a lot of guys
at the gym that day

225
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,773
if you were working out shirtless.

226
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,143
I remember that day.

227
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,413
I was surrounded by
a lot of good-looking guys.

228
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,982
Is this shirt really your size?

229
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,384
-Is it yours?
-Is it LE SSERAFIM's?

230
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,587
THE SHIRT DOESN'T FIT

231
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,822
That's what 20-year-olds wear.

232
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,059
-Sukchun wears all of these clothes.
-I do.

233
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,961
But let me show you
what Jaehyeon never uses.

234
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,196
I'm pretty sure he uses everything.

235
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,264
PULL-UP AND DIP BAR

236
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,099
Every man has one of these.

237
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,202
-They either have one or they want one.
-I don't.

238
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,770
It's a pull-up bar.

239
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,507
I want to talk about how sturdy this is.

240
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,408
That looks dangerous.

241
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,776
It's alive.

242
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,378
How do you do pull-ups?

243
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,713
It's not a pull-up bar.

244
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,083
-It's actually meant for dips.
-Look.

245
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,851
Four people have to hold it down.

246
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,086
No.

247
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,888
It helps you engage your core.

248
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,489
-Be careful.
-Seriously.

249
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,424
-What if it collapses?
-It's fine.

250
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,527
Will it collapse or not?

251
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,794
It seems okay.

252
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,864
What the heck? Look at him go.

253
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,267
Six, seven…

254
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,570
-Ten.
-That was easy.

255
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,139
-It was hard for me to keep it steady.
-Really?

256
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,041
I was afraid it might collapse.

257
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,877
This was actually a good purchase

258
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,914
because I signed up for a gym
right after I bought this.

259
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,882
-Why?
-It was a good purchase.

260
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,084
It motivated him.

261
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,853
To save on hospital bills?

262
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,254
-That's perfect.
-What the heck?

263
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,322
FOUND A NEW USE

264
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:59,026
-Perfect!
-Look, you can get a workout from this.

265
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,160
This is a workout.

266
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,262
We collect a recall item at the end,

267
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,864
-but we won't accept this.
-Okay.

268
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:09,269
I've never met anyone
who wears this at home.

269
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,537
SWIMMING SUIT &amp; BATHROBE

270
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,039
-Sukchun--
-Oh, my gosh!

271
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,107
-What's wrong?
-What is that?

272
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,143
That's what I used to wear.

273
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,613
This is what I wear now.
The one I have in my bag--

274
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,316
-It's smaller than I expected.
-What?

275
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:27,120
When it comes to swimsuits,
the smaller the better.

276
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,958
This is the kind of style
I prefer these days.

277
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,660
It has that European boy look.

278
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,829
Kind of like a boyish French look.

279
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,031
-Is this--
-This is an original piece.

280
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,433
It's from Paris, France.

281
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,303
People who love fashion
don't wear knock-offs or imitations.

282
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,240
-They seek originality.
-I don't wear what everyone wears.

283
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,643
I look for original designs.

284
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,013
-Do you know anyone who wears this?
-No, not in my circle.

285
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,982
Except maybe my nine-year-old nephew.

286
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,116
SHOULD I GET HIM ONE?

287
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,419
Do you just wear this bathrobe at home?

288
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,188
-Nothing underneath?
-No.

289
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:02,923
That's what bathrobes are for.

290
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,326
As soon as the autumn breeze turns cold,

291
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,662
-this becomes a must all winter long.
-Right.

292
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:13,000
Since I don't have any hair
to keep the heat in,

293
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,336
I put on my bathrobe
right after I step out of the shower.

294
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,940
I'm in my robe when I'm watching TV
or just lounging around the house.

295
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,943
-I want to see you in that orange robe.
-That one?

296
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,079
-Well, then--
-I just wanted to picture it in my head.

297
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,215
-Why?
-No need to show me.

298
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,150
You can wear it on top of your clothes.

299
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,686
HE'S A CLEVER ONE

300
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,290
This is from a well-known hotel.

301
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,824
<i>Dragon Ball!</i>

302
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,826
It's Master Roshi.

303
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,262
<i>Dragon Ball!</i>

304
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,098
It looks really nice. It even has pockets.

305
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,166
It looks good.

306
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,136
You said they call you
"the guy who'd sue a coupon and win."

307
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,204
I'd win.

308
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,240
But you have a lot of purchases.
This is a lot of stuff.

309
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,143
He only bought what looks good on him.

310
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,644
These are essentials.

311
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,713
-You don't need this?
-You need a robe.

312
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,748
Don't you need a swimsuit?

313
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,317
One is enough.

314
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,286
-Imagine going into the pool without this.
-Should I swim naked?

315
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,856
Who are you trying to impress
with five swimsuits?

316
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,059
-Pools are full of gorgeous people.
-He's right.

317
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,328
-There are a lot of hot people.
-What can I show off?

318
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,897
This is the only thing I can flaunt.

319
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,167
-Flaunt what?
-Fashion-wise, this is it.

320
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,836
-That's why swimsuits are important.
-Exactly.

321
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,906
I've given this next category a name.

322
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,307
Extra.

323
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,511
-What?
-Extra? What do you mean?

324
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,646
This is so extra.

325
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:36,149
-What are they?
-These are Jaehyeon's oral care products.

326
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,652
-Do you use all of this?
-Yes, I even used it today.

327
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,288
You take serious care of yourself.

328
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:44,658
People think they're very thorough
when they brush their teeth.

329
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,861
But when you floss,
something still comes out.

330
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,564
Once you're aware of that,
you can't ignore it.

331
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,033
This floss is great because it's thick.

332
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,069
-Does that even fit?
-Isn't it hard to use if it's thick?

333
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,505
You could lace up your sneakers with that.

334
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,807
When you're in a rush,
you don't have to floss both sides.

335
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,277
-It all comes out in one go.
-I see.

336
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,846
-What's this?
-That's a portable water flosser.

337
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:09,116
-Water flossers are usually big and bulky.
-They are.

338
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,319
But this pumps both air and water.

339
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,554
I see.

340
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,490
-We don't go to the dentist.
-I was honestly shocked.

341
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:19,593
I heard you brush your teeth
for seven to eight minutes.

342
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,796
Here's how I do it.
First, I rinse my mouth with water.

343
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,399
-Then I floss.
-That's the way to do it.

344
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,135
It's because I don't want any gunk
on my toothbrush.

345
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:32,172
Then I brush my teeth,
and I rinse with mouthwash twice a day.

346
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,907
It's not good to do it often.

347
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,310
The most important thing
is using a water flosser.

348
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,245
-It massages your gums.
-It does.

349
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:41,381
I was shocked when I first used it
because a teaspoon of gunk came out.

350
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,086
-You must've been shocked.
-I never wanted to see that again.

351
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,288
I've never seen
a rusty water flosser before.

352
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,892
-But the one in his bathroom was rusted.
-Vinegar water helps.

353
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,128
I care a lot about dental health too,

354
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,664
but brushing for 7 to 8 minutes
can be bad for your gums.

355
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,666
-There's just too much stuff.
-It is a lot.

356
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,636
If these products ruin his gums,
he'll take supplements.

357
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,238
He's basically immortal.

358
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,241
-Exactly.
-Do you know what "immortal" means?

359
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,077
-I've had a lot of dental problems.
-Why?

360
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,180
Now I've got full veneers.

361
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,716
Instead of wasting money
on all these products,

362
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,951
I think it's better to get veneers.

363
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,954
COUGHS WITH SHOCK

364
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,389
-All in one go.
-In one go?

365
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:25,959
Why didn't you go for a nose job
or get your jaw shaved?

366
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,595
Let's not even go there.

367
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,164
Whatever the job,
you always start from the bottom.

368
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,166
Even buildings start from the ground up.

369
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,436
I think this is enough,
but you have way too many.

370
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:41,909
Right before my grandfather passed away,
I was watching TV with him.

371
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,611
It was a show about rural life,
and that episode focused on fishermen.

372
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:48,115
When my grandfather saw people
eating octopus and squid, he said,

373
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:53,587
"If I could eat something that tough,
I'd have nothing left to wish for."

374
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:57,624
-It was his wish.
-He passed away that year.

375
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,759
So that's why…

376
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,862
-That's what happened.
-That's sad.

377
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,198
I guess these were a waste.

378
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:08,035
-I shouldn't have bought these.
-You should just use them.

379
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,470
We get it now. It all makes sense to us.

380
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,173
But if you care about
your teeth that much…

381
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,541
GUMMIES

382
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,443
Do you eat all these gummies?

383
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,779
That's why he brushes his teeth
for eight minutes.

384
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,782
Are you kidding me right now?

385
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,919
You floss religiously,
and you even talked about your grandpa.

386
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,154
So what's all this?

387
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:30,190
I brush my teeth
just so I can eat these gummies.

388
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,093
This one's my favorite,
and these are the last three left.

389
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,896
-This one's good.
-I really love them.

390
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,065
I started liking gummies

391
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,702
while filming variety shows outdoors
and during drama shoots.

392
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:45,839
I snacked on them often in the car,
and they didn't give me bad breath.

393
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,242
They also gave me an energy boost.

394
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,776
And since they're made with gelatin,

395
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,378
I considered them a health food.

396
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,614
Your spending habits boil down to this.

397
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,017
Supplements mess up your liver,
so you buy liver supplements.

398
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,620
Gummies ruin your teeth,
so you buy dental care products.

399
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,955
You even have supplements for your gums.

400
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:06,193
But you know,
this doesn't really suit your age.

401
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,461
EATING GUMMIES AT 54

402
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:11,231
If your girlfriend comes over
and sees all of this lying around,

403
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,967
she might think you're still a kid.

404
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,937
She might think you're not manly enough.

405
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,272
Well, you're enjoying them.

406
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,674
What's your favorite? Gummy worms…

407
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,409
-Oh, my goodness.
-What's wrong?

408
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:23,944
-What?
-They're so good.

409
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,712
Have more. Wait, who ate mine?

410
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,614
-I did.
-That's fine.

411
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,650
You know the king-sized gummy worm?

412
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,618
-There's only one per packet.
-That's right.

413
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,353
It's the little things
that make you happy.

414
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,357
I prefer the tangy, powdered ones.
I love that texture.

415
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,159
Do you want my vitamin C?

416
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,761
Should I eat it with the gummy?

417
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,330
-It sounds healthy.
-Sprinkle some on the gummy.

418
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,332
You claim you're frugal,

419
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,169
but everything here is pricey,
and there's a lot of it.

420
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,539
I never thought you'd ask Sukchun
why he bought those glasses.

421
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,274
That's just dumb.

422
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,276
What? Why is it dumb?

423
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,580
-These glasses define Sukchun.
-They do.

424
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,782
He's worn them for so long.

425
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:05,319
I totally agree.
Glasses are his trademark.

426
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,254
Whatever he wears,
it looks good on him.

427
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,322
SPEECHLESS

428
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,725
One pair is enough, but he's got too many.

429
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:16,029
There's a sad story
behind why he wears these glasses.

430
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,900
Despite a long and active career
spanning many years,

431
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,735
he still gets mistaken for Hareem.

432
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,072
Hareem has also had an amazing career.

433
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,841
Recently, a woman came up to me and said,

434
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,611
"You're so good at singing, Sukchun."

435
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,514
-Hareem…
-"I saw you singing overseas!"

436
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,250
People ask Hareem
when he's reopening his restaurant.

437
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,417
PEOPLE CONFUSE THEM

438
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,319
-They want to eat there.
-Right.

439
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,522
But do they really look alike?

440
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,223
-Not really.
-No.

441
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,424
So why is that?

442
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,559
-Why?
-Why?

443
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,163
It's the glasses that set you apart.

444
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,499
-That's why he's obsessed with them.
-Exactly.

445
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,635
-What's this?
-These are all glasses.

446
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,136
When I'm filming something,

447
00:18:56,203 --> 00:19:00,307
I never know what outfits
the stylist will bring.

448
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:01,542
TOTAL RESPECT

449
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,811
-Those glasses…
-Those would look good on you.

450
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,513
I bought them a long time ago.

451
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,682
-My goodness.
-Let me show you.

452
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,717
There.

453
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,052
I see.

454
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,420
Those look good on you.

455
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,856
-I could be in a noir film.
-They suit you.

456
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,994
"Today is a perfect day to die."

457
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,331
-Right.
-Go ahead. Take a stab at me.

458
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:28,202
The next item shows up almost every week.

459
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,871
-Really?
-Yes, similar products.

460
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:35,642
When we go for a massage,
we have to invest our time.

461
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,512
We also have to sit in traffic
and pay for valet.

462
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,113
Valet?

463
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,250
It all adds up and gets really expensive.

464
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,252
But these are so convenient.

465
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,722
You just put these on your feet
for eight minutes.

466
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,290
-They're cute, too.
-They are.

467
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,759
It even has a heel,
and you could get a pedicure.

468
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,796
If you could wear these outside,
I'd approve of them.

469
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,164
You seriously could.

470
00:19:57,231 --> 00:20:00,934
Strut around in these
and you'll feel like a member of aespa.

471
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,136
-Lots of references to aespa today.
-Look at these heels.

472
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,204
<i>Whiplash</i>

473
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,339
This is…

474
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,440
<i>Whiplash</i>

475
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,176
HE'S SHOOK

476
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,577
How often do you use it?

477
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,579
It looks new.

478
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,482
-Did you ask if it's okay to wear them?
-No.

479
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,851
-I've worn them three times.
-Three times?

480
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:21,688
You said they cost you 100,000 won,
so that's 30,000 won per use.

481
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:24,591
-With two more uses, it'd be 20,000 won.
-It's moving.

482
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,527
-That's right.
-When did you buy this?

483
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,662
They even heat up.

484
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,730
<i>Whiplash</i>

485
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,131
That's a tight squeeze.

486
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,467
They're not bad at all. They're well-made.

487
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:36,837
Sukchun did a nice thing
by helping out a small business.

488
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,740
He allowed them to use his picture.

489
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,142
-I want one.
-But it's a bit too much.

490
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,211
These are what you should be after.

491
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,079
Who's going to buy this?

492
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:47,781
-It's not for sale.
-It's not?

493
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,751
I just give it as gifts to people I know.

494
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,654
-The quality is pretty nice.
-Right?

495
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,155
I'd be happy to receive it.

496
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:57,925
There's another reason
why this is so great.

497
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,894
-Everyone in Korea knows who I am.
-Of course.

498
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:04,264
But when I go abroad,
people don't recognize me.

499
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,634
-Okay.
-Or they think I look familiar.

500
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:11,905
That's when I pull this out
and take a selfie with it.

501
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:13,707
"He must be famous."

502
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:16,143
"It's Hareem! It's a Hareem phone case."

503
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,881
This is the first time I've met someone
who buys things to assert dominance.

504
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,516
-Assert dominance?
-Yes.

505
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,984
AN ARMFUL

506
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,553
Press the power button. What the heck?

507
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,157
You scared me. Goodness, what are those?

508
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,192
That's so Hong Sukchun.

509
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,862
-It's perfect for a Russian mafia meetup.
-Totally.

510
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:37,364
-Where do you wear these to?
-They're pretty.

511
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,199
I've always wanted one of these.

512
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,300
Doflamingo, right?

513
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,971
In the winter,
this is all you need for a party or event.

514
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,138
-Step aside.
-It's game over.

515
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:46,940
Make way for Hong Sukchun.

516
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:51,144
Everyone's decked out in leather,
but this is the winner.

517
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,047
-Get out of the way.
-Photographers all turn my way.

518
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,016
Who are you even competing with?

519
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,919
-With myself.
-And everyone else that's there.

520
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,221
What can beat this fur coat?

521
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,357
-I'll put it on.
-The color is so vibrant.

522
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,025
THIS SAYS IT ALL

523
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:08,262
-That looks amazing.
-Look at that.

524
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,329
Incredible.

525
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:12,833
All that dust and static in winter
would have me sneezing.

526
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,868
Our country is lucky to have you.

527
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:17,871
-Is he wearing the boots?
-It goes well with the boots.

528
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:20,507
-He's wearing the boots.
-These boots…

529
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:21,575
TO THE BIG STAGE

530
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,143
Sukchun is here.

531
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,379
-Goodness.
-There we go.

532
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,181
That's it.

533
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:29,082
You don't sound so sincere.

534
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,552
You look amazing.

535
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,387
-Can I try this on?
-Yes.

536
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,122
-It's too…
-You'll pull it off.

537
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,424
JAEHYEON TRIES ONE ON

538
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,092
Look at that shine.

539
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,160
That's stunning.

540
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,328
HE'S A MODEL

541
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,963
Bravo!

542
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,299
JEALOUS

543
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,969
-Try it on, Byungjae.
-This is way too long for you.

544
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,605
All three of us are wearing coats.

545
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,307
-Okay.
-Okay.

546
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,343
SECONDHAND EMBARRASSMENT

547
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,446
-Isn't it the perfect day to die?
-It totally is.

548
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,915
Oh, my gosh. Even the weather's perfect.

549
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,552
We were joined by Hong Sukchun
and Ahn Jaehyeon today.

550
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:10,924
You're going to pick one item
to be your recall item.

551
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:15,562
Viewers can enter to win,
and we'll send it off to them.

552
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:17,297
Have you picked an item?

553
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:21,235
I'm thinking of giving away
the foot massager.

554
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:22,769
That's a great choice.

555
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,806
-I wanted it, too.
-It's clean and barely used.

556
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,708
-You liked it.
-It's barely used.

557
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,443
What should I give away?

558
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,978
Let me take a look.

559
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:33,714
They're all high-quality items.

560
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,315
Maybe the grip holder.

561
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,085
-Isn't that a limited edition?
-It's fine.

562
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,987
No one's looking for it anyway.

563
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,522
IT SLIPS OUT

564
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,589
PAYBACK

565
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:44,391
I'm sorry.

566
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:48,562
Put these on
and they'll lead you down good paths.

567
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:52,733
This is truly a rare item.
You won't find it anywhere else.

568
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,405
Whoever gets this,
just imagine I'm calling you every day.

569
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:02,209
I hope you look at my face
every time you're on the phone.

570
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,979
RECALL TO SENDER

571
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:09,550
We had Hong Sukchun and Ahn Jaehyeon
on You Bought What?! today.

572
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,585
We'd like to hear your thoughts.

573
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:15,222
After getting the invite,
I dug through a bunch of stuff.

574
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,325
There were a ton of things
I regretted buying

575
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,727
and some I wanted to give away.

576
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,930
It reminded me to be smarter
with my purchases

577
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:27,601
-and to give more things away.
-That's really important.

578
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:32,940
And seeing you two wasn't that exciting,
but it still was fun.

579
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,610
-I hope I win you over someday.
-Me too.

580
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:39,346
-I'm glad Jaehyeon was here.
-Thank you.

581
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:42,149
I also went through my stuff
before coming here.

582
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:45,185
It made me think about
why I bought those items.

583
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:49,122
So it brought back a lot of memories,
so thank you for that.

584
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:53,727
-Thank you both for coming on the show.
-Thank you.

585
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,229
SEE YOU ON THE NEXT EPISODE

586
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:57,064
Hello, I'm comedian Hong Hyunhee.

587
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,867
I'm Jasson, Junbeom's stylist.

588
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:03,070
-Why aren't you on <i>Don't be the First One?</i>
-They're a comedian couple.

589
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:05,706
This is for exfoliating your feet.

590
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,841
Can you show your big toe?

591
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,009
APPALLED

592
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,544
You've got to scrub that.

593
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:12,246
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

594
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:18,352
A mom wants her kid to wear
what she never got to wear.

595
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,721
You bought this last year
but never dressed him in it.

596
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:23,190
Junbeom doesn't wear this, right?

597
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:25,959
If I try really hard,
I might be able to wear it.

598
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,730
