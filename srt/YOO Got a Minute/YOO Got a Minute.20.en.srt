1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,171
Hello.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,641
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,711
The streets are filled with holiday cheer,

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,714
but there is one place
where laughter is not allowed.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,584
Welcome to The Quiet Interview,
where laughter is strictly forbidden.

6
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:22,489
We're wrapping up the year
with our final episode.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:28,896
So let's welcome our guest
in the quietest way possible.

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,704
Hello.

9
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,822
Welcome.

10
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,257
-Good to see you.
-Hello.

11
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,265
I'm obviously a huge fan of yours.

12
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,334
And I feel like you like me a lot, too.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,035
Yes, I do.

14
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:47,040
I really like your sense of humor.

15
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,643
-Really?
-It's the style of comedy you go for.

16
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,777
A "gopher"?

17
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,318
You mean, "go for."

18
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:02,523
That's great,
but you won't be laughing much today

19
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,392
because laughter
is strictly forbidden here.

20
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,562
Let me briefly explain the rules.

21
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,130
It's simple. You can't laugh.

22
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:14,134
If you do, you'll be sent to
the Quiet Room you see behind me

23
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,204
for a short period of time.

24
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,041
Now, you might be wondering
how we decide what counts as a laugh.

25
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:26,813
If you crack a smile,
just like you did a moment ago,

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,116
you'll hear a warning sound.

27
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:36,423
But if it's obvious
that you burst out laughing,

28
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,092
a much louder siren will go off.

29
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,605
If you're all clear on the rules,

30
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,373
-shall we get started?
-Yes.

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,713
Then let me officially introduce
the final guest of The Quiet Interview.

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,350
Please welcome Lee Junyoung!

33
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,418
LEE JUNYOUNG

34
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,053
Hello.

35
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:09,957
Hello.

36
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,726
LEE JUNHYEOK

37
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,794
What's this?

38
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,431
-Hello.
-What?

39
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,733
What?

40
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,303
-Huh?
-What's going on? Who's that?

41
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,840
But Lee Junyoung…

42
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,408
Did someone switch the order?

43
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,345
Donghyeok.

44
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,412
Donghyeok!

45
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,251
-What's going on?
-What's going on?

46
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,219
You told me to book Lee Junhyeok.

47
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,322
-Lee Junyoung, not Lee Junhyuk.
-Lee Junhyeok, not Lee Junyoung.

48
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,359
-Lee Junyoung, not Lee Junhyuk.
-Lee Junhyeok, not Lee Junyoung.

49
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,561
I said book Lee Junyoung, not Lee Junhyuk.

50
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,163
That's why I booked Lee Junhyeok,
not Lee Junyoung.

51
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,133
And the Lee Junhyuk I was talking about

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,470
was the one who starred in
<i>Along with the Gods.</i>

53
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,540
I was also in that movie as a judge.

54
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,341
"You're guilty!"

55
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,145
That's not what's important.

56
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,282
He's not the one I asked for.
Do I have to spell it out for you?

57
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,349
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,152
I asked for Lee Junyoung.
So why is Lee Junhyeok here?

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,188
What do we do?

60
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,889
I'll talk to him.

61
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,825
Slip him a cab fare
and send him on his way.

62
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,993
-Okay.
-But…

63
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,329
-Have you eaten yet?
-What?

64
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,630
-Have you eaten?
-I have.

65
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,233
-Let's grab one more meal.
-But I came all this way.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,702
-Let's go.
-Am I still getting paid?

67
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,938
-Of course not.
-But…

68
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,906
What the f*ck?

69
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,747
Mishaps like this happen
when you're filming a show.

70
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:41,949
It's just how it is.

71
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,252
Let's talk about what you've been up to.

72
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,457
The year 2025 is practically
"the year of Lee Junyoung."

73
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,594
Whether it's acting or music,
you're excelling at all of it.

74
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,363
You even won the grand prize
at the Seoul Song Festival

75
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,531
on <i>Hangout with Yoo.</i>

76
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,333
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

77
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:10,010
I figured I shouldn't be the one
trying to sum up your acting career.

78
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,712
I didn't want to butcher it,

79
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,882
so we asked ChatGPT
to break it down for us.

80
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,250
Okay.

81
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:22,155
Based on the roles you've played,
we'll ask what kind of person you are.

82
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,760
What kind of person is Lee Junyoung?

83
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,464
<i>You want to know about Lee Junyoung?</i>

84
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:37,237
<i>Lee Junyoung is an all-around entertainer</i>
<i>talented in acting, singing, and dancing.</i>

85
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,473
<i>But he's also the guy</i>

86
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,509
<i>who sat through a family meeting</i>
<i>while his girlfriend</i>

87
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,912
<i>was treated like a maid</i>
<i>and made to serve rice soup,</i>

88
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,880
<i>which ultimately led to their breakup.</i>

89
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,384
<i>Not only that, when he was in school,</i>

90
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,153
<i>he beat up his classmates</i>
<i>because he thought it was fun.</i>

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,790
<i>He was also kicked out of his band</i>
<i>when he was exposed as a bully.</i>

92
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,928
<i>After that, he lived off his girlfriend</i>
<i>and abused her physically and financially.</i>

93
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:05,199
<i>He even extorted money from his girlfriend</i>
<i>after deserting the military.</i>

94
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,202
<i>So to sum it up,</i>
<i>he's a downright sociopath</i>

95
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,205
<i>with no conscience and no empathy.</i>

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,075
That's what it says.

97
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,881
These are just the roles you've played,
but you played them so well

98
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,651
that this is the result we got.

99
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,221
We've been talking about your roles.

100
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,456
You've mostly played characters

101
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,191
-who are good at fighting.
-Yes.

102
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,327
You're a 2nd-degree
black belt in taekwondo

103
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,096
-and Special Forces martial arts.
-That's right.

104
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,799
You're a 2nd-degree black belt
in hapkido as well.

105
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,335
You also train in MMA, boxing,
and jiu-jitsu.

106
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,803
-That's right.
-I see.

107
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,472
You're practically a martial artist.

108
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,977
So, we looked into how impressive
your fight record has been on screen.

109
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,980
First, in <i>Weak Hero Class 2,</i>

110
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,749
-you fought against Yeon Sieun.
-Yes.

111
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,317
YEON SIEUN

112
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,654
You ended up losing that fight.

113
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,957
You also fought An Junho in <i>D.P.</i>

114
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,025
AN JUNHO
LOST

115
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,727
Another clear loss.

116
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,928
Yes.

117
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,964
Could you tell us about this one?

118
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:15,502
It's a show called <i>Class of Lies,</i>
and it's about high school students.

119
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,972
I get beaten up in that show.

120
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,207
-Really?
-Yes.

121
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,375
LEE KIHOON
LOST

122
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,743
-He beat you up.
-I lost.

123
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,278
In <i>Backstreet Rookie…</i>

124
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,713
I lost to Actress Kim Youjung.

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,015
-Kim Youjung.
-Yes.

126
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,783
I lost.

127
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,951
And to Kim Momi?

128
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,386
KIM MOMI - <i>MASK GIRL</i>
LOST

129
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,357
-I really liked the movie <i>Brave Citizen.</i>
-Thank you.

130
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,961
You lost to So Simin
who was played by Shin Haesun.

131
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,029
SO SIMIN
LOST

132
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:46,233
We keep showing your losses, but…

133
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,301
Right.

134
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,336
In <i>Badland Hunters…</i>

135
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,905
Thugs 1, 2, and 3 beat me up.

136
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,640
THUG 1
LOST

137
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,708
You lost.

138
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,577
RICE SOUP
<i>WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU TANGERINES</i>

139
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,147
WIN

140
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,682
You won that one.

141
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:05,385
-That's good.
-You refused to budge

142
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,020
and didn't serve the rice soup.

143
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,323
-So we ruled it a win.
-Okay.

144
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,925
Your record is 1 win and 7 losses
out of 8 fights.

145
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,729
I don't normally say things like this,
even off the record.

146
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,732
But since this is
the final episode of our show,

147
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,534
you're a loser.

148
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,381
Please enter the Quiet Room.

149
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:47,761
Even though our guest
is in the Quiet Room,

150
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,796
the show must go on.

151
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,398
Instead of Lee Junyoung,

152
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:56,103
let's welcome Lee Junhyeok,
who starred in <i>Along with the Gods.</i>

153
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,171
Lee Junhyeok!

154
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,273
Hello.

155
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,545
Nice to meet you.

156
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,247
I'm a huge fan,
and I've always wanted to meet you.

157
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,016
-I'm a fan.
-Me too, sir.

158
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,586
It finally feels like
things are back on track.

159
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:16,490
Yes, now we can really begin our show.

160
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,061
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

161
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,129
Yes?

162
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,968
This soldier keeps moving left and right.
Is this right?

163
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,404
Why isn't the game screen showing up?

164
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,506
That can't be right.

165
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:36,276
If the soldier pulls out a weapon,
it seems to work.

166
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,912
My friends recommended it,
so I downloaded the game.

167
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,583
-But a different game keeps popping up.
-You need to get the original version.

168
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,685
-The original version?
-Yes.

169
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,520
-Okay, got it.
-Yes.

170
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,422
That game is fun.

171
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,324
-Is it?
-Yes.

172
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,160
That concludes our interview
with Lee Junhyeok.

173
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,129
What?

174
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,133
I came from Gimpo.

175
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,703
That was Lee Junhyeok.
Please give him a hand.

176
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,039
Thank you.

177
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,244
Thank you.

178
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,016
Please return to your seat, Junyoung.

179
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,223
Your roles are one thing,

180
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,093
but off-screen,
you've got an amazing reputation.

181
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,797
We've heard so many stories
about your good deeds.

182
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,467
We even have someone here… Yes, go ahead.

183
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,435
Do you have something to say?

184
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,339
Hello.

185
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,543
I met him at an <i>izakaya </i>in Samseong-dong.

186
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,311
-An <i>izakaya </i>in Samseong-dong?
-Yes.

187
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,647
He looked more handsome in person.

188
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:47,714
Thank you.

189
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,783
He was drinking,

190
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,555
and even though
he could've driven himself home,

191
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,690
he called a designated driver.

192
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,963
So I got the feeling
he follows the law in real life.

193
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,400
Let's give him a round of applause.

194
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:12,172
Is there anyone else?
Please hand her a mic.

195
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:16,410
I once saw him on the subway
during rush hour.

196
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,912
It was really crowded,

197
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,482
and no one would've noticed
if he had slipped in without paying,

198
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,620
but he still tapped his transit card,
which really surprised me.

199
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,689
And when the train arrived,

200
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,525
he let everyone get off first
before boarding.

201
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,927
That surprised me again.

202
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,529
Please give him a hand.

203
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,132
You shouldn't do this,

204
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,971
but when it gets that crowded,
anyone might be tempted to sneak in.

205
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,507
But he still tapped his transit card,

206
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,343
and people were impressed
by how law-abiding he is.

207
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,911
I'm told there's someone else.

208
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,145
Yes, Frieza.

209
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,714
Well…

210
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,816
My name is Frieza.

211
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,853
I was waiting in line at a café recently.

212
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,323
Lee Junyoung walked in,

213
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,592
so I assumed he would cut the line.

214
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,327
But he got in line behind me.

215
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,230
I was shocked,
but I didn't let my guard down

216
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,866
because I had left my phone on the table.

217
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,370
So I rushed back to check on my phone,
but it was still there.

218
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,172
-He didn't steal it?
-No.

219
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,876
He could've taken my phone, but he didn't.

220
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,479
And that instantly made me a fan.

221
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:28,348
-Please give him a hand.
-He's the best!

222
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,483
Thank you.

223
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,886
Since you've become a big fan,
why don't you take a look at him?

224
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,688
-Can I?
-Yes.

225
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,461
You really…

226
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,132
-You should shake his hand.
-Okay.

227
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,504
You really impressed me back then.

228
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,439
-You're the best.
-Thank you.

229
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,874
He has beautiful eyes.

230
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,643
Thank you.

231
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,588
As I mentioned earlier,
I feel like we're similar in many ways.

232
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,090
I felt the same way
when I first met Moon Sanghoon.

233
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,492
Not only do we work in the same field,

234
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,395
but I also feel like
we're cut from the same cloth.

235
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,898
-You're actually shy, right?
-Yes, I am.

236
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,702
What's the worst situation you've been in
because you were shy?

237
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,405
If they bring me the wrong dish
at a restaurant, I just eat it.

238
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,242
-Same. I've never complained before.
-I eat it.

239
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,478
I even ate soy sauce crab
without the soy sauce.

240
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,080
Without the soy sauce?

241
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,854
As an introvert, I really relate to that.

242
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,024
-Let's move on to the next question.
-Byungjae.

243
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,760
-Let's take a small break.
-Okay.

244
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,130
We're about halfway through.

245
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,733
-Is this the only thing you have today?
-Yes.

246
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,469
Are you on a break right now?

247
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:56,970
I start filming next week.

248
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,705
-Next week?
-Yes.

249
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,386
Jieun.

250
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,989
This is our last episode.

251
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,393
So if I don't say this today,
I feel like I'll never be able to.

252
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:26,433
Do you remember telling me
that you really wanted to meet Junyoung?

253
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,269
I promised I'd make it happen.

254
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,772
This is really embarrassing,

255
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,875
but I told the camera director
I was bringing my mom

256
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,878
just so I could get you a seat
in the audience.

257
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:44,852
But when I saw
how excited you were to see Junyoung,

258
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,820
I got a little jealous.

259
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,122
I know we're just friends.

260
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,593
But I don't want to be

261
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,128
just friends anymore.

262
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,434
I'm shorter than Junyoung
and nowhere near as handsome,

263
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,536
but if you can accept someone like me,

264
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,506
would you go out with me?

265
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,544
Junyoung, would you like to say
a few words of support?

266
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,045
He just confessed.

267
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,882
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

268
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,150
-Why don't you go closer?
-Okay.

269
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:21,455
That took incredible courage.

270
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:23,991
Where did he get the flowers?

271
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,329
Will you come watch the sunrise with me
on January 1st?

272
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,842
Let's hit Hipjiro, try some <i>gachapon,</i>

273
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,243
and eat at H*idilao.

274
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,212
A round of applause, please.

275
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,184
Want to go to G*ntle M*nster?

276
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,686
Yeah, I ride the subway for free.

277
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,426
All right.

278
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,562
Let's continue.

279
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,730
I really enjoyed your appearance on BDNS.

280
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,399
You must really like Sanghoon.

281
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:10,370
-I do. We hang out pretty often.
-I heard you guys meet up outside of work.

282
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,873
-That's right.
-What's Sanghoon like?

283
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,943
He's someone who eats really well.

284
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,112
Since you know him well,

285
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,782
you know that
even though he plays that character,

286
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:24,251
he doesn't eat that much in real life.

287
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,855
Do you know the pork tail restaurant
in Hannam-dong?

288
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:28,922
Yes.

289
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:33,727
The first time we met and had a drink,
he ate a lot.

290
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:39,099
Since we're close,
I can tell you he doesn't eat that much.

291
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:41,702
I know him better than you.

292
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,704
I talked to him yesterday.

293
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:49,443
It's a weekday, so he's probably
filming BDNS right about now,

294
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,677
but I'll try calling him.

295
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:54,081
We're so close
that he's in my favorite contacts.

296
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,920
I can call him anytime.

297
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:03,090
That punk will pick up whenever I call.

298
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,226
I can call him that since we're close.

299
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:12,366
He even called me yesterday just to chat,
so we talked for a while.

300
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,505
God forbid this ever happens,

301
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,241
but if Sanghoon died,
he'd ask me to arrange his funeral.

302
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,645
-I see.
-I'd be the first one to carry his casket.

303
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,281
He's not picking up.

304
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,684
It's 1:50 p.m., so he must be working.

305
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:36,924
Should I try calling him?

306
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,294
-With my phone?
-It would be rude to call him now.

307
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,230
-I think he'll pick up.
-He's working.

308
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,139
<i>-Moshi moshi.</i>
-Sanghoon.

309
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,107
<i>-Moshi moshi.</i>
-What are you up to?

310
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:58,512
<i>I just ate and was about to take a nap.</i>

311
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,813
A nap?

312
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,549
<i>We're filming, but we took a short break.</i>

313
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,519
You're filming Hoony's, aren't you?

314
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,554
<i>Yes, I am. What are you doing?</i>

315
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:13,427
I'm here with someone
who says he's super close to you.

316
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,628
<i>Who?</i>

317
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,763
Yoo Byungjae.

318
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,199
<i>I see. No, that's not true.</i>

319
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,934
<i>Are you with him right now?</i>

320
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,569
<i>Okay.</i>

321
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,639
-Let's continue.
<i>-Have you eaten?</i>

322
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:26,874
He needs to leave soon.

323
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,076
I'll eat after this.
When will you be done?

324
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,212
<i>Me? Around 5:00 or 6:00 p.m.</i>

325
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,983
I'll probably finish around then, too.

326
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,752
-Should we grab a drink?
<i>-Yosh!</i>

327
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,988
-Okay, I'll call you later.
<i>-All right.</i>

328
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,322
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

329
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,062
-Do you two talk without honorifics?
-Yes.

330
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,131
You were born in 1997, right?

331
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,199
Yes.

332
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,003
-Shouldn't you be using honorifics?
-He told me he didn't mind.

333
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,873
Hello?

334
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,341
<i>Hi, Byungjae.</i>

335
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,978
I just called to ask you something.

336
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,915
<i>I see. Okay.</i>

337
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,552
-I'll call you later. <i>Moshi…</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

338
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,854
<i>-Sayonara!</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

339
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,665
Are you sure you two are close?

340
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,103
You got close through <i>D.P., </i>right?

341
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:32,940
Through "deep"?

342
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,243
The show <i>D.P.</i>

343
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,715
I can't…

344
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,524
This is driving me crazy.

345
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,932
You thought I said "deep,"
like a deep connection.

346
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,902
The Quiet Interview must continue.

347
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,638
So we have a special guest
who'll be the stand-in.

348
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:09,343
This person says they know Lee Junyoung
better than anyone else.

349
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,046
He's a man with overwhelming charisma
and incredible fighting skills.

350
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:17,618
Please welcome the tyrant of Ganghak,
Wolf Keum from <i>Weak Hero.</i>

351
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,360
Welcome. Please, have a seat.

352
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,698
-You can take your jacket off.
-Okay.

353
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,569
We are joined by Wolf Keum,
the tyrant of Ganghak,

354
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:39,273
a man with overwhelming charisma
and incredible fighting skills.

355
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:48,081
I've seen you on the show
and have met you a few times,

356
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,551
but I hear you're an amazing boxer.

357
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,286
-I am.
-That's what I was told.

358
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,887
I'm really good at boxing.

359
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:57,157
-Could you give us a quick demonstration?
-Of course.

360
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,227
I move like this when I box.

361
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:04,665
Okay.

362
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,567
I nailed it.

363
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,708
I noticed you were a bit out of breath,

364
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,811
but I imagine anyone who sees you thinks,

365
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:21,782
"I want to be as strong as him."

366
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,718
What's the craziest thing you've done
to become stronger?

367
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:29,823
Well, at one point, I was even eating…

368
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,160
Goodness.

369
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,331
-Goodness.
-I was eating three meals a day.

370
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,800
-Didn't that upset your stomach?
-I was fine.

371
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,902
It didn't upset my stomach.

372
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:46,807
When I went running,
I'd do about a million millimeters a day.

373
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:52,846
Is that more than a kilometer?
Actually, that's about a kilometer.

374
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:54,648
Yes, I used to run that much.

375
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,050
-Wasn't it hard?
-I was fine back then.

376
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:00,954
All right. Please return to your seat.

377
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,223
-Take the water and your jacket.
-Okay.

378
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:12,266
-Please come back to your seat, Junyoung.
-Okay.

379
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,202
Wolf Keum is so cool.

380
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,336
Yes.

381
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,772
It's great to build strength,

382
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,143
but what really matters is
putting that strength to good use.

383
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,346
This went viral,
and it kept showing up in my feed.

384
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,715
"Are you okay?
You puke when you see ugly things."

385
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,585
Why was that funny,
and what mistake did you make?

386
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:36,156
-I still don't understand that meme.
-Really?

387
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:37,991
A fan held up a paper that said,

388
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,494
"Are you okay?
You puke when you see ugly things.

389
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,362
So look at my face."

390
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,098
-Was that the full message?
-Yes.

391
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:48,468
But the problem was
how she had written the message.

392
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,805
There was an issue with the line break.

393
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:55,209
I didn't know what it was,
but I read it as best as I could.

394
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:59,179
-That's what she wanted.
-She wanted me to read it to her.

395
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:00,747
So I did my best, but…

396
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,216
How did you read it?

397
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:03,851
"Are you okay with being ugly?"

398
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,122
And then I apologized.

399
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:12,125
-You read the message wrong.
-Yes, I did.

400
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,427
I misread the message.

401
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:17,931
But so many of your fans
thought that was cute.

402
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:21,902
-Should I try saying that to the audience?
-Sure.

403
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,738
"Are you okay?
You puke when you see ugly things."

404
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:25,839
Let me try.

405
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,477
Are you okay?

406
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,447
You puke when you see ugly things.

407
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:17,524
So that happened.

408
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,497
-You really love dancing.
-I do.

409
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:24,831
What's so great about it?

410
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,901
I'm terrible at dancing,
so I don't really get it.

411
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,904
That's what I love.
People who can't dance can still do it.

412
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,873
-So anyone can dance.
-That's right.

413
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,941
I see.

414
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:38,378
Since you love dancing,
we prepared a special performance for you.

415
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:43,016
He's a former street dancer,
known for his clean, controlled moves.

416
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,753
He's getting a lot of hype from dancers
for his unique style.

417
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,021
Where is he?

418
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:49,489
Can you come to the stage?

419
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,397
Please introduce yourself.

420
00:24:57,464 --> 00:25:02,035
I'm Baestar, and I upload dance videos
on social media.

421
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,104
-Hello.
-Hello, Baestar.

422
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,772
Thanks for coming today.

423
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,674
Let's see the performance.

424
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:09,343
Okay. Music, please.

425
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:21,688
AM I THAT EASY TO YOU?

426
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:25,325
IS LOVE THAT EASY FOR YOU?

427
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:29,630
ARE OUR MEMORIES THAT EASY TO TOSS ASIDE?

428
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,900
IS EVERYTHING THAT EASY FOR YOU?

429
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,701
Thank you.

430
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,705
I think someone in the audience
was controlling him.

431
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:41,308
-That was great.
-We enjoyed the dance.

432
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,478
Our time on The Quiet Interview
is coming to an end.

433
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,747
Could you tell us how you felt today?

434
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:51,451
Honestly, this was a show
I was curious about.

435
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:52,519
Really?

436
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:56,523
I used to watch it during meals,
trying not to laugh.

437
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,592
-It was easier at home.
-I see.

438
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,763
But being here in person was
a whole different experience.

439
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,765
It was incredible.

440
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:11,238
-Vegeta looks really cool.
-Vegeta?

441
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,573
-Is that wrong?
-Frieza.

442
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,408
Right. I've never seen <i>Dragon Ball.</i>

443
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,747
This was the final episode of
The Quiet Interview,

444
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:23,884
and having Lee Junyoung here
made it even more meaningful.

445
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:26,920
I always ask guests
for their final thoughts

446
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:29,590
and never get to share my own.

447
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:32,192
So I'd like to briefly share
my final thoughts,

448
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,261
and then we'll say our final goodbyes.

449
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:37,764
We had a total of ten episodes of
The Quiet Interview.

450
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:41,134
And if you count You Bought What?!
it was a total of 20 episodes.

451
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:44,838
That means we've been with
our Disney+ viewers for around 19 weeks.

452
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:49,209
From the very beginning,
there wasn't a single easy moment.

453
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,677
It was always fun,

454
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:53,447
but at the same time, it was really tough.

455
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:56,216
I often wondered
how long I could keep this up.

456
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,686
But it also made me realize
how many people I'm truly grateful for.

457
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:04,157
The directors, writers,
and everyone here in the audience.

458
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm grateful to every single one of you.

459
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:10,030
Thinking about all this took me back

460
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:12,766
to when we started our company,
Black Paper, 3 years ago.

461
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:17,304
With a show like this,
I'm not just in front of the camera.

462
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:22,209
We have tons of meetings,
sometimes several a week.

463
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:25,479
We plan, rehearse, do table reads,

464
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:28,982
and go over things like
where to place a joke

465
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,085
or how to transition smoothly
into the next segment.

466
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,622
And after doing so many meetings,

467
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:39,393
it reminded me of my early days at <i>SNL</i>
when I was a junior writer.

468
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,228
To sum it up,

469
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:45,065
all I can think about is how grateful I am

470
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:47,067
to everyone who made this show happen.

471
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:51,038
This venue, Yeonnamjang,
has supported us since our early days,

472
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,842
so I wanted to make sure
I thanked them today.

473
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:58,679
As I said before, the directors, writers,

474
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:03,650
the entire crew,
and Yeonnamjang for providing the space…

475
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:04,718
That's right.

476
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:10,591
We couldn't have made this show
without the team at Disney+.

477
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,426
Actually, it would've been impossible.

478
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:17,731
And lastly, I want to thank our viewers.

479
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:21,401
If it weren't for your support,

480
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:24,938
-we wouldn't be here today.
-Marking it. One, two, three!

481
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,944
THE QUIET INTERVIEW

482
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:36,617
HOST: YOO BYUNGJAE

483
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:43,590
GUEST: LEE JUNYOUNG

484
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:06,880
Because of your love and support,
I was able to work and…

485
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:11,084
But when you think about it,
this show is ending

486
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:14,821
because you didn't give us enough love.

487
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:18,559
If you were going to give us
your love and attention,

488
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,295
you should've been tuning in from day one.

489
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:25,332
This show is hilarious.
I'm good at crafting a show.

490
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,969
I nail the timing for jokes,
the new bits, the running gags.

491
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,338
You think it's easy
to make one episode a week?

492
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:32,406
Try it yourself.

493
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,608
If you're going to love us,
then go all in.

494
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:37,277
Give us your full support and interest.

495
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:40,080
That's what keeps us going.

496
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:41,682
We have a production budget,

497
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:44,585
but once you pay the cast
and cover the venue rental,

498
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,420
there's not much left.

499
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:48,255
We do this because we enjoy it.

500
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:51,091
But this is ending because of you.
All because of you.

501
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:52,860
We did great, so this is on you.

502
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,062
This isn't for the people watching.

503
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,998
It's for the ones who didn't.
Yeah, I'm talking to them.

504
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:01,268
I'm stepping away for now,
but I will be back. As for when…

505
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:02,336
