1
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:04,848
Hello.

2
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:08,818
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:12,422
People who laugh a lot
can light up any room.

4
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:15,759
But laughter is forbidden here,

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:20,630
so even one laugh can chill the air.

6
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:25,936
This is a place where laughter
can make you or break you.

7
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,539
Please join me
as we quietly welcome today's guest.

8
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,633
-Hello, it's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.

9
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:33,670
Our special guest today is DAESUNG.

10
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:35,906
Let me go over the rules with you.

11
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:40,210
If you burst out laughing
during this interview,

12
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:47,017
you will be sent to the Quiet Room
you see behind me for five minutes.

13
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,720
Our laughter detection
is powered by a deep-learning AI system.

14
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:56,493
It's designed to read human emotion
by tracking facial expressions.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,332
If you so much as crack a tiny smile
or your nose flares even a little…

16
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:06,303
you will hear that warning sound.

17
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,605
When there's no doubt you've laughed…

18
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,549
our state-of-the-art system
will sound the alarm.

19
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,485
I'm curious, can you make that sound?

20
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:26,423
My vocal register doesn't reach that high.

21
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,827
That's the best I can do.

22
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:33,029
I see.

23
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:37,434
Please keep in mind what I've told you
for the rest of the interview.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,504
Could you look into that camera
and greet our viewers?

25
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,940
Hello, everyone. I'm DAESUNG.

26
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:47,644
Thank you so much
for inviting me here today.

27
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:52,415
I hope to have a great time today.
Thank you.

28
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:55,785
Since this will be streaming
on a global OTT platform,

29
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,521
could you say hello
to our English-speaking viewers?

30
00:02:58,588 --> 00:02:59,589
Right.

31
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:22,078
Excellent. Could you also say hello
to our Japanese viewers?

32
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:25,215
Hello, I'm DAESUNG.

33
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:30,720
It's a pleasure to be here with you
on The Quiet Interview.

34
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:34,758
I'm looking forward
to having a great time today.

35
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,159
Thank you for having me.

36
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:40,096
That's impressive. Your Japanese is great.

37
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:41,731
Your Japanese is bad!

38
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:45,569
It's bad?

39
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,671
My Japanese? Of course it's bad.

40
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:51,107
I'm not Japanese. I'm Korean.

41
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:52,909
So, of course my Japanese sucks.

42
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:54,844
I'll just use Korean then.

43
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:57,147
What's wrong with him? Gosh.

44
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:03,820
You know, I couldn't help but notice
how handsome you've become.

45
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:05,455
You look a lot better these days.

46
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,824
Did I look bad before?

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,361
What are you implying?

48
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:15,498
You've always looked good,
but as the years go by,

49
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,968
there's an even brighter energy about you.

50
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:21,304
It feels like I'm discovering
a new side of you.

51
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,874
Isn't one of your nicknames
Timothée of Heukseok-dong?

52
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,210
-Well…
-You've…

53
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:41,958
You've heard that nickname before, right?

54
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,428
Yes, I have.

55
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,330
Your fans call you that.

56
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:50,700
I actually gave myself that nickname.

57
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,136
When I was on <i>GYM JONG KOOK,</i>

58
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,138
I mentioned I got a perm

59
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:58,608
because I wanted to look like
Timothée Chalamet.

60
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:01,745
The only other person I know

61
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,282
who claims to look like
Timothée Chalamet is O3ohn.

62
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,785
I'm sure many of you have seen DAESUNG
over the years.

63
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,654
Doesn't he look more handsome now?

64
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:20,430
Make some noise if you agree!

65
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,867
Yeah.

66
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,677
I've been watching <i>ZIP DAESUNG.</i>
How long have you been doing it?

67
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:37,314
I started that channel around April 2024,
so it's been over a year.

68
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,381
I see.

69
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,483
I also have a channel, so I'm curious.

70
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,286
How long does it take
to film, edit, and upload a video?

71
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:45,622
-It takes about two weeks.
-Two weeks.

72
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:49,292
Since The Quiet Interview
is uploaded on an OTT platform,

73
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,461
there's usually a gap of a few months

74
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:55,031
between the filming date
and the release date.

75
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:56,700
So please keep that in mind

76
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:59,369
-as we talk about your recent updates.
-Okay.

77
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:04,641
Our viewers may think it's old news,
but we ask them to factor in the delay.

78
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,509
Let's mention what you've been up to.

79
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,980
You debuted on the survival show
<i>BIGBANG: The Beginning.</i>

80
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,648
Please tell us how you feel.

81
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:14,651
The survival show?

82
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:16,920
You debuted through
<i>BIGBANG: The Beginning--</i>

83
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:18,622
That was in 2006.

84
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:22,392
There's a bit of a gap
between filming and uploading.

85
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,061
Okay, so the gap is 20 years.

86
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:28,298
Just thinking about it
makes my heart race.

87
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,300
I worked really hard.

88
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:33,570
I poured everything I had

89
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:38,241
into making my dream come true.

90
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:44,548
-He's a master of the Finger Pistol.
-Finger Pistol.

91
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:48,618
After all that hard work,
you finally made an incredible debut.

92
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:52,222
You were never really at risk
of getting eliminated, were you?

93
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,992
My skills were still lacking,

94
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:59,496
but thankfully,
people saw me in a positive light.

95
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:03,533
Because of that, a lot of people
wanted to move forward with me.

96
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,402
Say a few words to the G*MTV viewers

97
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,003
who have supported you.

98
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,838
Is this going on G*MTV?

99
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,978
This is going on Disney+,
but <i>BIGBANG: The Beginning </i>aired on G*MTV.

100
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:19,482
It's been a while since I last greeted
the G*MTV viewers…

101
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:36,833
You've got such a great personality,
so I doubt this bothers you,

102
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,703
but it does seem like
you got the short end of the stick.

103
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:43,873
The other members in your group
are only a year older than you,

104
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,711
but even as you get older,
that one-year age gap never goes away.

105
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:50,347
So we wanted to do
something special today.

106
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,682
We're giving 36-year-old DAESUNG

107
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:58,421
a moment to talk to G-Dragon and Taeyang
from when they were 20.

108
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:02,158
Guess what, Jiyong and Youngbae?

109
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:06,997
A lot of people say
you guys are only a year older than me,

110
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:11,801
but you treat me
like I'm ten years younger.

111
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:15,438
Seeing how talented you both are,
I get why you treat me like that.

112
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:19,009
But no matter how old we get
or what the age gap is,

113
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:21,845
I know we'll respect
and care for each other

114
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:24,347
as we keep working together.

115
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:29,553
To 20-year-old Jiyong and Youngbae,
please look after 19-year-old DAESUNG.

116
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:30,620
Okay.

117
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:34,024
I'm actually the same age
as Jiyong and Youngbae.

118
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,928
Do you remember eating together
when we were at the same agency?

119
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,233
You don't remember. You forgot.

120
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,102
No, I remember there was a waterfall.

121
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,239
And we sat at those wooden tables.

122
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:51,708
-How could you forget?
-I didn't.

123
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:55,979
We greeted each other
and said we should be friends.

124
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,581
If you had any respect for me,

125
00:08:57,647 --> 00:09:01,618
you would've thought about this
before you met me today.

126
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:04,821
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing this is for me right now?

127
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:10,193
Try to remember me. Ready, set, go.

128
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,330
-It was back--
-Try harder.

129
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:18,001
It was back in 2000,
when the old YG building had just opened.

130
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:22,439
The cafeteria was always packed,
and the food was--

131
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:28,345
I don't get why this is so hard for you.
Keep thinking till your brain hurts.

132
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:35,185
The truth is,
this is my first time meeting you.

133
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:40,390
We were at the same agency
for quite a long time,

134
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:43,760
but we've only ever seen each other
through the media.

135
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,762
It's our first time meeting in person.

136
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:54,304
Let's jump straight into the interview.

137
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,839
Earlier this year,

138
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:59,075
-you released your solo album, <i>D's WAVE.</i>
-That's right.

139
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,778
How was it working solo
instead of in a group?

140
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,847
What did you want to convey in your music?

141
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:07,817
I've been performing in Japan
for about 11 years.

142
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:08,885
That's a long time.

143
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:12,956
I used to have a strong fear
of performing on stage.

144
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:14,791
The Korean market felt intimidating.

145
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,693
-Really?
-Yes.

146
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,664
So I was a bit pessimistic
about this album.

147
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,634
But after seeing my Japan tour,
the CEO of my agency said

148
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,871
he wanted to make it happen
and would take full responsibility for it.

149
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:31,841
And that's what gave me the courage
to release this album in Korea.

150
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:36,913
I tried to fill this album with upbeat,
refreshing music that lifts your mood.

151
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,048
-In <i>D's WAVE.</i>
-Yes.

152
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:40,283
When you first started playing the drums,

153
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,688
I figured it was just for the fans,
but you've kept it up for a long time.

154
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:48,158
I haven't been consistent with it,
but it's been about 8 to 10 years.

155
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:51,995
Some songs, especially heavy metal ones,
are tough to play on the drums.

156
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:55,265
How advanced would you say
your drumming level is?

157
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:58,268
The reason I record myself
playing the drums is that

158
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:01,037
once I learn a song
and move on to the next one,

159
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:04,741
-I completely forget the previous one.
-I can see how that'd happen.

160
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,576
That's why I record myself.

161
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,378
Can you play Davichi's <i>8282?</i>

162
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:10,914
Yes, I can.

163
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,482
-You can keep up?
-Yes.

164
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:13,550
-Really?
-Yes.

165
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:14,918
That's impressive.

166
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,688
Most people…

167
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:26,062
tend to pick up the guitar or piano.
What made you choose the drums?

168
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,198
Well…

169
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:32,035
I'm sorry, but I can't get the song <i>8282</i>
out of my head.

170
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:35,972
Even though it starts off slow,
the beat really picks up later.

171
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,311
I used to go to many different churches,

172
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:44,381
and there was a drummer
in one of the youth groups

173
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:45,882
who looked really cool.

174
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,184
But I couldn't learn the drums right away.

175
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,920
It was only after my debut,

176
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:53,557
when things were more stable,
that I finally started.

177
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,092
I see. People who play the drums
look really cool.

178
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,463
When they're up on stage, all sweaty,
they just look so sexy.

179
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,366
Excuse me. We need to do a quick touch-up.

180
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,434
Okay.

181
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,827
-Unfortunately, you…
-Is it over?

182
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:33,063
Please go to the Quiet Room
for five minutes.

183
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,131
-Hold on.
-You need to leave.

184
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:37,300
He's obviously not the makeup artist.

185
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,772
I knew this was coming,
but it still made me laugh.

186
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,274
This is crazy.

187
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:47,611
-Is there something hiding in here?
-No, just take a seat.

188
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,213
We'll let you out after five minutes.

189
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,916
He's the only guest we have today,

190
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:57,854
but since he's stuck in the Quiet Room
and the interview has to go on,

191
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:00,023
we brought someone to fill in for him.

192
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,661
-Fill in for me?
-We couldn't just invite anyone,

193
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:08,298
so we brought in two A-listers
who have a very close relationship

194
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:11,401
-with DAESUNG.
-Who else is here?

195
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:14,371
These are the guys
who served in the military with DAESUNG.

196
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:16,306
People call them the "Military Bang."

197
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,208
-Joowon, Beenzino.
-Joowon?

198
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,277
Ko Kyoungpyo and Dong Youngbae.

199
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:22,112
The lineup is incredible.

200
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,581
-Who among them will be joining us?
-Seriously?

201
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,650
Let's give them a big round of applause.

202
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:32,022
For real?

203
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:34,090
Who is that?

204
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,192
Is that Ko Youngbae?

205
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:39,663
That's a different Youngbae.

206
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,865
One moment, please. Donghyeok!

207
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:47,904
He's the wrong Youngbae.

208
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,039
What happened?

209
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:51,675
What's going on?

210
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:55,478
I asked you to book
Ko Kyoungpyo and Dong Youngbae.

211
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,115
So why is Ko Youngbae here?

212
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:01,685
He must've mixed the two names together.

213
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,155
We didn't have the budget
to invite both of them,

214
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:07,357
so we just booked Ko Youngbae.

215
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:08,725
You call that an excuse?

216
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:10,927
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:12,963
What do we do?

218
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:15,098
Why would you book Ko Youngbae?

219
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:16,633
Isn't it close enough?

220
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:19,736
This is ridiculous.

221
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,138
Okay, I'll keep going.

222
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,009
Please have a seat.

223
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:30,247
Thank you for coming.
You can take a seat on the couch.

224
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:35,118
Welcome. Thank you so much
for taking the time to join us.

225
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:44,160
I've always wanted to ask you this.
With BIGBANG'S 20th anniversary coming up,

226
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:47,831
can you give us a hint
about what you're planning for next year?

227
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,736
As many fans already know,

228
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:56,640
it's been 20 years since Jiyong, DAESUNG,
and I started out together.

229
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,742
We've been getting a lot of attention.

230
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:02,212
Next year, since our fans
have been waiting for so long…

231
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,114
The audacity. I've never even met him.

232
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,350
…we're planning street performances
and meet-and-greets…

233
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,953
-I see.
-…so we can be closer to them.

234
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,155
Hold on. Am I allowed to talk?

235
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:15,225
-So you plan to hold meet-and-greets.
-Yes.

236
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:18,995
DAESUNG said
he wanted to wear a face chain.

237
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,330
-At the fan event?
-Yes.

238
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:23,099
It seemed like a good idea,
so we're talking it over.

239
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,734
That's great.

240
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,805
I heard DAESUNG is planning
a concert next year.

241
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:30,373
Well…

242
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,311
January 3rd and 4th.

243
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:37,113
-Yes, in January.
-The 3rd and the 4th.

244
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,316
-It'll be on January 3 and 4.
-January 3 and 4.

245
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:43,520
He asked me and Jiyong
to come and support him.

246
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:47,090
Excellent. Ko Kyoung… I mean, Ko Youngbae,

247
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:50,193
I heard you have an anecdote
from when you served with DAESUNG.

248
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:52,729
My brother DAESUNG…

249
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:55,332
I'm his brother now? What's with that guy?

250
00:15:55,398 --> 00:16:00,170
My brother DAESUNG and I
lived in the same dorm when we served.

251
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:02,205
-Dorm?
-That doesn't sound right.

252
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:05,342
-Dorm?
-Sorry, I meant living quarters.

253
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:10,580
It's actually called the barracks.

254
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,716
All right, the five minutes are up.

255
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:16,486
Thank you so much for your time today.
Please go back to your seat.

256
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:18,488
-But--
-Thank you.

257
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:21,358
-But I--
-Thank you so much.

258
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:25,962
-See you next time. Thank you.
-But I didn't even shake his hand.

259
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,631
-Sorry about that.
-He left?

260
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:28,698
Yes.

261
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:31,201
How did you end up
with a different Youngbae?

262
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:33,303
SORAN has a new album coming out soon,

263
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,673
-so we can look forward to that.
-That's right.

264
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,441
-I'm rooting for you guys.
-Okay.

265
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:41,011
I remember watching
a very interesting interview.

266
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:44,014
You described singing
as a form of excretion.

267
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:48,652
-Yes, I think it was on <i>LeeMujin Service.</i>
-That's right.

268
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,654
That's where I said that.

269
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,424
That rush you get after singing…
It's like letting one out.

270
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:01,998
-So it's like dumping out the harmonies.
-That's right.

271
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,534
He just squirted.

272
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:06,536
-What did you say?
-I mean the seeds.

273
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,976
-Look at those seeds.
-I see.

274
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,612
-The seeds are everywhere.
-He squirted them.

275
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,551
Excretions come in all sorts of forms,

276
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:24,654
depending on their consistency
and texture.

277
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:28,425
Could you use that metaphor to describe
some of the songs you've released,

278
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,694
either by yourself or with BIGBANG?

279
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,497
For instance, some songs
bind BIGBANG together so firmly,

280
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,666
they're like a solid piece of poop.

281
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,837
And then there are songs
that just explode, kind of like diarrhea.

282
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,138
<i>BANG BANG…</i>

283
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,575
<i>-BANG.</i>
-Yes.

284
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:46,910
-It's <i>BANG BANG BANG.</i>
-Yes.

285
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:48,778
What's that song like?

286
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:52,082
It's like you feel gassy inside,

287
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:55,352
and as soon as you sit on the toilet,
a whole symphony comes out.

288
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:56,820
Like fireworks exploding.

289
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,089
-It's like--
-It's like instant relief.

290
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,625
<i>BANG BANG BANG.</i>

291
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,527
-Bang, bang, bang.
-Yes, like that.

292
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:11,902
I heard you're quite a homebody
and watch a lot of anime like <i>One Piece.</i>

293
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:13,503
I used to…

294
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,106
One, two, Finger Pistol!

295
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,347
So…

296
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:28,952
This is a big topic of discussion
among <i>One Piece </i>fans.

297
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,255
If the Four Emperors fought the Admirals,
who would win?

298
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,526
The Emperor…

299
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:40,964
The Four Emperors wouldn't stand a chance.
Fujitora could take them down by himself.

300
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,666
Shanks could wipe him out.

301
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:45,335
No, he couldn't. He just looks cool.

302
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:47,304
-No way.
-He just has a lot of fans.

303
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,173
An Admiral is basically like
a US Navy Admiral.

304
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,109
If they had to fight pirates
in small fishing boats--

305
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,644
They're not small fishing boats.

306
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:59,382
It's about whether
they're official government forces or not.

307
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,819
It's not about who's official.
It's about who's stronger.

308
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:03,954
Admirals are stronger.

309
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,957
You can't say they're stronger.
They're officially recognized.

310
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:11,761
The Navy Admirals are basically like
the Secretary of Defense.

311
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:15,198
No, I get it. It doesn't matter
if they're the Secretary of Defense.

312
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:18,235
We're talking about <i>One Piece </i>right now.

313
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:22,372
Think about why Eiichiro Oda
took Shanks's arm early on.

314
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,807
He didn't know he'd be famous.

315
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:26,409
No, it would've been too easy
if he had two arms.

316
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:27,878
He would've killed everyone.

317
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:30,380
-Navy Admirals get full benefits.
-Who cares?

318
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:33,583
Shanks lost an arm,
but it wasn't covered by insurance.

319
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,318
Admirals have a more stable job.

320
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,687
That's true.
They get a paycheck every month.

321
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,056
You learn with age
that money gives you power.

322
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:43,426
But think about it.
Shanks could steal the money.

323
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,464
Let's say Shanks is in a bad mood.

324
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:52,135
He could walk up to an Admiral and say,
"Give me all your money,"

325
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:54,971
and they'd have no choice
but to hand it over.

326
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,306
Wait.

327
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:59,542
-Don't do that with a pineapple!
-One, two, Finger Pistol!

328
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,020
-It's a face.
-He made eyes.

329
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:14,891
We'll conclude the <i>One Piece </i>debate here.

330
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,228
You're watching The Quiet Interview,
the classiest talk show around.

331
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:20,664
Some people
have come a long way to be here.

332
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,668
If you have anything to say to DAESUNG,
here's your chance.

333
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,069
Please raise your hand.

334
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:27,971
Go ahead, Master of Finger Pistol.

335
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:32,075
Hello, I'm Kim Jangjin,
the master of Finger Pistol.

336
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:35,478
There's a man who made it into
the Guinness Book of Records

337
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:39,149
by piercing a coconut with his finger.

338
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,851
As a disciple of the Finger Pistol,

339
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:45,021
I will continue to train
until I can pierce a coconut.

340
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:46,089
Finger Pistol!

341
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:49,226
-But…
-That has nothing to do with DAESUNG.

342
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:54,631
You should try the Finger Pistol sometime.

343
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:55,699
-What?
-What?

344
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,668
-You should try it.
-The Finger Pistol?

345
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:08,945
If anyone else has something to say,
please go ahead.

346
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:13,450
<i>I can't, baby, don't stop this</i>
<i>Just go wild today</i>

347
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:17,287
<i>Go crazy and rave</i>

348
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:22,726
<i>Wow, fantastic, DAESUNG</i>

349
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,062
Hello.

350
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:29,232
I'm such a big fan of yours
that I dress like this all the time

351
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:30,600
People call me your twin.

352
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:34,170
I feel a real connection with you
because we were both born in 1989.

353
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:36,306
And I have a friend called "Latino."

354
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:38,675
-What?
-His real name is Choi Hyeongryeol.

355
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,510
We go to the same church.

356
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:43,513
I've heard so much about you.
I feel like we're already friends.

357
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,116
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

358
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:48,919
Hello?

359
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:52,422
My car? Okay, I'll move it right away.

360
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,024
Sorry, I need to move my car.

361
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,959
-Where did you park it?
-In the basement.

362
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:57,394
Please come back soon.

363
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:18,548
-I moved it.
-Thank goodness.

364
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,250
I'm glad that's settled.

365
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,485
Do you have anything you want to show us?

366
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:25,822
-My dream was also to become a singer.
-I see.

367
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:29,793
So I'd like to get DAESUNG's opinion
to see if I have any potential.

368
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:32,229
I want to put my skills to the test.

369
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:35,632
I'll show you Greg from <i>Superstar K</i>

370
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:39,469
singing <i>I Miss You</i>
while swimming with DAESUNG.

371
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:46,776
<i>The memories of loving you like crazy</i>

372
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:48,645
<i>Those memories</i>

373
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:53,717
<i>Are searching for you</i>

374
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:57,420
<i>But I can no longer keep you captive</i>

375
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:00,957
<i>In the name of love anymore</i>

376
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:04,594
Okay.

377
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:08,965
DAESUNG and I got hungry after our swim,

378
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:12,302
so we went to L*tteria
and sang <i>I Miss You </i>there.

379
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:15,038
<i>The memories of loving you like crazy</i>

380
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:18,508
<i>Those memories are searching for you</i>

381
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,510
Great, the fries are ready.

382
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:33,089
You have to go back to the Quiet Room
because you laughed a bit too hard.

383
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:35,992
Hold on. I thought we were done.

384
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,029
Whatever the case,
you still have to go to the Quiet Room.

385
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,297
Again?

386
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,933
Do I really have to do this again?

387
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,069
Youngbae!

388
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,705
Ko Youngbae?

389
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:49,906
Youngbae!

390
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:53,043
He's still here? I'm sure he left.

391
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,978
-He's still here?
-Thank you.

392
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:56,446
Why is he still here?

393
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:57,781
Please have a seat.

394
00:23:58,348 --> 00:23:59,482
He's still here.

395
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:04,354
You'll have to fill in for DAESUNG
while he is in the Quiet Room.

396
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:06,790
Did you want to say something to DAESUNG?

397
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:11,127
I showed him everything I prepared,
but he didn't give me any feedback.

398
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:12,329
-I see.
-Yes.

399
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:15,532
Tell us what you think.
Does he have potential?

400
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,168
How would he know? He didn't see anything.

401
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,236
Well…

402
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:22,405
He has beautiful eyes.

403
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,241
-Right.
-They're beautiful.

404
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:27,644
But I think he should've left out
the bit about the fries.

405
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:31,014
You think he should've stopped
at the swimming part.

406
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:33,850
That's right.
I'm really sorry, but could you tell me

407
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:36,319
if I'm Ko Kyoungpyo
or Dong Youngbae right now?

408
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:39,322
You need to tell me so I know how to talk.

409
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:40,457
Aren't you Ko Youngbae?

410
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:42,893
-Let's pretend you're DAESUNG.
-DAESUNG?

411
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:46,963
-It's too much.
-What's happening?

412
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:48,932
This is too much.

413
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:53,069
-Please come with me.
-I was just about to go home.

414
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:54,804
-Are we switching?
-No.

415
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:57,574
-We'll both be stuck in here?
-Please come this way.

416
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:59,309
I just met him today.

417
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,545
-This is…
-Hello.

418
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:04,281
Let's continue.
Master of Finger Pistol, please come up.

419
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:07,317
I'm a huge fan.

420
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,854
-Didn't think we'd meet in here.
-I know.

421
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:13,790
-I've heard you on the radio a lot.
-Really?

422
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:16,826
Please give us a brief introduction.

423
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:21,565
I'm Kim Jangjin
from Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.

424
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:22,966
Hello, Jangjin.

425
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:26,236
Could you tell us
what makes Finger Pistol so special?

426
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:30,040
When life gets stressful,

427
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:33,877
Finger Pistol helps blow off some steam.

428
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:37,881
But the downside is
you might hurt your finger.

429
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,317
Isn't that obvious?

430
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:43,954
I didn't know that.
Have you ever injured yourself?

431
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:47,824
I once tried the Finger Pistol
on a watermelon and got hurt.

432
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:50,427
-That injury lasted a while.
-Oh, dear.

433
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,062
And it cost me some money too.

434
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,863
I'm sure it wasn't cheap.

435
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,032
Do you have a Disney+ account?

436
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:58,235
I have to make one.

437
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,245
That's all the time we have for today.
Thank you. You can go back now.

438
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:10,480
The five minutes are up.

439
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:13,950
-Can I leave, too?
-Yes, you can both come out.

440
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:18,722
I'm sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

441
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:20,156
It's time for you to leave.

442
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:22,492
-Is he going home now?
-Yes, he is.

443
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,427
-Good luck, SORAN.
-Good luck.

444
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:25,495
All right.

445
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:28,298
We've now wrapped up
the audience interviews,

446
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:31,668
but if anyone else has something to say,
please go ahead.

447
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:33,303
You're handsome!

448
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:37,007
Who are you talking about?

449
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:39,910
I'm pretty sure it's not DAESUNG.

450
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:43,213
But Byungjae isn't handsome either.

451
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,549
No, Byungjae is better.

452
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:48,318
He's short,
so he can sit in economy comfortably.

453
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:49,619
Super practical.

454
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,155
If we're talking practicality,
it's DAESUNG.

455
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:54,791
His eyes are small,
so it's hard for dust to get in.

456
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:56,560
That's a survival advantage.

457
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:59,429
It all goes in
through that big nose anyway.

458
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:03,300
A big nose means better lung capacity.
That's why he sings so well.

459
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:07,337
If that logic holds, Shin Hyunjoon
would be the best vocalist in Korea.

460
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:11,207
Why did Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla go
to war? They wanted to claim the center.

461
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:15,345
Since the nose is the center of the face,
having a big one is a blessing.

462
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:17,814
What good is a small country
with a huge capital?

463
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:21,985
Look at Byungjae.
You need plenty of real estate to prosper.

464
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:25,722
Byungjae's got plenty of land,
but it's all wasteland.

465
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,526
You could fit Cha Eunwoo and Byeon Wooseok
on each cheek and still have room left.

466
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:31,962
That's enough.

467
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:36,032
It feels like this turned into
a bit of a heated debate,

468
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:38,702
-but we each have our own charm.
-Of course.

469
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:41,605
I've never been insecure about my looks.

470
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:46,109
-Have you?
-No, I haven't.

471
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,248
This episode will go up around the time
the college entrance exam ends.

472
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:55,352
Could you give a congratulatory message
to those who did well on the exams?

473
00:27:55,418 --> 00:27:57,988
You've all worked so hard.

474
00:27:58,054 --> 00:28:03,093
So take some time to relax,
let go of the stress, and recharge.

475
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,298
Then keep moving forward
toward the future that's waiting for you.

476
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,600
Could you do another
for those who didn't do well?

477
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,102
-A congratulatory message?
-Yes.

478
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,104
-To comfort them?
-Yes.

479
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,906
Let's see.

480
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:20,944
I don't see this as a failure at all.

481
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:25,649
It's all about how you take it.
You can use this as fuel to grow.

482
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:28,151
So don't beat yourself up or lose hope.

483
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:32,255
I hope you all achieve the results
you're aiming for. Good luck.

484
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:34,457
Could you say something
to Japanese students?

485
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:39,996
There may be many challenges,
but this isn't the end.

486
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:43,934
So don't give up. Keep moving forward.

487
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,703
If you stay persistent
and work toward your dreams,

488
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,408
I believe you'll reach them
and achieve great things.

489
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:52,609
Good luck.

490
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:54,611
Your Japanese is good.

491
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:06,089
All right, that wraps up today's show
with our very special guest, DAESUNG.

492
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,658
I'd like to ask you
for your final thoughts.

493
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:11,061
I had so much fun today.

494
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,630
Since there's a bit of a delay
before this goes up,

495
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:17,000
I had the chance to greet the viewers
who watched our show on G*MTV.

496
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:21,671
-You got to greet them.
-It's been a while.

497
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:27,944
It was such an honor to greet them again.

498
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:32,082
And thank you for all the questions
that made me reflect on my life.

499
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:38,054
My encore tour is set for January 3 and 4,
so I'll be getting ready for that.

500
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:41,625
I'm sure our viewers will be very happy
to hear about your tour.

501
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:43,360
