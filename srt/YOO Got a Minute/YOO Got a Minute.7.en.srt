1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,769
I can't believe you own this.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:07,140
Since I enjoy drinking,
I hang it up in my bar at home.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,609
It's for decoration.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,776
Where did you get it?

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,079
Did you take this from a gas station?

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,581
…inspired me to give it a shot.

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,016
How are you using this now?

8
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,185
I currently use it as a plant stand.

9
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,419
It's so useless.

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,860
YOU BOUGHT WHAT?!

11
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:33,233
Today's guests are charming and handsome,
the kind you'd want to take after.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,969
But they're both a bit weird.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,506
I always knew
one of them was a bit quirky.

14
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:44,444
The other one seemed normal,
but it turns out he's got his quirks too.

15
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,847
You've seen the thumbnail,
so let's bring them out.

16
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,482
-Come on out!
-Already?

17
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,750
Hello.

18
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,817
GUESTS ENTER

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,053
-That cart goes over here.
-Over here?

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,588
REVERSE

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,058
We have Kim Daeho and Roy Kim with us.
Please introduce yourselves.

22
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,827
I'm Kim Daeho. I quit my old job
and am a TV personality.

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,196
-Welcome.
-Hello.

24
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,630
KIM DAEHO
A MINIMALIST

25
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,867
I'm Roy Kim, and I'm a singer.
It's good to be here.

26
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,268
Welcome.

27
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,736
ROY KIM
A MAXIMALIST

28
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:14,141
This show is all about taking a look at
people's spending habits.

29
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,043
How do you spend your money?

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,445
I don't usually buy many things.

31
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,682
I'm not the type to spend a lot

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,051
when it comes to fashion
or non-essentials.

33
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,752
I only buy things I need.

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,388
-So--
-I'm sorry, but is that rice?

35
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,524
A WHITE STAIN

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,326
-That's a first.
-That's rice.

37
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,595
-It's not rice.
-It may be toothpaste.

38
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,096
Maybe it splashed on you.

39
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,465
I heard your whole outfit
was given to you.

40
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,202
Woojae gave me this shirt,
and a friend gave me these shoes.

41
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,539
And these pants are from Jaehyung.

42
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,107
-You know him, right?
-Yes.

43
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,809
Your socks have a lot of lint.

44
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,278
These socks were a gift, too.

45
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,547
Look at that stain.

46
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,951
-Are those socks mismatched?
-I just wear them in the order they dry.

47
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,154
-Wait, so are these two different socks?
-Yes, they are.

48
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,190
What about you, Roy Kim?

49
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,759
I wanted to be a minimalist,

50
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:10,631
but keeping all those so-called essentials
turned me into a maximalist.

51
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,133
There are so many things
I want to buy out there.

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,103
-You're also interested in fashion.
-I am.

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,973
So each of us will take a side
and defend one of you.

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,776
If someone questions your purchase,
we'll back you up.

55
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,746
How should we split up?
Anyone you'd like to pair up with?

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,749
I'm fine with this arrangement.

57
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,084
-I trust him.
-Thank goodness.

58
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,253
I'm okay with Byungjae.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,757
-I'll be in charge of defending Daeho.
-Okay.

60
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,093
-I'll defend Roy Kim.
-Ryugyu will defend Roy Kim.

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,496
Should I take the first shot, or will you?

62
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,799
I'll take the first shot.
There's just too much to go after.

63
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,167
SHEEPISH

64
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,636
You say you don't really spend much,

65
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,739
but even people who spend a lot
don't buy things like this.

66
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,909
Bath bombs.
Specifically, jelly-type bath bombs.

67
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,211
What's wrong with that?

68
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,447
They're way more fun
than a regular shower.

69
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,017
To be honest,
I'm on social media quite a bit.

70
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,653
So I came across
these jelly-type bath bombs.

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,123
And I thought, "When I get a girlfriend…"

72
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,693
THEY LOOK AWAY

73
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,494
-"When I get a girlfriend…"
-When?

74
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,197
"When I get a girlfriend,
I'll have to try it out."

75
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,968
So you didn't plan on using this alone.

76
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,638
I actually tried it once by myself,
but it felt weird.

77
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,408
We've never used one before.
What happens when you put it in water?

78
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,613
When you lift your hands up,
jelly oozes through your fingers.

79
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,316
I just assumed you liked taking baths,

80
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,952
but it looks like
you had something else in mind.

81
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,421
What was the ad you saw on social media?

82
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:45,058
I don't remember the details,
but they were having a good time.

83
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,960
Is that what this is?

84
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,595
It smells really nice.

85
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,164
-I'm sure it's good for your skin, too.
-Of course.

86
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,835
This product has passed
all skin irritation tests.

87
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,336
He bought the red ones.

88
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:01,475
I figured I'd need them someday,
so I've kept them in my drawer.

89
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,378
It says, "Enjoy on anniversaries
and special occasions."

90
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,445
"Enjoy bathing…"

91
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,281
-Read the fourth point.
-Which one?

92
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,917
"Make bath time fun for kids
who don't like bathing."

93
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,286
That's just there
to make it seem less obvious.

94
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,687
I think so too.

95
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,522
This could lead to having kids.

96
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,823
What?

97
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,092
I want to get married someday.

98
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,527
-What?
-What?

99
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,795
-Someday?
-That's right.

100
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,697
-While playing with slime?
-Right.

101
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,668
You're giving him a hard time
for buying this off social media,

102
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:32,873
but Roy Kim also bought something
he saw on social media.

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,441
Actually, he bought two items.

104
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,276
PANTS &amp; BLACKHEAD REMOVER

105
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,581
Why were these a bad purchase?
They look pretty useful.

106
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,083
The ad said you could wear these
all year round.

107
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,219
-They're made to last.
-They say those things.

108
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,655
I bought the smallest size,
but they're still way too big for me.

109
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,757
So I want to give them away.

110
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,326
-To Daeho?
-Yes.

111
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,560
I'll take them.

112
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,363
-I'd be happy to take them.
-They're yours.

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,565
These are too big for you?

114
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,234
-Can I try them on?
-Yes.

115
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,535
On top of your pants?

116
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,137
I only own one suit, so this is perfect.

117
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,373
-But you were an announcer.
-They'll fit.

118
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,709
-Will they fit?
-They fit perfectly!

119
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,011
Hey, these have an elastic here.

120
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,779
This is awesome.

121
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,915
Lose the pair underneath, and they'll fit.

122
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,250
PERFECT FIT

123
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,584
-Looks good, right?
-Yes.

124
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,087
This isn't how our show normally goes.

125
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,122
-What's this?
-Let's see.

126
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,292
-You'll see this all over social media.
-I've seen it.

127
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,027
Blackheads build up around the nose,

128
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:30,364
but if you squeeze them with cotton swabs,
it irritates your skin.

129
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,399
So I got this pore vacuum.

130
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,902
I used this on my nose, and it swelled up.

131
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:35,969
Really?

132
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,772
-The suction must be strong.
-It really is.

133
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,608
-It turns on. It has three settings.
-It turns on.

134
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,878
-Is it working?
-You need to open your pores.

135
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,246
Your nose is really red.

136
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,515
-It's really red.
-You should stop.

137
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,019
-See? This is what happens.
-What happened?

138
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,821
Since Daeho used this,
you should give it to him.

139
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,956
He can have it.

140
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,024
Thanks.

141
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,492
HE POCKETS IT

142
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,560
Thank you.

143
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,896
I think this price tag
will really raise eyebrows.

144
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,499
It's so expensive, it'll surprise you.

145
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,335
You can tell it's expensive
just from the case.

146
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,170
Now that's a successful man.

147
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,872
It's a R*lex case, but inside--

148
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,774
It's an I*C watch.

149
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,010
-When did you buy this?
-I bought it when I was 20 years old.

150
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,012
You bought that when you were 20?

151
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,715
I didn't know what I*C was
when I was 20 years old.

152
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,719
It's common to receive a watch
as a graduation gift in the States.

153
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,787
Wow.

154
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,856
Back then, I was young.

155
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:33,827
So I decided to ask my parents
for a graduation gift.

156
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,331
That's when my mom asked me what I wanted,
so I said I wanted a watch.

157
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:42,536
She asked me what kind of watch I wanted,
so I told her what I had in mind.

158
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:47,174
And without the slightest hesitation,
she said, "All right!",

159
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,143
and whisked me off
to the department store.

160
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,115
When I tried the watch on,
my mom said it looked really good on me.

161
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,818
And then asked the clerk how much it was.

162
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,319
I think Daeho is eyeing it.

163
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,954
ALMOST GETS HUSTLED

164
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,456
No way he's getting that.

165
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:07,160
When the clerk told us the price,
my mom said it seemed reasonable.

166
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,831
-How much was it back then?
-It was around five million won.

167
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,634
A JAW-DROPPING FIGURE

168
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,270
But then my mom said
we shouldn't buy it right away.

169
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:20,340
She suggested we check out
the R*lex store next door first.

170
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:26,079
Once you walk out and take a left,
you can't see the I*C store anymore.

171
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,083
So as soon as the store was out of sight,
she smacked the back of my head.

172
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,386
PLOT TWIST

173
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
I was so hurt back then.

174
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,823
She put on an act in the store.

175
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,859
Now that's an amusing story.

176
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,428
After she smacked me, I cried a bit.

177
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,431
I was crushed,
but not because I didn't get the watch.

178
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,834
I felt like she was stringing me along.

179
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,873
So I told her I'd buy the watch myself,
and asked her not to do that to me again.

180
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,711
-That summer break, I went on <i>Superstar K.</i>
-Really?

181
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,713
And I won that competition.

182
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,484
When I got my first paycheck,
the first thing I bought was this watch.

183
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,388
Well, moms can be like that.
Did she swear at you back then?

184
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,390
-She did.
-What did she say?

185
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,694
"You crazy ****,
you're old enough to know better!"

186
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,164
Considering the price,
I get why she was so upset.

187
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:20,501
But Ryugyu got scolded
for asking his mom for 5,000 won.

188
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,670
No, I asked her for 10,000 won,
and she started swearing at herself.

189
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,706
BLAMES HERSELF FOR RAISING HIM WRONG

190
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,075
She basically called herself
a "mother ******."

191
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,911
People usually blame the parents.
Your mom put it on herself.

192
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,047
I told her not to call my mom that word,
and hung up the phone.

193
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,618
This watch must hold
a lot of sentimental value.

194
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,220
It really does,
but I don't wear it that often.

195
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,990
If that's the case,
are you willing to give it away?

196
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:47,895
I'm open to discussing it further.
I can cut you a good deal.

197
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,563
HE TAKES THE WATCH OFF

198
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,532
-How much?
-Just take it off.

199
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,235
-He doesn't want to take it off.
-You've had it on long enough.

200
00:08:55,302 --> 00:09:00,674
In all seven episodes we've filmed,
I've never seen an item like this.

201
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,911
Apparently, he plays this
when he drinks alone at home.

202
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,978
KOREAN SMALL GONG

203
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,414
It's so hard to defend your items.

204
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,552
-I do have some doubts.
-Me too. These items are a bit too much.

205
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,222
When I drink alone…
You also enjoy drinking alone, right?

206
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,690
-No, I don't.
-Really?

207
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,992
-I do. I drink by myself every night.
-You do?

208
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,430
Sometimes when I drink alone,
I get overwhelmed by my emotions.

209
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,599
And I want to express those emotions.

210
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,334
I was in a percussion quartet.

211
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,169
-Back in school?
-Yes.

212
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,373
I think back to those days
and let my emotions out through this gong.

213
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,209
You hold it like this.

214
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,245
OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS

215
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,014
This is what I do when I drink.

216
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,184
-I think your gong is broken.
-It is.

217
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,987
-The sound's off.
-I had a lot of emotions to let out.

218
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,055
But this--

219
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,857
DROWNING OUT ANY CRITICISM

220
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,593
PIERCING THEIR EARDRUMS

221
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,962
THIS IS TORTURE

222
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,998
If you keep talking about that,
he won't stop.

223
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,466
Should we let it go then?

224
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:04,104
Anyone who knows the percussion quartet
knows how important the gong is.

225
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,639
The gong runs the show.

226
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,707
No, it's the drum.

227
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,244
The gong's like the goalie in soccer.
It gets sidelined.

228
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,013
JEERING

229
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,249
People who knew how to have fun
played the gong.

230
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,917
They carry the lead,

231
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,387
and when it's time to move on
to the next song…

232
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,522
DON'T STRIKE THE GONG

233
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,323
…they give the signal.

234
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,394
I'm not questioning the gong's role
in the percussion quartet.

235
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,796
I just have a hard time believing

236
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,699
you play this
while drinking alone at night.

237
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:36,236
You can't smell it through the screen,

238
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,472
but Daeho reeks of alcohol right now.

239
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,175
I can barely breathe over here.

240
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,776
-Sorry.
-I wanted to ask earlier.

241
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,945
We're actually filming this
in the evening.

242
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,315
Just thinking about the gong
is making him tipsy again.

243
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,517
Have you used this to appeal your charm?

244
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:54,655
-You've played it for other people?
-This is how you're supposed to do it.

245
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,690
-No, don't do it.
-That's enough.

246
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,824
Hold on.

247
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:02,229
WORKING HIS CHARM

248
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,332
It looks really cool
if you play it properly.

249
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll take the mallet for now.

250
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,135
CONFISCATED

251
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,405
I feel a bit embarrassed
whenever I pull out these items.

252
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,140
-It's a skateboard.
-Yes, it is.

253
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,208
SKATEBOARD

254
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,709
How are you using this now?

255
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,878
I'm currently using it as a plant stand.

256
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,713
-I see.
-It's a plant stand.

257
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,815
You wanted a skateboard, right?

258
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,951
-I did.
-Then why is it a plant stand?

259
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,321
The way skaters get lost
in their own world

260
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,323
inspired me to give it a shot.

261
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,491
You can customize everything.

262
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:36,430
You can pick everything yourself,
even down to the color of the screws.

263
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:40,934
I had mine custom-made,
and it took about three months to get it.

264
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,769
-It took three months?
-Yes.

265
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,038
Didn't the excitement fade
during that time?

266
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,573
It totally did.

267
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,842
I only rode it twice at home.

268
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,213
-But it's not fit for a plant stand.
-It'll just roll around.

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,282
I wedge a rock right here.

270
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,452
-That's so smart.
-It's so useless.

271
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,655
It took three months
to arrive from Australia

272
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,924
-to be used as a plant stand.
-It needs a rock.

273
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:08,061
People are using it as decor these days.

274
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,398
Plenty of bars
hang skateboards on the wall.

275
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:15,369
And instead of throwing out your back,
you can roll the plants around.

276
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,272
Just wheel it over
when it's time to water them.

277
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,942
I'm all for the basics.
Food, clothing, and shelter.

278
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,646
You need clothes to keep you warm.

279
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,216
You need food to fill your stomach.

280
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:32,686
And you need shelter
to protect you from the wind and rain.

281
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,488
But this has no use at all.

282
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,523
It doesn't feed, clothe, or shelter you.

283
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,859
-It can shelter you from the rain.
-He's right.

284
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,827
Hungry? This gets you to food faster.

285
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,198
It looks really expensive to me.

286
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,133
It wasn't cheap.

287
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,069
I bet the shipping fee alone
could buy five gongs.

288
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,839
-Do you want the gong or this?
-I want that.

289
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,809
The gong is great when you drink alone.

290
00:12:55,876 --> 00:13:01,849
-If you've seen Roy Kim on TV recently…
-Are you seriously bringing that up?

291
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,617
…you might know him as a Marine.

292
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:07,454
-You're bringing up his military service?
-He's a proud Marine.

293
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,556
My subordinates gave me this.

294
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,292
-Are these their names?
-Yes.

295
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,028
I wouldn't take this
even if you gave it to me.

296
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,563
TURNS DOWN A FREEBIE

297
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,631
I'm serious.

298
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:20,067
Finally, something I don't want.

299
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,401
This is it.

300
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,469
SALUTE

301
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,272
-I'm a little embarrassed.
-Why?

302
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,709
-Where were you stationed?
-I was a sniper in Pohang.

303
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,944
21st Airborne Battalion, 1st Division.

304
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,713
-You were a sniper?
-I was.

305
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,881
What did you say?

306
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,649
-I was a sniper.
-Come on.

307
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:37,050
He was also a sniper.

308
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,619
He was a sniper?

309
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:43,290
I hit the target 95 or 96 times out of 100
and got rewarded with time off.

310
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,958
I ranked first in the regiment.

311
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,929
Snipers don't fire 100 rounds
when they train.

312
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,932
-Which rifle did you use?
-I was issued an M16.

313
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,767
But that's not a sniper rifle.

314
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,304
To be precise,
it was actually target practice.

315
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,773
He's good at long-range shooting.

316
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,608
Which rifle did you use?

317
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,277
-I used a K14.
-K14.

318
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,180
-It's a dedicated rifle for snipers.
-The barrel's longer.

319
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,615
You can't compare it to an M16.

320
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,351
Are you looking down on the M16?

321
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,321
All I'm saying is,
the "K" rifles are made in Korea.

322
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,455
He's proud of that.

323
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,793
The M16's stock is really big,
and it's heavy.

324
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,231
It's not even a sniper rifle,
but I nearly hit 100 out of 100 rounds.

325
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,534
-You fired your rifle lying down, right?
-Right.

326
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,769
Lying down?

327
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,004
-Lying down.
-It's called "prone position."

328
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,506
-He's right.
-He is.

329
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,074
Why didn't you catch that?

330
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,977
I got confused
because it felt like I was lying down.

331
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,046
That's how comfortable I was
with my rifle.

332
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,214
CAN'T SHOOT LYING DOWN

333
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,516
-This was really shocking.
-What?

334
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,585
He claims he carries this bag around.

335
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:48,856
Take a look at what's inside
and tell me what you think.

336
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,657
-Come on.
-He carries these around.

337
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,694
Are you serious?

338
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,296
EVERYDAY BAG
VARIOUS ITEMS HE CARRIES AROUND DAILY

339
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,199
-Let's start with the work gloves.
-I use those gloves

340
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,935
when I ride rental bikes to and from work.

341
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,972
-No way.
-I wear them when I ride bikes.

342
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,007
-Not when you fix the chain?
-No.

343
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:11,812
When it's autumn,
I wear the gloves like this.

344
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,549
But since it's hot in the summer,
I wear them backwards.

345
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:16,683
Stop lying.

346
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,686
-I know you're lying.
-I think it's clever.

347
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:23,590
-Why do you wear them?
-Sometimes the handlebars feel sticky.

348
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:27,427
-That's the first reason I wear them.
-It's for sanitary reasons.

349
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:32,833
The second reason is in case I fall.
Every now and then, I lose my footing.

350
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,668
Is this how you fall in the summer?

351
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,737
BRACE YOUR FALL
USING THE BACK OF YOUR HANDS

352
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,505
I do my best to fall like this.

353
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,840
-You do?
-Yes.

354
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,141
And the snorkeling gear?

355
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,178
You never know
when you'll go swimming in summer.

356
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,213
You go swimming on a whim?

357
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,848
I love swimming.

358
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,184
If he sees a body of water,
he dives right in.

359
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,585
I really do.

360
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,755
-I'm from Yangpyeong.
-You're from Yangpyeong.

361
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,291
And there's a river nearby.

362
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,360
So when I go on walks,
I sometimes get the urge to dive in.

363
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,697
-I know exactly what you mean.
-Do you really?

364
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:06,300
If he were lying,
the media would expose him.

365
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,769
He's not lying.
This is how he lives his life.

366
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:13,140
I've actually used these goggles
for nearly eight to nine years.

367
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,277
You can see better without them.
They're so scratched up.

368
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:22,950
These next two items are probably
the most expensive items we've seen today.

369
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,852
We have sneakers lined up here.

370
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:25,919
SNEAKERS &amp; NECKLACE

371
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:30,691
This is the first time
I've ever heard of this brand.

372
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:36,230
This is a necklace
from a brand called G*ro's.

373
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,198
Let me give you some background.

374
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,502
When Takahashi Goro founded this brand,

375
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:45,439
he was inspired by
Native American culture.

376
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:49,142
He even had his own leather workshop.

377
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,978
He also went to the States

378
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:54,281
and spent a great deal of time
with the Native Americans.

379
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,751
Anyway, it's a brand with a long history,
but it's really hard to get

380
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,787
because they only have one store
in Harajuku, Japan.

381
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:05,826
Nearly 500 people wait in line daily,
but only 30 can get in.

382
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,595
-But what do you use it for?
-What do you mean?

383
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,765
-It's a piece of art.
-Look at the detail on these feathers.

384
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,634
It's all handcrafted.

385
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,770
-I've got those feather details, too.
-What?

386
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:18,272
I have the same necklace.

387
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,975
-Feather details?
-Is that a G*ro's?

388
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,310
It does look similar.

389
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,012
Your feathers have no detail.

390
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,917
It's very similar to your necklace,
but mine was 5,000 won in Dongdaemun.

391
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,885
How much did that necklace cost?

392
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:35,989
One of these feathers
costs about 400 to 500,000 won.

393
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,524
THAT'S 100 TIMES THE PRICE

394
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,693
I bought them piece by piece.

395
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,530
I bought one feather,
then another, then the chain.

396
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,733
-Collecting them could be fun.
-It took 3 to 4 years to collect.

397
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,205
I just don't understand this.
These are all the same brand.

398
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,974
Why do you need five pairs of sneakers
from the same brand?

399
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,678
-Every sneaker has its own story.
-The design is slightly different.

400
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,314
I used to have more than these,

401
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,117
but I gave some away
to people who wear them more often.

402
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,687
-I wear them often, too.
-What are you implying?

403
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,255
You never know.

404
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:12,092
At the end of the day, I'm a celebrity.

405
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,028
Just look at all the cameras here.

406
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,631
So when I go to a shoot,
I want to look nice.

407
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,867
I want to look good
in front of the cameras.

408
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,902
-I know you're not like that.
-I'm not.

409
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,639
I make sure my makeup looks good,
and I don't drink the day before.

410
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,608
I don't think it was the day before.

411
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,010
-No.
-He drank until this morning.

412
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,880
-The smell's too strong.
-No, I drank last night.

413
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,715
I can't believe you own this.

414
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,685
Out of 50 million people in Korea,
you're the only one who has this at home.

415
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:44,324
Since I enjoy drinking,
I hang it up in my bar at home.

416
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,859
It's for decoration.

417
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,362
It's just like my skateboard.

418
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,397
Where did you get it?

419
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,033
Did you take this from a gas station?

420
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,434
-Can you buy this?
-Yes.

421
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,969
-Really?
-You can buy it online.

422
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,839
How original is that?
There are plenty of interior designers,

423
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:02,609
but I've never seen anyone
use a gas pump handle as decor.

424
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,345
People laugh when they see this.

425
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,382
-It's hilarious.
-They crack up laughing.

426
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,450
-Do you have a movie room at home?
-I do.

427
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,518
What's the theme?

428
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,887
-It's this.
-What?

429
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:17,891
-My favorite movie is <i>A Bittersweet Life.</i>
<i>-A Bittersweet Life.</i>

430
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,828
There's a scene where Lee Byunghun says,
"How could you do that to me?"

431
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,298
That's where I got the inspiration from.

432
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,900
So that scene
inspired your movie room decor.

433
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:27,968
That's right.

434
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:31,505
Do you pretend to shoot people
when you enter that room?

435
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:34,441
I just hold this while I watch movies.

436
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,344
How's your house set up?
I heard you have a vivarium room.

437
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,613
The rooms are laid out in a U-shape.

438
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,449
So right when you walk in,
you'll see a vivarium room,

439
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,720
then a bar, a comic room, the living room,

440
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,489
a room with a bathtub, a sauna,

441
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,159
-and finally, the movie room.
-That sounds amazing.

442
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:53,994
What do you keep in the sauna?

443
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:58,232
I have a bathrobe,
and those are quite expensive.

444
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,900
-You didn't.
-You didn't.

445
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,368
-No way.
-No way.

446
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,304
-You can't do that.
-It's wrong.

447
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,839
What are you talking about?

448
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,040
Did you steal it?

449
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,108
No, I didn't.

450
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,977
HE GOT IT AS A GIFT

451
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:14,381
I thought he was a practical guy,
but he bought this.

452
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,351
-Is that a professional-grade chainsaw?
-It is.

453
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,522
I live in a house with a yard,
so I need it for the trees.

454
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,290
-To maintain them.
-That's right.

455
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,893
But all you have to do
is trim a few branches.

456
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,628
To be honest, I've never used it.

457
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,063
I know. You haven't opened the box.

458
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,432
Why don't we open it?
I want to take a look.

459
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,435
-How much was this?
-It was a few hundred thousand won.

460
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,938
-You got a good deal.
-I know.

461
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,006
That's really cool.

462
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,073
THE BIG REVEAL

463
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,509
-That's what I'm talking about.
-That's so cool.

464
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,580
This is for home use,
and the battery pack is inside that box.

465
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,882
-Is it in there?
-I think you have to buy it.

466
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,884
-The battery isn't included.
-What?

467
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,886
No wonder it was so cheap.

468
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,121
There's no battery.

469
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,523
-It's really heavy.
-The battery's expensive.

470
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,759
You could hang it up in your movie room.

471
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,027
DIVERSIFY THE THEME

472
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,396
Or hang it next to the gas pump handle.

473
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,831
-I've got to admit, it does look cool.
-It does.

474
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:08,101
SHOWS OFF HIS CHAINSAW

475
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,637
It's like <i>Chainsaw Man.</i>

476
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,005
There's no battery.

477
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,208
It's completely useless
without the battery.

478
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,278
The next items belong to Roy Kim,
and I have to say, they're pretty cute.

479
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,448
He has a lot of them,
but I've never seen these before.

480
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:22,516
Never?

481
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,685
-Are these Sm*ski figurines?
-Yes.

482
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,889
I started collecting a few of these,

483
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,024
and once my fans found out,

484
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:35,963
they'd pick one up for me
whenever they came across one.

485
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,432
-So they send these to you as gifts.
-Yes.

486
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,835
When you were into <i>Toy Story,</i>
your fans showered you with gifts.

487
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:42,903
They did.

488
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,772
I grew up collecting
Woody and Buzz Lightyear figures,

489
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,041
and my fans knew that.

490
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,811
-So they give me those, too.
-They give them to you.

491
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:54,615
I've got an entire wall
covered with <i>Toy Story </i>figures at home.

492
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,718
I told my fans not to get me
any more <i>Toy Story </i>figures,

493
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,020
so now they've moved on to these.

494
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,655
Let me ask you something.

495
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:06,093
Even after what happened with <i>Toy Story,</i>
you told your fans you like Sm*ski.

496
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,661
-That seems intentional.
-It does.

497
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,063
He was just communicating with his fans.

498
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,866
I really don't need my fans
to get me any gifts.

499
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:17,504
As long as they enjoy my music
and come to my concerts,

500
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:18,972
that's more than enough.

501
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,875
If I were in your shoes,

502
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:24,878
I'd go live
and show off a 50,000-won bill.

503
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:29,283
I'd say, "I'm collecting these.
Aren't they pretty? Look at the design."

504
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,718
You can't do that. You'll get in trouble.

505
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,921
I'm collecting batteries these days.

506
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,055
DAEHO WANTS A GIFT

507
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,924
I'm collecting batteries.

508
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,994
Roy Kim has a lot of items today.
Next up is a vintage collection.

509
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:44,298
He values the history
behind the things he buys.

510
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,899
You attach meaning to things.

511
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:49,970
Some of your hats are old,
and some you bought vintage.

512
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:54,875
It's not about how worn
or sweaty the hat is.

513
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:58,946
It's the history and passage of time
that shaped the fit it has now.

514
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:01,915
I'm sure there are people
who understand what I'm saying.

515
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,519
I just don't get why anyone would buy
an old hat instead of a new one.

516
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,154
You should've bought new hats.

517
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:11,425
You can find tons of these
in the donation bins in my neighborhood.

518
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,427
But you don't buy new things either.

519
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,829
What can I say? I get a lot of gifts.

520
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,632
This probably used to be a vivid orange,

521
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:22,836
but the color faded over time
and left these marks.

522
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,538
-That's why it's vintage.
-Nice.

523
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:29,543
I know how much Roy Kim
loves vintage and treasures history,

524
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,078
so I prepared a gift for him.

525
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:36,083
These hats carry a long history
and have been shaped by time.

526
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,085
BATTERED BY HISTORY

527
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,152
That's crazy.

528
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:40,487
Look at the sweat stains.

529
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:43,524
-I actually think this looks really cool.
-The sweat stains?

530
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,628
If these were my sweat stains,
I would wear it.

531
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:49,630
I think it looks cool,
but I don't want it.

532
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:52,099
Let's give it to Daeho.

533
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,667
I'll gladly take it.

534
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,569
-You really want it?
-Yes.

535
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:56,970
It's a rare find.

536
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,973
-Thank you.
-You really want it?

537
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,141
Yes.

538
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,244
It's tough trying to defend my purchases.

539
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:07,781
I've come across plenty of vintage things,
but this is new to me.

540
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,883
-It's a vintage diary.
-I want it.

541
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,752
Do people buy vintage diaries?

542
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:15,889
I bought this diary
because I love traveling.

543
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,659
When you travel, it makes you think a lot.

544
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:22,095
So I thought it'd be nice
to jot things down.

545
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,230
But it's way too big.

546
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,599
I thought it was half the size.

547
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,334
So you've never used it.

548
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:32,606
I like to travel light,
so it's a bit hard to carry this around.

549
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:36,243
But since I already bought it,
I plan to use it someday.

550
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,011
This isn't really vintage, though.

551
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,146
-It's new.
-Right?

552
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,848
It's only meant to look vintage.

553
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,116
My diary is actually vintage.

554
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,786
-What's this?
-Do you like it?

555
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:51,124
-Can I have it?
-Yes, but I wrote in it.

556
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,794
I have a question.

557
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:56,396
Did you buy this?

558
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:57,598
DODGES THE QUESTION

559
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,032
Isn't this mine?

560
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,969
I don't know.
It was lying around the house.

561
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,638
We live together.
It's either yours or mine.

562
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,508
It's a vintage diary. Do you want it?

563
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:10,010
-I do. I really like it.
-I'll give it to you.

564
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:12,846
Just so you know,
you're not getting paid today, Daeho.

565
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:13,981
GOT HIS MONEY'S WORTH

566
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:15,849
-He got a lot of stuff today.
-He did.

567
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:20,487
We took a look at the items
Daeho and Roy Kim brought today.

568
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:24,224
And among the items they brought,
they will choose one item

569
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:27,194
that they regret buying
or don't really need.

570
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:31,164
And we'll send that item to someone
who can make better use of it.

571
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:35,702
So it's time for both of you
to choose your recall items.

572
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,071
-I've made my decision.
-What is it?

573
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,574
You can't give away
what you received today.

574
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:43,477
-Really?
-You can't give away those pants.

575
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,245
I forgot about those pants.

576
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:48,015
I thought I could put it to good use,

577
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:52,252
but I think someone else
could make better use of my chainsaw.

578
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,888
-Are you serious?
-It's way too expensive.

579
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:58,225
There must be someone out there
who only has the battery.

580
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,960
No way. That's ridiculous.

581
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:03,697
-He doesn't want to buy the battery.
-He doesn't want to buy it.

582
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:09,336
I think every object has its own fate
and its rightful owner.

583
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:15,642
So, I'd like this chainsaw
to go to someone who truly needs it.

584
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,212
-Thank you.
-You have to buy the battery.

585
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:19,847
-It's not included.
-It's not.

586
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,382
What could possibly beat that?

587
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,086
I'll give away one of my sneakers.

588
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,287
-Really?
-Seriously?

589
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:31,325
I'll give away the ones
with the mixed colorways.

590
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,060
-These sneakers?
-Yes.

591
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:39,499
It felt like a shame to see these shoes
just sitting on my shoe rack.

592
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:44,338
I hope the person who gets these sneakers
won't keep them tucked away.

593
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:48,775
I hope they wear them often
and put them to proper use.

594
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:51,211
-That's very nice of you.
-Thank you so much.

595
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:59,486
Our guests today were Daeho and Roy Kim.
How was it for you?

596
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:04,958
I've never been interested
in what other people purchase.

597
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:09,062
But when I saw what Roy Kim brought,
it felt like I got a peek into his life.

598
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:13,800
It was a chance for me
to get to know him a little better.

599
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,736
It was very meaningful.

600
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:22,042
I was trying to explain my purchases,
but I couldn't justify some of them.

601
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,546
I realized I need to be more mindful
when I spend money.

602
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:29,383
And after seeing Daeho's purchases,

603
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:35,522
I realized I was way too caught up
in superficial things.

604
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:39,693
It made me take a moment
to reflect on myself.

605
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,062
I'll try to be more frugal from now on.

606
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,931
Thank you for joining us today.

607
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,966
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

608
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,368
A BIG THANKS TO ROY KIM AND DAEHO

609
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:50,370
Why the heck did you buy this?

610
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:53,140
Who just laughed? Was it the director?

611
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,943
Let's find out who our guests are today.

612
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,811
-Is this a designer chair?
-It is.

613
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,479
-Is it an art piece?
-It's not a fake piece.

614
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:02,783
-I bought it at a department store.
-I asked if it was an art piece.

615
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,685
-Really?
-Anything you want to confess?

616
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,787
I'm into alien vibes.

617
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:09,489
-It's pretty if you wear it right.
-You look different.

618
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:13,260
Doesn't this make me look sleepy?
