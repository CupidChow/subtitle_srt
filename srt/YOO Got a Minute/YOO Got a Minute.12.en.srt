1
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,148
Hello.

2
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:08,752
I'm Yoo Byungjae, a quiet man
hosting The Quiet Interview.

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,522
How much did you laugh today?

4
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,891
Was that laughter, perhaps,

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:19,796
something you forced
just to please someone else?

6
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:25,135
We're joined by guests who've come
to reclaim their genuine laughter

7
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:27,737
in a place where laughter
is strictly forbidden.

8
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:33,143
I'll try to welcome today's guests
as solemnly as possible.

9
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,612
-We can't laugh from now on, guys.
-Okay.

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,214
Wow, you got my feet.

11
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,616
Hurry up.

12
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,220
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,361
Let's do this.

14
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:55,131
-This is funny already.
-Don't laugh.

15
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,601
-I thought you were in a bad mood.
-I am.

16
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:01,504
-I'm going to act grumpy today.
-Okay.

17
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:09,312
-Stand in a line.
-Wait. Don't laugh. I said don't laugh.

18
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,480
-Don't laugh.
-Let's go.

19
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:11,948
-This is bad.
-It's starting.

20
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,452
-Prepare yourselves.
-You go first.

21
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:25,528
-Hello.
-Hello, please take a seat.

22
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:50,420
We'll give you some time to settle in
before we begin.

23
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:51,588
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

24
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:53,056
Welcome.

25
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:57,494
Please introduce yourselves.
Should we start with Lily?

26
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:58,562
Sure.

27
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,932
Hello, I'm Lily from NMIXX.

28
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:07,604
Your turn, Haewon.

29
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,176
Don't worry.
Since I haven't explained the rules yet,

30
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:16,346
-you can laugh right now.
-Thank goodness.

31
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,915
Once the rules are laid out,
there'll be no mercy,

32
00:02:18,982 --> 00:02:20,650
-but you're good for now.
-Sorry.

33
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:23,186
-We're all doomed because of Lily.
-I'm sorry.

34
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:26,223
Let's start over.
Can you introduce yourself, Haewon?

35
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:30,493
Hello, I'm Haewon from NMIXX.

36
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:36,800
Go ahead, Bae.

37
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:38,635
Hi…

38
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,304
I'm Bae.

39
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,110
The rules are quite simple
on The Quiet Interview.

40
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:50,747
If you laugh, you'll be eliminated.

41
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:54,050
And once you're eliminated,

42
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:56,987
you'll be sent to the Quiet Room
you see behind me

43
00:02:57,053 --> 00:03:02,459
to spend the rest of the interview
in lonely isolation.

44
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,328
You might be wondering
how we decide who gets eliminated.

45
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:11,334
In <i>No-Laughing Birthday Party,</i>
a human judge simply decided--

46
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,136
<i>Simply…</i>

47
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,072
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,776
Since I'm not done explaining the rules,
you're allowed to laugh.

49
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,712
But may I ask why you laughed?

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,481
What?

51
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:28,418
Well, you said "simply."

52
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:35,425
I once covered the song <i>Symphony,</i>
and it reminded me of that song.

53
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:36,626
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:40,263
So you laughed because "simply"
sounded like "symphony,"

55
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,133
-which reminded you of the song <i>Symphony.</i>
-That's right.

56
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,968
I'm sorry. This is bad.

57
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,269
I've got this.

58
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:49,005
-Please continue.
-Okay.

59
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:53,143
In <i>No-Laughing Birthday Party,</i>
a human judge "symphony" decided

60
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,882
who to warn or eliminate
based on people's expressions.

61
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,785
But for this show,
we've taken things a step further.

62
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:06,289
We now use AI that detects emotions
and analyzes facial expressions.

63
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,225
Do you see that gauge over there?

64
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,062
That utilizes deep learning
to analyze facial data in real time

65
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,431
to determine whether you've laughed.

66
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:18,101
I might've made that sound
too complicated.

67
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,372
Since we haven't started yet,
could you show us an example, Haewon?

68
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,743
If you could do that
"buffering while laughing" act…

69
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,081
-Sure.
-…we can show you how this works.

70
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:44,661
As you just saw,
we use cutting-edge technology.

71
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:48,798
So if you laugh,
you will be sent to the Quiet Room.

72
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:52,569
So, he makes that noise when we laugh.

73
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,638
-I see.
-Okay, got it.

74
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,539
-That's high-tech.
-I know, right?

75
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:02,546
I believe we're all meeting
for the first time today.

76
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:03,847
-Us three?
-Yes.

77
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,584
-Not us. It's our first time meeting him.
-Yes, you're right.

78
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:11,087
-I wasn't talking about the three of you.
-Right. Sorry.

79
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:13,490
I misunderstood. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,859
You're so annoying.

81
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:19,195
What the heck?

82
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,367
-We didn't start…
-You laughed.

83
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:27,037
-We did--
-You didn't say we didn't start yet.

84
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:28,605
Right, I said we started.

85
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,839
-That's why--
-No.

86
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:31,942
I mean, you didn't say we started.

87
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,545
Rules are rules,
but since I forgot to mention one thing,

88
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:38,081
you won't be eliminated just yet.

89
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:42,852
If I laugh, you will be given a chance
to come back and join us.

90
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,721
I'll go ahead and laugh.

91
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:48,124
Since I laughed, you can stay.
But that was your last chance.

92
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,427
-Then, let's start now.
-Let's start.

93
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,494
Okay.

94
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,932
We're starting now.

95
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:00,670
-I'm meeting you for the first time today.
-That's right.

96
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,941
I'd like to hear what kind of attitude
you three are bringing to today's shoot.

97
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,143
But since we're short on time,

98
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,414
let's hear from the one person
who wanted to meet me the most.

99
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:17,454
Me?

100
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,460
I wanted to meet you the most?
Fine, I'll go.

101
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:25,762
Okay, let's see.

102
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:31,568
I don't usually laugh
when the other girls in my group laugh,

103
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:34,104
so I'm confident I won't laugh today!

104
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,907
All right. I'm looking forward to spending

105
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:40,577
a fun and meaningful time
with the three of you today.

106
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm meeting all three of you
for the first time in person,

107
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,749
but I've seen you through the media.

108
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:50,186
What impressed me the most
were your childhood photos.

109
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:54,090
I didn't find any unflattering photos.
You were all so cute.

110
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,893
We've prepared some of those photos.

111
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,729
-This is Lily.
-So cute.

112
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,565
-That's me.
-When was this?

113
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,832
Long before my debut,

114
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:09,739
I took part in a dance program
that taught English, called <i>English Egg.</i>

115
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,975
I think it's from that.

116
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:15,178
It must have been an educational program.

117
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,246
Yes, it was.

118
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:19,683
You don't recall the exact age,
but it's such an adorable photo.

119
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:20,917
When was this?

120
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,285
I was about two years old.

121
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,354
-Two years old?
-Really?

122
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,956
I don't think that's right.

123
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,458
-Then three years old.
-Three…

124
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:32,562
-Who are you…
-Why are you negotiating your age?

125
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,831
Or I could've been four.

126
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:37,834
Maybe you were four in Korean age.

127
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:39,603
I was two by international age.

128
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,138
-Then you were around four.
-Yes.

129
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,708
When I was two years old, my family…

130
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,943
No, not my family.
Actually, yes, my family.

131
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,714
I went on a trip to Europe
with my mom and dad.

132
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,649
I see. Was this taken in Europe?

133
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:56,419
-Probably?
-It does look like you're in Europe.

134
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,221
-Yes.
-All right. Next photo.

135
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:01,424
This is so cute.
I've seen this photo a few times.

136
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:02,659
-It's Haewon.
-Yes.

137
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,094
How old were you?

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,663
-Five or six years old.
-That seems about right.

139
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,767
-You always had those glasses on, right?
-Right.

140
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,738
This is Bae's photo.

141
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:16,640
-This as well.
-I like this photo.

142
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:17,874
-Me, too.
-Wait.

143
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:23,580
-Who is that?
-Why is it stuck?

144
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,015
You look alike.

145
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:29,152
This is stuck, but let's continue.
When was this taken, Bae?

146
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,325
That was when I was in elementary school.

147
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,460
Yeah.

148
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,396
What were you like back then?

149
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:42,365
-I was very shy.
-Right.

150
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:45,135
I can tell you had
a strong sense of determination,

151
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:49,906
and a clear desire to accomplish
whatever you set your mind to.

152
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,241
You're right.

153
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:56,746
The next segment we've prepared
is called "N Keyword Talk."

154
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:01,051
"N" is the first letter of NMIXX.

155
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:05,589
Let's take a look at
what the first keyword is.

156
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:08,792
-The first keyword is "NSWER."
-NSWER!

157
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:17,000
Could one of you tell us
what "NSWER" means?

158
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,703
That's the name of NMIXX's fandom.

159
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,606
"NSWE" stands for
"north," "south," "west," and "east."

160
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:24,741
And the "R" stands for "route."

161
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,676
It means that

162
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:30,847
our fans guide us on the path
we're meant to take.

163
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:32,215
-They're our compass.
-Yes.

164
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:40,624
The next keyword is "Nickname."

165
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,161
Bae, Haewon, and Lily.
You all have so many adorable nicknames.

166
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,329
What's Haewon's?

167
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:49,599
Out of all the nicknames my fans gave me,
I like BASA the most.

168
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:54,271
-B, A, S, A.
-A, S, A.

169
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:57,040
-Guess what it stands for.
-BASA.

170
00:09:57,674 --> 00:10:03,046
Brings All Smiles Around.

171
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:06,216
-Maybe something like that?
-You're really good at acronyms.

172
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:09,452
-What does it stand for?
-It stands for Baguette Abs Sexy Angel.

173
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:14,457
What are "Baguette Abs"?

174
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:19,262
The abs on my stomach.

175
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,566
-Do your abs look like baguettes?
-Yes.

176
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:25,268
-Baguettes have those ridges, right?
-They do.

177
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:30,073
-I have those here.
-So your abs look like baguettes.

178
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,344
I get why they call you "Lilyana Grande."

179
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,279
But what does "Lil Emp" mean?

180
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,283
It's Lily plus…

181
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,751
-Emperor.
-Emperor.

182
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:45,555
So they gave you that nickname
out of respect, since you're the best.

183
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:48,325
That's right.
It's one of my favorite nicknames.

184
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,993
-Lil Emperor?
-Yes.

185
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,728
What other nicknames do you have?

186
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,664
Just "Lil."

187
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:00,203
Sorry.

188
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:05,242
When I was little,
some people called me "Lil."

189
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:06,810
-Like a pet name?
-"Hey, Lil."

190
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:10,680
In my case, some people call me "Byung."

191
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:13,216
-Really?
-No, I made that up.

192
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,351
What the heck?

193
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,224
I wouldn't like it
if someone called me "Byung."

194
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,526
I'll never call you that.

195
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,162
It's like watching a monodrama.

196
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:30,867
Let's look at the next keyword.

197
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:35,238
"NIMBY Phenomenon."
It stands for "Not In My Backyard."

198
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:41,444
Basically, it means,
"Don't bring that into my personal space."

199
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:44,781
Can you guys relate to this keyword?

200
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,683
What do you dislike, Lily?

201
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,086
-I really dislike getting shots.
-They're scary.

202
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:51,922
-They're a pain.
-I hate them.

203
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:53,456
I don't know why we get them.

204
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:59,262
I know why we get them,
but I just don't like them.

205
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:02,232
I know they're a necessity.

206
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,835
You need to get shots when you're sick.

207
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:09,406
But technology should be advanced enough
for us to find an alternative.

208
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,509
I would be so grateful
if you found an alternative.

209
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:16,246
-So you dislike needles.
-I also hate seeing blood.

210
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:18,148
Me too. Why do we need blood?

211
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:22,719
I mean, it's important that we have blood.

212
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,155
-It's important.
-We need it to survive.

213
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:29,259
That's absolutely true.
You can't live without blood.

214
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:34,164
I'm a fan, so I know what NMIXX means,
but could you explain it for everyone?

215
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,266
There are two X's, right?

216
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,069
The "N" in NMIXX stands for
"Now, New, Next,"

217
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,739
as well as the letter "N,"
meaning an unknown variable.

218
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:45,842
The word "MIXX" symbolizes
combination and diversity…

219
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,479
Sorry, there was a bug.

220
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,482
But I killed it.

221
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,651
Did you just commit murder?

222
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:56,920
-Murder?
-Elizabeth!

223
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:01,291
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,060
Look at the blood.

225
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:07,898
It's on my shoe.

226
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:10,533
The Buddha is crying.

227
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,136
I'm so sorry.

228
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:16,573
I know every living creature is valuable.

229
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,742
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

230
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:22,045
We had a segment with Elizabeth
planned for the end.

231
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:26,383
-Really?
-We'll need to drop that segment.

232
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,819
-The writer's going to cry.
-I'm really sorry.

233
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,456
-You were explaining NMIXX to us.
-Sorry.

234
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,859
"Now, New, Next,"
and the unknown variable "N."

235
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,661
That's what the N stands for.

236
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:41,164
And the word "MIXX" symbolizes
combination and diversity.

237
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,199
Altogether, it means

238
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,571
-"the best combination for a new era."
-The best artists?

239
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:50,273
-That's what it means.
-That's very nice.

240
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:58,381
That meaning is reflected
in NMIXX's music as well.

241
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,851
So let's take a moment
to talk about your music.

242
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:05,021
Have you ever seen
an Australian cockroach, Lily?

243
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,691
-I heard they're huge.
-Well…

244
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:09,726
I heard the bugs in Australia are huge.

245
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:11,761
-That's true.
-Right?

246
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,029
How big are they?

247
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,832
Sometimes they can be
the size of your palm.

248
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,401
That's why you killed
that tiny bug so easily.

249
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:21,471
-Yeah, I think so.
-You "think so"?

250
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:25,508
I hate to say this, but Elizabeth was tiny
compared to the bugs in Australia.

251
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,479
-Bae…
-I heard you cry quite easily, Bae.

252
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,584
Has anything made you cry recently?

253
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:37,287
-I tear up when I talk about my fans.
-I see.

254
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:40,824
-Artists tend to tear up over their fans.
-Right.

255
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:45,295
I don't know why, but I tear up
whenever I talk about NSWER.

256
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:48,198
You seem to be tearing up now.

257
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:49,366
-Maybe…
-No.

258
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:56,273
I've heard many artists say
that they get emotional

259
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,476
when they talk to fans
after a concert or performance.

260
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:03,480
When we come in first place
on a music show,

261
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:08,418
we see all the fans from up on stage,
and seeing their faces…

262
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:09,986
You get choked up.

263
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:12,322
They're so happy we came in first place…

264
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,691
No, what are you doing?

265
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:15,825
Are you serious?

266
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:19,763
There's no way you're really crying.

267
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,534
She's crying!

268
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:29,272
-When they cheer us on, I feel grateful.
-I see.

269
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,607
It is really touching.

270
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:33,376
That's why I start to tear up.

271
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,317
You know what I mean?

272
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:48,158
I don't think those are fake tears.

273
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:52,896
I know exactly what you mean,
and I could feel your sincerity.

274
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:58,301
But if you keep your eyes open like that,
you'll naturally tear up…

275
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,036
Right.

276
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:01,838
You're clever.

277
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,774
-You tear up because your eyes get dry.
-I know.

278
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,444
Great. We'll continue
to talk about your music.

279
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,681
I'm curious who your role models are.
They don't have to be musicians.

280
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,884
Do you have a role model, Bae?

281
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,687
My current role model
is a singer named Tate McRae.

282
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:20,290
-Tate McRae.
-I'm a big fan of hers.

283
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,525
She has a husky voice and…

284
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:27,197
It was an elephant, not a pig.

285
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:28,999
It was a pig earlier.

286
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,134
Do you have a role model, Haewon?

287
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,435
My mom and dad.

288
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,671
-Of course.
-Right.

289
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,141
That's sweet.

290
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,378
Have you ever seen
an Australian earthworm, Lily?

291
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,547
Don't lie.

292
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,849
-I like gummy worms.
-You can't laugh.

293
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,083
Sorry, I didn't laugh.

294
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,351
Oh, my gosh.

295
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:49,419
What?

296
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:55,759
Staying in the same position
for a long time isn't easy.

297
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:59,129
Can you ask me about my role model?

298
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:03,500
Of course. Do you have a role model, Lily?

299
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,235
My role model is Taylor Swift.

300
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:08,905
-Taylor Swift is truly the best.
-I agree.

301
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,841
If I had to pick one artist in the world,
it would be her.

302
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,644
-I seriously--
-I like you.

303
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:26,790
Unfortunately, Haewon…

304
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,159
Yay, it's not me.

305
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:31,294
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,197
-Bye, Haewon.
-See you!

307
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,968
-I can't believe it's not me.
-Thank you.

308
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:41,171
You're really good at holding it in.
I'm impressed.

309
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,107
You can laugh in there.

310
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,443
We can't all be eliminated.

311
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:49,279
-Taylor Swift is your role model.
-Yes.

312
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:52,349
She's a wonderful musician,
so that makes sense.

313
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,251
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

314
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:58,054
You're releasing your first
full-length album in 3 years and 7 months,

315
00:17:58,121 --> 00:17:59,656
so it must feel very special.

316
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,626
Could one of you share your thoughts?

317
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:04,327
Our thoughts?

318
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,063
-Our thoughts?
-Yes.

319
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,733
-Do you want to take this?
-Really?

320
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,134
Okay, go ahead.

321
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,336
-Me?
-What?

322
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:14,771
-You?
-Okay.

323
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,806
-Me?
-Yes.

324
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,642
-Or you? Me?
-What?

325
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:23,747
We're happy that we were able
to release a full-length album.

326
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:26,983
We did go through some tough times,

327
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,319
-but we pulled through…
-He's laughing.

328
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:32,455
-…by working together.
-He's laughing!

329
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,824
-Haewon.
-Come here.

330
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,428
Did you laugh?

331
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,798
Yes, I guess I did.
Please return to your seat.

332
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:43,533
This is great.

333
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,168
That's a win for us.

334
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:52,842
You could say every member of NMIXX
is essentially a main vocalist.

335
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,177
When new songs come out,

336
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:57,981
you must feel some disappointment
when deciding who gets to sing which part.

337
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,616
Let's pause for a second.

338
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,652
-Please hold.
-Is this an act?

339
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,820
Okay.

340
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,922
Is this scripted?

341
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:07,157
Is everyone a vocalist?

342
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,559
-Everyone's a good singer.
-Right?

343
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,530
-You're all amazing singers.
-That's right.

344
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:17,867
What?

345
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:21,538
-What's that?
-What?

346
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:23,340
He's charging his phone.

347
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:28,044
I really didn't see that coming.

348
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:29,512
It must've been urgent.

349
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:31,081
How much battery is left?

350
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,886
-It's at 80%.
-What the heck? It's at 80%.

351
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:37,587
It's individual interview time.

352
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:40,523
All of you have been active
on variety shows,

353
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,526
but Haewon, you've stood out
for appearing on them the most.

354
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:45,795
-That's right.
-Is there a difference

355
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:49,966
between the Haewon we see on variety shows
and the Haewon in everyday life?

356
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,468
My energy is usually high,

357
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:55,972
but I have a hard time
talking to strangers.

358
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,207
I'm very shy…

359
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:07,584
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Byungjae. It's Donghyeok.</i>

360
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,487
<i>How much has the phone charged?</i>

361
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:15,091
-It's at 87%.
-It charged 7% already?

362
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,226
<i>Thank you.</i>

363
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:18,962
That charger is really fast.

364
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:26,636
The title track of NMIXX's
first full-length album is <i>Blue Valentine.</i>

365
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:30,440
I listened to the song
before today's shoot,

366
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:34,511
and I have to say,
it's incredibly catchy and really good.

367
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:35,579
Thank you.

368
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,316
Your songs have always had
unique rhythm changes,

369
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:45,488
but this one especially has
so many unpredictable transitions.

370
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:47,290
That's why, today,

371
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:52,896
we'd like to introduce an expert
who can truly play around with beats.

372
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:58,201
Lily, would you be able to sing along
during his performance?

373
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:00,937
-Let's bring out the expert.
-Okay, I'll try.

374
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:06,176
-Hello.
-Hello.

375
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,614
He's well-known for his spoon performance.
Whenever you're ready.

376
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:15,886
Ready, go!

377
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:19,189
<i>This love is over</i>

378
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:22,492
<i>I jump back in</i>

379
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,029
<i>This love is colder</i>

380
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:28,732
<i>I'll keep the fire lit in mine</i>

381
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,470
<i>You'll always be my blue valentine</i>

382
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:36,006
<i>-Blue valentine</i>
<i>-Blue valentine</i>

383
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:40,377
<i>You'll always be my blue valentine</i>

384
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:43,647
<i>-Blue valentine, blue valentine</i>
<i>-Blue valentine, blue valentine</i>

385
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:46,650
-Hey!
-Thank you. That was wonderful.

386
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:47,717
That was fun.

387
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,085
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

388
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:51,888
-Thank you. Bye!
-Thank you.

389
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:54,090
As we briefly mentioned earlier,

390
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:58,662
Lily got her nickname "Lil Emperor"
because she has a wide vocal range.

391
00:21:58,728 --> 00:21:59,729
Yes.

392
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,464
So we prepared another performance.

393
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:04,968
This person also boasts
an impressive vocal range.

394
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:09,506
Let's welcome the captivating vocalist
who's challenging Lil Emperor's throne.

395
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,009
-I can't wait to hear this.
-What?

396
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:16,746
-Hello.
-Hello.

397
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:17,881
It's a man.

398
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,022
He skipped my part.

399
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:33,563
<i>Anyway, there are so many weird stars</i>

400
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,666
<i>All kinds of weird stars</i>

401
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,401
<i>Anyway, weird stars</i>

402
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,136
<i>Twinkle little, little star</i>

403
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:41,371
<i>Yeah, I'm a star</i>

404
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:43,773
<i>We go up higher and higher</i>

405
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,409
<i>We go up higher and higher</i>

406
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:48,712
<i>I'm going to be the one</i>

407
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,714
<i>Stick with me</i>

408
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,955
<i>Stay awake</i>

409
00:22:59,022 --> 00:23:01,791
<i>You cannot hold us down</i>

410
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:08,932
<i>Fly away</i>

411
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,902
<i>To the sky above</i>

412
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:14,804
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,748
He's really good.

414
00:23:24,814 --> 00:23:29,553
Unfortunately, Bae will have to go
to the Quiet Room.

415
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,155
You put up a good fight.

416
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,725
You really did.

417
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:49,172
Our time with NMIXX on The Quiet Interview
is now drawing to a close.

418
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:54,277
Many people have gathered here
for NMIXX today.

419
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:57,013
If anyone has anything
they would like to say,

420
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,282
please feel free to raise your hand.

421
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:01,985
-I have something to say.
-Yes, sir.

422
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:05,689
Since I'm a huge fan of Haewon,

423
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:10,126
-I came all the way from Gaepo-dong.
-I see.

424
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,861
So I'd like her autograph.

425
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,798
-Would that be okay?
-Of course.

426
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:16,733
Please come up to the stage.

427
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:25,175
-I brought paper.
-Okay.

428
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:26,443
One second.

429
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,712
-I'm jealous.
-I'm scared.

430
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:30,614
Where did it go?

431
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,948
-It's in there.
-What?

432
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:37,087
I'm really sorry.

433
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:40,023
Okay.

434
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:43,326
I'm so sorry.

435
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:49,132
-You did bring it. Thank you.
-Thank you.

436
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,533
-It's a bit damp.
-Yes.

437
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,068
-Do you have a pen?
-No.

438
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:53,870
Does anyone have a pen?

439
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:55,572
Does anyone have a pen?

440
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,307
-Pen?
-I do.

441
00:24:57,374 --> 00:25:00,043
-Thank goodness. Could we borrow it?
-Thank goodness.

442
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:03,880
You can use his pen.

443
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:05,749
Where did I put it? One second.

444
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:10,253
Right.

445
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:20,897
I found it. Here it is.

446
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:29,339
Did he shave his head?

447
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,174
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

448
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,577
We put our heads together
for the pen and paper.

449
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:35,645
-Please sign it.
-Thank you.

450
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:45,088
Lily, don't do that.

451
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:47,057
-Don't look at them.
-You can peek.

452
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:49,259
-No.
-Right?

453
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:51,328
-Can I touch your wig?
-Yes.

454
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:53,430
It looks really nice.

455
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:00,170
Thank you. Congratulations.

456
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:03,440
-Sorry. Thank you.
-Thank you. Please return to your seats.

457
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:05,575
Please take it back. Thank you.

458
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:08,378
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

459
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:13,650
I think they swapped wigs.

460
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:23,293
-Haewon.
-Me?

461
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,730
-You laughed earlier.
-It wasn't me. I didn't laugh.

462
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:33,503
Why am I so good at this?

463
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,308
-Haewon just got eliminated.
-Okay.

464
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,777
We had NMIXX here with us…

465
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:51,922
We had NMIXX here with us today.

466
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:53,690
If you had all been eliminated,

467
00:26:53,757 --> 00:26:58,295
you wouldn't have had the chance
to talk about your music

468
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:01,431
or share any personal thoughts.

469
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:06,169
But since Lily made it to the end,

470
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:09,673
let's hear her final thoughts
on today's shoot.

471
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:12,475
Are you aware that
we went easy on you today?

472
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,144
Yes, thank you so much.

473
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,246
Please share your closing remarks,

474
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:22,085
and also tell us a little
about your first full-length album.

475
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:23,320
Okay.

476
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,323
Which camera should I look at?

477
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:27,824
The one in the middle.

478
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:29,125
He's back.

479
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:33,496
-It's done charging.
-Don't laugh!

480
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:34,598
Don't laugh.

481
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:36,499
I won't.

482
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:43,974
-All right. Can I start?
-Yes.

483
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:49,079
On October 13th, NMIXX is coming out

484
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:52,549
with our first full-length album,
<i>Blue Valentine.</i>

485
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:56,453
<i>Blue Valentine </i>is… I forgot the word.

486
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,587
Ambivalent.

487
00:27:57,654 --> 00:28:00,056
-The ambivalent emotions of love.
-Ambivalent.

488
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:01,591
-Ambivalent.
-I'm sorry.

489
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:04,261
-I memorized it. I really did.
-Okay.

490
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:08,031
We are coming out
with NMIXX's first full-length album

491
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:10,667
called <i>Blue Valentine.</i>

492
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,669
It's about ambi-sense.

493
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,337
-Ambivalent.
-Ambivalent.

494
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,972
-Ambivalent.
-Ambi-night.

495
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,775
-Ambivalent.
-Ambivalent!

496
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:20,810
-Ambivalent.
-I'm sorry. Ambivalent.

497
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,012
-About love.
-Right.

498
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:25,415
The album explores the ambivalent emotions
that come with love.

499
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:29,319
When people fall in love,

500
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:34,658
they experience all kinds of emotions
and inner conflicts.

501
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:36,526
This album expresses that.

502
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:42,699
We'd also like to hear your thoughts
on today's shoot.

503
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:44,000
How was it for you?

504
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,336
Well, today…

505
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:49,072
I think he read all of them.
Look at that pile.

506
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:50,540
He was speed-reading.

507
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:53,743
-There were a lot of books on that side.
-The details are crazy.

508
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,313
-They were on his left.
-The attention to detail…

509
00:28:56,379 --> 00:29:00,350
There were things I didn't understand,
but there were a lot of funny moments too.

510
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,019
So I think viewers will enjoy this show.

511
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:08,091
Please say a few words to Elizabeth,
the bug you killed today.

512
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,060
Let's see.

513
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:12,696
Elizabeth…

514
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:18,735
I'm all about world peace,
and I really hate violence.

515
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:19,970
Violence.

516
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:22,572
That's right. I really hate violence.

517
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:29,512
So I feel really bad
for taking a life so suddenly.

518
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,650
I heard she was a bug you cared about,
so I'm really sorry.

519
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:36,219
In her next life,

520
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:40,824
I hope she's reincarnated
as something better.

521
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:45,462
