- Is it over now? - Yes.

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,589

Hee Doo thought I was going to choose Ji Yeon for him.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,909
But he was probably surprised that I chose Ji Soo.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,049
But back then, the feelings I had...

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,750
I was so pathetic.

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,719
He was truly excited to spend time with Ji Yeon.

13
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,919
I should have let him go on a date with Ji Yeon...

if that's what he wanted.

But I couldn't bring myself up to do that.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,358
What can I do? That's what he wants.

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,060
Hae Eun, do you want to go outside and talk for a bit?

18
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,060
Wait. Take that with you.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,328
What? Oh, that.

20
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,629
- Hae Eun, take the whole thing. - I'll take it.

24

What a surprise. You actually asked me to talk to you first.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,109
- Sit down. - I'm so cold.

Why are you laughing?

28
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,530
You seem relieved after making that decision.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,029
Right. Last week, he said he might hate her...

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,629
if she didn't pick Na Yeon for his date.

31

- Do you feel relieved? - Yes?

32
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,840
- Because you chose Na Eon? - Yes.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,739
Okay.

34
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,480
- I'll try to be understanding. - Do I seem relieved?

35
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,849
You seem much better.

36
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,079
Right. I do feel a lot better in a way.

37
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,590
I can see that.

38
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,450
But I can promise you this.

39
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,120
I won't...

40
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,459
hate you or resent you because of this.

41
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,499
- Thank you. - I'll try to be understanding...

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,799
if this makes you feel better.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,999
- Thank you. - By the way, you seemed at ease...

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,240
- after making that decision. - I am relieved.

45
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,969
If I picked Na Yeon for you, I would have hated myself.

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,209
- I can tell you feel better now. - I feel better.

47
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,150
It's so obvious to me.

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,279
I found that really funny.

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,478
I'm happy about it.

50
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,550
If I picked Na Yeon...

51
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:28,990
Would you have regretted it?

52
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,318
Of course.

53
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,759
This would have bothered me for 48 hours. Today and tomorrow.

54
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,090
Actually,

55
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,460
I said some things to her to make the best of my situation.

56
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,229
"If you don't pick Na Yeon for me,"

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
"I might hate you for it." I got the feeling...

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,210
that what I said really hurt her.

59
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,039
I talked to her that night, so I could smooth things out.

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,949
I really want to stop crying.

61
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,448
Why do you keep crying?

62
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,149
I became such a crybaby because of you.

63
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,860
Why did you cry so much after your fun date?

64
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,590
What's the point?

65
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,829
You're crying again.

66
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,430
Hey, are you crying?

67
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,468
Na Yeon did that.

68
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,740
That's not true.

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Na Yeon didn't do this.

70
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,968
- Everyone does this. - Everyone does it?

71
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,610
- Yes. This is a meme. - No, she asked me that a lot.

72
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,209
- I know it's a meme. - You do?

73
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,179
- Don't give me that. - Okay, fine. I won't do it.

74
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,448
I'll keep using the same tissue.

75
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,479
Okay. Keep using that. Here's the last one.

76
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,650
Did you have a good time on your date today?

77
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,189
I did.

78
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,189
You said it was fun.

79
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,530
You kept bragging about it.

80
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,330
For the first time,

81
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,599
I didn't think about you.

82
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,669
It definitely refreshed me.

83
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,939
What was really annoying was...

84
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,839
I couldn't stop thinking about you and how you went out with Na Yeon.

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,310
Again.

86
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,580
To be honest, I only want to get back together with Gyu Min.

87
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,619
When he kept pushing me to pick Na Yeon, it was hurtful...

88
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,389
because I still have a lot of feelings for Gyu Min.

89
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,859
So I didn't talk about Hyun Gyu.

90
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,759
I just wanted to get back together with Gyu Min.

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,759
You should have fun here.

92
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,959
- I should have fun here? - Yes.

93
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,599
- If you don't, it won't be fair. - "I should have fun?"

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,299
What are you talking about?

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,569
Why are you...

96
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,600
talking like we're strangers?

97
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,040
You can smoke here.

98
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,379
You can pretend that I'm not here.

99
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,740
I'll smoke a cigarette and go.

100
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,879
I'll go inside.

101
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,448
Do you want to stay here?

102
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,919
- Why? I'll leave. - No, I'm cold.

103
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,518
- No. He'll feel bad. - No. I'll leave.

104
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,289
- Hey, don't make him feel bad. - I'll leave.

Besides, I thought we had an agreement.

But it was my decision.

131

Then why did you ask me?

To keep your opinion in mind.

I wasn't acting proud.

136

Why is everything about pride to you?

137
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,290
- Because you always act proud. - Is pride all you think about?

138
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,629
I never acted proud in front of you here.

You totally did.

140

Do you really not know that?

141
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,568
Maybe, you're the one acting proud. That's why you're saying that.

142
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,268
You're the one thinking about pride.

143
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,739
What is there for me to act proud about here?

144
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,809
Then you wouldn't have said anything...

145
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,809
- when I came back after my date. - Right.

- But you did. - When?

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,809
When I got back with Gyu Min, you said something too.

148
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,278
You said you wouldn't have done what I did if you were me.

00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,378
You said you didn't like it when I went on dates.

I never said that.

- If you didn't talk to me... - Shouldn't you be doing that?

If you told me that you didn't have any feelings...

- I do. - for me...

155
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,628
- I do. But that's allowed here. - Acting like that when you do...

156
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,028
- is a problem here. - That's what this show is for.

That's allowed here.

00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,579
Then you should date a girl who doesn't do what I do.

163
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,338
You're putting people...

164
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,979
who miss their exes...

165
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,479
and want to get back...

166
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,018
- with their exes on a pedestal. - No.

167
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,219
That's because you don't understand the purpose of this show.

168
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,519
What's the purpose of this show?

169
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,719
We're supposed to meet someone new.

170
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,489
That's why they created this show.

171
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,719
We either meet someone new...

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,028
or start afresh. But this is...

173
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,430
You don't want to start afresh with someone.

174
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
I do.

175
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:39,229
- But this isn't a fresh start. - You said you didn't want that.

176
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,768
- This is just a vicious cycle. - You said you didn't want that.

177
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,198
- Right. - I want a fresh start.

178
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,469
But how can I do that?

179
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,939
When you and I haven't changed?

180
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,250
Seriously. I can never get through to her.

181
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,660
Why are you still here? I can't talk to you in here.

182
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,100
My goodness.

183
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,240
- Gosh. Is this a fight or what? - Seriously.

184
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,708
If they are willing to make a small compromise,

185
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,438
- they'll be perfect together. - Right.

186
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,948
There are three types of love. Physical love, platonic love,

187
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,109
and love between those two.

188
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,080
- Love between them? - Those are the three types.

189
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,148
- Three... Yes. - Physical, platonic, and them.

190
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,149
- Right. And them. That's it. - Hee Doo and Na Yeon.

191
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,558
She acted as if she was going to end it,

192
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,719
- but she chose Ji Soo. - Again.

193
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,189
- Right. - I thought it was over,

194
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,489
but he came back.

195
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,928
- I wish one of them was flexible. - Right.

196
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,700
- Both of them are so stubborn. - Right.

197
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,669
Whenever they act stubborn, it always breaks their relationship.

198
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,370
- If one of them was more flexible, - Right.

199
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,479
They might be perfect for each other.

200
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,508
- You know? - Just for a bit.

201
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,080
- Seriously. Just for a bit. - Just for a bit. Really.

202
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,679
Why are you still here? I can't talk to you in here.

203
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,379
It's too hot. It's making me angrier.

204
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,549
Let's go.

205
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,590
(They go to Hee Doo's room.)

206
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,028
Can I join you guys?

207
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,000
- Come join us. - Yes?

208
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,869
Do you feel comfortable around here now?

209
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,668
- Yes, I now feel comfortable. - You do?

210
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,109
Doesn't time fly here?

211
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,509
Time really flies.

212
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,509
(Ji Yeon lets them talk in private.)

213
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,820
- We took a lot of nice photos. - Right.

214
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,350
I just saw them.

215
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,250
Do you want me to take a photo of you?

216
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,889
You're posing right away.

217
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,570
In 1, 2, 3. We got it.

218
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,469
We look nice in this photo too.

219
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,768
You really look good in this one.

220
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,110
- You think so? - You don't think so?

221
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,878
I look good in every photo. I was just joking.

222
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,138
- I was... - You might be thinking...

223
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,679
you look better in real life.

224
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,779
(What do you think your date with him will be like tomorrow?)

225
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,619
From what I can tell, Gyu Min...

226
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,959
might start the conversations.

227
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,320
And he will help me feel comfortable.

228
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,990
I think he will be gentle and polite.

229
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,230
(Na Yeon and Hee Doo are still talking.)

230
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,569
Then you shouldn't have asked me at first. That's why I asked you.

231
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,639
I didn't want to talk to you unless we had to.

232
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,268
So I asked you if you were going to decide...

233
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,709
- on your own. - Remember what I said?

234
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,110
- I said no. - You said you would.

235
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,378
It wasn't our decision to make.

236
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,508
- Listen. - I was supposed to choose...

237
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,080
after hearing you out. That's what I said.

238
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,278
- I kept telling you that. - So...

239
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,518
- I had to pick after we talked. - You're dancing around the issue.

240
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,888
That's why I kept asking you why.

241
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,148
- You're avoiding the core issue. - That's what I did.

242
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,619
But you said you were just comfortable with Ji Yeon.

243
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,889
Goodness. Your voice...

244
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,590
What am I supposed to do? I don't understand you at all.

245
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,230
Exactly. Let's not talk about it. Let's just move on.

246
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,969
That's your pride talking too.

247
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,070
Did I go to your room because I was acting proud?

248
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,469
I went to talk to you.

249
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,869
But we can't seem to understand each other.

250
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,969
How come you don't understand me?

251
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,069
You always talk...

252
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,378
- without listening to me. - Don't lose your temper.

253
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,408
Why do you always lose your temper?

254
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:14,148
Everything you say doesn't make sense.

255
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,678
Exactly. Why do you keep acting out?

256
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,749
You assume things in my place.

257
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,279
If this is going to continue, let's not talk.

258
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,489
I'll be honest. This conversation never seems to end.

259
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,889
Right. It doesn't. I know that.

260
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,960
- Nothing has changed. - Yes.

261
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,199
- Do you know why? - It's probably because of me.

262
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,839
- No. Do you know why? - Because I'm not thoughtful.

263
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,699
It's not simply about not being thoughtful.

264
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,069
I get it. It's because I'm not behaving properly.

265
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,038
But some people find the way I behave pleasant.

266
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,378
And a lot of people don't care.

267
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,779
If that's what you think...

268
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,579
That's why even if you criticized me,

269
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,579
I tried to put up with it. But this is hard on me too.

270
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,589
We broke up because that was tough on me.

271
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,120
But I'm doing the same thing here.

272
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,889
Are you my dad?

273
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,230
Do other people here criticize or lecture me?

274
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,259
You're not here to throw a tantrum.

275
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,629
Are you here to complain to me?

276
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,058
Does it sound like I'm complaining to you?

277
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,699
It sounds like you're taking it out on me.

278
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,469
No. I told you. I feel pathetic when I'm with you.

279
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,970
I still feel pathetic. You just hate me.

280
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,339
You just hate who I am. But you love me,

281
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,808
so you try to change me.

282
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,048
But you can't change me, so you always criticize me.

283
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,509
You humiliate me, look down on me, and lecture me.

284
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,849
This won't work out...

285
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,178
because you think I'm doing it to humiliate you.

286
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,949
So I'm telling you that I don't want to do this.

287
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,089
I really hope you won't do that in front of other people.

288
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,518
But you do that in front of everyone.

289
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,758
I bet they can picture how I had been treated...

290
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,859
when we were together.

291
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,259
I bet that's what they are thinking. I'm sure of it.

292
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,329
- I doubt that. - No.

293
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,829
But they all know that you look down on me. That's for sure.

294
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,240
So you were looked down on for four years.

295
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,569
- Right. That's why we broke up. - Right.

296
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,209
You dated me for four years when I looked down on you.

297
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,209
Of course, you were good to me too.

298
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,779
Okay. I got it. That's enough now.

299
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,379
Then you know what? Just mind your own business here.

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,089
Here's what I want. I want us to be happy together.

301
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,819
If that's what you want, you can behave better.

302
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
You need to work on yourself too.

303
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,229
I'm not the only one who needs to do that.

304
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,329
- I don't want to try... - That's why...

305
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,899
because you won't improve.

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,459
Because of the way you act,

307
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,729
- we won't work out. - All the small things you do.

308
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,969
It's because of your belief.

309
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,700
You won't even try to change because I can't change.

310
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,639
We should end it here.

311
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:24,178
It's because we can't think from each other's point of view.

312
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,439
I know why you do that.

313
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,008
I only asked you to change the way you expressed your feelings.

314
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,580
I changed my method in the beginning.

315
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,480
- And this is after you changed it? - Yes. "You know I'm like that."

316
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:35,049
Then you move on and repeat the same thing.

317
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,720
I know you.

318
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,789
Then leave me alone.

319
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,489
- So... - Don't try to change me.

320
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,759
That's why I want to let you be now.

321
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,600
I couldn't let you go...

322
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,730
because I know why you did that.

323
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,099
If you still did it after knowing why,

324
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,168
- what am I supposed to do? - I know. But it drives me crazy...

325
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,369
hundreds of times whenever I hear that.

326
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,609
What did I tell you hundreds of times a day?

327
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,839
Stop exaggerating.

328
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,378
You weren't even aware what you were doing earlier.

329
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,148
Earlier? I did that because I didn't like the way you behaved...

330
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,418
from start to finish.

331
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,178
- Because you didn't like... - If you and I were dating,

332
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,589
- I wouldn't have done that. - the way...

333
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,589
I didn't like that, and I had my reasons too.

334
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,928
Listen. You told me not to push you away.

335
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,288
Then you went on a date with him all day.

336
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,658
When you were passing by me,

337
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,059
- did you really want to say hi? - I...

338
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,869
I wouldn't have done that because I would've been embarrassed.

339
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,069
To be honest, I didn't think...

340
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,798
I wouldn't have done it because I would've been embarrassed.

341
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,398
It was nothing.

342
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,638
That shows what kind of person you are.

343
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,538
I didn't make a fuss when you went on a date,

344
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,539
and vice versa.

345
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,479
Exactly. If you really didn't care...

346
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,509
about me, this wouldn't have been an issue.

347
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,189
I thought both of us weren't bothered by this. So...

348
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,189
Don't say it was both of us. Don't think on my behalf.

349
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,889
That was probably your wish.

350
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,158
You weren't wearing the bracelet.

351
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,229
And you put it on again today because of your date with Ji Yeon.

352
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,258
I put it on yesterday.

353
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:52,128
You put it on when we arrived here. You made sure you wore it.

354
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:56,370
So what? To be honest, I wasn't even thinking about it.

355
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,340
You weren't thinking about it, but you went back and put it on.

356
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,369
- Then you went surfing with her. - I...

357
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,580
- To be honest, I was upset. - Other guys...

358
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,710
But I let you go because I thought we were on the same page.

359
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,019
Then let me be. Don't bring that up.

360
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,349
This is why we can't work out. It's the way you talk to me.

361
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,149
Right. I know what I just said wasn't nice.

362
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,320
But I really don't want to do this anymore.

363
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,629
You should date Gyu Min if you like him.

364
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,158
To be honest with you,

365
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,470
I could only think about you the moment I saw you.

366
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,239
- I want us to work out. - Don't give me that nonsense.

367
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,539
I want us to work out.

368
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,909
If that's what you wanted, how could you act like that?

369
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,178
No. I want us to get back together, but you're not cooperating.

370
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,179
Okay.

371
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,018
I really don't think we should get back together...

372
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,279
after repeating the same problem.

373
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,548
I was hurt by everything he said.

374
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,190
So I don't remember much.

375
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,758
We just couldn't understand each other.

376
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,389
No matter how much I tried to share what I thought,

377
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,399
Hee Doo won't listen to me.

378
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,370
I'll go inside. Goodnight.

379
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:09,870
She asked to borrow my makeup. Hey, Na Yeon.

380
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,909
Why did you cry?

381
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:13,980
It's obvious you cried.

382
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,878
No. I didn't cry.

383
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,509
Why did you cry, Hae Eun?

384
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,178
- Hae Eun. - I don't hate you or anything.

385
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,389
- You should never be sorry. - I know.

386
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,018
You know how I feel, right?

387
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,989
I just couldn't make that decision voluntarily.

388
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,989
- Gosh, Hae Eun. It's okay. - That's all.

389
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,798
- That's all. - Thank you for doing that.

390
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,929
No.

391
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:36,399
Actually, I did whatever I wanted too.

392
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,539
Then why did you choose Ji Soo?

393
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,710
He wanted to go on a date with Ji Yeon.

394
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,579
- Really? Then you can't let him. - But...

395
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,679
The fact that they had matching bracelets was hurtful.

396
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,980
Actually, I was tempted to get to know Gyu Min deeper.

397
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,048
But I thought I was being absurd for not letting him...

398
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,720
go on a date with other women.

399
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,918
By the way, Gyu Min is such a nice guy.

400
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,258
He's great. Hae Eun, he's a cool guy.

401
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,259
You think so?

402
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,598
It looked like he was a good influence on you.

403
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,240
Right. He was. He practically raised me.

404
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,139
By the way, Hee Doo did too.

405
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,109
- Really? - So I was more understanding.

406
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,039
- Really? - Yes.

407
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,609
I'm really grateful to Gyu Min. He's like a dad to me.

408
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,880
But that's a huge part of my life.

409
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,949
His presence is like this big shadow.

410
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,749
And I can't think about my life without him.

411
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,650
You guys were together for 6 to 7 years.

412
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,059
That's why I still have feelings for him.

413
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,390
What about you? How do you feel now?

414
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,598
You guys were just friends when we started.

415
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,369
What made you see her in a romantic light?

416
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:44,440
When she smiled, it brought back memories of our relationship.

417
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,839
It was really nice to see her smile like that.

418
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,239
I was reminded of my feelings how I cared for her.

419
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,880
Ji Soo told me she felt like she was transported back...

420
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,549
to her college days whenever she talked to you.

421
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,618
But she wasn't the same person anymore.

422
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,618
And even I wouldn't like it...

423
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,589
if people kept bringing up my past before I changed.

424
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,018
Right.

425
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,959
Let's say that I got plastic surgery...

426
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,660
and became a completely different person.

427
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,400
What you did was showing me a photo of me before my surgery.

428
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,329
That's how Ji Soo could have felt.

429
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,209
I want to let her go now too.

430
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,439
Right.

431
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,609
I really want to let her go.

432
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,880
- I'm still caught up in our past. - Right.

433
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:29,880
I know that too.

434
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,879
Instead of bringing up the past,

435
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,849
you must show her that you have changed.

436
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,249
- You're such a cool guy. Come on. - You're cool too.

437
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,789
You're cooler.

438
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,720
Thank you so much.

439
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,559
I'm relieved.

440
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,799
- Won Bin. - Yes.

441
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,430
I'm more grateful.

442
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,000
(She came out to check the temperature of the pool.)

443
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,768
Wait, this is warm water. Do you want to go in?

444
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,068
- Really? - Is it really warm?

445
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,980
- Then I'll go change. - I'm going in.

446
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,680
But... Hey, let's go. I'll go change.

447
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,008
- It's really warm. - I'm going in.

448
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,249
- I'll go change. - I'll go change too.

449
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,818
- Okay. Proceed! - Let's proceed.

450
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,420
- Let's proceed. - Let's go!

451
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:14,630
- Change right now. - Is it warm?

452
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,189
- Are you sure? - Put on your swimsuits now.

453
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,959
But I'm so full. This is crazy.

454
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,558
I want to swim because I'm full.

455
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,699
- Change right now. Come on. - Really?

456
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,200
Change your clothes here.

457
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,429
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

458
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,099
I love it. Digesting the food before going to sleep is great.

459
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,380
(The swimming pool opens at nighttime.)

460
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,450
(The swimmers gather one at a time.)

461
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,619
It's slightly cold.

462
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
- Aren't you cold? - It's not bad.

463
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,729
It will be fun with four people. We can play a game.

464
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,798
This is warm.

465
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,599
- I told you. - It's warm.

466
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,299
Let's do this.

467
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,740
Hey, wake Hee Doo up.

468
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,539
You're pretty good.

469
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,509
- Hey, this is so fun. - I told you it would be fun.

470
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,920
(Na Yeon and Hae Eun join them.)

471
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,289
Should we? Let's go and try this.

472
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,490
It's so cold. I can't do it.

473
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,430
I'm such a scaredy-cat.

474
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,699
- But it's so cold. - Let's go to the dry sauna.

475
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,828
Let's come back later.

476
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:29,969
Should we go back in?

477
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,798
- It's so cold. - Should we go in?

478
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,799
- We should run. - You cowards.

479
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,210
It's so cold.

480
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,868
Close the door.

481
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,380
You guys need towels.

482
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,049
- But this is fun. - Right.

483
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,479
But Gyu Min...

484
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,318
He's handsome. I thought he was going...

485
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,018
to be the most popular one.

486
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,319
Tae I is the best-looking one.

487
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,159
She said Tae I was the best-looking one.

488
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,460
She said her ex was the best-looking one among them.

489
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,298
I guess they feel really comfortable around each other.

490
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,630
- They're talking out in the open. - Right.

491
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,768
But Gyu Min...

492
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,598
He's handsome. I thought he was going...

493
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,268
to be the most popular one.

494
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:08,308
Tae I is the best-looking one.

495
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,608
- I think it's Hee Doo. - You all chose your ex.

496
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,339
You all chose your ex as the best-looking one.

497
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,779
- Tae I is handsome. - Gyu Min is handsome.

498
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,250
Tae I is handsome.

499
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,048
He's so handsome.

500
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,549
He's the best-looking one by far.

501
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,289
But isn't Gyu Min the best-looking one by far?

502
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,558
Hold on. She's in love right now.

503
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,460
I'm being objective. When you only look at his face.

504
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,429
Hee Doo is attractive.

505
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,299
- Isn't Hee Doo handsome too? - He's so manly.

506
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,828
- What? - You can press that.

507
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,229
(They go back to their room at dawn.)

508
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,430
- My room. - Is it this one?

509
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,839
- Take your time. I'm all right. - I'm all wet.

510
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,309
(She's looking at the photos she took with Hyun Gyu.)

511
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,079
- Did you wash up? - Yes.

512
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,990
By the way, I think Hyun Gyu is really nice.

513
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,489
That was sudden. You think he's nice?

514
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,919
- I easily get cold. - Okay.

515
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,629
So I really like people...

516
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,559
who have a lot of body heat and warm hands.

517
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,358
And we were looking at the sea at night.

518
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,229
I was freezing, and he gave me his cardigan.

519
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,169
He was only wearing a short-sleeve shirt.

520
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,338
But his arms were so warm.

521
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,640
That was so interesting.

522
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,739
He's nice. He always tries to be nice.

523
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,838
Let's say he really likes you.

524
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,879
Then he tries to do everything you want to do.

525
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,909
That's unexpected.

526
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,919
- He seemed really reserved. - Right?

527
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,949
I don't think he expresses his feelings openly.

528
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,420
You're his type.

529
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,389
Actually, men who only wear tracksuits are my type.

530
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,558
What?

531
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,889
The only thing he does is work out.

532
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,259
He only wore workout clothes when we were together.

533
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,659
By the way, he doesn't dress up like this.

534
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,798
I told you that I used to criticize him at first.

535
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,929
That was why.

536
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,369
I did that because he only wore workout clothes.

537
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,598
- Really? - Yes.

538
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,509
I had never seen him dress up like this ever.

539
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:52,639
You can guess his type, right? He doesn't dress up often.

540
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,479
He's like a kid from the US who dresses casually.

541
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,379
That's why people criticized me too.

542
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,150
I only wore tracksuits and didn't dress up.

543
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,118
- That's crazy. - I said that to him.

544
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,788
Then he and I are so similar.

545
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,460
So he doesn't dress up at all.

546
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,459
He doesn't care about his looks.

547
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,788
He's just like me because...

548
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,288
I don't see a reason behind dressing up.

549
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,199
I got goosebumps. Do you know why I got goosebumps?

550
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,129
"I look handsome even when I don't dress up. So why should I?"

551
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,969
Right. I told him something similar today.

552
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,440
I didn't think we would be this similar. But we really are.

553
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,538
I like him more and more after talking to you.

554
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,150
I think I have a shot at being happy.

555
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,278
Really?

556
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,349
Gosh. He knows his way around my heart.

557
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,849
That's crazy.

558
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,119
(The morning breaks as they chat all night.)

559
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,759
Hee Doo.

560
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,170
(Hae Eun is the only one who heard Na Yeon talk in her sleep.)

561
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,970
My gosh.

562
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,140
She was talking in her sleep?

563
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,709
- What did she say? - Oh, no.

564
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,709
- She was talking in her sleep? - She said his name in her sleep.

565
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,079
- She said his name in her sleep? - Right.

566
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,348
- Oh, no. - That's heartbreaking.

567
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,149
Is she in one-sided love or what?

568
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,749
- He's all she can think about. - Right. Totally.

569
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,789
- He must be on her mind. - Right.

570
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,389
- Oh, my. - She said his name in her sleep...

571
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,089
- just like that. - Then Hae Eun heard her, right?

572
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,500
- Are you going to work out? - Yes.

573
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,838
I'll be back.

574
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,609
- Have a good workout. - Bye.

575
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,230
I slept so well.

576
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,499
- What? - I slept so well.

577
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Seriously.

578
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,098
Do you want to hear something funny?

579
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:09,440
I went to sleep late because I had to wash my hair.

580
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,569
You were talking in your sleep.

581
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,940
"Hee Doo." That's what you said.

582
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,250
Did you two fight in your dream? I'm curious.

583
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,479
I called out his name in my sleep?

584
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,518
Yes.

585
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,588
- That's crazy. - Did you two fight?

586
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,220
You have to tell Hee Doo that.

587
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,389
I will.

588
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,429
Is that how you call him? "Hee Doo."

589
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,459
"Hee Doo."

590
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,230
"Hee Doo." That was cute.

591
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,758
Did I sound cute?

592
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,699
- No. - Was there warmth in my voice?

593
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,499
It didn't sound like that. "Hee Doo."

594
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,099
Then we must have fought in my dream.

595
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,740
- Hi. - Let's go.

596
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,809
- Did you sleep well? - Yes. I fell asleep right away.

597
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,679
- What about you? - I slept well too.

598
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,009
We're going fishing today.

599
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,078
- Really? - Have you gone fishing before?

600
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,150
No.

601
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,579
Thank you.

602
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,389
- Let's go. - Let's go.

603
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,420
(Hae Eun and Hyun Gyu's date, chosen by his ex)

604
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,289
Let's go.

605
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,599
I love it. This is great.

606
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,000
It's the ocean.

607
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,139
- Are you all right? - Wait.

608
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,680
- What? Me? Why? - Yes.

609
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,410
Just because.

610
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,309
You didn't seem happy.

611
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,279
Is that so?

612
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,490
(Last night)

613
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,788
- Don't cry. - You startled me.

614
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:34,890
I am not crying.

615
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,589
- You cried in the end. - I am not crying.

616
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,750
I didn't want you to see me crying or sad.

617
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,450
Seriously.

618
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,319
So I'm really sorry about that. I'm sorry.

619
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,119
It's okay.

620
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,359
It happens.

621
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,660
He must have been your first love.

622
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,599
Right.

623
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,200
I would have been like you too.

624
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,539
There's nothing I can do for you.

625
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,409
No. You helped me a lot yesterday.

626
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,309
I mean it. You made me so happy.

627
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,150
- I should be sorry. - I think...

628
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,750
you need a bit more time.

629
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,150
Time.

630
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,459
I didn't know I would be like this.

631
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,088
I really thought I moved on.

632
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,390
I was really happy.

633
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,598
- It would have been tough on me... - I...

634
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,400
- if I saw my first love like that. - Really?

635
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,609
You did it again. You made me cry this time.

636
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,950
- You made me cry. - No, don't cry.

637
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:09,619
My first love was intense too. So I know how you feel.

638
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,359
I dated a girl in high school.

639
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,359
I cried a lot back then too.

640
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,329
- Really? - Yes.

641
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,969
Na Eon wasn't my first love.

642
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,730
I had my first love too.

643
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,569
But the feeling I had when my first love ended...

644
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,710
still remains with me.

645
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,420
So I knew why Hae Eun cried.

646
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,349
I could relate to her the most about that.

647
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,619
(During the preliminary meeting)

648
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,659
It was really hard on me...

649
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,788
when I broke up with my first love after high school.

650
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,159
It was really tough on me.

651
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,959
I couldn't ask her to stay with me. She was far away too.

652
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,229
And I went about the wrong way too.

653
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,039
I clang on to her and was selfish.

654
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,500
I cried like a madman.

655
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,509
I dropped tens of kilograms too.

656
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,339
I didn't eat or go outside.

657
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,609
It took me years to get over her...

658
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,619
even when I never saw her again.

659
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,788
If I were to see my first love...

660
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,960
to spend time with another man...

661
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,089
Just thinking about it breaks my heart.

662
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,859
I think what she's going through...

663
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,500
is similar to what I went through.

664
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,999
Did you think you'd be okay before the show?

665
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,069
Yes.

666
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,869
I told them that I prepared several hearts.

667
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,539
- You must have left them behind. - Right.

668
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,710
I only had one heart.

669
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,440
Maybe, you left that too.

670
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,309
No. I'll get another heart.

671
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,220
There was only one heart.

672
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,420
But I'll get another one.

673
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,450
I think I will.

674
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,389
Wasn't it hard after breaking up with your first love?

675
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,288
- It was incredibly tough. - Seriously.

676
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,358
- My heart ached. - Right.

677
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,598
- It was like my heart was gone. - By "first love,"

678
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,729
- it's not your first girlfriend. - The woman he loved.

679
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,828
- The woman you truly loved. - The woman I loved.

680
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:03,429
The first person I loved.

681
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,430
- I... - Not my first relationship.

682
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:05,699
I couldn't reach her once.

683
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,599
So I realized for the first time that my heart was pounding.

684
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,939
She couldn't simply answer my call.

685
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,379
She was unable to pick up her phone, but I got so nervous.

686
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,939
- Were you worried? - In case something happened to her.

687
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,809
- You were worried? - So...

688
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,449
- I realized that it was love. - This...

689
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,649
- "Is this love?" - Yes.

690
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,048
- That's the power of love. - That's what I thought.

691
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,489
Seriously. You end up skipping your meals.

692
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,289
- You don't eat after a breakup. - Right.

693
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,660
After that breakup,

694
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:29,289
I wrote the song, "Lonely Night." It's one of my songs.

695
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,588
I wrote that as soon as I broke up with my first love.

696
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,159
I didn't have a way to express my feelings.

697
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,098
- "Lonely Night?" I'll check it out. - Yes, "Lonely Night."

698
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,430
- It goes like this. Lonely night - He must've been very lonely.

699
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,899
And he can understand Hae Eun's pain.

700
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,170
- Right. - He knows her pain.

701
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,739
He's digging into his own experience...

702
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,008
to understand Hae Eun.

703
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:48,008
- He's so sympathetic. - He's only 25 years old.

704
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,609
She won't think he's just a younger guy after this.

705
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,319
- He's more mature than his age. - Right.

706
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,279
It's the way he thinks.

707
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,420
- Have you been on a fishing boat? - No.

708
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,660
This is my first time.

709
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,890
This looks fun.

710
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:09,869
Put your arms in.

711
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,039
(Smiling)

712
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,369
Let's take a photo.

713
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:21,039
Gosh. My hair looks awful.

714
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:22,349
No. It looks great.

715
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,789
- They make such a cute couple. - Yes.

716
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,989
- They look good together. - They make a nice couple.

717
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,789
- They're the best-looking couple. - They look so good.

718
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,558
- Why do they look so good together? - They should start dating.

719
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,098
- Please. - They only took a selfie.

720
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,759
- Why are you all commenting? - They look so good together.

721
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,699
- Why? - I hope the boat rocks,

722
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,269
and he catches her like this.

723
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,240
- And put his hand on her back? - "Are you all right, Hae Eun?"

724
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,940
If it shows up, I'm going to pause there.

725
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,480
We'll set out now, weighing anchor.

726
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,109
Let's go.

727
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,779
- This looks fun. - Okay.

728
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,809
- I'm excited for some reason. - Right?

729
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,680
Gosh, I love it.

730
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,920
- Do you know how to swim? - Of course.

731
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,049
I can even rescue you.

732
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,660
Trust me.

733
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,259
I'm really good at swimming.

734
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,799
This is like the movie, "Titanic."

735
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,400
I love it.

736
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:17,400
This is amazing.

737
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,940
- This is why people love the ocean. - I love it!

738
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,568
I have to do deadlifts here.

739
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,140
- Deadlifts? - Yes. Deadlifts.

740
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:27,980
I can't lift heavy things.

741
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:31,049
(Hyun Gyu hurt his arm while exercising.)

742
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,380
I can't even lift a dumbbell.

743
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,480
I couldn't lift chopsticks at first.

744
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,890
Really?

745
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,390
I'll be your right arm.

746
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,460
My left arm is strong.

747
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,029
It felt nice.

748
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,999
We sat at the head of the beat while talking to each other.

749
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,659
Watching the boat sail on the water was pleasant.

750
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,368
And more importantly, Hae Eun really likes the ocean.

751
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:52,399
Instead of just looking at the ocean,

752
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,640
we were on it. So she seemed happier.

753
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,240
I was excited even on our way there.

754
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,139
We were looking at an unobstructed view.

755
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,250
And the wind from the ocean was so refreshing.

756
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,750
So getting there was a nice trip.

757
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,590
- Your hands are so warm. - They are.

758
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,690
Feel mine. Aren't they so cold?

759
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,789
Aren't my hands warm?

760
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,329
- Gosh. - What?

761
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,859
- This is nice. - It's nice to see them together.

762
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,968
She said she liked guys whose hands were warm.

763
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,169
- Right. - They keep holding hands.

764
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,599
They have to hold hands before they start fishing.

765
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:30,039
It will smell pretty fish once they touch the bait.

766
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,209
I'm serious.

767
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,340
- The bait is really fishy. - They should hold hands in advance.

768
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,110
They should do that first. Nice.

769
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,349
- Why am I getting excited? - Nice.

770
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,380
- Your hands are so warm. - They are.

771
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,389
Feel mine. Aren't they so cold?

772
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,590
Aren't my hands warm?

773
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,058
It happened very naturally.

774
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,459
Her hands and feet are cold by nature.

775
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,828
And she gets cold easily too.

776
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,468
But I have a lot of body heat and my hands are warm.

777
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,369
So we held hands just like two people on a date.

778
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,639
It made my heart flutter too.

779
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,869
I thought, "I can't believe I'm holding her hands here."

780
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,779
(They arrive at a fishing point.)

781
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,940
All right. Grab it.

782
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,078
And loosen the line, so there isn't a lot of resistance.

783
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,948
- Okay. I'll feel the pull, right? - Yes.

784
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:14,150
(He focuses on the fishing line.)

785
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,219
(All of a sudden, the fishing line unwinds fast.)

786
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,789
Wait. Didn't I get one?

787
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,090
You got a bite.

788
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,829
Is it a fish?

789
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,300
You can stop reeling it now.

790
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,499
Once they bite, you have to lift your fishing rod...

791
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,828
like this.

792
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,569
- I see. To the sky. - Grab this.

793
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,799
This is my first catch ever.

794
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,809
- How was it? Did you feel it? - Yes.

795
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,139
- This is fun. - Gosh.

796
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,110
- Show it to your girlfriend. - Girlfriend?

797
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,710
How...

798
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,250
It's stuck.

799
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,819
It keeps unwinding.

800
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,179
I was flustered.

801
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,190
I was shocked.

802
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,489
I guess we looked like a couple in his eyes.

803
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,159
Was it because we were so close?

804
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,360
I've never thought how we'd look in someone else's point of view.

805
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm not sure if we look good together. Not just yet.

806
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,800
(Concentrating)

807
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,538
It's here.

808
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,908
Reel it in.

809
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:11,909
Let me hold it for you.

810
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:14,409
It bit.

811
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,750
Reel it and reel it as you put it down.

812
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,979
Then pull it up. This one is big.

813
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,820
- It's heavy. - Hold it as you put it down.

814
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,618
- Pull it up. - Oh, no!

815
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,719
Then reel as you put it down.

816
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,960
Reel it and reel it as you put it down.

817
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,230
Your arm. Let me do it.

818
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,929
Then reel it.

819
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,928
- You can do it. - It won't go down.

820
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:37,129
Then pull it up. This one is big.

821
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,300
Then reel it as you put it down.

822
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,769
Let's move to this side.

823
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:43,610
Grab it. Oh, gosh!

824
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,139
(It escaped.)

825
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,848
- Did it get cut off? - It fell off.

826
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,349
Gosh, that's a bummer.

827
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,619
That was so close.

828
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,549
- This is fun. - It was really heavy, wasn't it?

829
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,590
Is your arm okay?

830
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,158
- Is your arm okay? - I couldn't use my strength at all.

831
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,519
- I'm sorry. - It's fine.

832
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,130
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

833
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,960
I caught a huge fish.

834
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,469
I felt bad...

835
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,238
for letting him use...

836
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,808
his arm that he had hurt.

837
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:19,979
I strained my right arm,

838
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,909
and Hae Eun was really worried.

839
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:24,379
You caught this?

840
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
(The captain's fresh gift)

841
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
- Is it good? - Yes.

842
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,659
Have this. You said you were hungry.

843
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,690
I was craving sashimi.

844
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,630
- It's good. - It's so good.

845
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:47,769
I could've caught...

846
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,009
Well done. I know. It was such a bummer.

847
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,639
I should've caught a big fish.

848
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,409
You might get addicted to fishing at this rate.

849
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,780
My arms are shaking. Aren't yours?

850
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,949
My wrist is.

851
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,618
Don't use chopsticks. I'll help you.

852
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,018
- I can use chopsticks. - Oh, really?

853
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,389
No, let me.

854
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,559
I'll give you the last piece.

855
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,159
Thanks.

856
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,260
Should we send them now?

857
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,369
- Hae Eun the Puppy? - How do I change the name?

858
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:23,069
I asked Tae I how I could change the name on the phone,

859
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,238
and he did it for me.

860
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,738
It was Hae Eun the Fool.

861
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,909
But he changed it to Hae Eun the Puppy.

862
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,780
Hae Eun the Puppy.

863
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,519
Can you change it for me?

864
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,630
(Hae Eun is no longer Hae Eun the Puppy.)

865

(Stumbling)

866
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,699
Watch out.

867
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,940
- I'm so shaky. - Why?

868
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,800
- I'm shaky. - Why?

869
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,309
- I mean the boat. - I see.

870
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,179
Did you think I said my heart fluttered?

871
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,409
Come on. Hey.

872
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,948
- He knows how to push and pull. - He knows how to make such jokes.

873
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,989
He knows how to flutter women's hearts.

874
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,759
He's good at expressing his feelings though.

875
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,158
- I know. - He is full of cute acts.

876
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,788
- That's right. He is. - He is full of cute acts.

877
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:16,829
That's his cute act.

878
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,989
I want to be fooled by Hyun Gyu once.

879

- I mean the boat. - I see.

Did you think I said my heart fluttered?

881
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,340
We got a little closer through fishing.

882
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,480
I had cried so much the day before,

883
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:38,510
so the time I spent with Hyun Gyu was so precious.

884
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,349
Hyun Gyu comforted me a lot.

885
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,888
It felt really therapeutic.

886
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:47,489
I didn't think much about Gyu Min then.

887
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,659
I was really happy and grateful.

888
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,230
It's raining

889

- Get in. - You're such a sweet guy.

You always say that.

It feels great. I don't feel sleepy with the sunroof open.

That's right. But it's more difficult than you think.

I really love sweet stuff.

I like things like mango, watermelon, and melon.

I can finish the whole watermelon.

but I think he's more well-mannered and considerate than I thought.

Compared to our first date,

we're getting to know each other more and becoming more compatible.

Do you think this is prettier?

1052

- I think this is better. - Sure.

Then you can take the difficult part and I'll take the easy part.

- You don't have to be thorough. - Oh, really?

1058
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,699
This much will be good enough.

1059

This looks too wide.

1060

- I ruined it. - No, you can keep going.

1061

You can do it on top.

1062

- Make it stronger. - Should I slow down?

Should I make it stronger?

1064

- Yes. - Got it.

1065
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,308
Once you put it in,

1066
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,440
- you must hold it straight. - I got it.

1067
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,849
That's good.

1068
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,860
It's cute.

1069
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,289
Can you take it out?

1070
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,329
You can do this much.

1071
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,868
I think he's really good at it.

1072
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:21,369
Watching him do it...

1073
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,609
made me think he's like a master. He was cool.

1074
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,839
- Here? - Yes.

1075
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,979
Should I do it like this or this?

1076
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,578
You said you'd use light blue for this,

1077
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,279
so we can use only light blue for this area.

1078
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,779
Let's just use this for the boundary.

1079
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,018
Which one do you think is prettier? This?

1080

- What? - Which one should I choose? This?

1081
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,190
- Like this? - You're so good at this.

1082
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,129
We can fill it straight now.

1083
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,399
What? You said you wanted to do it.

1084
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,099
I think I've done enough.

1085
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:58,070
From here to here.

1086

Only one person could take it.

1087

It'll become our memory,

1088
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:10,789
so I wanted to make it nice for her.

1089
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,158
We became more comfortable,

1090
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,459
and he treated me more comfortably...

1091
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,090
because he had feelings for me.

1092
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:22,598
- Only the edges are short. - Right. If you cut it too short...

1093
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:24,269
Because it wouldn't stick well?

1094
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,238
It's pretty, though, right? We did a good job.

1095

00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,149
- I'm curious about how you feel. - Me?

1109
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,919
How is it going for you these days?

1110
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,319
I'm still the same.

1111
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,429
Who do you like?

1112
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,359
- It's obvious. - Who? Na Yeon?

1113
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,429
Yes.

1114
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,030
We had fun on the date.

1115
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:33,369
Do you think Na Yeon felt the same way?

1116
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,969
I don't think so.

1117
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,840
Na Yeon is firm about it.

1118
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,710
She's more firm...

1119
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,250
about the other person than she is about me.

1120
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:45,610
- With Hee Doo? - Yes.

1121
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:48,980
I know.

1122
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,658
Na Yeon always looks after Hee Doo,

1123
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:56,988
and I could tell that she was caring from the little things she said.

1124
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:00,159
She shared way too much information she has about her ex...

1125
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,659
in front of everyone.

1126
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:07,099
It felt like she was stopping other girls from approaching him.

1127
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:11,339
I felt that way from the vibe...

1128
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,840
they gave off.

1129
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,309
When we're all gathered together,

1130
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,050
Hee Doo would scold Na Yeon.

1131
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:21,320
And seeing Na Yeon being upset about that...

1132
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,349
It seemed really natural.

1133
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,690
I thought their bond was strong.

1134
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:29,460
I'm not sure about you, though.

1135
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,730
Who do you like?

1136
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,090
Is it Hee Doo?

1137
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:36,230
- Take a guess. - Or is it Tae I?

1138
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,599
It's either Tae I or Hee Doo.

1139
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:40,699
I don't know.

1140
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,070
(Na Eon and Tae I, a commemorative photoshoot)

1141
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,739
Your feet don't touch the ground.

1142
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,909
Did you make that by yourself?

1143
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,479
- No. Oh... - You made it together?

1144
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,609
I made it.

1145
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,948
Try to look close. Put it in the center.

1146
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:57,489
Try to look close. That's it.

1147
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,889
Try to smile a little.

1148
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,960
Look at each other's faces. Good.

1149
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,199
Are we about to fight?

1150
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,268
Let's try to look good.

1151
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:16,268
- We're close. - No.

1152
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,808
Let's try to look sweet.

1153
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:18,868
Sure.

1154
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,440
Let's try to look sweet for once.

1155
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:21,880
Here we go.

1156
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,848
Look at each other. Smile a little.

1157
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:26,550
One more. One, two.

1158
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,219
Smile a little more.

1159
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:32,820
- Let's try it again. - This is embarrassing.

1160
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,759
You can take a selfie.

1161
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,229
- A selfie? - Yes.

1162
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,129
Press the button halfway.

1163
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,268
Pressing it halfway controls the focal point...

1164
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:46,429
and if you press it all the way, a photo gets taken.

1165
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,639
You should've caught the timing.

1166
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,869
(A set of awkward poses)

1167
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:57,049
- Don't you have your own pose? - No.

1168
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,178
Hurry. I did my part.

1169
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,979
Press it a little hard.

1170
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,279
I think it'll look nice.

1171
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,619
In 1, 2, 3.

1172
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,690
This is so comfortable, though.

1173
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,659
What?

1174
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,130
It's really comfortable.

1175
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:25,210
- I'm good, right? - You are.

1176
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,980
I think taking photos together...

1177
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,780
will be more memorable than tufting.

1178
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,059
It made my heart skip a beat a little.

1179
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,159
I was like this.

1180
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,159
It's licking my hand.

1181
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:48,959
Anggo!

1182

(A puppy, Anggo, has appeared.)

1183
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:53,369
My hands are dirty, though.

1184
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,099
You're so cute. You're happy, aren't you?

1185
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,380
You're so cute. You're so pretty.

1186
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,579
Anggo, what is this?

1187
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,149
It's so cute.

1188
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,210
What is this?

1189
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,619
Anggo, give me your nose.

1190
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:09,920
I want to bite it.

1191
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,518
I'll finish it.

1192
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:12,650
Anggo, give me your nose.

1193
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,859
Well done.

1194
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,820
- Well done. - It's so cute.

1195
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,690
Anggo, give me your paw.

1196
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:18,860
Try it, Tae I.

1197
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,059
(Anggo and us)

1198
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,070
You can sit on the floor.

1199
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:26,939
Shall we sit like this?

1200
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,968
"Lion King."

1201
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,170
Ta-da.

1202
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,739
Gosh, you're so pretty.

1203
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,380
Put Anggo in the middle.

1204
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,809
Look at the puppy. There you go.

1205
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,050
Try to look closer.

1206
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,349
Gosh, you're so cute.

1207
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,059
I didn't know he liked puppies that much. It was unexpected.

1208
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,029
I thought he loved animals.

1209
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,929
I love dogs too,

1210
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,198
- You're so cute. - and even in that sense,

1211
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,670
he seemed like a nice guy.

1212
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:00,570
It kissed me.

1213
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:02,639
It gave you a deep kiss.

1214
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,940
I have to...

1215
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,269
By the way...

1216
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:07,980
Excuse me.

1217
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:09,979
Can you focus on me instead of Anggo?

1218
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,750
- I have to get going. - Go.

1219
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,150
- What? You have to go. - Okay, fine.

1220
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,719
- You said you had to go. - Can you help me up?

1221
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,189
- Wait. - Forget it.

1222
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,219
Okay, fine.

1223
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:21,690
Goodness.

1224
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,460
Why must I help you up when you're going to cheat on me?

1225
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,499
- What was that? - That was so...

1226
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,959
- "You're going to cheat on me?" - Gosh, that was...

1227
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,669
Because she has to go on a date with someone else.

1228
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,198
That means he's jealous.

1229
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,139
And he thinks she's cheating on him.

1230
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,509
I think hearing that will make your heart skip a beat.

1231
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,038
- It really will. - Of course.

1232
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,409
I think it'll be really heart-fluttering.

1233
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:41,979
That comment too.

1234
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,309
- "You think I'll let you go?" - "You think I'll let you go?"

1235
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,210
He's not letting her go.

And you're letting me go so easily?

1243

Then will you not go if I don't let you go?

No.

00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,460
Hi.

1268
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
So...

1269
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:09,759
did your heart flutter because you were having a date...

1270
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,130
with someone new?

1271
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,428
Yes, I liked it.

1272
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,769
- You did? - Yes.

1273
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,769
This is awkward.

1274
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:21,609
I thought it was because I was too formal.

1275
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,738
No, not at all.

1276
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,050
You can drop the honorifics if you want.

1277
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,479
If you're not comfortable with it,

1278
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,549
you can just drop it whenever you feel comfortable.

1279
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,750
I'll be like, "Sure."

1280
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:42,229
I thought I should have a therapeutic time with Won Bin...

1281
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,170
on my way to see him.

1282
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,809
(Hae Eun and Won Bin's date)

1283
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,868
- You're here. - You came all the way.

1284
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,639
You came all the way.

1285
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,809
You're wearing something pretty.

1286
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:58,809
It looks good.

1287
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,049
- Let's go eat. - You haven't eaten?

1288
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,050
- No, not yet. - Oh, really?

1289
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:06,388
- Shall we? - Let's go.

1290
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:07,489
All right.

1291
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,288
Were you in the lodging the whole time?

1292
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:11,789
Yes, I took a rest...

1293
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,300
- and went to see the sea. - Really?

1294
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:16,969
You didn't cry, did you?

1295
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,369
Of course not.

1296
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:19,768
You should stop crying now.

1297
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:22,238
I'm such an eyesore for crying this much.

1298
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,339
- Right. - I'm such an eyesore.

1299
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,408
I stopped being down as of yesterday.

1300
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:26,439
- Really? - Yes.

1301
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,539
It's here.

1302
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,510
- We're here. - We're here!

1303
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,779
Thank you for driving.

1304
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,650
(Seongsangaetmaeul)

1305
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,250
- Is it cold raw hairtail soup? - Yes.

1306
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,719
(Cold raw hairtail soup, photo by Hae Eun)

1307
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,558
- How is it? Is it? - It's good.

1308
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,230
I've never had raw hairtail.

1309

(Exclaiming)

1310
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,739
It's really good.

1311
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:56,300
What?

1312
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:58,170
It's so warm.

1313
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:02,809
It's so comfortable and nice to be out with you.

1314
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,479
You must come out.

1315
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,809
You must have dates.

1316
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,518
Where is it?

1317
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:08,979
(Na Eon and Gyu Min, Jungho)

1318
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,119
Here it is.

1319
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:11,719
Let's go in.

1320
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,320
- Hello. - Hello.

1321
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,959
(They ordered a traditional liquor.)

1322
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,029
Thank you.

1323
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,658
I'll go prepare the first dish. You can enjoy the drinks first.

1324
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:22,829
All right.

1325
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:27,539
Aren't we sitting too far apart?

1326
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:29,440
Do you want to get closer?

1327
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,408
- It's a bit far, right? - It is.

1328
00:59:31,409 --> 00:59:32,868
I can't help but lean a bit.

1329
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,510
I have to stare at you intently.

1330
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,579
You can come as close as you want to get.

1331
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,179
Here's your first dish.

1332
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,590
It's black pork tenderloin.

1333
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,820
Thank you.

1334
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,159
- Thank you for the food. - Try it.

1335
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,090
What do you usually do on a date?

1336
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,159
But you dated Hae Eun for a long time.

1337
00:59:57,429 --> 00:59:58,468
Right.

1338
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:01,440
We fought a lot and broke up many times.

1339
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:03,369
So we've been broken up for quite a bit.

1340
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,840
That's why...

1341
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:06,639
Anyway, that's how it was.

1342
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:09,079
We had ordinary dates.

1343
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,449
This is good.

1344
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,509
Didn't you say...

1345
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,179
you'd drop the honorifics?

1346
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,380
That's right.

1347
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,619
You're suddenly dropping them now?

1348
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:22,889
Did you have any questions about me?

1349
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,030
I've been curious about everything.

1350
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:27,099
We didn't get to talk much.

1351
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:30,469
I roughly thought that we might have similar tastes.

1352
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:32,230
But I thought you'd be...

1353
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:37,039
more stylish than me.

1354
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:39,539
That's not true.

1355
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,849
But you wore such pretty clothes to say that.

1356
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,279
I was really surprised because I like that style.

1357
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,449
Oh, really?

1358
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,388
I really like the style you're wearing today.

1359
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:52,650
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1360
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,589
I think it's the prettiest.

1361
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,959
Is that so?

1362
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,760
But I suit girlish dresses too.

1363
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,260
I was going to wear that,

1364
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,699
but I thought it'd be better to show you how I usually dress.

1365
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,569
I've been meaning to ask you this.

1366
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,199
When you chatted with the guys,

1367
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,138
you chose Tae I, right?

1368
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:12,308
Why did you choose him?

1369
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,639
What did you think about me?

1370
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,678
I asked the same questions to everyone.

1371
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:17,250
I asked if they liked anyone...

1372
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:18,780
and their interests.

1373
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,449
I like people who have their own interests.

1374
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,590
Those who know what they like.

1375
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,888
Tae I and I got along well the most,

1376
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,488
and he was fun to talk with,

1377
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:32,090
as though we were really close.

1378
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,030
That's why I chose Tae I.

1379
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,069
And I thought you were very defensive.

1380
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,570
I think I was.

1381
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,839
It turned out...

1382
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,800
that you mistook me for someone else.

1383
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,868
That's why you were defensive.

1384
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,139
Well, that's part of the reason too.

1385
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,609
Or you could be that type of person.

1386
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,949
I'm not the type...

1387
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:56,250
to talk about how I feel inside.

1388
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,719
He listened to me well.

1389
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:01,260
He seems like the careful type.

1390
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:04,759
He doesn't share his feelings inside easily.

1391
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,889
In a way, he's defensive.

1392
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,299
She was honest,

1393
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,670
and she was straightforward with her feelings.

1394
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,570
But after joining you guys,

1395
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,909
I noticed that you and I...

1396
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,709
could share a lot of things in common.

1397
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,879
- With you. - Oh, with me?

1398
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,050
Honestly,

1399
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,479
I could feel...

1400
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,179
- that you thought the same way. - You could?

1401
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,319
If you didn't, then I was mistaken.

1402
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,690
No, you're right.

1403
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,920
But I'm quite narcissistic.

1404
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:36,158
I thought everyone...

1405
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:37,328
I thought everyone would like me.

1406
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:38,388
If they don't express their feelings,

1407
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:39,630
that's because they're shy.

1408
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:42,329
Well...

1409
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,429
You're really pretty and smart.

1410
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,800
Who would be your ideal guy?

1411
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,409
A smart man I can have conversations with.

1412
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,280
Someone who's considerate.

1413
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:58,079
I wouldn't mind him being handsome and fit as well.

1414
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:02,320
Right. He seems like the perfect guy.

1415
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:03,819
The guy whom I described?

1416
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,718
Isn't one's ideal guy or girl supposed to be perfect?

1417
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:06,788
I guess.

1418
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:09,090
That's implied in the word "ideal."

1419
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:15,130
- What do you think of me? - You?

1420
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,559
What do I seem like to you?

1421
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,530
What I noticed while talking to you...

1422
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,639
is that you're someone I would deem as clever.

1423
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,639
That sounds cuter than just "smart."

1424
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,980
I'm a clever one.

1425
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,449
I thought of that on the day...

1426
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,480
you made scrambled eggs.

1427
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:36,550
- How about this? - We have eggs too.

1428
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,319
Why don't I make scrambled eggs?

1429
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,718
- I was going to make them. - Really?

1430
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:40,759
That's right.

1431
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,859
You should ask me to go to a cafe with you.

1432
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,090
- A cafe? - Yes.

1433
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:50,230
I found your bold personality adorable.

1434
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,329
I bet you feel that way easily.

1435
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:55,469
Not really.

1436
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:58,469
Don't you think you told me that I was cute a few times?

1437
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,578
Did I say it that often?

1438
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:03,010
At least four times.

1439
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,710
Really?

1440
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:06,749
You find a lot of things adorable.

1441
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,750
- Is that so? - Yes.

1442
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,949
Gyu Min was just fun to talk to.

1443
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,089
We clicked in a lot of ways.

1444
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:17,288
I could relate to the nice things people have been saying about him.

1445
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:20,158
He's mature and very sincere.

1446
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,829
It's why I wanted the chance to get to know him better.

1447
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:27,000
It's almost 9pm.

1448
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:29,840
Hee Doo's back and so is Ji Soo.

1449
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:33,738
Hyun Gyu's back as well.

1450
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,480
- Hi. - You're back.

1451
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,780
Hi.

1452
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:40,010
Where are you going? Come sit with me.

1453
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,348
Na Yeon's a funny one, you know.

1454
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:46,250
While she was sleeping, she called out for you.

1455
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,789
No way.

1456
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:51,058
- For real? - I went to bed at nine.

1457
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,089
- In the morning? - Yes. So I'm tired.

1458
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,598
- Hee Doo. - In that exact voice.

1459
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,029
- Hee Doo. - That's how she called for you.

1460
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,169
- What? - Can I have the cushion?

1461
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,170
Sure.

1462
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:08,308
- What do you think of this color? - I like it.

1463
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:09,510
- You haven't seen it before. - No.

1464
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,788
Literally, this was the first time we actually got to talk.

1465
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:22,920
- Right. - That's why...

1466
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:26,158
it's been giving me a lot to think about.

1467
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,658
It was our first time talking by ourselves.

1468
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,169
Anyway, I enjoyed it.

1469
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:34,169
For the first time, we got to be alone.

1470
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,468
- Right. - What is it?

1471
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:37,709
- It's nothing. - Why are you laughing?

1472
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,009
You're blabbering for someone who talks well.

1473
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,409
I must be drunk.

1474
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,510
No, wait. I mostly fall asleep when drunk.

1475
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,710
I don't know why this is happening.

1476
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,119
You don't know?

1477
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:52,920
I'm curious. In a nutshell, I'm now curious about you.

1478
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:57,428
Anyway, let's grab brunch tomorrow and go grocery shopping.

1479
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:59,429
- Sure. Got it. - Good.

1480
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,960
- We can talk about it tomorrow. - Sure.

1481
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,000
(They agree to a date tomorrow while inebriated.)

1482
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,509
I'm curious as to what you dreamed about.

1483
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,368
Exactly. Why did I call out for Hee Doo?

1484
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,380
"Hee Doo!"

1485
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:18,078
Maybe my head was filled with thoughts about him.

1486
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,079
Right.

1487
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,218
What's going on? Where is everyone?

1488
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:27,388
Go ahead. I'm going to throw these away.

1489
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:28,889
- Thanks. - I'll see you later.

1490
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,729
- Welcome. - Hi. How was things?

1491
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,928
- Did you have fun? - Hi, cutie.

1492
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:38,299
Yes, I had an eventful day today.

1493
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,170
Yes, totally.

1494
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:42,698
Hold on a second. Let me sit down first.

1495
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:43,699
Okay.

1496
01:06:43,969 --> 01:06:45,968
With Tae I... Do you know what tufting is?

1497
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,808
- No. - The threading thing.

1498
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:48,809
Right.

1499
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,808
(Wow! Gasping!)

1500
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:53,279
- We made this. Pretty, right? - It's so pretty.

1501
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,848
- Good job. - We designed this...

1502
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:57,320
and decided on the color scheme.

1503
01:06:57,849 --> 01:06:58,889
I should look at it in the mirror.

1504
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:01,689
- It's so pretty. - It's cute.

1505
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,259
- Isn't it pretty? - It is.

1506
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,389
So this is what we made.

1507
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,159
(11pm, Tae I returns.)

1508
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,230
- Are you asleep? - Come on in.

1509
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,129
- Were you asleep? - Yes.

1510
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,440
- Go back to sleep, then. - Tae I, come in.

1511
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,238
- When did you get back? - Just now. I had dinner alone.

1512
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:20,340
- Alone? - Yes.

1513
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,579
I would've joined you had I not been so late.

1514
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,049
Do you like makgeolli?

1515
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,678
I really like it,

1516
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:29,118
but I get drunk easily.

1517
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,049
- Traditional wine... - Did you get some?

1518
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,989
- Yes, we bought some. - Nice.

1519
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,259
- You must love traditional wine. - I love it.

1520
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,759
I bought something nice.

1521
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,960
I wasn't going to drink tonight,

1522
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:42,030
but I guess I have no choice.

1523
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:46,030
- Do you want to see photos? - Show us.

1524
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:47,369
These are adorable.

1525
01:07:48,139 --> 01:07:49,300
Adorable, right?

1526
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,340
- Hold on. - Why? Do they look good together?

1527
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,440
They look really good together. Can you believe it?

1528
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,579
Why is it that you two look so great together?

1529
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,479
Tae I's gaze had my heart skipping a beat.

1530
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,979
Him gazing at others should be a crime.

1531
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,090
Absolutely.

1532
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,149
I'd arrest him if he didn't mean anything by this.

1533
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,158
Exactly.

1534
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:09,988
I doubt there's no meaning behind it.

1535
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:12,129
- I agree. - He always texts me.

1536
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,260
And I text him too.

1537
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:17,029
At first, I didn't think you two would be great together.

1538
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,229
But Tae I looks comfortable when he's with you.

1539
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,670
- Really? - Yes.

1540
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,310
- You're all back. - Hey, Ji Yeon.

1541
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:30,640
- Where did you go today? - When did you get back?

1542
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,419
I bet you're hungry.

1543
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,688
I'm starving.

1544
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:39,890
(She hides the photos she took with Tae I.)

1545
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,559
- Everyone's here, so... - Did you say you were hungry?

1546
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,829
- Yes. - Let's make something.

1547
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,359
- I ate though. - Really?

1548
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:49,799
- What did you have? - I had Korean cuisine.

1549
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,229
They had something delicious today.

1550
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:01,609
Who ordered what? I'm dying to know.

1551
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,538
- I'm starving. - I don't think it was ordered.

1552
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,209
Hee Doo said he was going to order sashimi,

1553
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,979
but Ji Soo said they didn't get the chance.

1554
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,180
Really?

1555
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,389
When she got here, I hurried to conceal them.

1556
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,488
- What are those? - The photos.

1557
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:16,358
- Gosh. - It must be tough around her.

1558
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:20,429
Not really. But there's no need to flash these in front of her.

1559
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:21,430
Of course.

1560
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:22,659
I was so startled that...

1561
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,828
- You did well. - So I...

1562
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:26,629
We look sweet in this.

1563
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,640
Yes, too sweet.

1564
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,938
As you know, I had my first date with Gyu Min today.

1565
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:36,009
He's nice and all,

1566
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,849
but I'm more comfortable around Tae I.

1567
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,180
- Right. - I can relax more around him.

1568
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,920
Hyun Gyu's really nice as well.

1569
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,549
- How was it today? - It was even better today.

1570
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,689
- Really? - Yes.

1571
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,549
- Really? I'm so happy for you. - I had even a better time today.

1572
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,788
I'm so happy to hear that...

1573
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:49,319
- because you look happy. - Exactly.

1574
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,089
I know our show is about dating other people's exes,

1575
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,559
but you'd expect to hear this only in Hollywood.

1576
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,899
Exactly.

1577
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,769
Right? You would only hear this on our show.

1578
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,800
Absolutely.

1579
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:00,368
You'd only hear it in Hollywood.

1580
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:03,000
"Do I look good with your ex? Go for it!"

1581
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,470
Really? And I was grateful.

1582
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,608
- Because he was nice? - He comforted me...

1583
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:09,109
and asked me why I cried yesterday.

1584
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,609
- He must really like you. - Really?

1585
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,149
I can't read his expressions though.

1586
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,649
He's trying to play it cool because he likes you.

1587
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,849
I think it's because things are still awkward.

1588
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:22,460
It's only his second day here.

1589
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:25,329
Anyway, it has been a while...

1590
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,858
since I felt my heart flutter.

1591
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:28,930
- Really? - Yes.

1592
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,799
Do you like him more than you did yesterday?

1593
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,000
Yes, of course. I'm more comfortable around him too.

1594
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,438
- Do you mean that? - I'm grateful...

1595
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,409
because he makes me laugh. That's why it was nice.

1596
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:41,979
He'll appreciate the fact that you think that way.

1597
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,579
He'll be grateful that he made you laugh.

- Right? - Not me.

1602
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,488

Let's have the makgeolli that Hee Doo bought.

1604
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,630
I'd love to, but we need snacks.

1605

- Is it enough? - We'll have to go back out.

1606

- Where's Ji Soo? - She must be taking a break.

- Is she in her room? - I think she's resting.

Things were so hard for me that night.

1610

It's the same for Won Bin and me.

1611
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:45,469
Neither of us can...

1612
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:48,439
mask our expressions well.

1613
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,250
Others have to walk on eggshells around us,

1614
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:55,079
and that's something I hate.

1615
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,289
I had a headache and my mind was buzzing.

1616
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:02,489
All I could think about was what I was going to do.

1617

Can it perhaps be delivered?

Why am I always the one ordering the food?

1619
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:19,170
One shrimp and bracken cream soup.

One egg gimbap.

1621

One grilled pollack roe.

One black pork tteokbokki.

1623
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:28,220
And red-banded lobster sashimi set.

1624
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,149
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

1625
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,389
We'll have two red-banded lobster sashimi sets.

Yes, we'll order one more.

That's right.

1629

We only accept a bank-to-bank transfer.

- Hey, girl. - Where is this place?

1632

- What did you do today? - Your outfit's so cute.

1633
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,180
Today? I took the day to chill on my own.

Should I take one?

- Should I take one? - Yes, us too.

Let's all take a photo.

It's cute.

01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,039
Someone take one of me too.

1639

Right. No one offered.

1640
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,938
- Take one of me too. - Am I in the frame?

1641
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,510
Yes. Ji Soo, do you want to be in the photo?

1642
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,349
- I'll be in it. - Tae I, you too.

1643
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,079
- Right, Tae I. - Get over here.

In 1, 2, 3.

1645
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,819
- What? - No one will know.

1646
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,329
This one's a great shot.

1647
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:51,299
- I agree. - I took one of him.

1648
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,100
Actually, it was Bin.

1649
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,269
The surfing photos came out great.

1650

- It's like you were in the US. - Right.

1651
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,039
Is she a ghost?

1652
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:03,579
I'm keeping this one.

Why?

What?

I'll get it this time.

I wonder what'll happen tomorrow.

1657
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,460
I hope for something fun.

1658
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,399
It'll be fun for sure.

1659
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,609
Hee Doo, read it for us.

- What is it? - What is he doing?

- Is it long? - Is it the guys' turn?

- Read it for us. - "Tomorrow, you'll stay home."

"Enjoy the facilities within the premises..."

"The 1-on-1 talk can be between those of the opposite gender..."

"as well as the same gender."

1669

- Did you say "alone" time? - No, we're staying home.

His text proved to me...

1740
01:19:34,539 --> 01:19:36,710
that he was willing to change.

1741
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:40,979
Rather than getting back together, he knew things had to change.

1742
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:42,649
That's what I liked.

1743
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:46,119
It's why I wanted to talk to him more about it.

1744
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,659
I can't be certain of Na Yeon's feelings,

1745
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,189
and I don't know where I stand with her either.

1746
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:55,158
It's been keeping me...

1747
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:57,060
from following my heart 100 percent.

1748
01:19:57,529 --> 01:19:59,868
I knew I had to make up my mind...

1749
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:02,800
because things were still in limbo.

1750
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:04,909
It might be because of someone else,

1751
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:07,970
but I didn't know where I stood.

1754
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,960
I thought about texting Hee Doo,

1755
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,430
but he didn't say anything that persuaded me in any way.

1756
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:32,270
And then I got to hear how he and Na Yeon were still solid.

1757
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,328
There was nothing I could do.

1758
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:37,869
Following my heart would've been the honest approach,

1759
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,669
but I was upset.

1760
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,810
He hasn't been choosing me, and that's a fact.

1761
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:44,710
I still care about my ex, and I'm worried about him.

1762
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:48,279
With support, I sent him a text.

I wanted her to laugh, so I sent that text.

The text was, "Who has made your heart flutter?"

1772
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:33,590
So I sent a text to someone who enjoyed the day with me.

1773
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:36,829
I had a date with Na Eon.

1774

I thought she was cute.

1775

In any case, I was firm in decision.

1776

I thought my decision would make Na Yeon feel...

more at ease.

1778

Judging by Gyu Min's character,

1779
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:58,250
I knew that he would send a text to someone he went on a date with.

He cherishes everyone.

He doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

1782

He is a gentle soul.

I was a bit jealous.

But being worried and jealous...

1786

is my personal problem.

- Is it big enough? - Seriously.

1897
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:53,170
Do you need help?

1898
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,140
(The team that picked up the red-banded lobster is back.)

1899
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,879
Let's make ramyeon well.

1900
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,079
- The seasoning, please. - Okay.

1901
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,979
Do you add the flakes first?

1902
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:05,319
Yes. I always do that.

1903
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,420
- Do you add them later? - No.

1904
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:11,020
- I... - I don't care how it's prepared.

1905
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,760
- I make ramyeon in a specific way. - Okay.

1906

- Tomorrow? - Yes.

1910
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:24,099
I will make it tomorrow.

1911
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,469
- Do you add chili powder? - What?

1912
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:27,670
Do you add chili powder?

1913
01:28:28,409 --> 01:28:29,680
To here? Should I do that?

1914
01:28:29,779 --> 01:28:31,278
I can't mix it right now.

1915
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:33,879
- That's how I usually do it. - Okay.

1916
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,978
- I add chili powder... - Okay.

1917
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:37,448
And a bit of water.

1918
01:28:37,449 --> 01:28:38,919
- Then I stir-fry the mix. - That sounds nice.

1919
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,219
Then I add the egg yolk at the end.

1920
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,359
- It's really tasty. - That sounds nice.

1921
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:44,520
(An egg yolk on standby)

1922
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,560
Hold on. Let's add it at the end. I will do this first.

1923
01:28:48,329 --> 01:28:49,729
You prepared it quickly.

1924
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,539
I have never seen anyone who is so serious about ramyeon.

1925
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,739
It looks delicious. It's insane.

1926
01:28:57,869 --> 01:28:59,210
It smells amazing.

1927
01:28:59,239 --> 01:29:01,270
- You are really cool. - Why?

1928
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:03,380
You are passionate about cooking.

1929
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:05,140
I am passionate about ramyeon.

1930
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:08,448
Then the career...

1931
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:09,519
Can I join you?

1932
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,479
You can join me. Of course you can join me.

1933
01:29:11,619 --> 01:29:13,850
So when should we eat breakfast tomorrow?

1934
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:15,250
Tomorrow?

1935
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,659
How about 11am? Then we will have enough time.

1936
01:29:17,859 --> 01:29:20,630
I don't mind eating breakfast early.

1937
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,460
- When is convenient for you? - How about 11am?

1938
01:29:23,329 --> 01:29:26,630
But if it's too late, other people can get up.

1939
01:29:28,069 --> 01:29:29,439
Then we can eat together.

1940
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,670
How about 11am?

1941
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,938
That would be nice.

1942
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:34,809
- Shall we go back inside? - Yes. Let's go back inside.

1943
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:35,879
(They decided to have breakfast together.)

1944
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,180
They must be eating.

1945
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,949
Did they come back?

1946
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:41,550
- Are they eating? - They are there.

1947
01:29:43,649 --> 01:29:45,649
- Hurry up. - Let's eat. Hurry over here.

1948
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,988
Can I eat this?

1949
01:29:46,989 --> 01:29:48,720
Eat. We made it for people to eat.

1950
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,590
I asked the same thing.

1951
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:52,089
- What? - You are back.

1952
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:53,459
You bought so many things.

1953
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,829
I bought different things.

1954
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:01,199
- Na Eon. - What?

1955
01:30:01,369 --> 01:30:02,369
Here.

(He bought Na Eon's favorite snack.)

1957
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:05,609
It looks tasty.

1958
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,369
- I forgot about it. - What?

1959
01:30:12,109 --> 01:30:14,010
Here. Have a bite.

1960
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,619
I hate this so much.

1961
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:21,020
I would have fought you if you were a man.

1962

That's so funny.

1963

Oh, no. That cat is dozing off while waiting.

01:34:25,029 --> 01:34:27,399
I think it's because I am drunk.

2054
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,340
- You did really well. - I think it's because I am drunk.

2055
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:30,469
Shall we have another round?

2056
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:32,769
Let's have another round of the Liar Game.

2057
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:34,209
- Good idea. - Let's play the Liar Game.

2058
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:37,209
Hold on. Give me one minute. I need to use the restroom.

2059
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:40,210
You can use the restroom in the room.

2060
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,609
It's here too.

2061
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:43,419
My room is closer.

2062
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:44,550
Is there a restroom in your room?

2063
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,689
- I am full. - Me too.

2064
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,889
Go away. You can't eat more food. Go home.

2065
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:53,188
- It's a fat cat. - Go home.

2066
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:56,459
- No. - Fat cat, can you go through there?

2067
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,500
It did it easily.

2068
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:01,430
- Hyun Gyu, is your hand okay? - Yes.

2069
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:04,739
It isn't okay. How painful is it on a scale of 1 to 100?

2070
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:07,069
On that scale, the pain level must be ten.

2071
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:09,409
I will do it.

2072
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:11,139
I will do it. No.

2073
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:14,750
I will do it. I will cut it.

2074
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,819
I am strong.

2075
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:19,750
I will cut it like this.

2076
01:35:20,149 --> 01:35:23,188
It would be hard for you to do it.

2077
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:26,288
That's enough. And I can use my left hand.

2078
01:35:26,289 --> 01:35:28,760
- No. I got this. - It's okay.

2079
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,129
What do you think? It will be really easy to eat.

2080
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,159
Thank you.

2081
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,470
Gyu Min and I are going through the same situation.

2082
01:35:35,869 --> 01:35:38,339
- Why? - How was it with Gyu Min today?

2083
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,068
Gyu Min chose me.

2084
01:35:40,069 --> 01:35:41,810
- Did he choose you? - Yes.

2085
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:44,609
- How about you? - Tae I.

2086
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,149
My situation is similar to Gyu Min's.

2087
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:49,979
Really? How is your situation?

2088
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,350
How is your situation similar to his?

2089
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,890
It's because of Hee Doo and Na Yeon.

2090
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:01,260
I felt the same thing.

2091
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,460
Hee Doo and Na Yeon are going strong.

2092
01:36:04,699 --> 01:36:08,569
I realized it today. I realized it yesterday and today.

2093
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:13,108
- Hee Doo and Na Yeon. - Gyu Min realized the same thing.

2094
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:15,978
I did too. That's why we are going through the same thing.

2095
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:17,710
I thought about it a lot today.

2096
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:19,679
I am still torn about it.

2097
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:21,779
So Hee Doo...

2098
01:36:23,479 --> 01:36:26,649
To be honest, I don't want to send a text to Hee Doo.

2099
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,318
I am so upset...

2100
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:31,259
that I don't feel the same pull toward Hee Doo anymore.

2101
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,729
You should look into it.

2102
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:36,259
The motivation is gone.

2103
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,129
I get that they dated for four years.

2104
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:41,970
But their relationship is too solid. It's too solid.

2105
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:44,898
Should I say that I am disappointed? How should I put it?

2106
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,270
I feel dejected.

2107
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,140
Did Na Eon come back?

2108
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,909
- They went to the restroom. - There they are.

2109
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,149
Ji Soo is drinking a lot today.

2110
01:36:53,479 --> 01:36:56,379
- The thing is... - Ji Soo can drink a lot of wine.

2111
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:57,818
She can hold her liquor.

2112
01:36:57,819 --> 01:37:00,389
I think everyone here can hold his or her liquor.

2113
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:02,419
Na Eon is the only one.

2114
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,459
How about Hae Eun?

2115
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,488
- No. What are you talking about? - I don't know exactly,

2116
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:07,728
- but she can hold her liquor. - Let's drink, everyone.

2117
01:37:07,729 --> 01:37:09,759
Okay. Let's see who can drink more.

2118
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,899
Your tone changed.

2119
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,130
It's more forceful now.

2120
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:15,939
- Does it hurt? - No.

2121
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:20,938
A cat scratched me earlier.

2122
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:21,939
Did it scratch you?

2123
01:37:22,939 --> 01:37:25,439
Where? Is this the wound?

2124
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:27,949
It hid between the rocks.

2125
01:37:29,649 --> 01:37:30,649
How is your hand?

2126
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,890
Really? Are there kittens?

2127
01:37:35,619 --> 01:37:37,188
There are so many kittens.

2128
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:38,819
That's right. I saw a black one too.

2129
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,158
There are a gray cat and a black one too.

2130
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,188
- The gray cat might be the dad. - So that cat is the mom.

2131
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,729
- I think that cat is the dad. - It's that cat's husband.

2132
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,969
Shall we clink our glasses?

2133
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:47,368
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2134
01:37:47,369 --> 01:37:48,399
Hae Eun, stop drinking.

2135
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,569
I am sobering up.

2136
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,039
She is soberer than she was before.

2137
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,609
Hae Eun was quite drunk.

2138
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:59,408
She stayed close to Hyun Gyu.

2139
01:37:59,409 --> 01:38:00,810
Seriously.

2140
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,119
You don't have an interview tomorrow, right?

2141
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,250
- It's him. - I get it now.

2142
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:08,819
Seriously.

2143
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:14,289
It's really hard.

2144
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,869
She kept touching him.

2145
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:24,069
It ruined my mood.

2146
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:28,438
Cheese. That and cheese.

2147
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:30,778
We talked about it earlier.

2148
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:31,810
It's hard.

2149
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:34,409
I think it's hard.

2150
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,689
I didn't mind the two of them.

2151
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,930
But I couldn't help but worry about Gyu Min.

2152
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,699
They showed physical affection...

2153
01:38:56,739 --> 01:38:59,869
and stayed close.

2154
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,109
It was hard to see them do that.

2155
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:07,079
I tried not to look at them.

2156
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:12,079
I made an effort not to show my displeasure.

2157
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:15,289
Since I was a bit wary of Hae Eun,

2158
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:18,658
I tried to be careful.

2159
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:23,430
But Hae Eun didn't seem to do that.

2160
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:27,569
I was disappointed and jealous.

2161
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:30,270
I didn't want to show...

2162
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,539
that I was feeling jealous.

2163
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,238
- I will go to bed now. - I will go to bed too.

2164
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:38,939
- Will you go to bed? - I will retire to my room.

2165
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:41,310
My goodness.

2166
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,189
Hey.

2167
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,829
I think we should look after Hae Eun.

2168
01:39:55,159 --> 01:39:57,828
Is Hae Eun okay?

2169
01:39:57,829 --> 01:39:59,329
- Hae Eun. - She would be okay, right?

2170
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:01,069
She drank a lot.

2171
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:03,840
She did look quite drunk.

2172
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,270
Does she like Hyun Gyu?

2173
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:08,608
Am I worrying for no reason?

2174
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:12,539
No. Anyone would worry in this situation.

2175
01:40:12,979 --> 01:40:14,779
Did it get on your nerve too?

2176
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:16,550
A little bit.

2177
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,649
I just thought, "There must be something between them."

2178
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,420
I am not saying they were in the wrong.

2179
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:25,359
They weren't in the wrong, but...

2180
01:40:26,489 --> 01:40:28,559
I will wake up at 11:10am.

2181
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,560
I will wake you up.

2182
01:40:29,561 --> 01:40:31,029
Good night.

2183
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,479
- Na Eon. - Yes?

2184
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:46,948
- What's up with her? - What?

2185
01:40:46,949 --> 01:40:48,309
- What's up with her? - Ji Yeon?

2186
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,350
Yes. What's up with Ji Yeon?

2187
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,448
- She is in a bad mood. - Why is that?

2188
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:52,719
Is she on bad terms with someone?

2189
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,390
It's not like that.

2190
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,359
- Is she worried about something? - No, it's not like that.

2191
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:58,619
She is okay.

2192
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,359
- She is okay. - She doesn't look okay.

2193
01:41:01,729 --> 01:41:03,229
I think...

2194
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:06,898
Hee Doo and Na Yeon have a solid relationship.

2195
01:41:06,899 --> 01:41:10,438
Still, Hee Doo seems to be interested in Ji Yeon.

2196
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:14,368
He asked me why Ji Yeon was struggling.

2197
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:15,538
I think it meant,

2198
01:41:15,539 --> 01:41:18,839
"Ji Yeon isn't interested in me these days."

2199
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,249
"Why doesn't she show her interest these days?"

2200
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:23,619
I got that feeling.

2201

2202
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,050

01:41:58,319 --> 01:41:59,589
- Hee Doo. - Yes?

2211
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:00,789
It's 11:30am.

2212
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:07,859
Did you have breakfast already?

2213
01:42:09,159 --> 01:42:11,460
I was supposed to have breakfast with someone,

2214
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,130
but she was sleeping so soundly that I came back to the room.

2215
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:18,368
That day, I was supposed to have breakfast with Na Eon.

2216
01:42:18,369 --> 01:42:21,310
When I woke up and went to Na Eon,

2217
01:42:21,409 --> 01:42:23,739
she was sleeping.

2218
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:26,350
So I came back to the room and slept some more.

2219
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:30,180
(Na Eon wakes up late.)

2220
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,619
(Gyu Min went back asleep.)

2221
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:39,020
(Knocking)

2222
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:41,858
- Gyu Min. - You are awake.

2223
01:42:41,859 --> 01:42:43,698
- Is no one in the room? - Yes.

2224
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,528
- Can I come inside? - Yes.

2225
01:42:45,529 --> 01:42:46,529
Hold on.

2226
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:53,068
I asked him,

2227
01:42:53,069 --> 01:42:56,339
"Can you wake up then? I can."

2228
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,009
But I overslept.

2229
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:01,079
I felt so bad that I went to the kitchen.

2230
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,250
(She prepares a simple breakfast.)

2231
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:22,600
Gyu Min.

2232
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:25,470
I felt bad about failing to keep my promise,

2233
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:29,510
so I prepared a room service.

2234
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,279
- Really? - Yes.

2235
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:33,810
Look at this. Can you get up?

2236
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:36,578
There wasn't much food.

2237
01:43:36,579 --> 01:43:37,849
You didn't have to do that.

2238
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:39,889
I am so sorry.

2239
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:41,289
Don't be sorry.

2240
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,188
This is amazing.

2241
01:43:44,189 --> 01:43:46,589
It's amazing, right?

2242
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:48,429
You wanted scrambled eggs,

2243
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:49,960
so I made it with three eggs.

2244
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:56,600
- Isn't it tasty with cheese? - Yes.

2245
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,500
This is a good restaurant.

2246
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:03,140
Would you forgive me for sleeping soundly?

2247
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,909
"I will wake up at the right time."

2248
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:09,049
"When will you wake up?"

2249
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,279
Do I talk like that?

2250
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,250
"We will have enough time if we meet at 11am."

2251
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:15,420
"That would be too late."

2252
01:44:16,119 --> 01:44:18,389
I prepared a simple breakfast...

2253
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,629
and ate it with Gyu Min.

2254
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,600
We spoke more comfortably compared to yesterday.

2255
01:44:24,659 --> 01:44:26,930
I felt a bit closer to him.

2256
01:44:29,869 --> 01:44:31,769
- Hae Eun. - You are awake.

2257
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:33,770
Are you okay? Don't you have a hangover?

2258
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:36,209
Why don't I remember when I came back?

2259
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:39,039
- Don't you remember? - How did I come back?

2260
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:42,709
I thought you were talking about "The Hunger Games."

2261
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,249
- Why? - It's Hyun Gyu, right?

2262
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:46,149
You called him "Hunger."

2263
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:47,819
It sounded like you had no mouth.

2264
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:51,059
"Hunger, I don't want to go back."

2265
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:54,889
You are insane. Hae Eun, you are insane.

2266
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:55,930
"Hunger."

2267
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:59,359
"My hands are cold." You fell asleep like that.

2268
01:44:59,729 --> 01:45:02,398
Hae Eun, are Hyun Gyu's hands warm?

2269
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:04,969
- They are so warm. - You like him, right?

2270
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:06,568
- Hyun Gyu? - You like Hyun Gyu, right?

2271
01:45:06,569 --> 01:45:09,039
- I like Hyun Gyu. - You were too drunk yesterday,

2272
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:12,078
- so everyone found out. - Why?

2273
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,510
You only looked for Hunger in front of everyone.

2274
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:17,819
- "Hunger" is ridiculous. - "The Hunger Games."

2275
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,449
You kept doing "The Hunger Games."

2276
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:25,488
Do you like Hunger?

2277
01:45:25,489 --> 01:45:27,659
You looked so happy.

2278
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:30,359
The thing is,

2279
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:34,028
I was a bit surprised to see you hold his hand.

2280
01:45:34,029 --> 01:45:36,670
When I came back inside, you were holding his hand.

2281
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:39,640
I was like, "What's going on? They became close so soon."

2282
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:42,108
I don't know what to do. This is so annoying.

2283
01:45:42,109 --> 01:45:43,639
I was surprised,

2284
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,640
but I thought it was understandable.

2285
01:45:50,119 --> 01:45:51,219
Why did I hold his hand?

2286
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,919
My hands were cold.

2287
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,349
- Hae Eun. - My hands were cold.

2288
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,519
I shouldn't have said anything. Don't get stressed out.

2289
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,118
His hands are really hot, right?

2290
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,188
Yes.

2291
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:02,090
This is something only we can talk about.

2292
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:05,299
My hands are always cold.

2293
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,328
His hands are really warm.

2294
01:46:07,329 --> 01:46:08,529
That was why I held them.

2295
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:10,739
- Good job. - I must be insane.

2296
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,038
- He found you cute. - I can't face him.

2297
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:15,009
I asked him yesterday if he is happy.

2298
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:16,269
- Last night? - Yes.

2299
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:17,978
I had to borrow a facial mask.

2300
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:19,309
I am sorry. I can borrow a facial mask...

2301
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,880
- from the man you like, right? - Stop it.

2302
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:26,789
I can't face him. I am so embarrassed.

2303
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:28,619
Hyun Gyu must be sick and tired of me.

2304
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:30,288
I told you.

2305
01:46:30,289 --> 01:46:33,129
He isn't the type to get sick and tired of someone for that.

2306
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:34,659
Still...

2307
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,630
It shows when I like someone.

2308
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,329
- I make it obvious. - Really?

2309
01:46:38,529 --> 01:46:40,529
I make it so obvious.

2310
01:46:41,069 --> 01:46:43,068
Are you okay with me...

2311
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:47,669
being comfortable around Hyun Gyu?

2312
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:52,010
I could feel you rooting for me during the past few days.

2313
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,279
This is what I think.

2314
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:57,078
I don't want other people to be wary of me.

2315
01:46:57,079 --> 01:46:58,578
I feel the same.

2316
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:00,749
I am not wary of other people either.

2317
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:03,020
Seriously. You don't need to do that.

2318
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,659
I mean it in the most literal sense.

2319
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:09,430
(Hunger appears.)

2320
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,800
I am so sorry.

2321
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:16,569
I am taking so long.

2322
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:22,340
(Running away)

2323
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:26,779
- What's going on? - Oh, no.

2324
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:28,778
- As soon as she came out... - I can't believe this scene.

2325
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:30,618
It really feels like a scene from a drama.

2326
01:47:30,619 --> 01:47:31,819
She is so cute.

2327
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,188
The heroine sees her love interest come out of the restroom...

2328
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:35,618
- and does this. - She is embarrassed.

2329
01:47:35,619 --> 01:47:36,889
It's like a drama.

2330

She is so cute.

(Running away)

2332
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,130
I went out like this...

2333
01:47:47,069 --> 01:47:49,399
- and why is Hyun Gyu out there? - Hyun Gyu is out there?

2334
01:47:49,869 --> 01:47:51,238
But you look cute.

2335
01:47:51,239 --> 01:47:52,840
- No, I look like this. - You look pretty.

2336
01:48:01,949 --> 01:48:03,109
Yes?

2337
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:05,119
Who is it?

2338
01:48:05,649 --> 01:48:07,390
- It's me. - What's up?

2339
01:48:07,649 --> 01:48:08,750
Why did you run away?

2340
01:48:13,859 --> 01:48:15,259
Oh, no.

2341
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,260
He saw her.

2342
01:48:16,261 --> 01:48:17,299
What is this?

2343
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:20,299
- This feels like an online novel. - It's cute.

2344
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:22,869
There was a melodramatic side somewhere deep inside my heart.

2345
01:48:23,569 --> 01:48:24,639
I didn't think there was.

2346
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,839
- I thought my melo side was dead. - I thought so too, but it wasn't.

2347
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,810
- It was in there. - It's like a cheesy romance novel.

2348
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:30,880
I wish I could have an experience like this.

2349
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:33,409
- "Why did you run away?" - Seriously, it was like a drama.

2350
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:35,779
- "Why did you run away?" - This is a drama.

2351
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:38,920
Who is it?

2352
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:41,220
- It's me. - What's up?

2353
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:42,448
Why did you run away?

2354
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:44,460
Oh, but wait.

2355
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,688
- What are you doing? - Me? I'm getting dressed.

2356
01:48:46,689 --> 01:48:47,859
- Really? - Yes, I was getting dressed.

2357

- Where are you going? - Me?

2361
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,478
I have to iron this.

2362
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:14,350
- It's so wrinkly. - I do too.

Hey, I have the same one.

2364
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,789
Oh, really?

2365
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:19,219
Let's wear matching shirts.

01:49:20,659 --> 01:49:22,059
- Do you remember from yesterday? - Why? No, I don't.

2368
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,259
- You don't? - I don't.

2369
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,559
Not at all?

2370
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,630
No.

2371
01:49:28,199 --> 01:49:29,329
Why?

2372
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,899
No, I really...

2373
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:35,568
I don't remember how I got home.

2374
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:36,739
Oh, I took you home.

2375
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:38,079
- You took me home? - Yes.

2376
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,310
There's nothing for today, right?

2377
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:40,749
- No. - Let's hang out.

2378
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:41,978
No, there might be something today.

2379
01:49:41,979 --> 01:49:43,949
So I have to iron this right now.

2380
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,050
- I'll be back after I iron this. - Okay.

2381
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,159
(It starts to rain in the afternoon.)

2382
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,169
Hyun Gyu, are you doing the dishes?

2383
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:03,769
Yes. Hey, could you come here for a second?

2384
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:04,970
Roll up my sleeves for me.

2385
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,270
A bit more.

2386
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:08,840
Hold on.

2387
01:50:10,909 --> 01:50:12,479
- Let's grab a meal sometime. - Okay.

2388
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:16,078
Do you want to order chicken?

2389
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:17,279
Should we order chicken?

2390
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,180
- Shall we? - Shall we?

2391
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,550
Want to come to my room? Let's go to my room.

2392
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:25,059
Why? Let's hang out in the living room.

2393
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:26,560
No, it's too cold here.

2394
01:50:26,859 --> 01:50:28,060
There's blankets.

2395
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:30,130
I don't like wide open spaces.

2396
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,770
I wonder what we're doing tomorrow.

2397
01:50:33,899 --> 01:50:35,170
I want to go on more dates.

2398
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:37,038
Wasn't it a bit lonely yesterday towards the end?

2399
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:38,599
Everyone came back from doing such fun stuff.

2400
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,639
I just stayed by myself yesterday.

2401
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,810
I just slept.

2402
01:50:45,109 --> 01:50:46,949
It's too cold. I'm going back to my room.

2403
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,050
We're heading inside.

2404
01:50:50,449 --> 01:50:51,648
Hyun Gyu, are you bored?

2405
01:50:51,649 --> 01:50:52,818
- Yes. - Want to hang out in my room?

2406
01:50:52,819 --> 01:50:54,090
Shall we? Who else is there?

2407
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,189
It's just me.

2408
01:50:55,319 --> 01:50:56,419
You should come too.

2409
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:57,459
- Do you want to come too? - No, I...

2410
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:58,760
I'll just get some rest in my room.

2411
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,529
Hey, Gyu Min.

2412
01:51:03,699 --> 01:51:04,759
What?

2413
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,930
This just broke.

2414
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:08,300
Oh, really? Oh, no.

2415
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,340
- That's a shame. - I'm so sad.

2416
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:15,669
This must be a sign that you should throw it out after this show.

2417
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:17,439
- I know, it's a shame. - There's only three days left.

2418
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:19,109
I'll keep using it here.

2419
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:21,709
I can still use it like this.

2420
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:23,779
- It's a shame. - I know. It was cute.

2421
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:25,250
Goodbye.

2422
01:51:26,619 --> 01:51:27,850
Have you been to my room before?

2423
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,060
No, it's my first time. I've never been to a girl's room.

2424
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:32,659
Excuse me.

2425
01:51:33,189 --> 01:51:34,729
So, you know...

2426
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:37,529
Is there anything you want to know?

2427
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,328
No, it's just fun to hear everyone's stories.

2428
01:51:40,329 --> 01:51:41,470
What's fun?

2429
01:51:41,699 --> 01:51:44,499
People talk to me a lot, you know?

2430
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,770
I mean, I am grateful for that.

2431
01:51:45,939 --> 01:51:47,139
But I don't even know...

2432
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,340
- what to do myself. - Right.

2433
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:51,039
Hee Doo and I don't always get along either.

2434
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,939
He's the type that tries to control things.

2435
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:57,180
"Do this, do that." That's how he is.

2436
01:51:57,619 --> 01:51:59,778
At first, it seemed manly, and I like it.

2437
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:01,288
But after spending time with him,

2438
01:52:01,289 --> 01:52:03,859
I got tired of it.

2439
01:52:04,789 --> 01:52:07,390
Well, those two dated for four years.

2440
01:52:07,529 --> 01:52:09,590
- Of course he can't forget her. - Right.

2441
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:12,499
And Na Yeon still hasn't forgotten about him either.

2442
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:16,029
After watching the ex reveal video, it felt like a tentative breakup.

2443
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:18,600
They seemed different from the other couples.

2444
01:52:19,069 --> 01:52:20,140
This is interesting.

2445
01:52:20,539 --> 01:52:21,739
How do Na Eon and I seem?

2446
01:52:22,439 --> 01:52:24,010
You seem like you're completely broken up.

2447
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:25,310
Why is the beer so good?

2448
01:52:25,579 --> 01:52:27,279
Yes, you're right.

2449
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:29,380
- Cheers. - That's it...

2450
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:31,249
and that's that.

2451
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:35,250
Having to hide the thoughts I have when I see Tae I...

2452
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,688
I don't want to be like that to Hee Doo.

2453
01:52:38,689 --> 01:52:39,759
It must be complicated.

2454
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,658
I know that I go back to how it was with Tae I.

2455
01:52:43,659 --> 01:52:44,659
Right.

2456
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:46,898
But I'm still choosing Tae I...

2457
01:52:46,899 --> 01:52:48,670
while he chooses Na Eon.

2458
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:51,739
Na Eon and Tae I were getting along so well.

2459
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:53,609
So I was a bit surprised.

2460
01:52:54,109 --> 01:52:55,970
But Na Eon...

2461
01:52:56,109 --> 01:52:57,880
Tae I is her type.

2462
01:52:58,609 --> 01:53:01,180
- Really? - A guy with strong features.

2463
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,618
Right. You look alike somehow.

2464
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:04,779
Tae I and I look alike?

2465
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,019
Before Na Eon came, Tae I was...

2466
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:11,689
Everyone here felt awkward around Tae I.

2467
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,130
But then Na Eon came.

2468
01:53:15,529 --> 01:53:18,100
And Tae I seemed comfortable with her.

2469
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,658
- That was fascinating to me. - Na Eon must've...

2470
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:20,729
accepted him.

2471
01:53:20,899 --> 01:53:22,698
It's more than acceptance. I think...

2472
01:53:22,699 --> 01:53:24,939
- they have similar personalities. - Right.

2473
01:53:25,369 --> 01:53:26,800
They're similar people.

2474
01:53:26,939 --> 01:53:28,169
She was so honest.

2475
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:29,470
She told me about...

2476
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:32,979
things that happened up to now and her feelings.

2477
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,279
She said that because of Hee Doo and Na Yeon's relationship,

2478
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:40,519
she can't find a way in.

2479
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:43,148
That was similar to my situation too.

2480
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:45,890
Because Hae Eun also has seven years with her ex.

2481
01:53:45,989 --> 01:53:48,229
I wondered if I could find my way into her life.

2482
01:53:48,289 --> 01:53:51,199
But Ji Yeon seemed to be thinking a lot about this.

2483
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:53,260
I didn't think much about it.

2484
01:53:56,699 --> 01:53:58,800
(Hae Eun is walking somewhere.)

If you want to have a 1-on-1 intimate conversation,

you can meet at a nearby cafe.

Hae Eun.

Why are you so late?

2499
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,309
Hae Eun, I was wondering where you had gone.

2500
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,409
Hae Eun.

2501
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:43,978
I'm going to cry if you call me out here like this.

2502
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:47,079
Do you know I almost cried just now too?

2503

If you call me out here like this, of course I feel like crying.

Let's promise not to cry.

2505

- We're already close to... - Let's promise not to cry.

2506
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,788
Hae Eun, look up.

2507
01:55:55,789 --> 01:55:56,988
- Let's not cry. - Look up.

2508

Let's not cry.

2509

What is this?

2510
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,389
I just saw you earlier. Why am I crying?

2511
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:03,930
What's this? Why are we...

2512
01:56:04,899 --> 01:56:07,100
Seriously, Sung Hae Eun.

2513
01:56:07,829 --> 01:56:08,898
It's so funny.

2514
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:10,170
Thank you for asking to see me first.

2515
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:13,840
I wanted to talk to you a lot more.

2516
01:56:14,039 --> 01:56:15,239
Do you feel okay?

2517
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:19,038
Since we got here, isn't it better because you don't have to see him?

2518
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:20,608
That's right. But really, that's fascinating...

2519
01:56:20,609 --> 01:56:22,749
because I didn't think of him when I went out.

2520
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:24,250
- Like on a date? Right. - Yes.

2521
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,619
But when I get back...

2522
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:27,949
- Because you see him. - Yes.

2523
01:56:28,289 --> 01:56:30,390
And he's just so frigid with me.

2524
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:32,689
He might be doing it on purpose.

2525
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,159
Because he thinks that's what's best for you.

2526
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,760
So it hurts more.

2527
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:42,568
I think our situations are really similar.

2528
01:56:42,569 --> 01:56:43,969
- Right? - Yes.

2529
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:45,738
So I think we can empathize so much.

2530
01:56:45,739 --> 01:56:48,769
And I bet those two are probably empathizing with each other...

2531
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:49,908
- so much. - Yes, so much.

2532
01:56:49,909 --> 01:56:51,238
We're like that too.

2533
01:56:51,239 --> 01:56:53,579
We had similar stories, and we both dated for a long time.

2534
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,978
So I think I know what Gyu Min means to you.

2535
01:56:56,979 --> 01:56:59,578
I think I do too. And I keep seeing it.

2536
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:01,988
Seriously, he's so similar to Gyu Min.

2537
01:57:01,989 --> 01:57:05,158
I thought it was natural for you to feel swayed.

2538
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:06,589
So I totally understood you.

2539
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:08,328
And one thing you said was that...

2540
01:57:08,329 --> 01:57:11,999
Gyu Min thought you were cute and pretty,

2541
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,769
and he respected you as a person and saw you for who you are.

2542
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:16,600
I thought you must've been so happy about that.

2543
01:57:16,699 --> 01:57:18,599
Right. That was the biggest thing.

2544
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,299
I thought you were being cautious...

2545
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,568
- and giving up on Gyu Min. - No.

2546
01:57:22,569 --> 01:57:24,578
- I don't want you to... - No, it's not like that.

2547
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:25,809
I don't have the right to.

2548
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:27,509
If you think that way, I feel hurt.

2549
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:29,879
If I give up because of you,

2550
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,618
then that's not good for you or Gyu Min either.

2551
01:57:33,619 --> 01:57:36,689
- Right. - But that's not it. Really.

2552
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:39,419
I'm just doing as my heart tells me.

2553
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:41,589
But what's weird is that when I'm with Hyun Gyu,

2554
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:43,089
I don't think of Gyu Min.

2555
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:46,099
Hyun Gyu saw me crying.

2556
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,868
- Did he console you? - He told me not to cry.

2557
01:57:47,869 --> 01:57:50,299
It was comforting, but I felt sorry too.

2558
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:51,698
I was grateful and felt comforted.

2559
01:57:51,699 --> 01:57:53,600
My emotions are crazy every day.

2560
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:54,908
I can't predict what it'll be like the next moment.

2561
01:57:54,909 --> 01:57:57,179
Still, hearing that you felt comforted makes me happy.

2562
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,809
It really did, and I felt like I could rely on him.

2563
01:57:58,810 --> 01:58:00,339
I hope you have more heart-fluttering moments.

2564
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:02,278
You had it so hard since you got here.

2565
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:04,318
I truly hope that you are happy.

2566
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:06,380
But really, I love that I can have...

2567
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:08,719
this kind of relationship with you.

2568
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,318
- I'm so grateful and happy. - Right.

2569
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:12,559
I only held out because you were here.

2570
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,688
- I feel the same. - I'm going to cry.

2571
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:15,689
But...

2572
01:58:16,729 --> 01:58:18,260
Gosh, I'm going to cry.

2573
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:20,158
But really, thank you so much.

2574
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:23,069
It's true. Because you were here...

2575
01:58:24,939 --> 01:58:28,809
In some ways, Hae Eun could've had the hardest time here because of me.

2576
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:31,179
Still, we relied on each other the most,

2577
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,810
and we were each other's rocks.

2578
01:58:34,109 --> 01:58:38,180
She probably requested the talk to make me feel more at ease.

2579
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:39,379
I'm off.

2580
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:40,380
(The 1-on-1 conversation ends.)

2581
01:58:40,381 --> 01:58:41,850
- Get back safely. - I will.

2582
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:49,289
Goodness, that kind person...

2583
01:58:53,829 --> 01:58:57,170
(The 1-on-1 conversation will take place at Ciao.)

2584
01:59:11,949 --> 01:59:15,020
(Requester, Park Na Eon)

2585
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,619
Goodness.

2586
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:22,689
- It was you. - Hi.

2587
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:24,560
What is going on?

2588
01:59:24,659 --> 01:59:25,898
I just called you to hang out.

2589
01:59:25,899 --> 01:59:27,028
Really?

2590
01:59:27,029 --> 01:59:29,899
- Na Eon. - Why?

2591
01:59:31,670 --> 01:59:33,169
I seriously called you to hang out.

2592
01:59:33,170 --> 01:59:35,140
Good. How are you these days?

2593
01:59:35,739 --> 01:59:37,639
Is it weird to ask you something like this?

2594
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:38,939
No, say anything.

2595
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:42,250
- What kind of person is he? - Tae I?

2596
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:45,550
Honestly, I think...

2597
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:48,849
people with similar personalities met here.

2598
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:51,059
I truly want him to be happy.

2599
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:52,288
- Tae I? - Yes.

2600
01:59:52,289 --> 01:59:54,229
I really cherish Tae I.

2601
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:56,789
- Isn't that what a mother feels? - A bit.

2602
01:59:56,989 --> 01:59:58,630
- Motherly love? - Yes, a bit.

2603
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:01,630
It's beyond you taking care of Tae I and all that.

2604
02:00:01,930 --> 02:00:04,469
- Tae I seemed comfortable with you. - Really?

2605
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:06,039
From what I saw.

2606
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:09,239
So, honestly, I felt thankful too.

2607
02:00:09,539 --> 02:00:12,279
And around that time,

2608
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:15,680
I wished that someone could...

2609
02:00:15,979 --> 02:00:18,380
really like Tae I a lot.

2610
02:00:18,649 --> 02:00:20,949
And that didn't seem like the case,

2611
02:00:21,189 --> 02:00:24,789
so I felt a bit sad sometimes.

2612
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:28,988
But for me, it's... You said it yourself.

2613
02:00:28,989 --> 02:00:32,499
You sent Tae I messages and stuff.

2614
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,898
So I felt sorry sometimes.

2615
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:36,969
- Was I intruding... - Of course you could feel sorry.

2616
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:40,368
I thought maybe I was intruding. I think Tae I is fun.

2617
02:00:40,369 --> 02:00:44,038
But I also like you and want to be friends with you.

2618
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:45,879
You can probably tell that I like you, right?

2619
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,749
My one-sided love for you.

2620
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:50,309
One-sided love? I like you too.

2621
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:52,050
I just felt bad about the situation.

2622
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:54,520
But it can't be helped. Everyone here is like that.

2623
02:00:55,649 --> 02:00:56,849
This is what I wanted to say.

2624
02:00:56,850 --> 02:01:00,259
- Yesterday, Tae I was so fun. - You had fun with Tae I?

2625
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:02,789
Yes, but this is how I am.

2626
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:05,630
I get comfortable with someone and treat them with ease.

2627
02:01:05,899 --> 02:01:08,770
But then at a certain point, I feel uncomfortable on my own.

2628
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:10,269
But that discomfort...

2629
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:12,569
isn't because the other person made me feel uncomfortable.

2630
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:15,109
It's because I just keep thinking about things.

2631
02:01:15,409 --> 02:01:17,680
You know that right? When you like someone, it gets uncomfortable.

2632
02:01:18,909 --> 02:01:20,380
It's like that.

2633
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:24,920
What can we do?

2634
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:30,889
But it's not like my heart is fluttering so much.

2635
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:32,658
It's just comfortable. And it's fun.

2636
02:01:32,659 --> 02:01:34,159
I don't have to think too much and it's fun.

2637
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:39,960
But I had a date with Gyu Min yesterday.

2638
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:42,728
There's a serious side to him, the more you talk to him, right?

2639
02:01:42,729 --> 02:01:45,839
Yes, he's serious. And we talked about a lot of deep stuff.

2640
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,568
We talked a lot.

2641
02:01:47,569 --> 02:01:51,409
It's not like I feel butterflies with him or see him as a man.

2642
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:54,310
I just want him to be someone I have nearby.

2643
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:58,448
But when I keep thinking about it... I don't know.

2644
02:01:58,449 --> 02:01:59,578
- I'm getting more confused. - It's confusing?

2645
02:01:59,579 --> 02:02:02,818
Yes. Gyu Min and I were going to have breakfast together.

2646
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:05,659
But I overslept, so we couldn't have breakfast.

2647
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:08,930
I felt sorry, so I made breakfast for him.

2648
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:11,060
- Really? - So we ate together.

2649
02:02:11,899 --> 02:02:15,068
So we talked some more, and it's easy to talk to him.

2650
02:02:15,069 --> 02:02:17,769
Well, first of all, Gyu Min and I have similar tastes.

2651
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:21,340
Right. You don't see his flaws and you want to take care of him.

2652
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:23,210
Tae I is charming.

2653
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:26,279
And Gyu Min is a really good guy.

2654
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,908
- But honestly... - The more I think...

2655
02:02:28,909 --> 02:02:30,949
- It's Gyu Min. - Talking to him is so easy.

2656
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:32,949
I think Gyu Min will fall for you.

2657
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:34,649
- You think he'll fall for me? - Yes.

2658
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:39,159
But you know, I also think...

2659
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:41,590
someone like Gyu Min is cool.

2660
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:44,060
He can make me become a better person.

2661
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:46,728
The person who can give me more stability is...

2662
02:02:46,729 --> 02:02:48,930
Gyu Min, not Tae I. I'm sure of that.

2663
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:51,770
Right, Tae I is charming, and Gyu Min is stable.

2664
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,068
He is a good person.

2665
02:02:54,069 --> 02:02:56,409
Everyone here is a good person.

2666
02:02:56,909 --> 02:02:59,439
But you really have to think about what it is that you want.

2667
02:03:00,109 --> 02:03:04,249
Ji Yeon is strongly appealing that she wants me...

2668
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,019
to get together with Gyu Min.

2669
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,219
She thinks I might not like Gyu Min a lot at first...

2670
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,619
but that I should keep seeing him.

2671
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,988
(Does Ji Yeon's strong suggestion have an influence on you?)

2672
02:03:12,989 --> 02:03:14,358
Yes, it does.

2673
02:03:14,359 --> 02:03:18,060
I thought I should keep getting to know Gyu Min.

2674
02:03:18,829 --> 02:03:22,399
Actually, Tae I is...

2675
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,398
very honest in his texts...

2676
02:03:25,399 --> 02:03:27,970
and it sounds like he's expressing his feelings for me.

2677
02:03:28,069 --> 02:03:29,868
But when everyone is together,

2678
02:03:29,869 --> 02:03:32,809
or when we're not on a date, we don't have much communication.

2679
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:35,608
If it was me, I'd express myself more.

2680
02:03:35,609 --> 02:03:39,919
But maybe he's just not that into me. That's what I thought.

2681
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,688
The reason I thought so is that...

2682
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:45,159
If I liked Tae I a lot,

2683
02:03:45,319 --> 02:03:48,328
I would've wanted to be with him all the time.

2684
02:03:48,329 --> 02:03:49,658
I think that's what I would've done.

2685
02:03:49,659 --> 02:03:52,260
But I found myself...

2686
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:54,869
not doing that with him.

2687
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:59,039
So I suddenly thought that I wasn't sure about anything.

2688
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,739
I think that's why I had a hard time.

2689
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:04,938
But honestly, I'm like... Tae I keeps choosing me, you know?

2690
02:04:04,939 --> 02:04:09,250
And maybe that's because he's comfortable around me.

2691
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:11,420
What does he say? Does he say anything?

2692
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:13,179
Tae I and I don't talk.

2693
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:14,288
You don't?

2694
02:04:14,289 --> 02:04:16,890
I think that could be the case.

2695
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,459
He finds me comfortable, so he chooses...

2696
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,589
That's right. Tae I will...

2697
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:23,590
He finds me comfortable.

2698
02:04:23,591 --> 02:04:26,658
He feels the closest to you, so that's why he chose you.

2699
02:04:26,659 --> 02:04:30,269
I do too. This is what I think. It's not that he likes me.

2700
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:31,299
I'm just the most comfortable person here.

2701
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:33,438
- That's what it is. - And yesterday's date was...

2702
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:35,169
something I picked out for him.

2703
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:37,170
Why would I have picked you for him?

2704
02:04:37,270 --> 02:04:38,978
What did you talk about when you picked me?

2705
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:42,108
I just told him to go on a date with whoever he wanted.

2706
02:04:42,109 --> 02:04:44,249
Whoever he felt the most comfortable with.

2707
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:45,949
I told him I wanted him to feel comfortable.

2708
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,149
And then what did he say?

2709
02:04:47,479 --> 02:04:49,149
(How do you feel about Tae I?)

2710
02:04:49,289 --> 02:04:51,590
I think I have even less of an idea now.

2711
02:04:51,689 --> 02:04:54,590
I didn't have much thought about it until the day before.

2712
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:59,399
But then suddenly, I think my thoughts became complicated.

2713
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,670
I honestly don't know if my heart flutters with him.

2714
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,368
My heart flutters a bit with Tae I.

2715
02:05:04,369 --> 02:05:06,368
- Really? - Yes. But what good is that?

2716
02:05:06,369 --> 02:05:07,909
Keem Tae I doesn't know how I feel.

2717
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:11,010
Hey, I'm sorry.

2718
02:05:12,739 --> 02:05:16,449
But to be entirely frank,

2719
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:18,449
we have one day left on Jeju Island.

2720
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:21,788
If we could do an activity, I think doing it with...

2721
02:05:21,789 --> 02:05:23,589
Hee Doo, rather than with Tae I, would be more fun.

2722
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:25,289
But I think he will be swayed if you're the one doing it.

2723
02:05:30,329 --> 02:05:31,499
Should I try?

2724
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,629
- I'll go in today... - Hey.

2725
02:05:32,630 --> 02:05:35,930
You might be able to sway him if you try.

2726
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:39,000
I thought so too, of course.

2727
02:05:39,069 --> 02:05:40,799
But I don't want to anymore,

2728
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,839
and I know that's just my pride.

2729
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:46,209
Also, the more I had to think about Hee Doo that way,

2730
02:05:46,210 --> 02:05:48,108
the more it upset me.

2731
02:05:48,109 --> 02:05:52,549
However, I couldn't deny that I really enjoyed...

2732
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:54,850
spending time with Hee Doo.

2733
02:05:54,949 --> 02:05:56,590
That's why I was really confused.

2734
02:05:57,789 --> 02:06:00,618
Hee Doo has a lot of good energy.

2735
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:02,688
He's also very positive...

2736
02:06:02,689 --> 02:06:04,430
and has a lot of other good parts,

2737
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:07,259
but I haven't ever dated someone like that.

2738
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:08,899
- Really? - Never.

2739
02:06:09,229 --> 02:06:11,898
You need to date someone who's stable,

2740
02:06:11,899 --> 02:06:14,198
- bright, and positive. - I've never dated a guy like that.

2741
02:06:14,199 --> 02:06:15,909
Dating someone like that can make you happy.

2742
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:18,379
I want to hear what he has to say first...

2743
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:20,680
because we really haven't talked.

2744
02:06:21,609 --> 02:06:23,149
The two of you should do something together.

2745
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:27,319
She's interested in Hee Doo,

2746
02:06:27,649 --> 02:06:31,318
but it felt like she wasn't able to do the things she wanted to do.

2747
02:06:31,319 --> 02:06:33,260
She didn't seem to understand her own feelings.

2748
02:06:33,789 --> 02:06:35,489
So I felt bad.

2749
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:40,399
She did say that Na Yeon and Hee Doo seemed pretty firm.

2750
02:06:40,529 --> 02:06:42,699
I thought so too,

2751
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,339
but it doesn't seem like Hee Doo...

2752
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:46,969
has feelings for Na Yeon still.

2753
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:49,309
I think Na Yeon...

2754
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:51,139
really likes Hee Doo.

2755
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:53,840
She likes him as if they're still together now.

2756
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:57,449
I think if Ji Yeon tries, she'll be able to sway him.

2757
02:06:57,579 --> 02:06:59,249
(The 1-on-1 conversation ends.)

2758
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:00,319
Do something.

2759
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:19,939
(Won Bin shortly fell asleep.)

2760
02:07:21,409 --> 02:07:22,569
You scared me.

2761
02:07:34,789 --> 02:07:37,619
(Won Bin leaves.)

2762
02:07:58,140 --> 02:08:00,738
I spent the whole day in the reception area.

2763
02:08:00,739 --> 02:08:02,608
Ji Soo came by once.

2764
02:08:02,609 --> 02:08:05,649
I took the umbrella and waited outside until she left.

2765
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:09,648
She did look over at me once before she went back in.

2766
02:08:09,649 --> 02:08:13,760
I wondered why she did that and if she had something to say.

2767
02:08:19,729 --> 02:08:23,100
(Ji Soo grabs some paper and a pen.)

2768
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:34,609
(She starts to write a letter.)

2769
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:40,919
I wanted to give Won Bin time to understand my feelings.

2770
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:45,419
I wrote a letter explaining why I was frustrated and upset.

2771
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:48,028
I wrote everything out honestly.

2772
02:08:48,029 --> 02:08:50,429
I wrote that I felt like he never considered my feelings...

2773
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:53,358
when we were talking about the past...

2774
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:55,199
and that it upset me.

2775
02:08:55,399 --> 02:08:58,300
I also wrote that we should talk it out.

2776
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:03,640
(She expressed her honest feelings through her letter.)

2777
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:10,249
(Ji Soo goes to Won Bin's room.)

2778
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:11,319
Hello.

2779
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:13,849
- Ji Soo? - Gyu Min?

2780
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:15,818
- Yes. - Are you alone?

2781
02:09:15,819 --> 02:09:17,689
Yes. What's up?

2782
02:09:20,289 --> 02:09:22,590
I have something to give him.

2783
02:09:22,659 --> 02:09:24,529
- To Won Bin? - Yes.

2784
02:09:25,159 --> 02:09:28,600
You could put it in his drawer or in his journal.

2785
02:09:31,699 --> 02:09:34,239
(Ji Soo puts the letter on his bed.)

2786
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:43,079
(Won Bin comes back to his room.)

2787
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:49,850
(He spots Ji Soo's letter.)

2788
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:51,989
Did you go out somewhere, Won Bin?

2789
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:53,989
I did.

2790
02:09:55,689 --> 02:09:59,329
(He takes time reading Ji Soo's letter.)

2791
02:09:59,699 --> 02:10:02,769
She wrote about the things I did...

2792
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:05,869
that upset her or made her angry.

2793
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:10,038
She said that I was too stuck in the past...

2794
02:10:10,039 --> 02:10:12,880
and that she didn't want me to cry anymore.

2795
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:16,310
I couldn't deny what she said...

2796
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:19,680
because looking back, I was really stuck in the past.

2797
02:10:19,779 --> 02:10:22,119
I wasn't able to show her...

2798
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:24,389
that I've changed at all.

2799
02:10:24,390 --> 02:10:26,358
I've only shown her how I used to be in the past.

2800
02:10:26,359 --> 02:10:29,728
I mostly expected what she wrote,

2801
02:10:29,729 --> 02:10:32,829
so I accepted what she said, but it still hurt my heart a little.

2802
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:44,909
(Hae Eun is waiting for someone else.)

2803
02:10:47,409 --> 02:10:50,449
(Respondent Park Na Eon)

2804
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,889
- Hello. - Hi, Hae Eun.

2805
02:10:55,890 --> 02:10:58,019
- You didn't know, right? - No. I had no idea.

2806
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:59,760
How did you trick me so well?

2807
02:11:01,159 --> 02:11:02,760
You're wearing the clothes I picked out for you.

2808
02:11:03,289 --> 02:11:05,028
I was just curious how things went.

2809
02:11:05,029 --> 02:11:06,398
- Oh, yesterday? - Yes.

2810
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:07,629
I think he's more like a brother.

2811
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:09,629
- Oh, really? That's a surprise. - I agree.

2812
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:12,238
Honestly, I was kind of worried...

2813
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:14,769
- that I'd like Gyu Min... - If he made your heart flutter...

2814
02:11:14,770 --> 02:11:16,769
- and not text Tae I. - I see.

2815
02:11:16,770 --> 02:11:18,179
Do you know what he texted me yesterday?

2816
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:20,109
He asked, "How did you feel, cheating on me?"

2817
02:11:20,279 --> 02:11:23,148
But I can't tell how Tae I feels.

2818
02:11:23,149 --> 02:11:24,478
- Why? - Because...

2819
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:27,519
I can't imagine him liking someone.

2820
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:29,449
- He likes you. - No.

2821
02:11:30,489 --> 02:11:32,819
No, I mean...

2822
02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:35,259
it feels like he's picking me...

2823
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:36,589
just because we kept going on dates...

2824
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:38,828
after I came here.

2825
02:11:38,829 --> 02:11:41,568
- That's why I thought. - But that's not what his text said.

2826
02:11:41,569 --> 02:11:42,929
That's why I'm confused.

2827
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:46,198
Does he really like me?

2828
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:49,038
I can't tell if I like him as a person...

2829
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:50,839
or as a love interest.

2830
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:53,278
If he gives you butterflies,

2831
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:55,049
That always happens a bit later for me.

2832
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:57,278
I usually have to take time...

2833
02:11:57,279 --> 02:11:59,379
to get to know someone for a long time...

2834
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:01,390
because I develop feelings for them.

2835
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:05,090
I think I have to see Gyu Min a few more times.

2836
02:12:05,489 --> 02:12:07,420
I do want to a few more times.

2837
02:12:08,130 --> 02:12:10,460
I think I might get butterflies then.

2838
02:12:11,029 --> 02:12:13,698
I have two people I'm interested in.

2839
02:12:13,699 --> 02:12:15,698
I should go on a lot of dates with them.

2840
02:12:15,699 --> 02:12:16,769
You should.

2841
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:18,840
I can't tell how Hyun Gyu feels.

2842
02:12:19,470 --> 02:12:21,709
He doesn't ever show his feelings.

2843
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:23,270
It might not seem like it, but he is.

2844
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:25,339
- But... - I don't get that.

2845
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,738
He's so reserved.

2846
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:28,879
He doesn't care...

2847
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,319
about people he doesn't like.

2848
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:33,919
That's how he feels to me. I don't think he cares about me.

2849
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,948
We have a good date, but when we're with everyone...

2850
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:38,760
and I say something to him, he says, "No."

2851
02:12:38,989 --> 02:12:40,059
Oh, really?

2852
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:41,630
He's kind of like that.

2853
02:12:41,859 --> 02:12:43,760
He just says, "Yes."

2854
02:12:43,829 --> 02:12:45,029
You're upset, aren't you?

2855
02:12:45,329 --> 02:12:46,960
So I don't get him yet.

2856
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:48,669
Are you upset or not?

2857
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:51,569
- Or do you not care? - I'm upset.

2858
02:12:51,670 --> 02:12:54,538
I think that's why I can't fully like him yet.

2859
02:12:54,539 --> 02:12:55,868
If he were to be nicer to you,

2860
02:12:55,869 --> 02:12:57,369
I like friendly people.

2861
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,608
When he's in a relationship,

2862
02:12:59,609 --> 02:13:01,078
he says, "You're pretty" all the time.

2863
02:13:01,079 --> 02:13:02,810
He doesn't even care if you gain weight.

2864
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:05,118
He just says, "You're pretty?" I love that.

2865
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:07,049
He never tells you to change.

2866
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:09,448
He never says anything negative to his girlfriends.

2867
02:13:09,449 --> 02:13:11,858
He doesn't try to change someone's appearance.

2868
02:13:11,859 --> 02:13:13,188
He doesn't expect you to.

2869
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:14,358
He just sees someone as themselves.

2870
02:13:14,359 --> 02:13:15,828
He always says, "You are you. Na Eon is Na Eon."

2871
02:13:15,829 --> 02:13:17,659
He never asked for anything more than that.

2872
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:19,859
I always asked for a lot.

2873
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,568
I learned a lot.

2874
02:13:22,569 --> 02:13:25,398
If it hadn't been for him, I think I would've been very immature still.

2875
02:13:25,399 --> 02:13:26,469
- Really? - Really.

2876
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:28,710
I met him when I was 21 years old.

2877
02:13:28,739 --> 02:13:31,009
I know it's funny for me to say this since I'm still a baby,

2878
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:32,839
but I do seem pretty mature, right?

2879
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:34,849
I think it's because I met him.

2880
02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:36,108
- Really? - Really.

2881
02:13:36,109 --> 02:13:37,810
The reason I wanted to tell you this,

2882
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:41,889
the reason I thought you two should see each other...

2883
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:44,148
is because I think you two would be happy together.

2884
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:45,889
- Really? - Yes.

2885
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:49,158
Honestly, I want you to be happy too, of course,

2886
02:13:49,159 --> 02:13:51,658
- but I want him to be happy more. - Of course.

2887
02:13:51,659 --> 02:13:54,528
But if his happiness also means your happiness,

2888
02:13:54,529 --> 02:13:56,299
that's awesome for me.

2889
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:00,600
I felt bad when we broke up...

2890
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:02,340
because I thought...

2891
02:14:02,739 --> 02:14:04,809
that if I were a nicer person,

2892
02:14:04,810 --> 02:14:07,709
- he wouldn't have struggled... - Why?

2893
02:14:07,710 --> 02:14:10,648
And that I wouldn't have either.

2894
02:14:10,649 --> 02:14:14,920
But you're a nice person.

2895
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:17,549
I think you're a nice and wise person.

2896
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:19,419
So I thought it'd be nice if you two got together.

2897
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:22,429
I think you'd both be happy...

2898
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:24,728
and have a smooth relationship.

2899
02:14:24,729 --> 02:14:26,630
(Do you wish for Hae Eun and Gyu Min to get together?)

2900
02:14:26,699 --> 02:14:29,999
I do. She's a diamond in the rough.

2901
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,368
I think Hyun Gyu is someone who will be able to...

2902
02:14:32,369 --> 02:14:34,368
turn her into a shining diamond.

2903
02:14:34,369 --> 02:14:35,869
At least he will be that person for Hae Eun.

2904
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:37,839
But with Jin Sol,

2905
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,978
(She subconsciously called Hyun Gyu...)

2906
02:14:38,979 --> 02:14:41,038
My gosh, I got so serious.

2907
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:42,210
(by the name she used for him when they used to date.)

2908
02:14:45,979 --> 02:14:47,720
I used the name Jin Sol...

2909
02:14:47,949 --> 02:14:49,250
when I went to high school...

2910
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:51,858
as a way to show my determination for starting anew...

2911
02:14:51,859 --> 02:14:53,260
and for studying hard.

2912
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:57,130
All of my close friends called him Jin Sol.

2913
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:59,228
(What did Na Eon call you?)

2914
02:14:59,229 --> 02:15:00,559
She knew both names,

2915
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:02,000
but she called me Jin Sol more.

2916
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:05,868
I don't think I ever really called him Hyun Gyu.

2917
02:15:05,869 --> 02:15:07,869
I always called him Jin Sol.

2918
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:11,779
Oh, I'm starting to cry.

2919
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:28,229
I'm sorry.

2920
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:36,499
I'm so grateful to him.

2921
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:37,899
(So grateful)

2922
02:15:38,869 --> 02:15:41,369
I don't think I knew because I didn't call him Jin Sol.

2923
02:15:43,409 --> 02:15:48,750
(The name Jin Sol reminded her of the past she had buried away.)

2924
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:55,989
I'm sorry. Could we take a break?

2925
02:16:09,869 --> 02:16:10,969
(How did you meet Hyun Gyu?)

2926
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:14,100
A friend introduced us.

2927
02:16:14,970 --> 02:16:16,739
I told her to bring...

2928
02:16:16,909 --> 02:16:21,179
the coolest, most handsome guy at her school.

2929
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:22,479
That's how we were introduced.

2930
02:16:22,579 --> 02:16:24,948
I was at Hongik University at the time,

2931
02:16:24,949 --> 02:16:26,978
so he said he'd come to meet me.

2932
02:16:26,979 --> 02:16:30,148
We met at that confusing exit.

2933
02:16:30,149 --> 02:16:33,059
I saw this big guy walking towards me.

2934
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:37,430
I thought, "He's tall."

2935
02:16:37,659 --> 02:16:40,898
At first, I thought his features were too strong,

2936
02:16:40,899 --> 02:16:42,899
so I didn't think he was handsome.

2937
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:45,699
But the more I saw him, the more handsome he seemed.

2938
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:47,238
He had a fun personality.

2939
02:16:47,239 --> 02:16:49,339
Being with him was really fun.

2940
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:51,639
She's like an old friend. It's easy to talk to her.

2941
02:16:51,979 --> 02:16:53,408
Being with her is fun.

2942
02:16:53,409 --> 02:16:54,809
I don't even notice the time passing by.

2943
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:56,979
He's like family.

2944
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:00,879
Also, it was the first time for me to live in Seoul.

2945
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:03,719
Jin Sol was the first person I dated after I moved to Seoul.

2946
02:17:03,889 --> 02:17:07,389
I got really attached to him because I relied on him a lot.

2947
02:17:07,489 --> 02:17:09,429
(Who liked the other person more?)

2948
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:10,458
I did.

2949
02:17:10,459 --> 02:17:12,530
I really liked him so much.

2950
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:16,469
I could treat him like family.

2951
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:18,539
All of the new experiences I had in Seoul...

2952
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:21,239
were all with Hyun Gyu.

2953
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:24,208
I think of him as my family in Seoul.

2954
02:17:24,209 --> 02:17:26,739
(I think of him as my family in Seoul.)

2955
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:30,649
I was so young,

2956
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:35,049
but while dating Jin Sol,

2957
02:17:35,819 --> 02:17:38,249
he taught me about the world.

2958
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,959
(Jin Sol taught me about the world.)

2959

At the time,

2960
02:17:42,459 --> 02:17:43,760
I was living alone...

2961
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:46,129
and having a hard time adjusting.

2962
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,430
I was lost...

2963
02:17:49,829 --> 02:17:51,670
and lethargic.

2964
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,369
Now, I'm a very proactive,

2965
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:57,340
positive person.

2966
02:17:57,569 --> 02:17:59,539
If it hadn't been for Jin Sol,

2967
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:01,649
I don't think I would've ended up this way.

2968
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:06,250
Even when things were tough for him, he believed in me.

2969
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:08,950
He always tried to help me...

2970
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,260
and do whatever he could for me.

2971
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:15,158
I think we grew together.

has also been hurt a lot.

2982
02:18:54,329 --> 02:18:58,229
I think Hyun Gyu will accept her as she is.

2983
02:18:58,739 --> 02:19:01,039
Hae Eun will be able to care for Hyun Gyu with a big heart,

2984
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:05,909
which I wasn't able to do well.

I hope they're happy together.

2986
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:12,249
He seems like a really good person from what you say.

2987
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:13,750
I only have good memories left.

She said that Hyun Gyu knows how to love someone as they are...

and that he was the type of person I needed the most at this time.

You do look nice today.

I felt like she didn't want to talk to me...

and like she tried to avoid me...

I still have it on because I'm a good person.

- I'm not upset. - You were upset...

If you're upset, I understand.

I'd choose you.

3070

I feel happy when I'm with you.

was thank you.

Honestly, I don't care about Na Yeon.

3087

You asked me if I ever dated someone for four years.

3088

No, so I don't know what it's like.

But now I understand a little.

if I ever dated someone for four years.

3092

- Again? - Yes.

3094
02:24:02,309 --> 02:24:04,940
I was shocked by your interview.

3095
02:24:05,139 --> 02:24:06,639
Why were you shocked?

3096
02:24:06,739 --> 02:24:10,350
It felt like you were just having a break.

3097
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:12,750
- Did it feel like that? - Yes.

3098

Have you ever dated someone for four years?

No.

3100

Four years aren't a short period of time.

3101
02:24:19,719 --> 02:24:20,760
Of course not.

3102
02:24:20,860 --> 02:24:22,760
To me, it sounded like,

3103

"It's hard to face my ex..."

3104

"because I dated her for four years."

3105
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:31,500
I've never dated anyone for four years before.

3106
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:34,099
"You wouldn't understand me."

3107
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:38,610
"You need to understand me." That's how I received it.

3108
02:24:39,639 --> 02:24:41,579
If I had no feelings for my ex at all,

3109

I would've enjoyed the date with you.

3110

It wasn't...

3111

easy for me to approach anyone.

3112

Would you fall for me if I try?

3113
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:01,930
Before this, I was disappointed in her,

3114
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:05,469
so I thought Ji Yeon wasn't into me anymore.

3115
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:07,940
I got to know how she felt.

3116
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:11,239
It was nice. It resolved the misunderstanding between us.

3117

I realized once again...

3118

that it's fun to be with Hee Doo.

I enjoy spending time with Hee Doo.

02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,299
No, I liked it.

3148
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,269
It's amazing when I meet someone...

3149
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:53,638
who makes me open my heart...

3150
02:26:53,639 --> 02:26:56,350
because I don't do that.

3151
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:58,479
- Are you lying? - No.

3152
02:26:58,579 --> 02:27:00,649
- You talked so much. - No.

3153
02:27:00,750 --> 02:27:01,979
- Really? - Yes.

3154
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:04,090
I have a question.

3155
02:27:05,049 --> 02:27:06,489
I'll be direct.

3156
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:08,459
You and Na Yeon...

3157
02:27:08,719 --> 02:27:11,530
had feelings for each other.

3158
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:14,759
What did you like about her?

3159
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:15,968
- You mean her? - Yes.

3160
02:27:15,969 --> 02:27:18,629
I know she's charming, but what did you like about her?

3161
02:27:18,799 --> 02:27:21,169
It wasn't like that at first,

3162
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:23,770
but when I judge someone,

3163
02:27:24,139 --> 02:27:26,739
I look at her appearance first,

3164
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:28,708
then I start to see...

3165
02:27:28,709 --> 02:27:31,449
if she is the person I expected her to be.

3166
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:33,578
If she isn't, I see how she's different.

3167
02:27:33,579 --> 02:27:34,780
And everyone does that.

3168
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:39,190
The date with her was very nice.

3169
02:27:39,459 --> 02:27:42,389
I got the feeling that she was a very nice person.

3170
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:45,430
That's why...

3171
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:48,728
You're very defensive.

3172
02:27:48,729 --> 02:27:51,568
- Am I? - Yes.

3173
02:27:51,569 --> 02:27:52,968
How am I supposed to talk?

3174
02:27:52,969 --> 02:27:55,440
You didn't tell me anything.

3175
02:27:56,639 --> 02:27:58,638
There's no substance.

3176
02:27:58,639 --> 02:28:00,878
- Really? - In the end,

3177
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:02,750
you only said she was nice.

3178
02:28:03,649 --> 02:28:05,878
I'm not blaming you.

3179
02:28:05,879 --> 02:28:07,350
Let me tell you more.

3180
02:28:07,649 --> 02:28:09,318
Because I'm surprised.

3181
02:28:09,319 --> 02:28:11,350
You're not telling me anything...

3182
02:28:11,690 --> 02:28:13,190
when we're supposed to open our hearts.

3183
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:15,259
- Okay. - We're not here for breakfast.

3184
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:17,558
- We're supposed to open our hearts. - Okay. Sorry about that.

3185
02:28:17,559 --> 02:28:18,728
Do you know what you said?

3186
02:28:18,729 --> 02:28:21,729
"I noticed she was nice on the date."

3187
02:28:24,899 --> 02:28:26,770
- I'll tell you. - Those things...

3188
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:28,440
You've only said designators.

3189
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,539
- Let me start over. - Okay.

3190
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,068
Let me try that again. It's hot.

3191
02:28:32,069 --> 02:28:34,609
Does it feel like I'm scolding you?

3192
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:37,908
No. After hearing that, I agree with you.

3193
02:28:37,909 --> 02:28:40,048
Other people would let you get away with that,

3194
02:28:40,049 --> 02:28:41,148
but I don't.

3195
02:28:41,149 --> 02:28:44,019
Right. So if I start over,

3196
02:28:44,020 --> 02:28:45,988
at first,

3197
02:28:45,989 --> 02:28:49,190
Na Yeon looked gorgeous.

3198
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:51,629
I expected her to be insincere,

3199
02:28:51,889 --> 02:28:55,228
but that was gone after the date with her.

3200
02:28:55,229 --> 02:28:57,100
Was she that cute?

3201
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,839
She was cute,

3202
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:03,940
but at the time,

3203
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:07,479
she felt more sincere than I expected.

3204
02:29:08,979 --> 02:29:11,679
We didn't know how old we were.

3205
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,978
We barely knew about our jobs.

3206
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:15,988
So we were keeping a distance.

3207
02:29:15,989 --> 02:29:17,488
After the date that day,

3208
02:29:17,489 --> 02:29:19,818
she became the first person I felt comfortable with.

3209
02:29:19,819 --> 02:29:23,129
After that, I found her appealing.

3210
02:29:23,530 --> 02:29:25,958
That's what happened. Should I get into more detail?

3211
02:29:25,959 --> 02:29:27,228
That was good enough.

3212
02:29:27,229 --> 02:29:28,430
- Do you feel better now? - Yes.

3213
02:29:30,030 --> 02:29:32,100
Am I giving you a hard time?

3214
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,270
Not at all.

3215
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:37,510
I'm not so easy.

3216
02:29:37,870 --> 02:29:39,078
You're not giving me a hard time at all.

3217
02:29:39,079 --> 02:29:40,839
- Okay. - I actually like it.

My goodness.

3224
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,048
- What are you doing in there? - Come here.

3225
02:30:22,049 --> 02:30:23,049
You scared me.

3226
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:25,420
Peekaboo.

3227
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:28,190
Why were you staring like that?

3228
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:29,530
Didn't you know?

3229
02:30:30,329 --> 02:30:31,689
It's nice and raining.

3230
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:33,959
You didn't know it was me? Who did you expect?

3231
02:30:35,459 --> 02:30:36,899
I had no idea who it was.

3232
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:40,468
It could be Ji Soo. It could be you.

3233
02:30:40,469 --> 02:30:41,799
It could be Ji Yeon.

3234
02:30:43,170 --> 02:30:44,568
You must be popular.

3235
02:30:44,569 --> 02:30:45,780
I'm not that popular.

3236
02:30:46,739 --> 02:30:48,478
- You must be popular. - I'm not popular.

3237

"I'm not popular."

3238
02:30:50,350 --> 02:30:52,750
Did you not want to talk to... Did you not request it?

3239
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:54,449
You don't plan to talk to me, do you?

3240
02:30:54,450 --> 02:30:55,789
I didn't talk to anyone.

3241
02:30:55,790 --> 02:30:57,620
I only requested you.

3242
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,719
I suppose Gyu Min will be here soon.

3243
02:31:00,790 --> 02:31:02,189
- No. - No?

3244
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:03,190
No.

3245
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:05,489
Or maybe Gyu Min requested it.

3246
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:10,029
- You bought a book with Gyu Min. - Yes.

3247
02:31:10,030 --> 02:31:12,669
- What did you buy? - A book on philosophy.

3248
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:13,898
Philosophy? Why philosophy?

3249
02:31:13,899 --> 02:31:15,809
I like philosophy.

3250
02:31:16,069 --> 02:31:17,339
I should read books like that...

3251
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:21,440
to think that way.

3252
02:31:25,049 --> 02:31:27,019
- Wait. I'm not surprised. - Isn't that hot?

3253
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:28,750
No. It is hot.

3254
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:33,620
- Geez. - I did what I always do.

3255
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:37,529
- What's wrong with you? - Thanks.

3256
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:39,129
Why are you doing that?

3257
02:31:39,930 --> 02:31:42,299
You need to be careful. Seriously.

3258
02:31:43,969 --> 02:31:45,370
Wipe it here.

3259
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:49,870
Why are you doing that? Why?

3260
02:31:50,309 --> 02:31:52,239
It was hot.

3261
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:54,879
I wasn't aware of my jaw.

3262
02:31:55,979 --> 02:31:57,010
It's sticky.

3263
02:32:08,290 --> 02:32:09,290
Thanks.

3264
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:12,999
My thoughts on you changed after coming here.

3265
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,058
Why did it change?

3266
02:32:14,059 --> 02:32:15,760
I understand you now.

3267
02:32:15,870 --> 02:32:17,128
Back then, when you said,

3268
02:32:17,129 --> 02:32:19,769
"Why are you spilling it? Why are you doing that?"

3269
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:20,869
That upset me.

3270
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:21,899
Why did that upset you?

3271
02:32:22,510 --> 02:32:26,179
Because you sound cold. You sound grumpy.

3272
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:28,238
You probably know what I want.

3273
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:29,409
I know what you want.

3274
02:32:31,079 --> 02:32:33,250
So here's the thing.

3275
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,818
"I'm always like that. That's who I am."

3276
02:32:35,819 --> 02:32:38,350
You always take it for granted.

3277
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:39,760
That upsets me.

3278
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:41,459
I know that.

3279
02:32:41,719 --> 02:32:43,590
I realize that now.

3280
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:46,959
Now I can afford...

3281
02:32:47,129 --> 02:32:49,128
to understand you.

3282
02:32:49,129 --> 02:32:51,969
I understand you. I look back at myself.

3283
02:32:52,100 --> 02:32:53,600
I'm giving you assurance.

3284
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:55,068
All of a sudden?

3285
02:32:55,069 --> 02:32:57,409
All of a sudden? I've been doing that in the last few days.

3286
02:32:57,709 --> 02:33:00,979
"All of a sudden?" Don't say that.

3287
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,680
Because that sounds so sudden.

3288
02:33:03,950 --> 02:33:06,549
I told you already. Why are you saying it's sudden?

3289
02:33:07,049 --> 02:33:08,718
That's the thing.

3290
02:33:08,719 --> 02:33:09,919
Just don't do that.

3291
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:11,889
As long as you don't do that, I'm okay with everything else.

3292
02:33:17,030 --> 02:33:21,000
(Hee Doo is quiet.)

3293
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:35,950
Can you not afford that yet?

3294
02:33:37,879 --> 02:33:38,950
No.

3295
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:46,360
No? Not yet?

3296
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:48,959
It's not that I can afford it.

3297
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:53,600
That's the feeling I get. "All of a sudden?"

3298
02:33:53,959 --> 02:33:56,129
I get it.

3299
02:33:57,469 --> 02:33:59,739
I wanted to...

3300
02:33:59,969 --> 02:34:03,209
talk to Hee Doo about...

3301
02:34:03,909 --> 02:34:05,309
the change he mentioned the day before.

3302
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:09,010
I wanted to talk to him...

3303
02:34:09,079 --> 02:34:10,378
about how we want to change.

3304
02:34:10,379 --> 02:34:13,149
But he didn't tell me.

3305
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:17,250
I requested the conversation again this time.

3306
02:34:17,549 --> 02:34:18,920
I talked alone.

3307
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:24,158
It got me thinking...

3308
02:34:24,159 --> 02:34:25,690
if he wasn't interested.

3309
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:28,399
I've told you what's in my heart.

3310
02:34:34,299 --> 02:34:35,739
Are you contemplating?

3311
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:38,408
Are you contemplating between me and someone else?

3312
02:34:38,409 --> 02:34:39,979
- Yes. - Yes?

3313
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,040
Think about it.

3314
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:50,850
So this is how it ends again.

3315
02:34:56,090 --> 02:34:58,429
Even though I requested a conversation,

3316
02:34:58,430 --> 02:35:01,329
he kept changing the topic and didn't tell me about his thoughts.

3317
02:35:03,129 --> 02:35:05,628
So, for the first time,

3318
02:35:05,629 --> 02:35:09,068
this relationship would end...

3319
02:35:09,069 --> 02:35:11,009
if I let it go.

3320
02:35:11,010 --> 02:35:14,280
I didn't feel like dating Na Yeon again.

3321
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:18,780
I tried to push her out...

3322
02:35:19,149 --> 02:35:20,250
unconsciously.

02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:15,000
Hi.

3329
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,308
- You're here. - Yes.

3330

Where were you?

3331
02:36:18,610 --> 02:36:19,978
I was outside.

- Outside? - Yes.

Oh, gosh.

3334
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:27,079
I expected Hae Eun...

3335
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:29,119
to request it.

3336
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:32,148
I waited for it the most. This was what I'd been waiting for.

3337
02:36:32,149 --> 02:36:35,360
I didn't get to talk to Gyu Min a lot.

3338
02:36:35,690 --> 02:36:38,459
I wanted to talk about the good old days with him.

3339
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:42,968
I wanted to spend some time...

3340
02:36:42,969 --> 02:36:44,600
talking about what's on my mind.

3341
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:48,699
Was it cold on the way here?

3342
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:51,638
Very cold. It's still cold.

3343
02:36:51,639 --> 02:36:53,308
- It's cold. - Right?

3344
02:36:53,309 --> 02:36:54,809
Your hands must be freezing.

3345
02:36:57,879 --> 02:36:59,950
It's cold. I can't give you my jacket.

3346
02:37:00,219 --> 02:37:02,249
You never do that anyway.

3347
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:03,889
I always did.

3348
02:37:04,219 --> 02:37:06,388
You never did. You said it was cold.

3349
02:37:06,389 --> 02:37:08,589
Even if it's freezing to death.

3350
02:37:08,590 --> 02:37:10,388
Even my fingers break...

3351
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:12,430
Even if you give me your jacket, you shiver.

3352
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:15,229
Why did you request it?

3353
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:18,399
Of course I wanted to. If...

3354
02:37:18,969 --> 02:37:21,499
I don't talk to you like this,

3355
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:23,739
you never give me a chance to talk to you.

3356
02:37:24,610 --> 02:37:26,340
That's not true.

3357
02:37:27,379 --> 02:37:28,840
We talk now.

3358
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:32,078
We didn't really have time after we came to Jeju.

3359
02:37:32,079 --> 02:37:34,520
You were always on a date.

3360
02:37:36,389 --> 02:37:38,389
How did you feel after sending me on a date?

3361
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:39,759
After you went on a date?

3362
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:41,859
If you...

3363
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:44,090
had a good time on a date, I was happy for you.

3364
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:47,259
Did you ever feel jealous?

3365
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:48,859
- I was jealous. - Were you?

3366
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:50,670
Of course I was.

3367
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:54,139
I wasn't just jealous. I was...

3368
02:37:59,409 --> 02:38:00,709
Never mind.

3369
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,379
- What? - It sounds like I'm scolding you.

3370
02:38:04,979 --> 02:38:06,319
Just say it.

3371
02:38:07,049 --> 02:38:08,679
We dated for a long time,

3372
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,589
and we loved each other so much.

3373
02:38:10,590 --> 02:38:14,389
I don't want others to get a bad impression on you.

3374
02:38:15,459 --> 02:38:18,958
The way you behaved in the last few days...

3375
02:38:18,959 --> 02:38:21,259
may give people a bad impression.

3376
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:22,659
Like what?

3377
02:38:22,930 --> 02:38:26,128
You got drunk...

3378
02:38:26,129 --> 02:38:29,169
and kept cuddling with Hyun Gyu.

3379
02:38:29,170 --> 02:38:31,738
That didn't look nice.

3380
02:38:31,739 --> 02:38:34,079
So...

3381
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:37,479
I hate seeing that, and I'm worried about you.

3382
02:38:39,049 --> 02:38:42,619
I bet that bugged everyone, but they just didn't say it.

3383
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:44,619
After hearing that from Gyu Min,

3384
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:46,419
it felt like someone hit me with a hammer.

3385
02:38:46,420 --> 02:38:48,689
It was shocking.

3386
02:38:48,690 --> 02:38:50,158
Gyu Min said...

3387
02:38:50,159 --> 02:38:52,458
everyone else would've thought the same.

3388
02:38:52,459 --> 02:38:55,328
That's when I realized it.

3389
02:38:55,329 --> 02:38:58,870
It was regrettable and embarrassing.

3390
02:38:59,229 --> 02:39:02,200
Right. I should've known better.

3391
02:39:03,370 --> 02:39:05,739
I like...

3392
02:39:06,309 --> 02:39:09,579
how you're doing well.

3393
02:39:12,149 --> 02:39:14,148
But don't act like that.

3394
02:39:14,149 --> 02:39:16,149
That'd look bad to anyone.

3395
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:20,790
Yet, you requested the conversation with me.

3396
02:39:21,159 --> 02:39:22,558
That's strange.

3397
02:39:22,559 --> 02:39:26,299
I knew you'd find that ironic.

3398
02:39:26,459 --> 02:39:30,228
It's true I enjoyed the date with Hyun Gyu,

3399
02:39:30,229 --> 02:39:31,898
and I like him.

3400
02:39:31,899 --> 02:39:34,599
But I can't say I like him...

3401
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:37,209
more than you.

3402
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:40,039
I've only seen him for a couple of days.

3403
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:41,639
So it's obvious.

3404
02:39:44,549 --> 02:39:49,318
So I'm confused. I was.

3405
02:39:49,319 --> 02:39:51,249
You mean so much to me.

3406
02:39:51,250 --> 02:39:54,089
If you have feelings for me,

3407
02:39:54,090 --> 02:39:56,059
you shouldn't have acted like that.

3408
02:39:56,219 --> 02:40:00,030
Don't expect me to understand and accept that.

3409
02:40:07,799 --> 02:40:09,600
I'm sorry.

3410
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:13,809
You don't need to apologize to me.

3411
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:18,250
It's not like we're in a relationship.

3412
02:40:18,809 --> 02:40:20,350
We broke up already.

3413
02:40:20,450 --> 02:40:24,850
That only helped me make up my mind.

3414
02:40:25,149 --> 02:40:28,319
I don't...

3415
02:40:28,459 --> 02:40:31,489
hate you or blame you for that.

3416
02:40:31,559 --> 02:40:34,530
When I still have feelings for Gyu Min,

3417
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:39,669
that one action caused all this.

3418
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:41,100
It's upsetting.

3419
02:40:41,370 --> 02:40:44,639
Yet, I still have feelings for Gyu Min.

3420
02:40:45,739 --> 02:40:50,180
I wanted to apologize to him and change his mind.

3421
02:40:50,409 --> 02:40:53,719
For the remaining time,

3422
02:40:54,049 --> 02:40:58,090
I want to change your mind if I can.

3423
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:02,159
I'll think about it.

3424
02:41:04,159 --> 02:41:06,398
Only if I didn't do that yesterday.

3425
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:09,129
I regret it so much.

3426
02:41:09,229 --> 02:41:10,370
I regret it.

3427
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:13,670
You need to think about it.

3428
02:41:14,139 --> 02:41:16,100
You wouldn't be able to trust me.

3429
02:41:16,469 --> 02:41:19,739
You don't need to think about it. Spend some time on it.

3430
02:41:27,180 --> 02:41:28,379
Do you think...

3431
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:31,920
you wouldn't...

3432
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:36,059
change your mind?

3433
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:42,559
At all?

3434
02:41:46,969 --> 02:41:51,209
(Gyu Min doesn't answer.)

3435
02:41:56,409 --> 02:41:59,819
It gave me many emotions.

3436
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:03,450
I felt bad that she still wanted me back.

3437
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:06,250
I was also thankful. Yet, at the same time,

3438
02:42:06,489 --> 02:42:10,129
I was disappointed that she had a fling with Hyun Gyu.

3439
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:35,179
We ended up talking about this again.

3440
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:38,389
Yes, well... I understand...

3441
02:42:39,389 --> 02:42:40,819
how you feel.

3442
02:42:44,959 --> 02:42:48,129
Is there anything else you wanted to say?

3443
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:54,999
I just wanted to spend time with you.

(I just wanted to spend time with you.)

3445
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:01,409
I'll get going.

3446
02:43:03,750 --> 02:43:05,049
I'll see you at home.

3447
02:43:11,889 --> 02:43:13,120
See you later.

(The 1-on-1 conversation ends.)

3449
02:43:33,979 --> 02:43:36,579
I shouldn't have talked to him.

3450
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:39,610
I never expected it to end after that.

3451
02:43:39,879 --> 02:43:41,318
I didn't get to say what I wanted.

3452
02:43:41,319 --> 02:43:42,420
But then...

3453
02:43:42,579 --> 02:43:45,819
we didn't get to spend much time together.

3454
02:43:47,219 --> 02:43:50,360
He could talk about something else.

3455
02:43:52,059 --> 02:43:54,529
But it was sad that it ended after that.

3456
02:43:54,530 --> 02:43:57,369
It seemed he had no will to.

3457
02:43:57,370 --> 02:43:58,969
That broke my heart.

So, how is it coming here?

It was so tough on the first two days.

3463
02:44:47,579 --> 02:44:49,649
I was too nervous to sleep.

3464

I couldn't focus...

on what I was eating.

3466

Right. I was like that too.

You were very impressive on the first day.

02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:58,430
Really?

3469
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:00,729
- The way you talked to Hae Eun. - Oh, right.

3470
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:03,370
- I guess you really like her. - Yes.

3471
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:05,229
She caught my attention.

3472
02:45:06,870 --> 02:45:09,440
Honestly, I didn't know your names.

3473
02:45:09,469 --> 02:45:11,110
I didn't know anyone else's name aside from Hae Eun.

3474
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:12,869
- You mean other people? - Because she caught your attention.

3475
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:16,308
How was it after the first date?

3476
02:45:16,309 --> 02:45:18,909
I like the first date with her and the second date too.

3477
02:45:19,309 --> 02:45:20,879
Really? Was it better?

3478
02:45:21,079 --> 02:45:22,219
It was much better.

I guess you were okay.

3483

You don't seem to be regretting at all.

3484
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:36,870
- Not at all, right? - Yes.

3485
02:45:37,430 --> 02:45:39,000
We had a lot of ups and downs too.

3486

I liked him so much.

3487

I liked him so much.

3489

I did everything I could.

3490
02:45:45,770 --> 02:45:47,509
- Me too. - It's cool...

3491
02:45:47,510 --> 02:45:49,578
that you come clean and say you liked each other.

3492

I liked him more, right?

3493
02:45:51,209 --> 02:45:52,308
That's not true.

3494
02:45:52,309 --> 02:45:54,478
I begged you.

3495
02:45:54,479 --> 02:45:56,379
I was like, "Don't leave me."

3496
02:45:57,690 --> 02:45:58,950
When he was leaving,

3497
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:00,658
I stopped him like this.

3498
02:46:00,659 --> 02:46:01,959
- Hey. - And...

3499
02:46:02,190 --> 02:46:04,458
he was walking away.

3500
02:46:04,459 --> 02:46:05,488
I ran to him and stopped him.

3501
02:46:05,489 --> 02:46:06,529
- When you were breaking up? - Yes.

3502
02:46:06,530 --> 02:46:08,228
We kept breaking up and getting back together.

3503
02:46:08,229 --> 02:46:09,499
He dumped me and said,

3504
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:10,700
"I miss you."

3505
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:15,440
I have nothing to say.

3506
02:46:16,809 --> 02:46:18,468
- I guess you liked him a lot. - So much.

3507
02:46:18,469 --> 02:46:19,568
Are you...

3508
02:46:19,569 --> 02:46:21,578
able to talk about it because you have no feelings for him at all?

3509
02:46:21,579 --> 02:46:22,579
Yes.

3510
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:23,779
I just want her to be happy.

3511
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:25,379
Me too. He feels like a family.

3512
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:28,079
Hi.

3513
02:46:29,450 --> 02:46:31,619
- Where did all the girls go? - I don't know.

3514
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:32,749
Where did Hae Eun go?

3515

- She didn't come home. - I don't know.

Oh, geez.

My goodness.

3521
02:46:41,959 --> 02:46:43,869
She's clumsier in front of Hee Doo.

3522
02:46:43,870 --> 02:46:45,429
- Right. - She gets worse.

3523
02:46:45,430 --> 02:46:48,040
Is she nervous in front of Hee Doo?

3524
02:46:48,139 --> 02:46:49,370
Is that it?

3525
02:46:49,469 --> 02:46:51,139
- Maybe she's still... - Every time.

3526
02:46:51,209 --> 02:46:53,208
Excited and nervous in front of Hee Doo.

3527
02:46:53,209 --> 02:46:54,440
She keeps making mistakes.

I'll do it. Let me do it please.

Hurry up and wipe it before it absorbs it.

Wait.

3535

I'm about to lose my mind.

3536
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:09,860
Why?

3537
02:47:09,861 --> 02:47:11,929
- I just spilled the pickled radish. - What?

3538
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:12,959
The pickled radish.

3539
02:47:13,059 --> 02:47:15,899
I didn't know there was soup in it.

3540

I'm not even angry... I'm not surprised anymore.

3541
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:20,340
I don't understand myself either.

3542

I don't know why I always spill.

3543

It happens.

It happens.

That's what I thought at first.

(From Na Yeon)

3633
02:53:12,950 --> 02:53:16,360
That's how I felt after the conversation.

3634
02:53:16,590 --> 02:53:20,259
In the end, I talked about where we were going alone.

3635
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:23,260
I talked alone in the conversation I requested.

3636
02:53:23,360 --> 02:53:26,429
"Is Hee Doo not sincere about it?"

3637
02:53:26,430 --> 02:53:28,199
"Is he not serious about it? Does he have no intention to?"

3638
02:53:28,200 --> 02:53:29,369
That's what it got me thinking.

3639
02:53:29,370 --> 02:53:32,809
I wanted an answer for that. That's why I wrote that in the text.

(Let's be happy. Thank you. From Ji Yeon)

3643
02:53:45,989 --> 02:53:50,059
It felt nice and uncomfortable at the same time.

3644
02:53:50,159 --> 02:53:54,328
I bet Ji Yeon wasn't exactly happy...

3645
02:53:54,329 --> 02:53:57,270
after the 1-on-1 conversation that day.

3646
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:01,170
I felt bad for her when I got her text.

(Na Yeon)

(Don't forget about what you said today. From Hee Doo)

3649
02:54:10,139 --> 02:54:12,449
I can never read Hee Doo's heart.

3650
02:54:12,450 --> 02:54:15,679
Even when we have a fight, he always texts me.

3651
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:18,218
No matter how he disappoints me,

3652
02:54:18,219 --> 02:54:20,590
in the end, everything he does is for me.

3653
02:54:20,690 --> 02:54:23,359
I contemplated a lot that day.

3654
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:26,058
I know I'm selfish, but I like Ji Yeon,

3655
02:54:26,059 --> 02:54:28,700
and I still have feelings left for Na Yeon.

3656
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:33,700
I wasn't sure about Ji Yeon,

3657
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,200
so I couldn't text her.

3658
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:39,068
But it wasn't like I was sure about Na Yeon.

3659
02:54:39,069 --> 02:54:42,209
My text to Na Yeon wasn't sincere.

(Your ex chose you.)

3661
02:54:49,450 --> 02:54:52,989
That broke my heart again.

3662
02:54:53,149 --> 02:54:56,119
I'm not asking him...

3663
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:57,860
to like me more than Na Yeon.

3664
02:54:58,129 --> 02:55:01,260
I texted him to root for his choice.

3665
02:55:01,430 --> 02:55:04,170
But he didn't even do that much for me.

3666
02:55:04,270 --> 02:55:06,829
So, I can't help but give a meaning to it.

I should get ready for it.

3670

I should let her go now.

I can't stay in the past forever.

Yet, he did. That was unexpected.

After the date with Gyu Min,

I realized...

that he has no feelings for me at all.

I can never change his mind.
