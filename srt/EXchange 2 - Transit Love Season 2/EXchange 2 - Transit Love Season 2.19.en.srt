1
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:15,041
(EXchange 2)

2
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,352
See you later.

3
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:21,382
(Everyone goes back to their rooms.)

4
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:22,411
Yes?

5
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,451
Come in.

6
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:26,951
Hae Eun. About tomorrow...

7
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:29,192
Why are you crying?

8
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:30,422
- I'm not crying. - Is that so?

9
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,892
Get ready to leave here by 12:30pm.

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:34,031
We'll leave at 12:30pm.

11
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,432
Sorry. But I already knew that.

12
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:38,161
Why...

13
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,031
- Why are you mean to me? - What do you mean?

14
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,671
I was just joking.

15
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,432
- Really? Okay. - Yes.

16
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:49,442
(Not long after, Gyu Min comes back.)

17
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:51,112
Do you want to talk for a second?

18
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:53,381
Where?

19
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,881
Over there in the back.

20
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,551
Well,

21
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,722
why are you so mean?

22
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:01,951
What?

23
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:04,421
You told me that you wanted me...

24
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,721
to be nicer to you.

25
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,831
So I tried to be nicer to you.

26
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:13,361
- Okay. - Whenever I tried to be nice...

27
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:16,031
or talked to you first, you ignored me...

28
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:18,602
or sounded as if you were annoyed at me.

29
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,201
Why are you acting like that?

30
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:22,111
(Goodnight.)

31
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,811
Can I have some too?

32
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:26,242
- You shouldn't eat it. - I had some of it.

33
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,912
- What's wrong with you? - Do you want some?

34
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:29,882
I thought you had fun today.

35
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:31,122
You were bragging about it.

36
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,182
I didn't get to look at it.

37
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,831
- Why are you crying? - I'm not crying because of you.

38
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,292
Okay.

39
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:46,001
Well, about that...

40
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:48,072
I don't think I was so mean to the point...

41
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,802
that you should be upset.

42
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,572
I didn't mean it.

43
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,572
I was just goofing around.

44
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,641
Then why would you goof around like that?

45
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:00,081
I approached you first, so we could have a good time here.

46
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:04,522
But you kept treating me coldly whenever I tried to be nice to you.

47
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,652
So I don't know what to do.

48
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,552
And I was really upset earlier.

49
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:12,022
Because we used to date,

50
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:13,732
I kept goofing around with you.

51
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,892
I just thought you would get it.

52
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,302
I thought you would understand it because we used to date.

53
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,402
I thought we were close.

54
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,902
- Everyone knew we were exes. - Okay.

55
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,541
I must have felt as if we were still dating.

56
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,811
If you really felt that I was genuinely mean to you,

57
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,841
then that was probably because I was heartbroken.

58
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:34,911
You knew that I would get jealous...

59
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:38,422
but you kept goofing around with Na Yeon in front of me,

60
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:42,321
so I resented you. That's why I behaved that way too.

61
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:47,761
If you were upset that I was just talking to Na Yeon,

62
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:51,362
then why did you do that?

63
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,772
Other than the time I was drunk,

64
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,302
I didn't behave like that. Did I?

65
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,471
Yes, earlier.

66
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,071
I didn't act intimate with him.

67
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,971
- Then did I see it... - Other than the time I was drunk,

68
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,311
I didn't act intimate with him in front of you.

69
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,911
Okay. Then I must have seen it wrong.

70
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:11,022
After what happened yesterday, I'm really tired...

71
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:12,781
of you.

72
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,622
Why... Other than that night,

73
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:20,291
I didn't act intimate with other guys...

74
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,561
in front of you...

75
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,001
because I hadn't made up my decision yet.

76
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,501
But you clearly knew...

77
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,372
that I would get jealous and it would hurt me,

78
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:32,242
you kept goofing around with Na Yeon.

79
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:35,112
You talked to her in private and asked her out on a date.

80
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:37,381
You were a lot more intimate with her than I was with anyone.

81
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,381
That's because...

82
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:44,652
trying not to hurt you couldn't have been the only thing I considered.

83
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:47,251
You said you didn't have a choice. But in the end, that's what you did.

84
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:49,422
You kept hurting me.

85
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:51,392
But I would like you to also know...

86
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:54,462
that you didn't have the right to tell me how to behave...

87
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,862
around Hyun Gyu given your own behavior.

88
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:59,761
But after Hyun Gyu joined us, you seemed...

89
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,702
Did I seem like I was having fun?

90
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:03,471
Yes. I thought you were doing well.

91
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:06,541
I thought you would be doing well even if it was tough.

92
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:07,811
Even though this thing with Hyun Gyu...

93
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:10,142
is new, and he makes me happy,

94
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,041
you're such a big part of my life.

95
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,881
Why do you think...

96
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:17,521
I cried for two weeks when we were in Pyeongchang-dong?

97
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,492
When I see you with other men, of course,

98
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,151
I want you to be happy with them.

99
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:26,162
I truly want you to be happy.

100
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,061
But I still get jealous.

101
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,532
I get these feelings too.

102
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,532
But the thing is, you and I...

103
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,932
are in two different places regarding our relationship.

104
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,872
I can't be sweet to you like when we were dating.

105
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,912
If I behave that way, I think...

106
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,542
it will hurt you more in the end.

107
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:49,511
But you treated me as if I were a stranger to you...

108
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:51,352
when we were in Pyeongchang-dong.

109
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:54,352
You made sure you didn't mislead me at all.

110
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:56,391
I thought I had to do that,

111
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,862
- so you would get hurt less. - But you knew...

112
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:01,592
But you knew that I wanted to get back together with you.

113
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,391
If I were nice to you,

114
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:06,732
I thought you would get hurt more.

115
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:09,302
Because you were never going to come back to me?

116
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,201
Because you were never going to date me again?

117
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,811
Isn't that why?

118
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,381
Anyway, I started to get interested in someone else.

119
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:21,211
So you were never going to like me back?

120
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,651
I joined you in Pyeongchang-dong.

121
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:25,782
And you could have liked me back.

122
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,122
But I already started to get interested in her before you came.

123
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,492
- So you didn't like me more? - You know me.

124
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,061
So you didn't like me more?

125
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,232
- Are you talking about Na Yeon? - Yes.

126
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:36,732
You know me.

127
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,362
I thought I could win you back...

128
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:40,532
because I knew you.

129
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,432
It was me.

130
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:45,542
I clearly realized it...

131
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,211
after talking to you now.

132
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:50,612
I can tell from your eyes...

133
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:52,881
and the way you talk.

134
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:55,581
I deserve to be loved too.

135
00:05:56,751 --> 00:06:00,052
And clinging onto you like this makes me sad and feel pathetic.

136
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,151
Had I known that you were never going to come back to me,

137
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:05,792
I wouldn't have been this sad.

138
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,561
But you knew it from the start.

139
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:10,901
I thought I would be able to win you back when I tried.

140
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,701
Go.

141
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,032
I'll go to sleep here.

142
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,631
Go. Just leave me like you did.

143
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:18,571
Leave me here alone like the heartless guy you are.

144
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,612
Just go.

145
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,612
I'm getting dizzy because of you.

146
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,641
What can I do to stop that?

147
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,112
You make me feel dizzy.

148
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,951
You should choose me on the last day.

149
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,992
Right. I want you to be happy.

150
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,662
It's great to see you smile like that.

151
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:40,261
- It's fun. - I've always been a happy person.

152
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:41,492
I knew you would get it.

153
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,232
So I was joking around you.

154
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,662
You weren't always a happy person.

155
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:46,232
You looked like this in Pyeongchang-dong.

156
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,071
"Give me a towel."

157
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:49,631
- You kept doing that. - I didn't do that.

158
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,941
When I talked to you...

159
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,412
Because in Pyeongchang-dong...

160
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,922
You startled me!

161
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:11,622
I was always heartbroken because of you in Pyeongchang-dong.

162
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,122
It would've been great...

163
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,492
if it weren't like that here, right?

164
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:18,032
- We didn't have time. - Okay.

165
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:21,102
After talking to Hae Eun late at night,

166
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,042
we were able to put our disappointments...

167
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:26,571
and hurt feelings behind us.

168
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,672
Spending a fun day together...

169
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,511
and ending the day on a good note...

170
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,682
would bring back a lot of old memories.

171
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:35,811
Because of the feelings I had been suppressing...

172
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,282
and jealousy, I thought I might...

173
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,052
miss her even more.

174
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,722
It really might change my mind.

175
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:46,521
Why are you always drinking Coke Zero?

176
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,032
It's not good for your health.

177
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:50,761
Do you know why?

178
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,401
This was the only way to relieve stress.

179
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:55,232
I kept seeing you act intimate with other girls.

180
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,401
The only thing I could do was drink Coke.

181
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,201
I wouldn't have lasted here without Coke.

182
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,641
Okay.

183
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,141
So I was drunk today.

184
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:09,511
But did I act intimate with Hyun Gyu today? I didn't.

185
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:13,651
It was freezing in here. My hands were cold. That was it.

186
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:14,751
Okay.

187
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,352
His hands are much warmer than yours.

188
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,961
Fine.

189
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,862
I can communicate with Na Yeon a lot better too.

190
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,432
Okay. What is it?

191
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:29,932
Okay. I was just joking.

192
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:33,472
- Anyway, you are too short... - Yes.

193
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,511
to be my boyfriend.

194
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:36,972
Okay.

195
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,151
- She was brutally honest. - He said, "Okay."

196
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,452
- That was random. - He said, "Okay."

197
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:44,751
They are funny.

198
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:47,222
He said, "Okay."

199
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:50,452
We're finally seeing the chemistry of a couple who dated for six years.

200
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:51,562
He said, "Okay."

201
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:53,362
(Hae Eun, Na Yeon, and Na Eon's room)

202
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:55,962
I talked to Gyu Min. We ended up fighting.

203
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:57,092
- We just... - You didn't make up?

204
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,462
We just teased each other as we were leaving.

205
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,102
But I understand him now.

206
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:03,271
I realized that I didn't have to...

207
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,501
- keep clinging on to him. - That's great.

208
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,501
That's what I realized.

209
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:10,541
I don't think tomorrow's date will affect me much.

210
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:15,881
Seriously. When we were talking, I was so annoyed by him.

211
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,051
He's so annoying.

212
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,322
But when we were teasing each other,

213
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,151
- why was it so fun? - Was it fun?

214
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:24,092
I knew it. Why was it fun?

215
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:26,791
- Hey, Ji Yeon. - You told me to lie down.

216
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,962
- What? - Lie down there. That's so cute.

217
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,431
- Just cut it and put it on. - It's hot.

218
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,602
- I didn't do it like that. - Then what?

219
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,702
I'll just do it my way.

220
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:37,501
Hey, remember this.

221
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,342
Hey, I'll turn it to my side.

222
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,842
No. I need the mirror too.

223
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,781
Wait. I need to use it first. I need it more.

224
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,281
Yes, I can see that.

225
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,281
(He definitely needs the mirror first.)

226
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:50,881
Gosh. This is an important moment.

227
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:54,592
Na Eon, help me. I think this got ripped.

228
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,992
- Okay. Hold on. - Okay.

229
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:00,661
- Can you salvage this? - Okay. Water.

230
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,462
Suction.

231
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:03,732
(Getting into the role)

232
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:05,761
Scissors.

233
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:07,901
- Where's the scalpel? - Hee Doo.

234
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,501
- Hee Doo, scalpel. - Where is it?

235
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,732
Doing a face pack together is fun.

236
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:14,411
What is Hae Eun doing?

237
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,812
- She's talking to Gyu Min. - Really?

238
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,281
Do you like Hae Eun?

239
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,982
I do. But I feel awful for her.

240
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:23,612
It breaks my heart too.

241
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:26,181
Gyu Min is too cruel.

242
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,791
But he's doing the right thing...

243
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,952
- if he doesn't want her anymore. - Right. That's true.

244
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:33,021
Hey, I blocked you completely. Wasn't that the right thing to do?

245
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:34,962
That's why we can be friends now. Right?

246
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:38,001
If I kept misleading you, would we have been able to do this?

247
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,372
But still. I don't want my ex-girlfriend...

248
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:42,872
to get hurt like that.

249
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:45,702
I agree. But I don't think I could do what Gyu Min did.

250
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:49,312
Right. Gosh. They had been together for seven years.

251
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,812
- They're family. - It's more than a challenge.

252
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,781
- They're family. - Right.

253
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:55,452
That's why I'm going to try my best to the end.

254
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:58,151
I'll be fine wherever I end up.

255
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:01,222
But it's not easy to get through the seven years she spent...

256
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,692
with him.

257
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:07,462
But do you want to pursue her despite her history?

258
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,291
You know that I don't care about that.

259
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:14,001
Is it because we know that it's Hae Eun, not just anyone?

260
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,872
So they dated for seven years.

261
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:17,972
And you dated for four years. It's not about the number.

262
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:19,501
- Right. - It's different with people.

263
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,742
That's right. That's what I focus on.

264
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:24,342
I can pursue her, but her mindset will be important for me.

265
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,712
I want to ask Hae Eun...

266
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,011
what she wants to do if she were to date him again.

267
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:32,781
Even Gyu Min can't understand Hae Eun well.

268
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:36,452
You know what's really funny? After living together here,

269
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:39,161
we can all understand other people in the house.

270
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,521
But we can't understand our own exes.

271
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:42,962
That's so ironic.

272
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,102
In that sense, I thought it would be nice for Hae Eun...

273
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,232
to date Hyun Gyu.

274
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:50,332
Hyun Gyu can just accept Hae Eun for who she is.

275
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:53,401
He can trust her and just let her be.

276
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,742
That's why I want her to date him.

277
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:58,281
When he and I were together,

278
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:02,352
if I were a bit more generous and understanding,

279
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:03,482
we wouldn't have fought a lot.

280
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,982
You can just be yourself.

281
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,891
- I'm good at relationships now. - Okay.

282
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:12,161
I'm really grateful to you, and I'm sorry too.

283
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,161
But I don't regret anything.

284
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:16,531
- Why not? - In a way, I sound so shameless.

285
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:20,031
But I am who I am now because of my past mistakes.

286
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:21,702
Right.

287
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:23,531
So I'm grateful to you.

288
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:26,842
- So let's have fun tomorrow. - Okay.

289
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,942
By the way, Hee Doo.

290
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,911
Do you want to get back with your ex? I can tell that you do.

291
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:34,712
- Hee Doo... - You think so?

292
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,712
Yes.

293
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:36,781
I'm curious about Hee Doo's feelings.

294
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:38,551
It's not that. It's more than that.

295
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,092
- Is it because he's warmhearted? - I just get that feeling.

296
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,452
I can't date her again because I can't stay objective.

297
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,192
It looks like both of you want that, but I might be wrong.

298
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,161
- You think so? - Yes.

299
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:49,992
There's more to it than meets the eye.

300
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:54,232
- I thought Ji Yeon... Nothing. - What?

301
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,171
Come on. Just tell me.

302
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,702
Tell me your honest feeling.

303
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:03,411
Ji Yeon wasn't truthful to her feelings.

304
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:04,781
That's how I felt.

305
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,452
Did it get better?

306
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:11,482
- You look much better. - It's so smooth. My goodness.

307
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:13,482
- Great. - This is nice!

308
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,291
- This is crazy. Seriously. - This is great.

309
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,092
- This is amazing. This is crazy. - Hee Doo.

310
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,921
- You have the best skin now. - Yes.

311
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:22,332
I'm glad that you all enjoyed the face packs.

312
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,171
- What? - I knew it.

313
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,472
I knew everyone was here.

314
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:31,001
Hae Eun, are you all right?

315
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,202
Did you have a nice talk?

316
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:36,771
I finally realized his true feelings.

317
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,381
You'll come back with a puffy face tomorrow.

318
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,911
No, I won't.

319
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:46,921
After talking to him, I made up my mind.

320
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:48,622
- Were you able to move on? - Gosh, you can't do that in a day.

321
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,092
No. I realized how he felt.

322
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,962
I think I was just making a fool of myself.

323
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:56,092
I thought I would be able to change his mind.

324
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,832
- Did you want to get him back? - Yes.

325
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,872
- That's why I didn't give up. - Really?

326
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,541
- I want you to be happy. - I agree.

327
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,872
- I'm happy. - Don't cry.

328
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:09,612
Do you want to do a face pack?

329
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:12,712
I'll put it on you.

Do you want to do it?

331

It will take long.

332
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,852
I bet you were thinking you would never do it after you saw me do it.

333
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:23,852
I won't do it.

334
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,722
- Let's go. - Let's go and sleep.

335
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,192
Thanks for the face pack.

336

He's crazy.

No. It's not hot.

I thought it would be cold today. But the weather is amazing.

What a surprise. The weather is great for our date.

406
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,532
- The weather is indeed great. - Yes.

But I don't think they'll have a big fight.

- They'll just argue a bit. - Right. It would be just that.

I really hope they don't fight today.

I just wanted to have fun with him.

I wanted to enjoy the date...

414
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:15,022
as if we were a couple who came on a trip together.

415
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:19,022
And I wanted him...

416
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:22,231
to show me that he had changed.

417
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,592
I thought about that too.

418
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:27,431
I really wanted him to show me a clear reason for us...

419
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,671
to get back together.

420

Whatever he was feeling, if he showed me that he changed,

421
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:34,241
I knew for sure that I would pick him.

422
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:39,941
I was really happy to spend time with Na Yeon...

423
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,951
because we didn't go on a proper date here.

00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:45,082
(They bought drinks at a cafe before starting their date.)

425
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:46,752
You'll spill some for sure, right?

426
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,221
Yes. Probably.

427
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,852
- What? - Probably.

428
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,362
Try it. It's so good.

429
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,661
So you just assume you'll spill it.

430
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,062
They told me that we acted as if we were still a couple.

431
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:02,372
- Us? - Yes.

432
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,441
Maybe, I expressed my feelings too openly.

433
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,342
In their eyes?

434
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:11,411
To be honest, I just didn't want to look indecisive.

435
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:13,681
Did you make up your mind?

436
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:15,612
But I'm not sure.

437
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,082
Aren't you happy that you're going on a date with me?

438
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,191
Yes.

439
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,391
- We haven't been here together. - Right.

440
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,191
- When you first moved in, - Yes.

441
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:29,262
did you still have feelings for me?

442
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:30,891
- Did I have feelings for you? - Yes.

443
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,231
When I talked to Ji Soo and Ji Yeon,

444
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,901
you told them that you still had feelings for me.

445
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,102
So this is what I said.

446
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:43,211
They asked me if I still had feelings for you,

447
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,012
so I said I did, but I didn't want to get back together.

448
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,211
That's what I told them in the Talking Room.

449
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:50,481
- Really? - Yes. But they now know...

450
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,451
that I still have feelings for you...

451
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,082
because we often talk about our feelings.

452
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,451
They talked about their feelings too.

453
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:57,122
I bet they said they had moved on.

454
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,062
Ji Yeon told me.

455
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:00,661
Right. She probably said she moved on.

456
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:01,691
No, that she still had feelings.

457
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:03,461
She still had feelings for her ex?

458
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,062
- Ji Yeon? - I doubt she said that.

459
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,262
No.

460
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,401
Really?

461
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:14,201
Did you think she didn't have feelings for her ex?

462
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,772
- What? - Did you think she moved on?

463
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,981
Did she say she wanted to get back together with him?

464
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:21,282
Well, I'm not sure.

465
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:24,252
If that's what she told you, then she lied to me.

466
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:27,322
- Is that what she said? - No.

467
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,022
Besides, I can't share what she said to me with you.

468
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:36,191
I'm ready to change.

469
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,862
- You are? - Yes.

470
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:40,762
I'm ready to make changes.

471
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:42,901
And I can understand you.

472
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:45,671
But I don't think you can do that.

473
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,241
I think you still believe our relationship can work out...

474
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:49,512
if I change.

475
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,512
Then what are some changes I should make?

476
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,951
- Should I tell you what I think? - Okay.

477
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:01,022
In the end, I have to let go.

478
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:02,391
No.

479
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,622

I didn't agree with that.

But you know you did, right?

484
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,832
- I know. I said countless times. - Here...

485
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,431
- No. - I said that during my interview.

486

You know that you said the same thing here, right?

"Some people like me for who I am."

You know that you always say that, right?

489
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:29,282
You always spit out your feelings and the thoughts...

Sort of.

494
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:42,491
Exactly.

495
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:45,231
This is about your pride again.

496

It doesn't matter...

497
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:50,901
how much I change. I'm always the same in your eyes.

Do you think we're fighting now?

499

- No. We're not fighting. - Right?

- I'm trying to talk to you. - We're having a conversation.

501

- To be honest... - When we start talking, you...

502
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:03,211
It's frustrating.

503
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:05,252
I'm not sure what it is. It might be frustration.

504
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:07,181
No. It's just sad.

505

- You... - So let me ask you this.

506
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:10,721
You should answer my question.

What are some changes do you think I should make?

508
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:15,032
Let me think about it more before I share them.

509
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,032
How...

510
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:19,602
You can just tell me what comes to your mind.

511
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:22,072
Even if you don't make sense, I can understand you.

512
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,572
I want you to be nicer to me.

513
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:27,171
You can lecture me. But be nice to me when you do.

514
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:29,112
I don't want you to think...

515
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:32,782
that I'm stupid as a basis when you talk to me.

516
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,342
I don't think you're stupid.

517
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:36,282
- You do. - I always say this.

518
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:38,381
"You're smart. But why do you act like that?"

519
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,522
And to be honest, I'm asking you to give up on me.

520
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,292
But you can't try to change everything...

521
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:44,991
- I don't try to change everything. - You...

522
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,661
You try to help me or fix me all the time.

523
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,731
I want you to stop focusing on helping or fixing me.

524
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,862
You don't have to do that.

525
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,201
- Right. - Right.

526
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,731
Was I like this when we first started dating?

527
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,272
When we first started dating, I smiled.

528
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:01,201
- I know. - Yes.

529
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,971
But that's not important.

530
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,082
- It's important. - So you did that at first.

531
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,582
But you don't smile anymore because four years have passed.

532
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:08,252
So are you saying you'll continue to do the same?

533
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:10,951
Oh, my gosh.

534
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:14,421
I don't understand the way you communicate either.

535
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:16,092
When I told you what I didn't like,

536
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:18,792
you could have just said "Okay."

537
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,221
"I see. You didn't like that."

538
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:22,991
When it comes to that, you...

539
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:24,332
- I was talking. - Okay.

540
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,901
- You're not ready to change. - I...

541
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:27,961
So I'm not ready?

542

- So I'm not ready? - Right.

543
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:32,141
So everything would be okay as long as I change.

544
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,171
Right.

545

And I know why you're like that.

But what makes me angry now...

547
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:38,612
Why are you angry now?

548

I'm getting angry now.

549

You're still stuck in the past.

No, I'm not.

551
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:45,622
I agree that I spill things often.

552
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:48,691
- But was that such a big mistake? - That's fine.

553
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:50,022
I don't care if you spill things.

554
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:52,562
- Did I act that immature here? - I...

555

You're not listening to me.

556
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,262
I'm asking because I'm curious.

557
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:58,862
- I really realized a lot here. - I don't care if you spill things.

558
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:02,102
I really hated it when you said, "That's so typical of me."

559
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:03,901
You didn't say, "I should be careful."

560

"That's so typical of me."

561
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:09,941
It's such a minor thing, but I don't like that about you.

562
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,211
Even if you thought it was typical of you.

563
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,782
you shouldn't have said it out loud. Did you have to say that?

564
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:18,721
I won't say it out loud then.

565
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,252
But you misunderstood what I meant.

566

"That's so typical of me. I'm such a clumsy girl."

- Right. You... - I didn't mean it like that.

Words have power.

You didn't have to say things like that.

570
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,901
Anyway, I get your point. But that's not what I meant.

571
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:35,171
"Gosh. I did that again. I shouldn't do that next time."

572
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:36,772
I always think like that.

573
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:38,542
Anyway, I shouldn't have said that out loud.

574

There's no right or wrong. But I won't say that from now on...

I wanted them to get out of the car.

We were pretty high up.

I thought it was just a hill. I ended up on a mountain.

No, I can't.

I can't see it because I'm too short.

I have more positive feelings about Hyun Gyu.

did Hyun Gyu say something?

I'll be objective.

After you went on a date with him yesterday,

you basically told everyone you still wanted Gyu Min.

Right. I felt really bad about that.

Hyun Gyu kept checking if I was crying or not.

if you want things to work out with Hyun Gyu,

you should clear that up with him.

Let's go back late.

796
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:19,352
Okay. Will they drink again today?

797
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,882
- Don't you think they will? - Is that so?

798
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:24,522
Why do you drink so much here?

799
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,761
Because that'd make me feel better.

800
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:29,091
I drank a lot too for the same reason.

801
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:30,692
Why wouldn't you be in a good mood?

802
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:33,502
Of course I wasn't. It was hard for me too.

803
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:38,102
It'll be more comfortable for you to have a relaxing date...

804
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,372
than to hear me say things...

805
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:41,301
like how much I had missed you and stuff?

806
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:44,772
Of course it'd be better for me to have a fun date with you.

807
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:47,582
Are you looking forward to riding the zipline?

808
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,611
No, I'm not.

809
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,812
Why not? Doesn't it sound like fun?

810
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:53,451
No, zipline is just...

811
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:58,122
It's not about the activity we're going to do together.

812
00:34:58,122 --> 00:35:01,022
I just like being with you.

813
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:05,602
I just hope we have a lot of time to talk to each other.

814
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:09,372
We're here.

815
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:13,372
Why are we here already? I wish time could stop for today.

816
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,812
(Jeju LAF)

817
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:22,911
I've ridden a zipline with Gyu Min before.

818
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:26,051
We went to Laos for a trip when we were 24.

819
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,122
I was reminded of our Laos trip...

820
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:30,022
the moment he said we'd go ride a zipline.

821
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:31,891
It was really nice,

822
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:34,761
and I was just happy the entire time I was on the trip.

823
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:40,602
We were on a really good term.

824
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:42,971
We were just happy to be in each other's company.

825
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:45,641
We were just happy to be together...

826
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:47,841
no matter what we did.

827
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:23,111
It reminded me of the good memories we had.

828
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:25,511
I really had this thought...

829
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,781
of going back to those days...

830
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:31,611
and having fun together again.

831
00:36:32,082 --> 00:36:34,422
"It was really fun then." I have this thought a lot.

832
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:45,591
I really liked her a lot.

833
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:50,272
Hae Eun liked me a lot too, but I really liked her.

834
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,442
Gyu Min must've been a really nice boyfriend.

835
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:58,812
That's why Hae Eun has a hard time forgetting him.

836
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:00,812
- That's right. - The scariest thought...

837
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:03,181
you can have after a breakup...

838
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:04,712
- is "No one is better than him." - It's really scary.

839
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:05,752
So being nice to your partner...

840
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,252
- is the best thing you can do. - That's true.

841
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,352
How can you forget all those memories?

842
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,991
I can't believe Gyu Min did something like this.

843
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:13,292
- You can't forget those. - I mean...

844
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:15,161
- You can't. - Why was it kept hidden?

845
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:17,132
Gyu Min did this in the video.

846
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:20,161
He felt like a completely different person.

847
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:22,872
What's even more shocking is this move that Hae Eun did.

848
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,002
This one. It's what Jang Hyuk does.

849
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:32,141
- That's how well they get along. - That's true.

850
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:33,741
- They get along so well. - They get along.

851
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:35,341
But isn't this a bit scary?

852
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:36,882
- I know. - It's scary?

853
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:37,982
I'm afraid it might come out in my dream.

854
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:40,582
That's how great their chemistry was.

855
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,281
She must've wanted to tease him...

856
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:43,491
because they used to play around like that.

857
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:45,152
That's right. Hae Eun even said...

858
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:47,591
that bickering with him was fun.

859
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:48,922
- She said that was fun. - I know.

860
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:50,931
Even that short moment was fun for her.

861
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:53,132
We might see a big twist at the end.

862
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,201
I know.

863
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:58,672
- Look at the sky. It's so blue. - It really is.

864
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:02,341
It does feel like that time we went to Laos.

865
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,812
- You're right. - Right?

866
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,241
Yes.

867
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,681
But that one is taller than the one we did in Laos.

868
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:11,181
- Isn't it? - No, the one in Laos...

869
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,582
was much taller.

870
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:15,221
Let me give you brief instructions before we start.

871
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:17,622
- You go first. - You can go first.

872
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:18,692
- You want me to go first? - Yes.

873
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:20,292
Let me check the gear.

874
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:23,091
Hold on. It's a little scary. Hold on.

875
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,591
No! Wait!

876
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:44,681
Why is it so fast? That surprised me.

877
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:47,451
Gosh, it's scary.

878
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:14,341
- It's so fun. - How come it's so fast?

879
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:15,582
The one we rode in Laos...

880
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:16,681
- wasn't that scary at all. - I know.

881
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:18,011
This is so fun.

882
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:20,652
- Bye. - Here we go.

883
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:41,502
My gosh.

884
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:54,852
Be careful!

885
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:58,192
- Be careful. - Okay.

886
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:00,761
- How was it? - It was fun.

887
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,491
Let's move to our next spot.

888
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,391
- Let's go. - Let's go.

889
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:07,861
It was really fun.

890
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:10,772
After riding the zipline together, we came down and talked some more.

891
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:13,102
It felt great.

892
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:15,042
Being with her was fun.

893
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:17,312
We took photos of each other,

894
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:19,111
saying it reminded us of our old days.

895
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:33,462
Gyu Min took a lot of photos for me back then too.

896
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:45,632
During our Laos trip, Gyu Min followed me around...

897
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:47,971
and took photos and videos of me.

898
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,172
I missed those days so much,

899
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,411
but I'm not sure if he felt the same way too.

900
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:58,482
- Go straight in. - We need towels.

901
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:02,352
(They came to get a foot bath.)

902
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:06,692
We've never done this.

903
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:08,792
A foot bath? Yes, we have.

904
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,761
- It was a massage. - Was it?

905
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:12,192
You can control the water.

906
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,132
- Is it warm? - Yes.

907
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:23,812
- I brought foot cream. - Look at this.

908
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:26,312
I got hurt while ice skating.

909
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:28,042
It's almost healed.

910
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:29,511
Yes, it is, but this part...

911
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:31,082
This part is still very swollen.

912
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:33,652
- I have so many scars on my body. - I know.

913
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:34,951
It was painful. I shouldn't have held it in.

914
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,522
You shouldn't have. Why would you hold it in when it hurt?

915
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,622
You were always foolishly patient.

916
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,161
I got my finger burned too.

917
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,091
I got burned here and here.

918
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:45,462
I got burned here too.

919
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,531
Doing what? Using your curling iron?

920
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:50,832
- They're actually burn scars. - How is that possible?

921
00:41:51,772 --> 00:41:53,872
Do you want to have a water fight with our feet?

922
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:56,841
- There. - Hey.

923
00:41:57,872 --> 00:42:00,911
What? You even loved this part of me.

924
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:02,482
Is that not the case now?

925
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:06,451
Which date was the most fun?

926
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:08,622
Again?

927
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:10,991
You were asked that too?

928
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:12,692
(Truth or Dare from last night)

929
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:14,221
- Is it my turn? - Yes.

930
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:15,562
Then I will ask...

931
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,732
Gyu Min a question.

932
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:18,792
(Won Bin asked a question to Gyu Min.)

933
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,632
The same question that you asked Ji Soo.

934
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:23,232
The happiest moment during my time here?

935
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:28,571
My first date happened to be with Na Yeon.

936
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:31,312
And I had so much fun with Na Yeon on the date,

937
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:34,781
so I think that was the most fun moment.

938
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:42,792
You had to go to the place where you first met me.

939
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,152
- Right. - I hear that place...

940
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:45,321
is still doing well.

941
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:47,361
As soon as I saw the entrance,

942
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:50,962
I was reminded of our time there when we were 21.

943
00:42:50,962 --> 00:42:51,991
Do you remember that time?

944
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:54,902
The day we had a blind date when we were 21?

945
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:55,962
Of course.

946
00:42:56,232 --> 00:42:58,301
I even remember the room we met in.

947
00:42:58,332 --> 00:43:00,442
Me too. I even remember the seating arrangement of that day.

948
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:01,502
- Really? - Yes.

949
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,872
I really wanted to go back there with you again.

950
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:07,812
How was being there with Na Yeon?

951
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:11,152
It was really new because we're both...

952
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:13,951
in our late 20s.

953

That actually means Hee Doo wasn't willing to change for me.

1111
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:09,991
If Hee Doo had the will...

1112
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:11,761
to date me again,

1113
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:13,332
he wouldn't have acted that way.

1114
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:17,232
That's when my chance of choosing him dropped to one.

1115
00:51:17,832 --> 00:51:19,232
That's why I couldn't help but cry.

1116
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:22,372
(At the cafe)

1117
00:51:25,312 --> 00:51:27,641
They're at it again. They fight every time they're at a new spot.

1118
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:29,511
It's not even something he should get mad about.

1119
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:31,752
He didn't have to put it that way. It's a disappointment.

1120
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:34,652
- He doesn't treat others like that. - I know.

1121
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:36,652
- Right. - He does it to his girlfriend only.

1122
00:51:36,652 --> 00:51:38,352
Why does he act like that to Na Yeon only?

1123
00:51:38,522 --> 00:51:40,591
If Hee Doo was a little gentler,

1124
00:51:40,591 --> 00:51:42,422
Na Yeon would've loved it.

1125
00:51:42,422 --> 00:51:45,361
I know. He could be a little sweeter.

1126
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:46,761
- That's it. - That's all he needs to do.

1127
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:48,161
It's not difficult at all.

1128
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:50,102
It's just the way he talks. That's it.

1129
00:51:50,102 --> 00:51:51,971
He could've said, "That's not for us."

1130
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:53,701
- Exactly. - He could've just said that.

1131
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:56,102
I get that he could be frustrated with other things,

1132
00:51:56,102 --> 00:51:57,641
but the pizza incident...

1133
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,341
- I know. That incident... - I can't understand...

1134
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:02,141
why he felt frustrated with that.

1135
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:05,252
But it's not like Hee Doo doesn't like Na Yeon.

1136
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:06,951
That's why he should change himself.

1137
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:08,852
Actually, Hee Doo is the one who should change himself.

1138
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:13,891
Why are you so upset?

1139
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:18,632
You might not find it upsetting if you give it another thought.

1140
00:52:19,332 --> 00:52:20,732
It's because I have pent-up anger.

1141
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:24,632
This place is nice.

1142
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:26,872
That's the ocean.

1143
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:28,102
I know that.

- No? - Won't you be cold?

1149
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:41,382
- I think you'll be cold. - Yes, I'm cold.

How are things for you?

1158

I mean, generally. Our time here is nearing the end.

1159

- It's a bit sad. - Sad?

Me too. I wish it could be a little longer.

1161
00:53:15,082 --> 00:53:16,382
But I...

1162
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:19,622
clearly realized this.

1163
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:22,861
I think I'm still upset...

1164
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,531
by your words.

1165
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:26,531
Even if you say the reason we can't get back together is me.

1166
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,801
You know the condescending things you say. "What do you know?"

1167
00:53:31,272 --> 00:53:32,672
I think it's because...

1168
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:34,341
you think of me as someone...

1169
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:37,272
you want to protect and take care of.

1170
00:53:37,872 --> 00:53:39,511
- Of course... - I put that jelly on your bed.

1171
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:40,982
- On my bed? - Yes.

1172
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:41,982
Really?

1173
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:44,312
- It was really you? - Yes.

1175
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:52,692
(Hee Doo put a bag of jellies on Na Yeon's bed.)

1176
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:58,462
So you could cheer up. But I didn't show that it was me at all.

1177
00:53:58,462 --> 00:54:00,301
I know. I even asked you if you got it for me.

1178
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,502
I was like, "What are you saying?"

1179
00:54:01,632 --> 00:54:02,902
I know. It was you?

1180
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:04,832
Who did you think it was from?

1181
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:06,201
- Gyu Min? - Yes.

1182
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:10,372
Because Gyu Min gave me jellies a lot around that time.

1183
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:17,812
How did you feel?

1184
00:54:18,252 --> 00:54:20,011
The moment you cried when you were talking with me...

1185
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:22,382
or when you were in the Ex Room.

1186
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:25,491
Was it because you had feelings for me? Or were you just sad?

1187
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:28,261
I cried because...

1188
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:29,761
I thought I had to move on...

1189
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:32,161
because I still had feelings for you,

1190
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:33,232
and that thought was hard on me.

1191
00:54:36,002 --> 00:54:39,531
Did my confession of feelings got in your way, perhaps?

1192
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:42,301
- I was trying to... - Why would it get in the way?

1193
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:44,571
From what Ji Yeon said last night,

1194
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:47,812
she seemed to be blaming everything on me.

1195
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:50,451
But I've never pushed her.

1196
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:53,352
Rather, I avoided you guys when you were together.

1197
00:54:53,352 --> 00:54:55,752
Should I have held back my feelings more?

1198
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:58,051
I only acted based on how I felt.

1199
00:54:58,551 --> 00:55:00,491
I've met a lot of people since,

1200
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:04,261
but I realized that I wasn't ready to move on.

1201
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:09,161
My feelings for Na Yeon are really big.

1202
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:12,071
I do have feelings for her because she's precious to me.

1203
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:13,741
I want to look after her.

1204
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:15,442
Just because I cherish her,

1205
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:17,471
I can't ask her to start...

1206
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:20,882
dating me again.

1207
00:55:21,312 --> 00:55:24,111
It's obvious that we need a change.

1208
00:55:24,281 --> 00:55:27,482
Na Yeon is expressing her feelings to me.

1209
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:29,152
But I'm not sure...

1210
00:55:29,152 --> 00:55:31,451
if I should accept her feelings...

1211
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:34,622
or push her away.

1212
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:39,891
Are you contemplating about your decision?

1213
00:55:40,602 --> 00:55:42,031
- Why? - The final decision.

1214
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:44,301
Does it make you contemplate?

1215
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,402
- Of course. - Is that so?

1216
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:51,841
I've been expressing my feelings to you the whole time.

1217
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:54,482
But if...

1218
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,352
it's because I'm used to being with you,

1219
00:55:57,752 --> 00:56:01,252
without any changes,

1220
00:56:01,882 --> 00:56:05,752
I don't think it's right for me to get back with you.

1221
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,391
- I just... - Did you think about it afterward?

1222
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:09,462
I did.

1223
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:13,661
That's when you texted me that I needed to change.

1224
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,562
I was glad because I thought we were on the same page.

1225
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:20,132
Actually, that change could mean a breakup for good.

1226
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:21,772
No, that's the result.

1227
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:25,042
I mean, the change...

1228
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:26,812
could make us break up.

1229
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:28,882
But if we can change ourselves,

1230
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:30,781
- Just accepting each other... - we should date each other again.

1231
00:56:30,781 --> 00:56:33,051
the way we are could be our change.

1232
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:36,152
But you don't accept me as who I am.

1233
00:56:37,491 --> 00:56:39,422
I told him that I didn't want to get back together with him...

1234
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:40,661
because I'm used to him.

1235
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:42,761
And that I wanted to get back with him after we change ourselves.

1236
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:44,292
"I thought that was what was going to happen today,"

1237
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:45,832
"and that you'd show your changed self,"

1238
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:48,431
"but today's date was the worst."

1239
00:56:48,602 --> 00:56:50,002
That's what I meant.

1240
00:56:50,902 --> 00:56:52,071
That's how I actually felt.

1241
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,571

00:58:01,372 --> 00:58:02,701
The mugwort rice cake is really good.

1268
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:04,942
Let's eat this up and grow up more.

1269

(Chuckling)

1270
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:15,082
I'm so full now.

1271
00:58:16,152 --> 00:58:17,721
I've given it a lot of thought.

1272
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:19,991
And I was stuck in our past.

1273
00:58:21,192 --> 00:58:24,591
I was too stuck in the past.

1274
00:58:24,732 --> 00:58:26,632
All we talked about...

1275
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:29,062
It was all about our past.

1276
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:32,201
I only talked about our past.

1277
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:34,341
(Sighing)

1278
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:36,372
I guess I was too hung up on you.

1279
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,672
I fooled myself...

1280
00:58:38,672 --> 00:58:40,411
into thinking that I was over you.

1281
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,712
Three years went by like that,

1282
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:46,352
so those feelings were still lingering in my heart.

1283
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:51,422
Would we have continued to date if I didn't go to the military?

1284
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:53,252
You don't think so?

1285
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:57,692
You treated me so nicely and liked me a lot,

1286
00:58:57,792 --> 00:59:00,361
but you and I were each other's first.

1287
00:59:00,361 --> 00:59:01,661
Right.

1288
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:03,801
It wasn't that healthy.

1289
00:59:04,201 --> 00:59:07,442
We got used to a relationship that wasn't exactly healthy.

1290
00:59:07,542 --> 00:59:09,902
I didn't know how to handle our conflicts,

1291
00:59:09,902 --> 00:59:11,772
so all I did was apologize.

1292
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:14,181
From the outside,

1293
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:16,911
it seemed as though I was being mean to you.

1294
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:21,721
I guess I got fed up with all those opinions.

1295
00:59:22,681 --> 00:59:26,292
That's why I suddenly knew I wanted to end it.

1296
00:59:26,951 --> 00:59:29,962
Up until I came onto the show...

1297
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:32,261
and even after I came on it,

1298
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:36,332
I thought we had broken up because of the situation we were in.

1299
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:40,701
But facing the emotions of the past...

1300
00:59:41,502 --> 00:59:43,172
left me to realize...

1301
00:59:43,172 --> 00:59:45,511
that we weren't compatible on many levels.

1302
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:47,241
We would've broken up either way.

1303
00:59:47,341 --> 00:59:50,451
I learned that while on this show...

1304
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:51,752
which is what I told him.

1305
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:53,712
How was the three weeks for you?

1306
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:55,181
Overwhelming.

1307
00:59:56,821 --> 00:59:59,122
I learned a lot.

1308
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:01,491
I had a blast.

1309
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:05,692
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had this chance.

1310
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:07,931
I want this to have been good for you...

1311
01:00:07,931 --> 01:00:09,661
since I'm grateful for having this opportunity.

1312
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:13,801
I thought I was one to express...

1313
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:16,071
the love I have for someone.

1314
01:00:17,272 --> 01:00:20,241
However, it turns out that I tend to hold back...

1315
01:00:21,082 --> 01:00:23,951
just to save myself of the heartache.

1316
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:27,252
And because of that, I was always too late.

1317
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:30,051
- On the show? - Yes, which is a bummer.

1318
01:00:31,352 --> 01:00:35,161
I spent too much of my time being heartbroken.

1319
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:37,091
That stressed me out as well.

1320
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:39,192
I'm not like this to others,

1321
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:41,332
but I'm like that only to you.

1322
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:43,872
I acted that way even though I didn't want to.

1323
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:47,542
Well, I guess it's because I find you comfortable.

1324
01:00:47,971 --> 01:00:50,071
I don't have to force a smile when I'm with you.

1325
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:55,281
Maybe that's how I unintentionally hurt you.

1326
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:58,982
That was you being comfortable with me,

1327
01:00:58,982 --> 01:01:01,451
but I didn't register that.

1328
01:01:02,221 --> 01:01:04,152
I should've just seen you as is...

1329
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:07,022
even when you were keeping to yourself.

1330
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:11,832
Remember how I told you that I have made up my mind?

1331
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:14,201
I was going to choose you.

1332
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:19,002
Out of all the women here, you are the most inspirational.

1333
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,341
What about me makes you think that way?

1334
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,971
- Don't be like that. - I'm far from cool.

1335
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,111
I mean it.

1336
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:28,841
I have been hard on myself thinking that...

1337
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:30,712
there's nothing I'm good at.

1338
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:34,622
However, Bin said that I was inspirational.

1339
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:38,422
He had learned a lot and thanked me for it.

1340
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,721
His words meant a lot.

1341
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:45,261
There's a reason...

1342
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:48,361
why I got swept up by my past emotions.

1343
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:50,971
It's funny if you think about it,

1344
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:54,272
but you were as pretty as you used to be back then.

1345
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:55,672
"Shall we say cheers?"

1346
01:01:57,042 --> 01:02:00,341
I saw the old you which led me to believe...

1347
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:04,382
All the emotions I had been suppressing...

1348
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:06,011
ended up upsetting you.

1349
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:07,752
No, I was never upset.

1350
01:02:09,882 --> 01:02:11,321
It's a bummer for me too.

1351
01:02:12,652 --> 01:02:14,792
I wanted to be back as a changed man,

1352
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,292
but it didn't happen.

1353
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:21,732
You were never a loser in the first place.

1354
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,801
What I liked so much about you...

1355
01:02:24,801 --> 01:02:27,872
was the fact that you liked me for who I was.

1356
01:02:28,672 --> 01:02:30,772
I don't want you to change in any way.

1357
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:34,781
You are a decent man because of those qualities.

1358
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:37,982
There are many people who are calculative...

1359
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:40,111
and different on the inside.

1360
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:44,591
I'm sure there will be many women who like you for who you are.

1361
01:02:45,252 --> 01:02:46,852
- Thanks. - And the pipes are leaking again.

1362
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:49,462
Gosh. I promised myself I wouldn't cry today.

1363
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:52,891
Shall we get going?

1364
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:55,801
Your dress goes perfectly with the weather.

1365
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:56,962
With this.

1366
01:02:56,962 --> 01:02:58,201
- This? - Camomile.

1367
01:02:59,102 --> 01:03:00,102
Let's go.

1368
01:03:00,102 --> 01:03:02,301
(Na Eon and Hyun Gyu, a date with ex)

1369
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:06,172
I have been wanting to spend some time with Hyun Gyu.

1370
01:03:06,172 --> 01:03:09,611
It was nice to see him again. A date was unexpected though.

1371
01:03:09,812 --> 01:03:11,551
I bought everything I know you'll love.

1372
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:12,582
- Really? - Yes.

1373
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:14,482
- As in what? - Chewy candy.

1374
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:16,922
You have chewy candy for me?

1375
01:03:18,522 --> 01:03:21,721
You even bought almonds. What other flavors did you get?

1376
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,891
- This is all I got. - Thanks.

1377
01:03:24,531 --> 01:03:26,062
Is he Doraemon?

1378
01:03:26,531 --> 01:03:28,562
Where did all the snacks come from?

1379
01:03:29,261 --> 01:03:30,872
- How sweet of him. - He's adorable.

1380
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:32,172
I wouldn't mind dating Hyun Gyu.

1381
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:37,312
I know the snacks that Na Eon likes,

1382
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:39,172
so I bought them for her.

1383
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:45,281
Being with you is most comfortable.

1384
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:47,451
- I feel the same way. - I can finally breathe.

1385
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:49,721
I can breathe!

1386
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:53,252
I wanted to spend some time with you here.

1387
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:56,391
Really? But I told the others that it was a waste of time.

1388
01:03:56,391 --> 01:03:58,491
- Why would it be? - I was only joking.

1389
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:01,701
You are someone...

1390
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:04,801
who knows when I'm joking and when I'm not.

1391
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,031
I knew it was a joke.

1392
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,102
I feel like I'm in Japan.

1393
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:11,212
Tell me about it.

1394
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:14,312
This reminds me of Okinawa.

1395
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:17,951
We had both gained weight, but we still wanted to take photos.

1396
01:04:19,511 --> 01:04:22,022
We took a lot, but...

1397
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:23,382
- They're meaningless now. - I know.

1398
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:25,422
We took a lot, but there are no keepers.

1399
01:04:25,752 --> 01:04:29,321
(On the way to Okinawa, photo taken by Na Eon)

1400
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:32,062
Can I add sounds?

1401
01:04:32,062 --> 01:04:33,062
Of course not.

1402
01:04:33,062 --> 01:04:34,062
(Hyun Gyu filmed Na Eon in Japan.)

1403
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:38,602
Here is Park Na Eon in the wild.

1404
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:42,241
- I had fun. - Me too.

1405
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:45,571
We're here.

1406
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:48,812
We're here.

1407
01:04:56,082 --> 01:04:57,792
My purse... Why don't we look around?

1408
01:04:57,792 --> 01:04:59,091
- Sure. - Let's see what's here.

1409
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,692
- No way. - This is nice.

1410
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,591
- It's fascinating. - This is adorable.

1411
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:07,502
- Hey, this is really nice. - I know.

1412
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:10,031
- You must be hungry. - A little.

1413
01:05:10,132 --> 01:05:11,602
Let's rest and then fire up the barbecue.

1414
01:05:11,602 --> 01:05:12,672
Sure.

1415
01:05:13,632 --> 01:05:14,772
What did you do here?

1416
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:17,002
- As in on the dates? - Yes.

1417
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:20,712
I had black pork omakase and rode a motorcycle.

1418
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:23,482
A motorcycle? Did you manage that?

1419
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:25,482
I did.

1420
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:27,051
Really? How daring of you.

1421
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:28,922
Of course. I'm not as afraid as I used to be.

1422
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:34,321
The boats are adorable. They're like paper boats.

1423
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:35,321
Right.

1424
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:37,192
Do you actually know how to do this?

1425
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:40,292
(He starts a fire for the first time.)

1426
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:45,772
The coal...

1427
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:50,772
(It's not easy.)

1428
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:01,451
I think this is it. I'm sure of it.

1429
01:06:02,221 --> 01:06:03,681
Something's not right.

1430
01:06:04,652 --> 01:06:05,652
Are you sure?

1431
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:08,622
The holes are for air flow.

1432
01:06:08,622 --> 01:06:09,861
What if this catches fire?

1433
01:06:11,132 --> 01:06:12,192
We have an abundance of water.

1434
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:15,531
Then carry this over there and take a dive.

1435
01:06:15,531 --> 01:06:16,531
- Got it? - Got it.

1436

(He tries to start a fire.)

1437
01:06:20,632 --> 01:06:21,841
It burns easily.

(He manages to start a fire.)

1439
01:06:28,611 --> 01:06:29,641
It's lit.

1440
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:30,741
- Really? - Yes.

1441

(They begin grilling the meat.)

1442
01:06:33,382 --> 01:06:34,451
Are there any sausages?

1443
01:06:38,422 --> 01:06:40,752
Make it look like I'm grilling the meat.

1444
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:49,402
(He gets into position.)

1445
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:58,312
- All good? - No, take another one.

1446
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:06,082
That's enough.

1447
01:07:06,582 --> 01:07:08,082
It looks delicious.

1448
01:07:23,232 --> 01:07:24,301
Don't eat it.

1449
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:28,571
Am I a dog or something?

1450
01:07:28,772 --> 01:07:31,341
You eat food after dropping it, calling it the three-second rule.

1451
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:32,442
It's a thing.

1452
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:34,641
Hold on.

1453
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:35,911
It's hot, but try this.

1454
01:07:39,252 --> 01:07:40,482
It's good.

1455
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:41,922
Let's eat.

1456
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:44,891
- Get the Coke. - Sure.

1457
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:48,761
On the other hand, I shouldn't.

1458
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:51,962
(Glancing)

1459
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:53,232
It's all right.

1460
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:54,562
Just wipe it dry.

1461
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:57,161
Can you go over there? I'll sort this out.

1462
01:07:57,431 --> 01:07:58,672
- I'll stay put. - Sure.

1463
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:01,672
Meat is soaked in Coke sometimes.

1464
01:08:01,672 --> 01:08:02,872
Sit there and be quiet.

1465
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:05,341
Tissue, please.

1466
01:08:07,071 --> 01:08:08,582
Did you spill it on the meat?

1467
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:09,611
Yes.

1468
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:11,352
Are you kidding me?

1469
01:08:15,152 --> 01:08:17,422
- Not much though. - It's soaked.

1470
01:08:17,851 --> 01:08:19,122
It's fine though. Let's eat.

1471
01:08:19,321 --> 01:08:21,122
- Shall we? - Sure.

1472
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:25,262
Hey, it's nice.

1473
01:08:25,832 --> 01:08:26,892
- Try some. - Sure.

1474
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:30,972
- It's good. - I know.

1475
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:34,302
I grilled them well.

1476
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:36,872
How is it like to be here?

1477
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:39,071
They're all nice people,

1478
01:08:39,811 --> 01:08:40,811
and it's been fun.

1479
01:08:41,712 --> 01:08:43,042
They all look exhausted though.

1480
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:45,951
- Everyone's having a hard time. - I know. It seems that way.

1481
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,981
- We all have our own stories. - Right.

1482
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:50,851
Come to think of it,

1483
01:08:50,851 --> 01:08:52,351
if we had just broken up,

1484
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,521
I would've found it difficult as well.

1485
01:08:54,252 --> 01:08:57,462
I broke up with you when I knew I could end things for good.

1486
01:08:57,561 --> 01:09:00,191
- Right. - That's why I wasn't heartbroken.

1487
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,002
We went through a lot together.

1488
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:06,672
All I can do is apologize.

1489
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:09,201
You've already apologized too much.

1490
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:10,502
It doesn't stir up any more emotions.

1491
01:09:10,941 --> 01:09:12,012
- Really? - Yes.

1492
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:13,271
I guess you're sorry and that's it.

Hi.

Hey.

1496
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:40,701
It's been a while.

1497
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:45,842
Have you been well?

1498
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:48,842
What about you?

1499
01:09:49,082 --> 01:09:51,252
A lot has happened since we broke up.

1500
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:57,622
Why did you ask me to join you on this show?

1501
01:09:57,821 --> 01:09:59,491
You're asking that out of the blue?

1502
01:10:00,052 --> 01:10:01,161
I want to know.

1503
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:04,491
It seemed like fun.

1504
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:07,191
- That's very you. - Right.

1505
01:10:10,061 --> 01:10:11,531
How did it feel...

1506
01:10:11,672 --> 01:10:14,872
when I suggested that you be on the show?

1507
01:10:15,802 --> 01:10:16,872
Well...

1508
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,082
Nothing crossed your mind?

1509
01:10:27,752 --> 01:10:28,851
I guess...

1510
01:10:31,222 --> 01:10:34,561
I want to see her again and talk to her.

1511
01:10:35,392 --> 01:10:37,321
I have a lot to apologize for.

1512
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:40,491
I'd love the chance to talk to her again.

1513
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:45,432
Although, I don't want things to be serious between us.

1514
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:49,472
We were madly in love with each other.

1515
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:53,311
We met during a tumultuous period of time,

1516
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:55,781
so the relationship had many issues.

1517
01:10:55,781 --> 01:10:58,151
Still, the love we had was innocent.

1518
01:11:01,222 --> 01:11:03,082
We'd go to the Han River often...

1519
01:11:03,082 --> 01:11:04,792
and also Garosu-gil.

1520
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:08,061
We used to take his dog out for walks...

1521
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:09,722
along the Han River.

1524
01:11:16,061 --> 01:11:17,601
You're an adorable one.

1525
01:11:18,002 --> 01:11:19,531
Look at how adorable you are.

1526
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:22,172
How about we go to Han River?

1527
01:11:22,672 --> 01:11:23,701
Sure.

1528
01:11:25,172 --> 01:11:26,972
This is one of the things I felt guilty about.

1529
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:29,512
Na Eon and I never got...

1530
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:31,151
to go on real dates.

1531
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:34,111
I had to study for the CSAT...

1532
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:36,781
which was a priority for me,

1533
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:39,552
and she knew how important it was.

1534
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:42,521
For half of the year, I studied for the CSAT.

1535
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:46,292
It's too bad that we didn't get to do a lot of things together.

1536
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:48,502
Especially because we got along so well.

1537
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:53,601
We met often at a coffee shop.

1538
01:11:53,872 --> 01:11:56,372
We'd study together while teasing each other a bit.

1539
01:11:56,372 --> 01:11:57,911
That's what I mostly remember.

1540
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:00,771
I can be a bit of a prankster.

1541
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:04,082
Everything she had, I managed to disassemble.

1542
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:06,481
I'd take her earbuds,

1543
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:08,382
pull them out of the case and remove the cover.

1544
01:12:08,382 --> 01:12:09,582
I also dissembled her mechanical pencil once.

1545
01:12:09,651 --> 01:12:12,592
Na Eon would sit there and put them back together.

1546
01:12:13,922 --> 01:12:17,061
He would hide my earbuds in the flowerpot.

1547
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:21,661
And I would tie his shoe around the table leg.

1548
01:12:21,731 --> 01:12:23,762
Childish, right?

1549
01:12:25,071 --> 01:12:26,332
Two adults did that.

1550
01:12:26,802 --> 01:12:30,101
If I think about it now, it doesn't seem like fun.

1551
01:12:30,372 --> 01:12:32,172
But it was back then.

1552
01:12:32,372 --> 01:12:35,212
We'd goof around like that to the point...

1553
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:36,712
that it would seem odd to others.

1554
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:41,882
(They had fun doing the smallest things.)

1555
01:12:43,252 --> 01:12:47,491
(Back when they were together)

1556
01:12:49,361 --> 01:12:51,392
(Why did you study for the CSAT for so long?)

1557
01:12:51,462 --> 01:12:53,392
It's not because my parents pushed me.

1558
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:56,762
They both graduated from Seoul National University,

1559
01:12:56,901 --> 01:12:58,432
so that felt like the only option.

1560
01:12:58,872 --> 01:13:00,571
Even though I didn't study that much,

1561
01:13:00,802 --> 01:13:03,502
I thought that I would get in there easily.

1562
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:07,611
I mostly wanted to prove myself.

1563
01:13:07,611 --> 01:13:10,481
I couldn't bear not being the best.

1564
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:12,151
That led me to believe...

1565
01:13:12,651 --> 01:13:15,722
that graduating SNU was my only course in life.

1566
01:13:17,182 --> 01:13:20,321
SNU isn't a college you can easily get into.

1567
01:13:20,451 --> 01:13:21,592
It was a challenge.

1568
01:13:21,592 --> 01:13:23,161
I had three years...

1569
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:24,731
to catch up on 12 years amount of schoolwork.

1570
01:13:26,632 --> 01:13:30,462
To be free of my inferiority complex is why I kept studying.

1571
01:13:30,802 --> 01:13:35,672
Graduating SNU wasn't going to alter my life dramatically.

1572
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:38,071
But I felt insecure.

1573
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:40,771
That's why I felt insecure,

1574
01:13:40,811 --> 01:13:43,042
so I studied to overcome my issues.

1575
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:46,911
(And that's how...)

(Why did the relationship end?)

1578

Technically speaking, we got back together once...

1579
01:13:58,092 --> 01:13:59,592
after we initially broke up.

1580
01:13:59,592 --> 01:14:01,361
The first time, he was the one to end things.

1581
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:02,901
But I ended it the second time.

1582
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,932
When I first ended the relationship,

1583
01:14:05,972 --> 01:14:09,741
it was after I had done poorly on the exam.

1584
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:10,901
I didn't get the score I wanted.

1585
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:13,512
- Back then... - Yes?

1586
01:14:13,512 --> 01:14:16,781
He had been studying for an exam,

1587
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:19,951
but he didn't score well which broke him mentally.

1588
01:14:19,951 --> 01:14:22,781
He didn't have room in his life for me...

1589
01:14:23,151 --> 01:14:24,552
which is why we wanted to break up.

1590
01:14:24,552 --> 01:14:27,491
I kept telling him that I'd take what he could give.

1591
01:14:29,361 --> 01:14:31,161
But we still broke it off.

1592
01:14:31,762 --> 01:14:34,031
He was smart, and he got grades,

1593
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:36,802
but he just couldn't get a good score on the CSAT.

1594
01:14:37,632 --> 01:14:39,832
Thinking back on it now,

1595
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:44,201
his confidence must've dipped low.

1596
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:46,542
I didn't want her...

1597
01:14:48,212 --> 01:14:50,542
to see how pathetic I was.

1598
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:54,281
She had obviously been patient with me,

1599
01:14:55,281 --> 01:14:58,552
but I didn't get a good result to make up for it.

1600
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:03,321
She rarely expressed how hard it was for her,

1601
01:15:03,321 --> 01:15:04,661
but I knew.

1602
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:07,561
I could tell that she was enduring the hardships.

1603
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:09,861
Because I knew that,

1604
01:15:10,462 --> 01:15:13,731
I couldn't keep her by my side.

1605
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:15,571
It's true that I'm making excuses.

1606
01:15:16,172 --> 01:15:18,571
She had to sacrifice more in this relationship,

1607
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:21,781
and I couldn't let it continue.

1608
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:24,441
So that's why...

1609
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,012
I didn't want to make things harder on her.

1610
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:30,422
I selfishly told her I wanted to break up.

1611
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:33,122
"I'm sorry,"

1612
01:15:35,762 --> 01:15:37,722
"but I no longer love you."

1613
01:15:39,092 --> 01:15:42,661
(Guilt and fear had him pushing her away with lies.)

1614
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:44,802
We shared so much,

1615
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:46,901
and I wanted to share that much more.

1616
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:48,101
Because I was young.

1617
01:15:48,372 --> 01:15:52,172
I thought that's how it should be with someone you love.

1618
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,172
That you have to know everything about that person...

1619
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:56,212
and share everything.

1620
01:15:56,712 --> 01:16:00,411
I thought you have to accept everything about that person.

1621
01:16:01,281 --> 01:16:02,781
But that isn't the case.

1622
01:16:02,781 --> 01:16:05,191
That way, you can become tired of each other.

1623
01:16:05,191 --> 01:16:07,191
I dated her when nothing was set in my life.

1624
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:09,861
I was very anxious.

1625
01:16:10,962 --> 01:16:12,991
I depended on her too much.

1626
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,802
He was going through a lot,

1627
01:16:15,962 --> 01:16:19,472
and he didn't want me to become more meaningful to him.

1628
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:21,472
He said that.

1629
01:16:21,842 --> 01:16:23,901
I was a bit scared.

1630
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:27,542
I was afraid of having someone who is important to me.

1631
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,911
It's like that with first love.

1632
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,712
When that person disappears, the emptiness is too much.

1633
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,512
I crumble.

1634
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:35,722
So I wanted to deny it.

1635
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:39,592
Na Eon found out why I behaved that way.

1636
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:41,722
I even told her about these things.

1637
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,691
The fear of getting abandoned had made me defensive.

1638
01:16:45,691 --> 01:16:48,101
Had I been stable, I wouldn't have acted that way.

1639
01:16:50,031 --> 01:16:52,701
Na Eon tried to fix me.

1640
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:54,842
She tried to resolve the situation.

1641
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,071
It must have hurt her.

1642
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:01,142
I felt like I could accept it.

1643
01:17:02,012 --> 01:17:03,142
I felt like...

1644
01:17:03,142 --> 01:17:05,451
I could embrace his heart.

1645
01:17:05,752 --> 01:17:08,922
I am satisfied with who I am now.

1646
01:17:09,182 --> 01:17:12,151
Ever since I met Na Eon, I came to understand myself better.

1647
01:17:12,392 --> 01:17:16,561
I had never received unconditional love.

1648
01:17:16,861 --> 01:17:20,161
In retrospect, it was my biggest flaw.

1649
01:17:20,892 --> 01:17:24,161
I had never met someone who loved me unconditionally,

1650
01:17:24,731 --> 01:17:27,071
so I was afraid of filling that void.

1651
01:17:27,071 --> 01:17:30,872
There was a variety of reasons.

1652
01:17:31,172 --> 01:17:33,571
When there is a problem, I say so.

1653
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:34,911
When I am sad, I say so.

1654
01:17:35,142 --> 01:17:36,882
I learned to express myself.

1655
01:17:37,012 --> 01:17:39,781
I am who I am now thanks to Na Eon.

1656
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:44,151
If you could ask Na Eon anything, what would you ask her?

1657
01:17:44,252 --> 01:17:47,321
I can answer that question in 0.1 seconds.

1658
01:17:47,491 --> 01:17:51,292
"Was I a good influence in your life?"

1659
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:55,802
"Don't you regret meeting me?"

1660
01:17:57,031 --> 01:18:00,632
(Hyun Gyu and Na Eon were together in their uncertain early 20s.)

1661
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:05,771
(Their relationship ended with them feeling bad for each other.)

1662
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:09,512
I think I used up my feelings.

1663
01:18:10,512 --> 01:18:12,111
I did what I could.

1664
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:13,552
I did my best.

1665
01:18:13,951 --> 01:18:16,021
I liked him as much as I could,

1666
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:17,651
so I have no regrets.

1667
01:18:18,892 --> 01:18:22,161
From my relationship with Na Eon,

1668
01:18:22,361 --> 01:18:23,661
I learned a lot.

1669
01:18:24,691 --> 01:18:26,932
That's why I can express myself in a healthy way...

1670
01:18:27,531 --> 01:18:30,901
and like someone without getting hurt.

1671
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:38,741
- I have a question. - What?

1672
01:18:38,842 --> 01:18:40,512
Why did you message me so often...

1673
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:42,441
after we broke up?

1674
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:44,212
I just...

1675
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:46,682
wanted to know how you were doing.

1676
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:50,781
I missed you too.

1677
01:18:52,991 --> 01:18:54,792
You were the only one I could contact.

1678
01:18:56,092 --> 01:18:57,422
- I... - It was pathetic.

1679
01:18:58,691 --> 01:18:59,962
I was a loser.

1680
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:01,701
It was pathetic.

1681
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:02,962
- Yes. - It was pathetic.

1682
01:19:03,101 --> 01:19:04,262
But...

1683
01:19:04,361 --> 01:19:07,101
I replied and told you...

1684
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:09,071
about how I felt.

1685
01:19:09,071 --> 01:19:10,401
Yes. I was thankful.

1686
01:19:10,771 --> 01:19:12,372
- I wasn't hung up on you. - No.

1687
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,811
You weren't either.

1688
01:19:13,811 --> 01:19:15,241
- I could tell from your messages. - Right.

1689
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:16,941
I thought about you a lot.

1690
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:19,012
I could talk to you easily...

1691
01:19:19,411 --> 01:19:21,281
even though years had passed after a relationship.

1692
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:24,351
I felt like you would put up with me even if I contacted you.

1693
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:26,691
So I messaged you often.

1694
01:19:26,951 --> 01:19:28,021
Exactly.

1695
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:29,392
That's what annoys me.

1696
01:19:29,462 --> 01:19:31,161
- What? - I won't put up with everything.

1697
01:19:31,422 --> 01:19:32,561
Okay.

1698
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:33,731
I was careless.

1699
01:19:33,731 --> 01:19:35,432
Did I seem like a pushover to you?

1700
01:19:35,861 --> 01:19:37,061
It wasn't like that.

1701
01:19:37,802 --> 01:19:40,972
I knew it wasn't like that.

1702
01:19:40,972 --> 01:19:42,441
But I couldn't help it...

1703
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:48,142
because I had pent-up anger toward Hyun Gyu in my heart.

1704
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:51,241
So I used it as an excuse to express my anger.

1705
01:20:01,991 --> 01:20:04,161
I didn't see you as a pushover.

1706
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:06,332
It's just that...

1707
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:08,462
I can't do things properly when it comes to you.

1708
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:12,632
Maybe it's because you have seen my rock bottom.

1709
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:14,672
I should've been more careful.

1710
01:20:14,771 --> 01:20:15,901
You are right.

1711
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:21,441
When I was the most unstable and messed up in my early 20s,

1712
01:20:22,182 --> 01:20:23,481
I met you.

1713
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:25,882
We grew together.

1714
01:20:25,981 --> 01:20:28,182
- That's what I think too. - Right.

1715
01:20:28,182 --> 01:20:30,321
I think that was why...

1716
01:20:30,851 --> 01:20:32,222
I showed...

1717
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,951
such behaviors to you.

1718
01:20:35,661 --> 01:20:38,962
I annoyed you.

1719
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:42,031
You should have lived well.

1720
01:20:42,432 --> 01:20:45,302
When it looked like you wanted to get back together...

1721
01:20:45,302 --> 01:20:46,901
You are right. But...

1722
01:20:48,571 --> 01:20:49,842
I didn't want...

1723
01:20:49,842 --> 01:20:51,712
to hurt you again.

1724
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,741
I didn't want to get hurt either.

1725
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:54,042
Back then,

1726
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:56,382
I was the one...

1727
01:20:57,911 --> 01:20:59,451
who was mean to you.

1728
01:20:59,451 --> 01:21:00,651
It's okay.

1729
01:21:01,052 --> 01:21:02,622
You can do that to me.

1730
01:21:02,622 --> 01:21:04,021
I didn't want to get back together...

1731
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:05,451
- with you. - Right.

1732
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:07,151
- I knew that. - I hated you,

1733
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:09,622
so I wanted to hurt you.

1734
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:11,661
It's okay. It's understandable.

1735
01:21:12,092 --> 01:21:13,661
I don't feel bad about it.

1736
01:21:14,092 --> 01:21:15,361
Don't feel bad.

1737
01:21:23,741 --> 01:21:25,611
I want to be good friends with you.

1738
01:21:26,642 --> 01:21:28,342
Let's do that. But...

1739
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:29,611
there is something I want to ask.

1740
01:21:30,611 --> 01:21:31,752
What?

1741
01:21:32,712 --> 01:21:34,082
Do you regret meeting me?

1742
01:21:34,382 --> 01:21:35,521
No.

1743
01:21:37,082 --> 01:21:38,321
Okay then.

1744
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:42,991
I wanted to hear that.

1745
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,491
Why did you ask me that?

1746
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:51,002
I was the worst boyfriend to you.

1747
01:22:13,722 --> 01:22:16,161
He asked me if I regretted meeting him.

1748
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:20,161
The fact he asked me that...

1749
01:22:21,691 --> 01:22:23,002
made my heart ache.

1750
01:22:23,832 --> 01:22:26,332
I have nothing but gratitude.

1751
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:29,172
So...

1752
01:22:30,271 --> 01:22:32,911
I realized that he has a lot of guilt.

1753
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:35,441
He must have struggled a lot.

1754
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:39,151
I hurt him in that regard too.

1755
01:22:40,851 --> 01:22:42,052
I realized...

1756
01:22:44,351 --> 01:22:47,592
that Hyun Gyu lived in guilt because of me.

1757
01:23:22,962 --> 01:23:24,191
I am sorry.

1758
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:33,372
I hurt you too much.

1759
01:23:35,101 --> 01:23:36,901
When I had so many problems,

1760
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:39,771
you met me.

1761
01:23:43,212 --> 01:23:44,441
I feel bad about that.

1762
01:23:46,182 --> 01:23:47,712
I can't turn back time.

1763
01:23:54,722 --> 01:23:55,892
I feel so bad.

1764
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,731
I hurt you continuously. Even now, I did that.

1765
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:04,262
I didn't want to hurt you again,

1766
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:06,632
but it just kept happening.

1767
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:08,542
I was scared...

1768
01:24:09,372 --> 01:24:11,302
that you would regret meeting me.

1769
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:19,212
I was scared of that.

1770
01:24:20,781 --> 01:24:21,951
So...

1771
01:24:21,951 --> 01:24:23,552
I couldn't ask you to come back.

1772
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:34,292
I know that if I express my anger,

1773
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:35,701
you will feel bad...

1774
01:24:37,231 --> 01:24:39,071
If I express my anger,

1775
01:24:42,872 --> 01:24:44,542
you will feel bad...

1776
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:51,911
I know that you will feel bad and run away.

1777
01:24:53,382 --> 01:24:56,021
I know why you run away.

1778
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:02,262
I hope you will be happy.

1779
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:11,132
I hope you will be successful.

1780
01:25:13,472 --> 01:25:16,042
You say it's okay, but I feel so bad.

1781
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:20,472
I think that's why I behave more strangely.

1782
01:25:20,472 --> 01:25:24,042
And it makes the matters worse.

1783
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:34,821
I can't express myself well to Na Eon.

1784
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:37,222
That's not how I feel.

1785
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:40,262
I don't look down on her.

1786
01:25:40,262 --> 01:25:42,262
I don't see her as a pushover.

1787
01:25:43,701 --> 01:25:46,101
I don't know how to express that.

1788
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:50,472
I really want to express those things,

1789
01:25:51,802 --> 01:25:53,241
but I can't make a good delivery.

1790
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:56,042
It was my first time seeing Hyun Gyu cry.

1791
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:58,281
Hyun Gyu knew...

1792
01:25:58,281 --> 01:26:01,981
that I was angry about something else.

1793
01:26:02,622 --> 01:26:06,252
The fact that he hurt me again...

1794
01:26:06,252 --> 01:26:08,792
made both of us cry.

1795
01:26:09,222 --> 01:26:10,462
She said she didn't regret it.

1796
01:26:11,092 --> 01:26:12,592
She said she only feels gratitude.

1797
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:15,462
I wanted to hear those words.

1798
01:26:16,561 --> 01:26:18,771
There was a lump in my heart.

1799
01:26:19,601 --> 01:26:22,271
There was a heavy burden regarding my relationship with Na Eon,

1800
01:26:22,972 --> 01:26:25,771
guilt, and bad feelings.

1801
01:26:26,111 --> 01:26:28,042
I think they dissipated a lot.

1802
01:26:29,082 --> 01:26:31,582
I wanted to tell her this.

1803
01:26:32,512 --> 01:26:37,151
"Thanks to you, I grew a lot..."

1804
01:26:38,481 --> 01:26:40,321
"and became happier."

1805
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:44,191
(They opened up for the first time after the breakup.)

1806
01:26:44,191 --> 01:26:46,061
It's okay. I'm okay now.

1807
01:26:51,701 --> 01:26:53,401
We got along well.

1808
01:26:58,172 --> 01:27:00,472
- No? - You are right.

1809
01:27:03,512 --> 01:27:04,911
Crying made me hungry.

1810
01:27:05,882 --> 01:27:07,012
The food must be cold now.

1811
01:27:15,052 --> 01:27:16,892
It is a candle.

1812
01:27:18,932 --> 01:27:21,632
(They visit a gift shop.)

1813
01:27:22,031 --> 01:27:23,531
It must be a bracelet.

1814
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:26,731
Shall we get matching bracelets?

1815
01:27:26,832 --> 01:27:28,002
Matching bracelets?

1816
01:27:28,101 --> 01:27:31,672
Shall we get matching bracelets since we are on Jeju Island?

1817
01:27:31,672 --> 01:27:33,172
- Shall we do that? - Yes.

1818
01:27:33,172 --> 01:27:35,271
Okay. This is pretty.

1819
01:27:36,411 --> 01:27:38,611
- A flower bracelet. - Let's get it.

1820
01:27:38,611 --> 01:27:39,911
- This is pretty. - Let's get it.

1821
01:27:40,012 --> 01:27:41,012
Let's get a flower bracelet each.

1822
01:27:41,012 --> 01:27:42,882
You like pink, so get this.

1823
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:45,351
- I love it. It's pretty. - Right?

1824
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:46,922
Nice.

1825
01:27:48,021 --> 01:27:49,092
Thank you.

1826
01:27:49,962 --> 01:27:51,892
- Thank you. Bye. - Thank you.

1827
01:27:52,262 --> 01:27:54,462
- Let's get iced Americano. - Iced Americano?

1828
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:04,042
Come on.

1829
01:28:05,002 --> 01:28:08,071
Are you hogging the ice cream since only a small bit remains?

1830
01:28:08,071 --> 01:28:09,911
- Unbelievable. - Don't take it. Eat it here.

1831
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:11,241
You took it too.

1832
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:12,611
Put it in the middle!

1833

I knew you would say something about that.

- What? - Go on in.

1839
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:37,901
We came to a nice cafe.

1840
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:39,441
I know. You must be cold.

1841
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:41,512
I am cold, but it's okay.

1842
01:28:41,512 --> 01:28:43,382
- Should I take off my cardigan? - No. You never do that.

1843
01:28:44,281 --> 01:28:45,981
I did it all the time.

1844
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:51,752
This bracelet is pretty.

1845
01:28:53,052 --> 01:28:54,052
Right?

1846
01:28:54,691 --> 01:28:55,962
Why is it so loose?

1847
01:28:58,561 --> 01:28:59,691
Hold on.

1848
01:29:01,031 --> 01:29:02,632
Why are you so slow?

1849
01:29:03,861 --> 01:29:06,802
- It's too tight. - You can clasp it like this. Here.

1850
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:08,701
It's too tight.

(They got matching bracelets on Jeju Island.)

1853

They needed to go on a date.

1854

- That's right. - Seriously.

1855
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:22,752
This should have happened on the first day...

1856
01:29:22,752 --> 01:29:23,882
they landed on Jeju Island...

1857
01:29:23,882 --> 01:29:25,082
- to turn things around. - That's right.

1858
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:28,451
Maybe he remained cold so that this wouldn't happen.

1859
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:30,722
He didn't want this to happen. He didn't want to fall for her.

1860
01:29:30,722 --> 01:29:31,991
- I see. - That might be the case.

toward her.

This photo came out well.

- Did you take it here? - Yes.

1865
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:44,071
Because you lost a lot of fat in your face,

1866
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:45,571
you look very nice in photos.

1867
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:48,882
Your face used to be huge and round like a steamed bun.

1868
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:51,142
You are right. I was like Anpanman.

1869
01:29:51,142 --> 01:29:53,752
Your face used to be as big as Mount Rushmore.

1870
01:29:54,882 --> 01:29:56,521
You had no style.

1871
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:58,182
You always wore pajamas.

1872
01:29:58,182 --> 01:30:00,651
"It looks like she came out without taking a shower."

1873
01:30:00,651 --> 01:30:03,262
People used to say that, but you became a lot prettier.

1874
01:30:03,262 --> 01:30:05,592
You dress well now. You look pretty.

1875

Thank you. I see that it's a compliment.

1876

I see that it's a compliment.

1903
01:31:50,061 --> 01:31:52,432
When? When will you do that?

1904
01:31:52,701 --> 01:31:54,531
- Some other time. - Why are you crying?

1905
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:05,241
Why are you crying?

1906
01:32:13,092 --> 01:32:15,151
Because it ended in an unexpected way?

1907
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:19,592
I thought I would get to have a conversation with you now.

1908
01:32:19,592 --> 01:32:21,392
I know. It's too bad.

1909
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:27,201
It was the perfect time to talk.

1910
01:32:27,332 --> 01:32:30,302
We could have had some quality time together, right?

1911
01:32:30,741 --> 01:32:32,771
Come on.

1912
01:32:34,741 --> 01:32:35,911
Why is he suddenly being like that?

1913
01:32:36,182 --> 01:32:38,642
- Why am I crying? - Why does my heart ache?

1914
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:40,582
- I know. Why is that? - Why is that?

1915
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:49,861
Why am I so sad?

1916
01:32:52,491 --> 01:32:54,861
It was the perfect time to talk.

1917
01:32:55,061 --> 01:32:58,101
We could have had some quality time together, right?

1918
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:04,701
It suddenly ended.

1919
01:33:06,571 --> 01:33:08,642
Gyu Min cried for the first time.

1920
01:33:08,911 --> 01:33:10,441
I was very surprised.

1921
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:13,651
"Gyu Min is sad too. Gyu Min is disappointed too."

1922
01:33:13,651 --> 01:33:17,252
I had that thought for the first time.

1923
01:33:17,781 --> 01:33:20,622
I didn't want to show her that side of me.

1924
01:33:20,622 --> 01:33:21,851
I was so disappointed.

1925
01:33:22,052 --> 01:33:25,861
The situation made me upset.

1926
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:27,632
I don't think...

1927
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:30,861
we had a meal together.

1928
01:33:31,031 --> 01:33:33,771
I always had good meals with other people.

1929
01:33:35,571 --> 01:33:38,672
So I thought it would be nice to have a good meal...

1930
01:33:38,672 --> 01:33:39,911
with Hae Eun.

1931
01:33:40,071 --> 01:33:42,342
I was very disappointed that it didn't happen.

1932
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:44,781
Still, how was it today?

1933
01:33:47,851 --> 01:33:50,451
In the beginning, it was hard to be with you.

1934
01:33:53,991 --> 01:33:55,922
I thought...

1935
01:33:56,661 --> 01:33:59,491
I would be able to enjoy my time with you from now on.

1936
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:01,161
So it's disappointing.

1937
01:34:04,701 --> 01:34:06,872
I really thought we would get to eat together.

1938
01:34:07,832 --> 01:34:09,672
Is today the end?

1939
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:17,012
Were those tears of disappointment?

1940
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:19,451
- Were you disappointed? - Yes.

1941
01:34:21,082 --> 01:34:23,481
I didn't think you would be disappointed.

1942
01:34:24,682 --> 01:34:27,252
We should have had more conversations, right?

1943
01:34:29,292 --> 01:34:31,622
You kept avoiding me.

1944
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:35,661
You were annoyed with me.

1945
01:34:37,061 --> 01:34:38,762
You were like that back in Pyeongchang-dong too.

1946
01:34:39,101 --> 01:34:42,432
You asked Na Yeon to go and pick a perfume with you.

1947
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,142
It would've been nice if you asked me that.

1948
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:47,771
I went with her because the topic came up.

1949
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:50,882
You should have asked me. You knew I was free.

1950
01:34:53,411 --> 01:34:55,052
You had a lot of chances.

1951
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:57,351
Today, I am disappointed.

1952
01:34:57,682 --> 01:34:58,981
Why are you disappointed today?

1953
01:34:59,351 --> 01:35:01,491
We spent time together for the first time.

1954
01:35:02,222 --> 01:35:04,191
Why are you only disappointed today?

1955
01:35:06,161 --> 01:35:07,661
Stop crying.

1956
01:35:14,972 --> 01:35:16,441
Stop crying.

1957
01:35:20,911 --> 01:35:24,411
I don't know why I feel the most comfortable around you.

1958
01:35:24,941 --> 01:35:27,212
We spent many years together. Of course it's like that.

1959
01:35:30,682 --> 01:35:33,552
Even though it was forced, I am so happy...

1960
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:36,762
that we got to face each other and spend time together.

1961
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:41,292
I am so disappointed.

1962
01:35:43,262 --> 01:35:47,031
I was happy to tell you that it was nice.

1963
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:52,672
You are okay...

1964
01:35:52,972 --> 01:35:55,642
with me dating someone else, right?

1965
01:35:57,642 --> 01:35:59,851
- You don't care. - I wouldn't be happy about it.

1966
01:36:00,712 --> 01:36:02,012
I wouldn't be happy about it.

1967
01:36:04,182 --> 01:36:07,922
Nevertheless, I want you to follow your heart.

1968
01:36:09,462 --> 01:36:11,622
You used up the napkins.

1969
01:36:12,222 --> 01:36:13,832
You used up the napkins this cafe has.

1970
01:36:16,502 --> 01:36:18,601
- What are you doing? - Are you hungry?

1971
01:36:18,962 --> 01:36:21,672
For goodness' sake. I almost choked.

1972
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,472
I almost died.

1973
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:33,481
I was more disappointed then. Seriously.

1974
01:36:33,582 --> 01:36:37,821
The fact that the date with Hae Eun ended so abruptly...

1975
01:36:38,021 --> 01:36:40,451
gave me a hard time.

1976
01:36:40,691 --> 01:36:43,392
It was the first time Gyu Min opened up...

1977
01:36:43,392 --> 01:36:45,321
about his feelings.

1978
01:36:45,762 --> 01:36:49,462
I cried a lot because it felt like the end.

1979
01:36:51,632 --> 01:36:55,531
(Both of them sent a reply.)

1980
01:37:00,811 --> 01:37:03,111
Why are you so stingy with your words?

1981
01:37:03,411 --> 01:37:05,142
You don't say anything. You don't express yourself.

1982
01:37:05,142 --> 01:37:06,851
You don't talk about your feelings.

1983
01:37:07,512 --> 01:37:08,781
I had fun today.

1984
01:37:11,351 --> 01:37:14,021
I thought we would have more time together.

1985
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:15,491
I was disappointed...

1986
01:37:15,491 --> 01:37:17,191
- that it ended so abruptly. - Is that all?

1987
01:37:18,092 --> 01:37:19,161
Is that all?

1988
01:37:19,531 --> 01:37:20,892
What else do you want to hear?

1989
01:37:21,892 --> 01:37:24,031
Today's date didn't change your mind...

1990
01:37:24,962 --> 01:37:26,771
in any way, did it?

1991
01:37:27,432 --> 01:37:28,832
It did.

1992
01:37:30,842 --> 01:37:32,372
Of course it did.

1993
01:37:36,111 --> 01:37:38,111
How many more times do you want me to say it?

1994
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:41,411
I don't know. Express yourself more like me.

1995
01:37:41,411 --> 01:37:43,052
"I was sad. I was happy."

1996
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:46,021
"I was very disappointed." Say those things.

1997
01:37:47,252 --> 01:37:50,361
Don't you know my style after dating me for six years?

1998
01:37:51,321 --> 01:37:52,521
I don't like it.

1999
01:37:52,932 --> 01:37:54,092
I don't like it either.

2000
01:37:56,632 --> 01:37:57,832
Is your face cold?

2001
01:37:58,262 --> 01:38:00,231
My face is hot. My hands are cold.

2002
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:02,802
Your hands are really cold.

2003
01:38:04,302 --> 01:38:05,441
Your hands are cold.

2004
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:10,342
We need to go now.

2005
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:16,321
(Gyu Min gets up first.)

2006
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:17,382
I will go first.

2007
01:38:47,811 --> 01:38:52,021
(He goes over the photos he took today.)

2008
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,451
I went over the photos...

2009
01:38:55,451 --> 01:38:58,222
I had taken that day.

2010
01:38:58,892 --> 01:39:01,361
They brought back old memories.

2011
01:39:02,031 --> 01:39:06,531
When we were very happy together,

2012
01:39:06,731 --> 01:39:09,132
Hae Eun was always smiling in my photos.

2013
01:39:09,132 --> 01:39:12,002
We always took selfies together.

2014
01:39:12,002 --> 01:39:13,411
The photos reminded me of that time.

2015
01:39:25,622 --> 01:39:27,592
You are walking in a strange way.

2016
01:39:28,691 --> 01:39:29,821
Are you okay?

2017
01:39:30,191 --> 01:39:32,321
- Will you be able to get there? - Yes.

2018
01:39:33,592 --> 01:39:35,932
- You are exhausted, right? - No. I am okay.

2019
01:39:39,571 --> 01:39:40,601
What?

2020
01:39:46,642 --> 01:39:50,082
At that moment,

2021
01:39:50,481 --> 01:39:51,811
I missed the past so much.

2022
01:39:53,582 --> 01:39:55,351
I really wanted to express myself.

2023
01:39:56,082 --> 01:39:58,752
All those emotions burst out.

2024
01:39:58,752 --> 01:40:02,092
I felt so bad. I wanted to express myself.

2025
01:40:02,151 --> 01:40:06,462
All those emotions burst out at the same time.

2026
01:40:23,981 --> 01:40:28,052
(Gyu Min cried alone for a while.)

2027
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:47,101
All along,

2028
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:49,472
I suppressed myself because I thought...

2029
01:40:49,472 --> 01:40:51,372
it was for Hae Eun's sake.

2030
01:40:51,642 --> 01:40:54,111
I didn't think my emotions would burst out...

2031
01:40:54,111 --> 01:40:56,712
in such a short amount of time.

2032
01:41:10,222 --> 01:41:11,661
We could see...

2033
01:41:11,661 --> 01:41:14,191
that Gyu Min was suppressing his emotions...

2034
01:41:14,191 --> 01:41:15,661
in a deliberate way.

2035
01:41:15,661 --> 01:41:16,802
- Right. - He kept putting up a guard.

2036
01:41:16,802 --> 01:41:17,901
But that's...

2037
01:41:18,332 --> 01:41:20,832
The fact that it's on purpose...

2038
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:23,241
means that there's a chance it might all crumble down.

2039
01:41:23,372 --> 01:41:24,601
It's just so sad.

2040
01:41:24,601 --> 01:41:27,571
If only he had opened up his heart...

2041
01:41:27,571 --> 01:41:30,582
- a little bit earlier. - It's a shame, isn't it?

2042
01:41:31,682 --> 01:41:33,951
I feel sad and upset myself.

2043
01:41:34,182 --> 01:41:38,451
So far, he's been so cold-hearted and frigid.

2044
01:41:38,821 --> 01:41:41,222
But seeing him cry all of a sudden...

2045
01:41:42,052 --> 01:41:45,191
I had this thought that Gyu Min must've really held himself back.

2046
01:41:45,191 --> 01:41:47,292
- Right. I thought so too. - He held himself back so much.

2047
01:41:47,292 --> 01:41:48,832
But I think it all exploded at once.

2048
01:41:49,531 --> 01:41:52,561
We saw videos of these two when they went to Laos.

2049
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:54,802
And watching them since the first episode...

2050
01:41:55,472 --> 01:41:57,372
makes it feel like they're not strangers.

2051
01:41:57,472 --> 01:42:01,571
That could be just what he felt throughout the day,

2052
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:04,342
or it could be about missing the past.

2053
01:42:04,342 --> 01:42:05,512
Yes, that could be.

2054
01:42:05,512 --> 01:42:08,451
It could've been emotions of longing in that moment.

2055
01:42:08,451 --> 01:42:10,521
It might not be lasting emotions.

2056
01:42:10,521 --> 01:42:13,691
He might be crying because he realizes they're really over.

2057
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:15,752
- Right. - It's the last date with the exes.

2058
01:42:15,752 --> 01:42:18,292
- The last date with the exes. - It's his last date with his ex.

2059
01:42:23,502 --> 01:42:24,601

I'm sure he chose Ji Yeon.

- Why are you smiling? - Tae I with the glass.

2219

Bring it down a bit more to make it perfect.

2220
01:50:44,661 --> 01:50:46,901
Can't you smile once? Do the pose.

2221
01:50:48,101 --> 01:50:49,101
A bit farther.

2222
01:50:57,582 --> 01:50:59,682
At first, I thought you were...

2223
01:50:59,682 --> 01:51:01,651
someone who had no ambitions in life.

2224
01:51:05,052 --> 01:51:06,052
Why?

2225
01:51:06,052 --> 01:51:07,722
Just by your looks. It was my misconception.

2226
01:51:07,722 --> 01:51:08,792
From my looks?

2227
01:51:10,861 --> 01:51:11,892
I mean...

2228
01:51:12,521 --> 01:51:13,731
It was a misconception.

2229
01:51:14,892 --> 01:51:16,762
When we talked on the rooftop?

2230
01:51:16,762 --> 01:51:19,061
Well, yes. I did feel that back then.

2231
01:51:19,061 --> 01:51:21,432
And a little bit on the second day too.

2232
01:51:21,432 --> 01:51:23,231
But on the third day, I had so much fun.

2233
01:51:23,231 --> 01:51:24,271
Forget it.

2234

- The rabbit? - Yes.

2238
01:51:40,082 --> 01:51:41,351
It's Judy and Nick, right?

2239
01:51:41,922 --> 01:51:43,252
Nick? Yes, it's Nick.

2240
01:51:43,252 --> 01:51:46,521
Yes. Nick. And then there's the civil servant.

No.

the most depth.

- Are you finished? - Yes.

- No. - You're not sad?

I am sad.

No. Let's just go back late.

She was so happy instantly when I suggested we go to the ocean.

2276
01:53:44,082 --> 01:53:47,981
I thought we could talk with no inhibitions.

2277
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:49,311
That's why I suggested it.

2278
01:53:50,722 --> 01:53:51,821
The smell of the ocean.

2279
01:53:53,582 --> 01:53:54,991
- Do you see the ocean? - Yes.

2280

- Sit down. - Here?

2281

- Yes. - Okay.

2282
01:54:05,262 --> 01:54:06,262
So...

2283
01:54:08,932 --> 01:54:11,101
- What? - Isn't it...

2284
01:54:13,002 --> 01:54:15,271
more fun here than the caravan?

2285
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:17,382
Of course this is more fun.

2286
01:54:17,781 --> 01:54:19,682
I asked you because I knew you'd think that.

2287
01:54:20,082 --> 01:54:21,411
Gosh, seriously.

2288
01:54:21,781 --> 01:54:23,252
Do you have anything you want to ask me?

2289
01:54:23,252 --> 01:54:24,552
When we played Truth or Dare yesterday,

2290
01:54:24,552 --> 01:54:26,382
it felt like you weren't even there.

2291
01:54:28,122 --> 01:54:32,262
I want to know why you only chose me.

2292
01:54:33,191 --> 01:54:35,661
You're curious why I only chose you?

2293
01:54:38,302 --> 01:54:42,031
You chose me after only hearing my voice.

2294
01:54:43,901 --> 01:54:45,872
I chose you based on our conversation.

2295
01:54:46,441 --> 01:54:49,741
I would've chosen you based on our conversation,

2296
01:54:50,071 --> 01:54:52,712
and I would've done the same if it was based on seeing you...

2297
01:54:52,712 --> 01:54:53,882
and knowing your vibe.

2298
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:57,281
- Why? - Just because.

2299
01:55:00,521 --> 01:55:04,491
So I did tufting without eating a single meal.

2300
01:55:04,491 --> 01:55:06,821
But you left me and went to eat steak?

2301
01:55:06,922 --> 01:55:09,132
But I sent you the text.

2302
01:55:12,231 --> 01:55:13,502
I think it was a good idea we went to see the ocean.

2303
01:55:13,502 --> 01:55:17,872
Of course, we got to refresh ourselves as we looked at the ocean.

2304
01:55:17,872 --> 01:55:20,241
But what we talked about allowed us to...

2305
01:55:20,241 --> 01:55:22,411
confirm our feelings for each other.

01:58:39,941 --> 01:58:41,911
for every question...

2378
01:58:43,512 --> 01:58:44,811
without hesitation.

2379
01:58:44,842 --> 01:58:47,582
- I was just... - But...

2380
01:58:47,582 --> 01:58:49,082
that's you.

2381
01:58:50,151 --> 01:58:53,521
That's what's attractive about you. You're honest.

2382
01:58:53,521 --> 01:58:58,161
Looking back, I was too honest during Truth or Dare.

2383
01:58:59,122 --> 01:59:02,031
Seven years is a long time.

2384
01:59:02,392 --> 01:59:03,892
I knew it already.

2385
01:59:04,661 --> 01:59:05,861
Knew what?

2386
01:59:06,231 --> 01:59:09,771
I knew that Gyu Min would mean more to you.

2387
01:59:10,972 --> 01:59:13,241
That's natural. It would be weirder if he didn't.

2388
01:59:15,142 --> 01:59:18,611
But actually hearing you say it...

2389
01:59:18,611 --> 01:59:19,741
made me sad.

2390
01:59:19,741 --> 01:59:23,111
I felt bad saying it...

2391
01:59:23,552 --> 01:59:24,951
when you were right there.

2392
01:59:25,622 --> 01:59:26,922
That's what's attractive about you.

2393
01:59:26,922 --> 01:59:29,151
Looking back, I regretted it so much...

2394
01:59:29,151 --> 01:59:31,991
It's okay. You can't lie during Truth or Dare.

2395
01:59:31,991 --> 01:59:34,892
because you were so kind to me...

2396
01:59:34,892 --> 01:59:38,101
and helped me a lot during this short time.

2397
01:59:38,462 --> 01:59:40,101
Three days? Four days?

2398
01:59:40,632 --> 01:59:44,342
I only asked Gyu Min questions...

2399
01:59:44,872 --> 01:59:48,472
when you were right next to me.

2400
01:59:48,642 --> 01:59:49,642
It's okay.

2401
01:59:49,642 --> 01:59:52,481
I thought that I'd spend my whole time here being sad.

2402
01:59:52,582 --> 01:59:54,651
When you chose me for the first time,

2403
01:59:55,182 --> 01:59:57,682
I wondered whether the producers...

2404
01:59:57,682 --> 02:00:00,052
told you to do so...

2405
02:00:01,052 --> 02:00:02,552
because they felt bad for me.

2406
02:00:03,552 --> 02:00:05,821
(Hyun Gyu's first day)

2407
02:00:05,821 --> 02:00:07,731
(My name is Sung Hae Eun.)

2408
02:00:07,731 --> 02:00:10,632
(Pick someone you'd like to go on a date with tomorrow.)

2409
02:00:10,632 --> 02:00:12,002
(Even if you don't know their name...)

2410
02:00:12,002 --> 02:00:15,101
(One particular name comes to mind.)

2411
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:17,472
(Hae Eun.)

2412
02:00:17,502 --> 02:00:19,201
Hae Eun.

2413
02:00:20,542 --> 02:00:22,111
(See you tomorrow, Hae Eun.)

2414
02:00:23,872 --> 02:00:25,642
- Gosh. - Oh, my goodness.

2415
02:00:27,651 --> 02:00:29,382
(Hae Eun. Let's drink together.)

2416
02:00:29,382 --> 02:00:31,052
(Oh, okay.)

2417
02:00:34,092 --> 02:00:36,922
I thought they might've told you that there's one person...

2418
02:00:37,292 --> 02:00:38,561
who keeps crying.

2419
02:00:39,392 --> 02:00:40,462
Hae Eun.

2420
02:00:40,462 --> 02:00:41,491
Seaweed.

2421
02:00:44,502 --> 02:00:46,661
That's so funny. "Hae Eun."

2422
02:00:46,661 --> 02:00:47,731
- "Seaweed." - "Seaweed."

2423
02:00:49,101 --> 02:00:50,172
Hae Eun.

2424
02:00:50,172 --> 02:00:51,241
Seaweed.

2425
02:00:51,241 --> 02:00:53,642
Hey, come on. Why did you have to see that?

2426
02:00:53,642 --> 02:00:55,071
Don't give me seaweed anymore.

2427
02:00:57,811 --> 02:01:00,082
Don't give me seaweed, okay?

2428
02:01:00,512 --> 02:01:03,552
Don't give me seaweed.

2429
02:01:06,481 --> 02:01:08,521
Your timing was great. It felt like destiny.

2430
02:01:08,722 --> 02:01:10,962
You came when I was struggling the most.

2431
02:01:11,061 --> 02:01:13,821
When you came, it felt like destiny.

2432
02:01:15,061 --> 02:01:17,832
So why were you only looking...

2433
02:01:19,401 --> 02:01:21,101
at Gyu Min yesterday?

2434
02:01:21,872 --> 02:01:23,601
Was I really like that?

2435
02:01:23,632 --> 02:01:26,802
It was Truth or Dare, and I hadn't had much time to talk to him.

2436
02:01:26,802 --> 02:01:29,271
- How can I eat right now? - Go ahead.

2437
02:01:29,441 --> 02:01:32,111
- I had talked to you the whole day. - I understand.

2438
02:01:32,111 --> 02:01:33,682
- I hadn't had time... - It just made me sad, that's all.

2439
02:01:33,682 --> 02:01:36,012
- to talk to Gyu Min. - I know.

2440
02:01:36,012 --> 02:01:37,212
I was just sad, that's all.

2441
02:01:37,212 --> 02:01:38,682
You want me to stop?

2442
02:01:38,682 --> 02:01:40,182
I knew how you felt.

2443
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:43,851
Actually seeing that was hard.

2444
02:01:44,052 --> 02:01:45,392
- That's all. - It's not like that.

2445
02:01:45,392 --> 02:01:46,922
I'm just whining a little.

2446
02:01:47,932 --> 02:01:50,691
You're not whining. Not at all.

2447
02:01:50,802 --> 02:01:52,861
I just wanted to talk to him, that's all.

2448
02:01:54,502 --> 02:01:56,771
- The food's tasty. - That's good.

2449
02:01:58,302 --> 02:02:00,502
Don't you regret only going on a date with me in Jeju?

2450
02:02:02,741 --> 02:02:04,642
Ji Yeon also said this before,

2451
02:02:05,082 --> 02:02:06,911
but I can get close to other people while drinking.

2452
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:08,981
You were the only one I wanted to go on a date with.

2453
02:02:08,981 --> 02:02:10,411
- Really? - Really.

2454
02:02:12,021 --> 02:02:13,781
If I want to get to know someone better,

2455
02:02:13,781 --> 02:02:15,092
I can just have some drinks with them.

2456
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:18,462
If you could go on a date...

2457
02:02:18,462 --> 02:02:20,491
with one other person...

2458
02:02:20,491 --> 02:02:23,031
If I could go on a date with one other person?

2459
02:02:25,332 --> 02:02:27,132
That was today, and I picked you.

2460
02:02:29,101 --> 02:02:30,472
What about after today?

2461
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:32,802
- It's still going to be you. - Really?

2462
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:35,672
It's my choice. I get to choose who I want.

2463
02:02:35,672 --> 02:02:37,441
You're right. That's true.

2464
02:02:37,441 --> 02:02:39,811
But still. You're new here.

2465
02:02:39,882 --> 02:02:42,252
I would totally understand if you wanted to do so.

2466
02:02:42,252 --> 02:02:43,981
That's why I asked.

2467
02:02:44,151 --> 02:02:45,682
I do what I want.

2468
02:02:46,052 --> 02:02:49,021
You could go on a date with someone else if you want.

2469
02:02:49,021 --> 02:02:50,092
Exactly.

2470
02:02:50,092 --> 02:02:51,762
I'll do what I want.

2471
02:02:51,762 --> 02:02:52,991
That's why I'm going to pick you.

2472
02:02:55,962 --> 02:02:59,262
Seeing you like this is what moved my heart.

2473
02:02:59,762 --> 02:03:03,731
I didn't think my feelings would change very easily.

2474
02:03:04,771 --> 02:03:08,811
You cheer me up so much.

2475
02:03:09,241 --> 02:03:10,741
This is what I think.

2476
02:03:11,082 --> 02:03:13,342
If I was able to brighten up...

2477
02:03:13,611 --> 02:03:16,212
someone's life, even just a little,

2478
02:03:18,021 --> 02:03:20,321
I think that was time well spent.

2479
02:03:24,691 --> 02:03:25,962
Don't cry.

2480
02:03:28,632 --> 02:03:29,932
How did you two break up?

2481
02:03:31,861 --> 02:03:33,932
Were you ready to break up?

2482
02:03:35,372 --> 02:03:36,372
I was.

2483
02:03:36,372 --> 02:03:39,002
He was so cold for a while.

2484
02:03:39,302 --> 02:03:41,542
He was so cold to me,

2485
02:03:42,372 --> 02:03:44,382
so I was getting myself ready.

2486
02:03:44,382 --> 02:03:45,842
I was okay after we broke up.

2487
02:03:45,842 --> 02:03:47,342
It was harder when we were together...

2488
02:03:47,342 --> 02:03:48,951
because he was so cold to me.

2489
02:03:49,512 --> 02:03:51,351
I should've been more mature,

2490
02:03:51,882 --> 02:03:55,552
more trustworthy, more helpful,

2491
02:03:55,851 --> 02:03:59,061
and more supportive of his work,

2492
02:03:59,061 --> 02:04:01,161
but I was always whining like a kid.

2493
02:04:01,161 --> 02:04:02,262
But Hae Eun.

2494
02:04:02,691 --> 02:04:05,502
You didn't have to do anything more.

2495
02:04:05,762 --> 02:04:08,302
- I think I should've. - I'm not sure about that.

2496
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:13,802
People break up because they don't love each other. That's all.

2497
02:04:14,611 --> 02:04:17,071
That's true. It wasn't one-sided.

2498
02:04:17,712 --> 02:04:19,082
- I already knew it. - Exactly.

2499
02:04:19,082 --> 02:04:20,311
It's not your fault.

2500
02:04:20,712 --> 02:04:23,651
It wasn't because you weren't good enough.

2501
02:04:25,781 --> 02:04:27,691
That thought must've made you regret more.

2502
02:04:31,392 --> 02:04:32,762
Oh, gosh.

2503
02:04:32,762 --> 02:04:34,991
- I'm getting tipsy. - Na Eon did tell me...

2504
02:04:35,231 --> 02:04:39,832
that you respect someone just as they are.

2505
02:04:40,132 --> 02:04:44,271
She said that you were the type of person I needed right now.

2506
02:04:46,302 --> 02:04:48,611
It's all up to you.

2507
02:04:50,741 --> 02:04:53,611
I don't resent Gyu Min,

2508
02:04:54,351 --> 02:04:56,552
but from what Na Eon says,

2509
02:04:56,682 --> 02:04:58,781
Hyun Gyu is the type of person...

2510
02:04:58,781 --> 02:05:00,722
who trusts you...

2511
02:05:00,722 --> 02:05:03,592
no matter what you do.

2512
02:05:03,722 --> 02:05:06,861
That's what Na Eon told me.

2513
02:05:07,122 --> 02:05:09,561
It made me think...

2514
02:05:09,832 --> 02:05:12,031
that things would be different...

2515
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:13,361
with Hyun Gyu.

2516
02:05:14,731 --> 02:05:15,832
Come here.

2517
02:05:20,701 --> 02:05:21,911
Why are you sighing?

2518
02:05:22,111 --> 02:05:23,672
I did drink quite quickly.

2519
02:05:23,811 --> 02:05:25,311
Why did you do that?

2520
02:05:26,082 --> 02:05:27,542
I wanted to drink.

2521
02:05:28,552 --> 02:05:29,651
You're warm.

2522
02:05:30,512 --> 02:05:31,722
My face?

2523
02:05:31,722 --> 02:05:33,851
I know. It's bad.

2524
02:05:34,491 --> 02:05:36,052
- What is this? - My gosh.

2525
02:05:36,592 --> 02:05:37,821
He doesn't hold back.

2526
02:05:39,092 --> 02:05:40,722
What are they doing?

2527
02:05:41,991 --> 02:05:43,561
I want to be Hae Eun.

2528
02:05:43,861 --> 02:05:45,031
I want to be Hyun Gyu's Hae Eun.

2529
02:05:45,401 --> 02:05:47,031
- What? - That's so funny.

2530
02:05:47,302 --> 02:05:49,271
That "Come here." Oh, my gosh.

2531
02:05:50,571 --> 02:05:53,002
Please show us the "Come here." part one more time.

2532
02:05:53,342 --> 02:05:54,512
Come here.

2533
02:05:59,182 --> 02:06:00,342
Why are you sighing?

2534
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:02,252
I did drink quite quickly.

2535
02:06:02,411 --> 02:06:03,811
Why did you do that?

2536
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:06,021
I wanted to drink.

You're warm.

I know. It's bad.

2540

It's so hot.

2541
02:06:17,432 --> 02:06:18,601
Nice.

Who is most hung up over their ex?

You.

2544
02:06:26,271 --> 02:06:27,972
I really couldn't help it.

2545
02:06:27,972 --> 02:06:30,212
- You haven't even been here... - Ouch.

2546

Nobody was really interested in me.

I was just hurting because of Gyu Min.

That's...

2550
02:06:37,851 --> 02:06:40,222
because you were only interested in Gyu Min.

2551
02:06:40,451 --> 02:06:42,191
- I couldn't help it. - Who would try?

2552
02:06:42,422 --> 02:06:44,321
- I couldn't help it. - Oh, that hurts.

2553
02:06:44,991 --> 02:06:46,521
You're right. I wasn't very approachable...

2554
02:06:46,521 --> 02:06:48,691
- because I kept crying over him. - Exactly.

- What? - Why are you sighing?

2558

I just want you to be happy.

I'm happy.

Your ex means too much to you.

2561
02:07:06,342 --> 02:07:07,542
I understand.

2562
02:07:08,012 --> 02:07:10,582
Actually seeing it is hard, though.

2563
02:07:13,321 --> 02:07:14,552
I just felt bad for you.

- How was it? - How was what?

2565
02:07:21,462 --> 02:07:22,592
The three weeks here.

2566
02:07:22,592 --> 02:07:23,792
The three weeks here?

2567
02:07:24,701 --> 02:07:26,201
I think I've ever been...

2568
02:07:27,302 --> 02:07:29,132
so emotional before.

2569

That makes sense.

When did you feel the best?

I got it.

You know my answer already.

2577
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:48,651
You told me with your eyes.

2578
02:07:49,321 --> 02:07:50,451
You saw?

2579
02:07:52,292 --> 02:07:53,462
I'm happy...

2580

as long as I was able to make you happy.

2581

I want you to be happy.

2582

I'll try my best.

2583
02:08:10,212 --> 02:08:12,082
One thing I'm sure about is that you made me happy.

2584
02:08:13,142 --> 02:08:14,951
I want you to know that.

2585

You made me happy, and you're making me happy now.

2586
02:08:18,082 --> 02:08:20,752
- I want you to know that. - Okay.

2587
02:08:21,722 --> 02:08:22,951
Can you tell?

2588
02:08:23,191 --> 02:08:24,722
I can if you tell me so.

2589
02:08:24,722 --> 02:08:26,262
That's why I just told you so.

2590
02:08:27,361 --> 02:08:28,491
Tell me more often.

2591

- More? - Yes.

2592

- You need me to tell you more? - Yes.

Really? I thought this was enough.

2594
02:08:37,372 --> 02:08:38,642
Don't you regret anything?

2595
02:08:38,642 --> 02:08:42,172
You picked me from your first impression of me,

2596
02:08:42,172 --> 02:08:44,342
- I did. - and it turned out...

2597
02:08:44,342 --> 02:08:47,212
that I was the most hung up over my ex.

2598
02:08:47,382 --> 02:08:49,052
- Do you regret picking me? - No, I don't.

2599
02:08:49,611 --> 02:08:50,781
Do you think I would?

2600
02:08:51,351 --> 02:08:52,521
To be honest, no,

2601
02:08:52,521 --> 02:08:53,851
but I just felt bad.

2602
02:08:54,592 --> 02:08:56,321
- Didn't you do it all? - Do what?

2603
02:08:56,351 --> 02:08:57,491
Everything you wanted to do.

2604
02:08:57,722 --> 02:09:00,262
You're right. I did!

2605
02:09:00,622 --> 02:09:02,892
We went to a cafe, drank the ocean,

2606
02:09:03,292 --> 02:09:04,901
had some drinks, and ate some sashimi.

2607
02:09:04,901 --> 02:09:06,231
We also went to the beach at night.

2608
02:09:06,701 --> 02:09:08,901
- We did it all. - We had a walk on the beach.

That's good.

I did everything I wanted to do with you.

Doing these things with you made everything even more fun.

Thank you for saying that.

2613
02:09:17,441 --> 02:09:19,981
I'm not just saying so. You know that, right?

2614
02:09:20,611 --> 02:09:23,682
I hope Jeju Island reminds you of me.

You're good.

why you two broke up or how...

2621
02:09:41,972 --> 02:09:43,571
or how your relationship was,

2622
02:09:46,002 --> 02:09:48,411
but I want you to think of what's best for you...

going forward.

2624

Don't put your ex in the center of your life.

2625

You're the most important,

so care about yourself more.

So let's do everything we want to today.

when we drank soju together.

2696
02:13:11,342 --> 02:13:12,542
I drank quickly that day.

2697
02:13:12,642 --> 02:13:15,151
I can't exactly remember what happened.

2698
02:13:15,252 --> 02:13:17,012
I looked back...

2699
02:13:17,012 --> 02:13:20,651
on all of our pictures, videos, and texts yesterday.

2700
02:13:20,752 --> 02:13:23,052
It felt like such a long time ago. It made my heart race.

2701
02:13:23,821 --> 02:13:27,092
"Don't drink too much today. It was hard picking up the jellies."

2702
02:13:27,092 --> 02:13:28,161
And my message said,

2703
02:13:28,161 --> 02:13:29,892
"I'm happy that you came back today."

2704
02:13:30,092 --> 02:13:31,802
"Help me with my griptok."

2705
02:13:33,262 --> 02:13:35,231
- Do you remember? - Of course.

(Last night)

2707

(There's a picture from their first date saved on her phone.)

2709
02:13:48,651 --> 02:13:50,151
I feel so awkward.

2710
02:13:50,712 --> 02:13:51,882
You look very natural.

2711
02:13:53,321 --> 02:13:57,651
(Their awkward first date)

2712

- You look very natural. - Really?

2713
02:14:00,962 --> 02:14:02,962
I don't think so. That's enough.

2714
02:14:04,832 --> 02:14:06,302
My hair...

2715
02:14:06,401 --> 02:14:08,002
- Do you want me to hold it? - keeps getting in the way.

2716
02:14:08,002 --> 02:14:10,601
Please hold my hair like this.

2717
02:14:11,302 --> 02:14:12,472
How pretty.

2718
02:14:12,972 --> 02:14:14,342
- I got it. - You got it?

2719
02:14:15,672 --> 02:14:17,571
- Haribo? - I love it.

(Gyu Min gave Na Yeon a griptok.)

2721

- Let's get one of these. - It's so cute.

02:14:21,142 --> 02:14:23,382
- Did you put the griptok on? - Oh, could you do it for me?

2723
02:14:23,882 --> 02:14:24,981
A little bit lower.

2724

- I'll put it right here. - I trust you.

I don't know.

Since we're drunk, tell me how much your feelings for me have grown.

(He used being drunk as an excuse to express his feelings.)

2729
02:14:37,432 --> 02:14:40,262
That took a lot of courage for me to say that.

2730
02:14:40,401 --> 02:14:41,672
- Really? - Really.

2731
02:14:42,601 --> 02:14:44,571
- I had no idea. - I see.

2732
02:14:44,802 --> 02:14:46,472
- But I... - I still have the flower ring.

2733
02:14:46,741 --> 02:14:47,941
Why do you have that there?

2734
02:14:47,941 --> 02:14:50,472
- Mine's on my vanity. - Exactly.

2735
02:14:50,712 --> 02:14:52,012
I always have it with me.

2736
02:14:52,012 --> 02:14:54,481
Oh, right. Also, I brought this.

2737
02:14:54,611 --> 02:14:57,182
We didn't get to say goodbye to our flower vase.

2738
02:14:57,682 --> 02:14:58,851
That's true.

2739
02:14:58,851 --> 02:15:01,552
- I have the note that we put on it. - The note?

(Na Yeon and Gyu Min's second date)

(As Na Yeon was packing her bags,)

(she kept the note that was on the flower vase.)

2744
02:15:19,642 --> 02:15:21,342
Could I grab my shoes?

2745
02:15:21,642 --> 02:15:22,712
I'll give it to you.

2746
02:15:23,542 --> 02:15:25,382
You're good at driving.

2747
02:15:25,481 --> 02:15:27,342
Driving? I'm not bad.

2748
02:15:27,441 --> 02:15:29,052
You're really good.

2749
02:15:29,252 --> 02:15:32,082
- Me? I'm good at using the GPS. - I definitely thought so.

2750
02:15:32,651 --> 02:15:35,122
It's hard to follow the GPS while talking to someone.

2751
02:15:35,321 --> 02:15:37,851
- You noticed. - Of course.

2752
02:15:37,851 --> 02:15:39,122
That makes me feel better.

2753
02:15:39,491 --> 02:15:41,731
- This makes you feel better? - It does.

2754
02:15:42,262 --> 02:15:44,262
I can't help but compare.

2755

You're different from my ex.

2756

Even today...

(Today's date with ex)

2758

- Is this right? - Let's see.

2759
02:15:55,941 --> 02:15:57,512
- Is it right? - Yes.

2760
02:16:00,212 --> 02:16:01,281
I don't think so.

2761
02:16:02,781 --> 02:16:05,382
You... Never mind. I should do it.

2762

(Date on the way to Jeju Island)

2763
02:16:11,321 --> 02:16:14,491
- You have to tell me now. - Left turn. Now.

2764
02:16:14,962 --> 02:16:17,361
- Here? - I told you to turn left.

2765
02:16:22,432 --> 02:16:24,672
Assistant. Should I turn right or go straight?

2766
02:16:25,172 --> 02:16:26,502
- Go straight. - Go straight?

2767
02:16:26,502 --> 02:16:27,601
Yes. We have to follow the pink line.

2768
02:16:28,741 --> 02:16:31,111
- It's nice to have you help me. - Right?

2769
02:16:32,312 --> 02:16:35,451
You're right. I'm so good at following the GPS.

2770
02:16:35,451 --> 02:16:36,781
I totally agree.

2771
02:16:36,781 --> 02:16:38,111
- I've never seen... - Right?

2772
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:39,451
someone who was so good at this.

2773
02:16:40,152 --> 02:16:42,552
I always thought I was bad at it...

2774
02:16:43,222 --> 02:16:45,062
until you told me otherwise.

2775
02:16:45,091 --> 02:16:46,921
I really don't think so.

2776
02:16:47,021 --> 02:16:48,892
I've never driven with someone...

2777
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:51,562
who was so good at following the GPS.

2778
02:16:51,562 --> 02:16:54,431
- Really? I'm really good at it. - Seriously.

2779
02:16:55,531 --> 02:16:57,701
I cried a lot while dating Hee Doo.

2780
02:16:57,802 --> 02:16:58,841
You cried a lot?

2781
02:16:58,841 --> 02:17:01,372
I did. I'm never enough...

2782
02:17:03,072 --> 02:17:04,572
for Hee Doo.

2783
02:17:05,341 --> 02:17:08,712
You made me feel so much better.

2784
02:17:08,812 --> 02:17:11,822
I almost cried while we were eating shrimp.

2785
02:17:11,822 --> 02:17:14,322
You said the perfect thing...

2786
02:17:14,322 --> 02:17:16,591
to make me feel better.

2787
02:17:18,662 --> 02:17:21,962
I was depressed, but seeing you made me happy.

2788
02:17:22,831 --> 02:17:26,062
Today is the same case. I always end up seeing you...

2789
02:17:26,062 --> 02:17:27,201
when I'm sad and depressed.

2790
02:17:27,302 --> 02:17:29,331
Today was also very hard...

2791
02:17:29,601 --> 02:17:31,841
for me as well.

2792
02:17:32,372 --> 02:17:34,271
Seeing you and drinking with you...

2793
02:17:34,372 --> 02:17:36,011
- cheered me up. - Right?

2794
02:17:37,542 --> 02:17:38,611
Seriously.

2795
02:17:40,681 --> 02:17:43,011
I don't have to tell him what I'm thinking. He always knows.

2796
02:17:43,111 --> 02:17:45,251
He always makes me feel better.

2797
02:17:45,982 --> 02:17:48,021
That's what makes me have feelings for him.

2798
02:17:48,722 --> 02:17:52,421
He's a really good person for me.

2799
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:53,622
He's on my side.

2800
02:17:54,322 --> 02:17:56,462
He seems like he would understand and accept...

2801
02:17:56,462 --> 02:17:57,861
whatever I do.

2802
02:17:57,962 --> 02:18:00,361
My heart feels so warm when I'm with him.

2803
02:18:00,861 --> 02:18:02,431
That's what made it hard.

2804
02:18:03,601 --> 02:18:05,441
We have to make our final decision tomorrow.

2805
02:18:05,542 --> 02:18:07,872
I wish we had a few more days,

2806
02:18:07,972 --> 02:18:10,941
but at the same time, I felt so sure...

2807
02:18:11,742 --> 02:18:13,681
that I wanted to choose Gyu Min.

2808
02:18:14,941 --> 02:18:16,681
It was hard.

2809
02:18:16,781 --> 02:18:18,882
"Is this okay? Am I making the right choice?"

2810
02:18:18,882 --> 02:18:20,281
"Do we really have to make our decision tomorrow?"

2811
02:18:20,882 --> 02:18:22,921
"What if this isn't the right choice?"

2812
02:18:23,851 --> 02:18:24,951
I was so confused.

2813
02:18:24,951 --> 02:18:26,191
(Na Yeon became confused.)

2814
02:18:26,662 --> 02:18:30,091
I like how I am when I'm with Na Yeon...

2815
02:18:30,091 --> 02:18:32,601
more than how I am with Hae Eun.

2816
02:18:33,132 --> 02:18:35,902
I feel like we can talk better.

2817
02:18:36,601 --> 02:18:41,542
That's why I like how I am when I'm with Na Yeon.

2818
02:18:42,271 --> 02:18:43,341
I can see what he means.

2819
02:18:43,341 --> 02:18:45,341
He seems more childish with Hae Eun,

2820
02:18:45,341 --> 02:18:46,712
but he's more mature with Na Yeon.

2821
02:18:46,712 --> 02:18:51,011
I feel like he seems young when he's with Hae Eun...

2822
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:52,081
since they used to date when they were young.

2823
02:18:52,081 --> 02:18:53,652
When these two are together,

2824
02:18:53,751 --> 02:18:55,691
they seem...

2825
02:18:55,691 --> 02:18:58,052
- like their age. - Exactly.

2826
02:18:58,052 --> 02:19:00,892
That's why I say it's scary to grow older.

2827
02:19:00,892 --> 02:19:03,091
- Your personality changes. - Exactly.

2828
02:19:03,331 --> 02:19:06,101
Maybe it's because they're the same age.

2829
02:19:06,101 --> 02:19:08,531
There are times...

2830
02:19:08,531 --> 02:19:11,941
when you really like the way you are...

2831
02:19:12,101 --> 02:19:14,601
- when you're with someone. - Right.

2832
02:19:14,601 --> 02:19:17,372
- It's important. - I can feel that from him.

2833
02:19:17,372 --> 02:19:18,611
He seems very different.

2834
02:19:18,611 --> 02:19:21,042
It must be very different. He dated Hae Eun when he was a baby.

2835
02:19:21,042 --> 02:19:22,281
- He was only 21 years old. - He was 21.

2836
02:19:22,281 --> 02:19:24,681
They just had a date that was similar to back then.

2837
02:19:24,681 --> 02:19:27,021
Exactly. They seemed to be having fun,

2838
02:19:27,281 --> 02:19:30,322
but Gyu Min seems mature when he's with Na Yeon.

2852
02:20:42,492 --> 02:20:43,831
We can choose.

2853
02:20:44,191 --> 02:20:46,732
We can choose? That's what we have to do tomorrow.

2854
02:20:49,601 --> 02:20:50,601
That's hilarious.

2855
02:20:52,972 --> 02:20:56,212
I didn't know that we'd have this kind of time today.

2856
02:20:56,542 --> 02:20:58,111
How did this happen?

2857
02:20:58,542 --> 02:21:01,081
Exactly. Do you know what I wrote?

2858
02:21:02,681 --> 02:21:04,451
"Your date with your ex is over."

2859
02:21:05,552 --> 02:21:09,222
"Hee Doo..." That's what I wrote.

2860
02:21:11,962 --> 02:21:13,261
Why did you pick me?

2861
02:21:14,921 --> 02:21:17,531
I wanted to see you one last time.

2862
02:21:18,162 --> 02:21:20,361
We didn't get a chance to talk.

2863
02:21:20,361 --> 02:21:21,501
Right.

2864
02:21:22,372 --> 02:21:25,031
You're going to be burned at the stake...

2865
02:21:25,302 --> 02:21:27,201
if you don't say everything today.

2866
02:21:27,802 --> 02:21:29,542
- Right away. - We should prepare some water.

2867
02:21:31,511 --> 02:21:32,642
Cheers.

2868
02:21:36,081 --> 02:21:37,181
Do I look swollen?

2869
02:21:38,152 --> 02:21:40,281
I look better today, right? No?

2870
02:21:40,722 --> 02:21:43,992
It's hard to tell if you see someone every day. You know what I mean?

2871
02:21:43,992 --> 02:21:45,562
You looked almost too comfortable...

2872
02:21:46,521 --> 02:21:48,292
on the first day.

2873
02:21:48,562 --> 02:21:51,132
You had glasses on and your hood over your head.

2874
02:21:51,331 --> 02:21:53,462
Honestly, I don't remember your face from that day.

2875
02:21:54,101 --> 02:21:57,732
How do I put it? I was like, "Who is this girl?"

2876
02:21:59,841 --> 02:22:02,072
(Hee Doo's first day)

2877
02:22:02,072 --> 02:22:04,072
We do clean,

2878
02:22:04,611 --> 02:22:06,511
but it's different each time.

2879
02:22:06,742 --> 02:22:09,511
(An awkward first hello)

2880
02:22:10,212 --> 02:22:12,421
(My name is Nam Hee Doo.)

2881
02:22:12,421 --> 02:22:14,251
(I'm on the national ice hockey team.)

2882
02:22:14,622 --> 02:22:17,492
(That's fascinating.)

2883
02:22:17,591 --> 02:22:21,091
(I was born in 2001. I'm 22 years old.)

2884
02:22:21,162 --> 02:22:22,691
You're so young!

2885
02:22:22,761 --> 02:22:25,601
(Hee Doo was curious about the character in the hood.)

2886
02:22:26,162 --> 02:22:27,601
Tell me more.

2887
02:22:27,601 --> 02:22:29,472
You really looked like a cartoon character.

2888
02:22:29,472 --> 02:22:31,232
I'm thinking of a particular one.

2889
02:22:32,101 --> 02:22:34,171
Why are you only telling me this now?

2890
02:22:35,912 --> 02:22:38,271
I first saw your face...

2891
02:22:39,212 --> 02:22:41,042
- when you had your interview. - Right.

2892
02:22:41,042 --> 02:22:43,181
- That's when I first saw your face. - You told me...

2893
02:22:43,181 --> 02:22:46,921
that my hair was like a ponytail that a mom does for her kid.

2894
02:22:47,421 --> 02:22:48,851
Do you know the vacuum thing?

2895
02:22:54,292 --> 02:22:56,392
(Seeing Ji Yeon's face for the first time)

2896
02:22:57,462 --> 02:23:00,062
- Have you had dinner? - No, I haven't.

2897
02:23:00,601 --> 02:23:01,662
You should eat.

2898
02:23:02,072 --> 02:23:04,972
- I heard you were a good cook. - Me?

2899
02:23:04,972 --> 02:23:07,472
Everyone said you were really good at cooking.

2900
02:23:07,472 --> 02:23:08,501
Really?

2901
02:23:08,501 --> 02:23:10,841
When she smiled while listening to me talk...

2902
02:23:10,872 --> 02:23:13,212
You looked at me with such big, round eyes.

2903
02:23:13,212 --> 02:23:15,382
Like this.

2904
02:23:15,382 --> 02:23:16,982
- When did I do that? - You did.

2905
02:23:18,312 --> 02:23:20,152
You're right. You said so.

2906
02:23:20,521 --> 02:23:24,322
He remembered how I looked when we first met.

2907
02:23:24,892 --> 02:23:27,591
He even remembered what I was wearing...

2908
02:23:27,591 --> 02:23:29,962
and the glasses I wore.

2909
02:23:29,962 --> 02:23:32,562
He remembered every detail.

2910
02:23:32,562 --> 02:23:37,201
I got the feeling he adored me.

2911
02:23:37,331 --> 02:23:39,972
His feelings toward me were true.

2912
02:23:40,271 --> 02:23:42,511
I was happy, and I had a good time.

2913
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,611
You said you didn't eat. Eat up.

2914
02:23:46,781 --> 02:23:48,011
It's good.

2915
02:23:48,011 --> 02:23:49,281
Now that I think about it, I didn't do anything right.

2916
02:23:50,312 --> 02:23:52,421
- Do you eat asparagus? - Yes, it's good.

2917
02:23:52,521 --> 02:23:53,751
(Exclaiming)

2918
02:23:54,382 --> 02:23:55,851
I like garlic.

2919
02:23:55,951 --> 02:23:57,021
It's good.

2920
02:23:57,021 --> 02:23:58,622
- Grocery store. - Did you go?

2921
02:23:58,622 --> 02:23:59,822
You didn't?

2922
02:24:00,062 --> 02:24:01,521
Yellow...

2923
02:24:01,562 --> 02:24:03,031
- sweet potato. - Sweet potato.

2924
02:24:03,361 --> 02:24:04,892
Why am I repeating after you?

2925
02:24:08,701 --> 02:24:10,331
I'm usually not this funny.

2926
02:24:10,431 --> 02:24:13,341
You know how to make the other person laugh...

2927
02:24:13,402 --> 02:24:14,802
if that person is like you.

2928
02:24:14,802 --> 02:24:16,242
Yes!

2929
02:24:16,242 --> 02:24:18,142
That's why it's fun to be with you.

2930
02:24:18,142 --> 02:24:19,912
Same here.

2931
02:24:22,751 --> 02:24:24,181
Is there anything you want to say?

2932
02:24:25,921 --> 02:24:28,281
We're both very proud.

2933
02:24:30,722 --> 02:24:32,222
I never acted proud.

2934
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:34,792
I mean it.

2935
02:24:35,892 --> 02:24:39,062
Anyway, I'm going to open up today.

2936
02:24:39,062 --> 02:24:40,802
I'm going to be honest.

2937
02:24:40,802 --> 02:24:44,031
To be honest, I don't want to speak. I want to listen.

2938
02:24:44,302 --> 02:24:46,072
- Want to play Truth or Dare? - Yes.

2939
02:24:46,072 --> 02:24:48,501
I'm already playing.

2940
02:24:49,212 --> 02:24:52,812
Honestly, I did everything I wanted.

2941
02:24:53,212 --> 02:24:56,611
I texted Na Yeon first about Jeju Island,

2942
02:24:56,681 --> 02:24:58,351
but I texted you how I felt.

2943
02:24:58,882 --> 02:25:01,152
It's not that I liked Na Yeon,

2944
02:25:01,281 --> 02:25:04,152
but it's rather I couldn't stop paying attention to her.

2945
02:25:04,652 --> 02:25:08,691
I tried to stop myself.

2946
02:25:09,292 --> 02:25:11,261
And I still am.

2947
02:25:12,302 --> 02:25:15,201
When I arrived on Jeju Island,

2948
02:25:15,361 --> 02:25:17,232
I couldn't face you all of a sudden.

2949
02:25:17,601 --> 02:25:18,902
That's understandable.

2950
02:25:19,201 --> 02:25:20,972
When I got off the car,

2951
02:25:20,972 --> 02:25:23,042
you were walking toward me with two other people, remember?

2952
02:25:23,142 --> 02:25:26,482
I suddenly started reading your face.

2953
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:28,412
To put it simply,

2954
02:25:29,251 --> 02:25:32,552
you were just...

2955
02:25:32,552 --> 02:25:34,122
- sullen. - Of course.

2956
02:25:34,122 --> 02:25:35,152
So...

2957
02:25:35,281 --> 02:25:37,222
I might be too greedy for saying this,

2958
02:25:37,222 --> 02:25:39,892
but you could've understood me.

2959
02:25:40,892 --> 02:25:42,492
That's what I was thinking.

2960
02:25:43,531 --> 02:25:45,492
I didn't avoid you.

2961
02:25:46,902 --> 02:25:49,171
You know that I'm obvious.

2962
02:25:49,171 --> 02:25:51,331
If I show my emotions just a tiny bit,

2963
02:25:51,572 --> 02:25:54,001
other people can see it right away.

2964
02:25:54,372 --> 02:25:57,712
You can't hide it. That's what I think.

2965
02:25:58,742 --> 02:26:00,912
I'm not good at hiding it either.

2966
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:06,021
I tried not to do that here.

2967
02:26:08,322 --> 02:26:09,622
Then it got me thinking,

2968
02:26:09,892 --> 02:26:12,562
my indecisiveness...

2969
02:26:12,562 --> 02:26:15,361
- could hurt you. - Yes.

2970
02:26:15,792 --> 02:26:17,591
I think I went overboard...

2971
02:26:17,591 --> 02:26:21,402
by the fact that you showed up with your ex.

2972
02:26:22,162 --> 02:26:24,671
Expressing my emotions...

2973
02:26:24,671 --> 02:26:26,802
when others feel uncomfortable...

2974
02:26:27,142 --> 02:26:30,341
makes me a mean and selfish person.

2975
02:26:30,412 --> 02:26:32,412
I could see that.

2976
02:26:32,712 --> 02:26:33,882
That's why I stopped you.

2977
02:26:35,982 --> 02:26:38,812
After I chose Hyun Gyu, I was depressed for a while.

2978
02:26:38,812 --> 02:26:39,882
Really.

2979
02:26:39,882 --> 02:26:41,882
- But that was your choice. - Exactly.

2980
02:26:42,322 --> 02:26:44,521
I was thoughtless...

2981
02:26:44,521 --> 02:26:46,062
at that moment.

2982
02:26:46,062 --> 02:26:47,222
Right.

2983
02:26:47,521 --> 02:26:49,931
- I regret it. - You do?

2984
02:27:05,111 --> 02:27:06,142
Shall we drink?

2985
02:27:14,351 --> 02:27:15,691
You...

2986
02:27:17,091 --> 02:27:20,162
You didn't have to do that.

2987
02:27:22,562 --> 02:27:23,632
I know.

2988
02:27:25,931 --> 02:27:28,662
It's in the past.

2989
02:27:28,802 --> 02:27:31,402
Are you sad that you couldn't spend time with me today?

2990
02:27:31,972 --> 02:27:33,802
Why don't we go home after 12 hours exactly?

2991
02:27:34,101 --> 02:27:35,601
At 10:23am.

2992
02:27:35,742 --> 02:27:37,912
- Make the final decision like this? - Yes.

2993
02:27:41,581 --> 02:27:44,851
To be honest, it's tough for me.

2994
02:27:46,021 --> 02:27:48,822
I never wanted to be in contemplation.

2995
02:27:50,052 --> 02:27:53,062
I just wanted to support each other...

2996
02:27:53,421 --> 02:27:54,861
and go on separate ways.

2997
02:27:57,132 --> 02:27:59,662
I don't know what to do.

2998
02:27:59,662 --> 02:28:01,632
Look. I've seen that...

2999
02:28:01,632 --> 02:28:04,271
you're mature enough...

3000
02:28:04,372 --> 02:28:06,171
to make the best choice for yourself.

3001
02:28:06,542 --> 02:28:08,472
And I support your decision.

3002
02:28:08,771 --> 02:28:10,671
By support,

3003
02:28:10,912 --> 02:28:12,511
will you support any decision?

3004
02:28:15,611 --> 02:28:16,751
Obviously...

3005
02:28:17,581 --> 02:28:19,052
I want you to choose me.

3006
02:28:20,751 --> 02:28:22,322
I have a lot on my mind.

3007
02:28:23,351 --> 02:28:25,021
Do what you want.

3008
02:28:27,591 --> 02:28:29,232
It's your call.

3009
02:28:30,492 --> 02:28:31,962
Do everything you want.

3010
02:28:32,261 --> 02:28:34,601
- And... - My goodness.

3011
02:28:34,601 --> 02:28:36,072
think again.

3012
02:28:36,632 --> 02:28:39,872
Who made you happy and who made you sad.

3013
02:28:41,271 --> 02:28:44,312
Why are you getting me these emotions?

3014
02:28:44,812 --> 02:28:48,712
She said she had feelings for me.

3015
02:28:49,042 --> 02:28:51,951
She was frank.

3016
02:28:52,312 --> 02:28:55,052
I got feelings for her too.

3017
02:28:55,351 --> 02:28:58,751
I started thinking...

3018
02:28:58,751 --> 02:29:00,361
if I'm ready to move on from Na Yeon and meet someone new.

3019
02:29:00,822 --> 02:29:01,892
I had a lot on my mind.

3020
02:29:03,892 --> 02:29:05,031
I'm off to the restroom.

3021
02:29:14,601 --> 02:29:15,642
It's annoying.

3022
02:29:35,021 --> 02:29:36,492
So, what are you thinking?

3023
02:29:42,701 --> 02:29:43,802
Why?

3024
02:29:44,232 --> 02:29:45,941
What's wrong?

3025
02:29:50,341 --> 02:29:51,941
Seriously.

3026
02:29:53,642 --> 02:29:55,712
It's so nice and cool!

3027
02:29:55,712 --> 02:29:56,812
(Woljeong-ri)

3028
02:29:59,222 --> 02:30:02,451
- I like the ocean. - So... Hee Doo.

3029
02:30:06,122 --> 02:30:07,222
Let's sing together.

3030
02:30:11,662 --> 02:30:12,831
Hey.

3031
02:30:12,831 --> 02:30:15,062
- The splashing sound. - Yes.

3032
02:30:15,062 --> 02:30:16,302
Was that really a mackerel pike?

3033
02:30:16,302 --> 02:30:18,331
- Halfpeak? - Halfbeak.

3034
02:30:18,331 --> 02:30:19,501
What? Half?

3035
02:30:20,171 --> 02:30:21,642
Halfbeak!

3036
02:30:21,671 --> 02:30:23,372
- Is there really a halfbeak? - Look.

3037
02:30:24,171 --> 02:30:26,011
- Where? - Focus.

3038
02:30:33,581 --> 02:30:34,622
Did you hear that?

3039
02:30:35,152 --> 02:30:36,251
Hush.

3040
02:30:37,451 --> 02:30:39,421
Stay quiet until I hear it.

3041
02:30:39,421 --> 02:30:40,591
We're leaving when we hear it.

3042
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:49,501
I heard it under the streetlight over there.

3043
02:30:54,402 --> 02:30:55,972
It's garlic.

3044
02:30:57,611 --> 02:30:59,441
Do you want aglio e olio?

3045
02:31:00,281 --> 02:31:03,511
I can make you aglio e olio with a basketful.

3046
02:31:04,882 --> 02:31:06,882
- Now, let's ask. - Yes.

3047
02:31:06,882 --> 02:31:08,021
Good.

3048
02:31:08,822 --> 02:31:11,892
Are you honest about your feelings?

3049
02:31:13,191 --> 02:31:17,331
- Or are you defensive? - I used to be defensive.

3050
02:31:17,331 --> 02:31:20,162
But I plan to be honest.

3051
02:31:21,201 --> 02:31:23,001
This is crazy.

3052
02:31:23,472 --> 02:31:25,201
Sir. What about you?

3053
02:31:25,201 --> 02:31:27,701
- Sir? - Hey. Hang on.

3054
02:31:27,701 --> 02:31:30,671
Hey. Not so fast.

3055
02:31:30,742 --> 02:31:32,142
So?

3056
02:31:33,581 --> 02:31:34,812
Let's go.

3057
02:31:34,941 --> 02:31:37,351
What are you trying to do?

3058
02:31:37,581 --> 02:31:39,921
Is it this way?

3059
02:31:42,081 --> 02:31:43,222
I can smell it.

3060
02:31:49,662 --> 02:31:52,392
(They brought a mat and a blanket.)

3061
02:31:57,572 --> 02:31:58,831
Thank you.

3062
02:32:01,972 --> 02:32:03,271
Let's just drink.

3063
02:32:05,212 --> 02:32:07,042
It'll be over tomorrow.

3064
02:32:10,181 --> 02:32:11,652
You're a really nice person.

3065
02:32:12,552 --> 02:32:16,992
I find you charming.

3066
02:32:19,562 --> 02:32:20,892
That's why it's tough.

3067
02:32:21,691 --> 02:32:23,931
I don't know what to do.

3068
02:32:24,261 --> 02:32:26,562
I really don't want to do this.

3069
02:32:27,162 --> 02:32:30,802
Look back at your four years of relationship.

3070
02:32:31,732 --> 02:32:35,402
Regardless of your decision, you've become a wonderful person.

3071
02:32:35,902 --> 02:32:37,142
- In my opinion. - No.

3072
02:32:38,511 --> 02:32:39,712
You shine so brightly.

3073
02:32:40,341 --> 02:32:44,251
Do you think I fell for you for no reason?

3074
02:32:44,251 --> 02:32:45,451
No.

3075
02:32:45,882 --> 02:32:48,781
You just need to be honest.

3076
02:32:49,421 --> 02:32:51,251
I'm going to be honest.

3077
02:32:52,662 --> 02:32:55,521
Before you go to sleep, you need to tell me,

3078
02:32:55,521 --> 02:32:56,931
"Be honest, Ji Yeon."

3079
02:33:01,101 --> 02:33:02,402
If I choose you,

3080
02:33:02,802 --> 02:33:05,831
it's not because I got carried away.

3081
02:33:07,001 --> 02:33:09,841
I made the decision because I want to see you.

3082
02:33:10,171 --> 02:33:13,412
"I was serious about my ex."

3083
02:33:13,412 --> 02:33:14,941
I'm not making the decision...

3084
02:33:14,941 --> 02:33:16,351
for that reason.

3085
02:33:17,052 --> 02:33:18,681
Because I don't want to do that,

3086
02:33:18,681 --> 02:33:21,281
I treated Na Yeon that way.

3087
02:33:22,181 --> 02:33:24,251
That's why I wasn't nice to her.

3088
02:33:25,691 --> 02:33:28,261
I didn't want to bring back the old emotions.

3089
02:33:28,322 --> 02:33:31,031
I don't want those emotions to affect my decision.

3090
02:33:33,501 --> 02:33:36,072
- But I... Hee Doo. - Yes?

3091
02:33:37,472 --> 02:33:38,671
I meant it all along.

3092
02:33:38,771 --> 02:33:40,542
In every moment.

3093
02:33:41,171 --> 02:33:42,671
- We're the same. - I...

3094
02:33:42,671 --> 02:33:43,771
We're...

3095
02:33:43,771 --> 02:33:46,111
- We're mutual. - But I...

3096
02:33:46,341 --> 02:33:47,441
Yes.

3097
02:33:48,281 --> 02:33:50,812
If I were in your shoes, I would've never contemplated.

3098
02:33:51,312 --> 02:33:53,081
I told you I regretted it.

3099
02:33:53,482 --> 02:33:56,822
I wish our situations switched.

3100
02:33:57,052 --> 02:33:59,392
His feelings for me...

3101
02:33:59,492 --> 02:34:01,421
gave him a hard time.

3102
02:34:01,421 --> 02:34:03,531
We were being honest,

3103
02:34:03,531 --> 02:34:05,861
so we expressed our emotions so much.

3104
02:34:05,861 --> 02:34:09,601
We admitted that we enjoy...

3105
02:34:09,732 --> 02:34:13,972
spending time together.

3106
02:34:14,402 --> 02:34:16,872
That made it more certain.

3107
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:18,972
- Are you... - I'm talking casually to you.

3108
02:34:18,972 --> 02:34:21,181
(They spoke casually from their first date.)

3109
02:34:21,581 --> 02:34:23,152
Don't speak in dialect when you go back.

3110
02:34:23,712 --> 02:34:25,351
That'll show we drank together.

3111
02:34:28,351 --> 02:34:30,822
(Every time we made eye contact, we couldn't stop laughing.)

3112
02:34:31,292 --> 02:34:32,992
One, two, three. Snap.

3113
02:34:33,421 --> 02:34:34,662
- Are you okay? - Yes.

3114
02:34:35,521 --> 02:34:37,091
- I... - Hey. Are you okay?

3115
02:34:37,931 --> 02:34:41,201
Ji Yeon looked very appealing.

3116
02:34:41,931 --> 02:34:43,171
She's really funny.

3117
02:34:43,171 --> 02:34:46,372
Sometimes I have to stop her.

3118
02:34:46,771 --> 02:34:48,101
That's a bit hard.

3119
02:34:49,101 --> 02:34:50,312
But...

3120
02:34:50,671 --> 02:34:53,681
she gives me energy when I'm with her.

3121
02:34:54,042 --> 02:34:56,212
If I meet someone energetic,

3122
02:34:56,451 --> 02:34:59,781
his energy and my energy will create a synergy effect.

3123
02:35:03,951 --> 02:35:06,052
It's like, "When will you be here?"

3124
02:35:06,322 --> 02:35:07,521
Isn't that cute?

3125
02:35:08,162 --> 02:35:09,492
- That one? - Isn't this cuter?

3126
02:35:09,531 --> 02:35:10,591
I like this one.

3127
02:35:10,591 --> 02:35:12,261
I realized a younger girlfriend...

3128
02:35:12,261 --> 02:35:13,361
can be cute.

3129
02:35:14,162 --> 02:35:16,201
When I look back in last three weeks,

3130
02:35:16,331 --> 02:35:18,601
he made me laugh the most.

3131
02:35:19,031 --> 02:35:22,001
I could tell...

3132
02:35:22,001 --> 02:35:23,611
that Hee Doo was into me...

3133
02:35:25,712 --> 02:35:28,681
for real. I could tell at that moment.

3134
02:35:28,882 --> 02:35:30,581
I like dialects.

3135
02:35:30,982 --> 02:35:33,751
See? I've never heard a dialect like that before.

3136
02:35:33,882 --> 02:35:34,921
"This one?"

3137
02:35:35,781 --> 02:35:36,892
Trying to look cool.

3138
02:35:44,732 --> 02:35:46,232
Can I touch your dimple?

3139
02:35:50,232 --> 02:35:51,331
Isn't he cute?

3140
02:35:55,671 --> 02:35:56,712
No?

3141
02:35:57,271 --> 02:36:00,081
After the earnest conversation with Ji Yeon,

3142
02:36:00,281 --> 02:36:03,511
and she told me the things she couldn't tell me before,

3143
02:36:03,681 --> 02:36:07,652
my feelings for her became deeper.

3144
02:36:08,921 --> 02:36:10,951
Should I choose Ji Yeon...

3145
02:36:10,951 --> 02:36:13,591
when I still have feelings for my ex?

3146
02:36:13,962 --> 02:36:15,222
What should I do...

3147
02:36:16,392 --> 02:36:17,691
about Ji Yeon?

3148
02:36:18,792 --> 02:36:20,562
- Hee Doo. - Yes?

3149
02:36:20,662 --> 02:36:22,431
- See you later. - Yes, see you.

3150
02:36:24,701 --> 02:36:25,872
What should I do?

3151
02:36:25,872 --> 02:36:28,402
(Hee Doo gets it off his chest before going home.)

3152
02:36:28,402 --> 02:36:29,671
What do I do?

3153
02:36:31,111 --> 02:36:34,581
When I see Na Yeon,

3154
02:36:35,011 --> 02:36:36,652
it brings back my old memories.

3155
02:36:36,652 --> 02:36:38,882
It becomes more complex.

3156
02:36:39,652 --> 02:36:43,652
It's ridiculous that I'm getting feelings for Ji Yeon.

3157
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:58,601
I...

3158
02:37:04,712 --> 02:37:07,781
I thought this...

3159
02:37:08,781 --> 02:37:11,212
would clear my mind.

3160
02:37:12,511 --> 02:37:13,722
The decision...

3161
02:37:15,382 --> 02:37:16,552
I just...

3162
02:37:16,921 --> 02:37:19,792
I didn't know I was an emotional person.

3163
02:37:20,792 --> 02:37:21,921
I...

3164
02:37:28,531 --> 02:37:29,601
It was tough.

3165
02:37:30,831 --> 02:37:33,101
(Have you made up your mind yet?)

3166
02:37:34,072 --> 02:37:35,402
No, I haven't.

3167
02:37:42,912 --> 02:37:47,052
(They come home separately after their secret date.)

3168
02:38:02,931 --> 02:38:05,671
(She goes straight to Hyun Gyu's room.)

3169
02:38:07,402 --> 02:38:08,572
Yes?

3170
02:38:10,412 --> 02:38:12,572
- Are you sleeping? - You home?

3171
02:38:12,742 --> 02:38:13,912
I'm here to say hi.

3172
02:38:14,142 --> 02:38:15,281
And to check on you.

3173
02:38:16,552 --> 02:38:18,451
- I'll walk you home. - Just to the door.

3174
02:38:18,451 --> 02:38:19,511
Open the door for me.

3175
02:38:20,081 --> 02:38:21,622
No, just open the door for me.

3176
02:38:23,851 --> 02:38:25,052
Go back to sleep.

3177
02:38:25,421 --> 02:38:26,691
Go back to sleep.

3178
02:38:28,062 --> 02:38:29,521
Hey, go back to sleep.

3179
02:38:32,292 --> 02:38:33,861
Thank you for walking me.

3180
02:38:33,962 --> 02:38:35,101
You're welcome.

3181
02:38:36,201 --> 02:38:37,331
Bye.

3182
02:38:37,572 --> 02:38:39,271
Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

3183
02:38:40,601 --> 02:38:41,771
Bye.

3184
02:38:51,982 --> 02:38:53,652
Hi.

3185
02:38:54,451 --> 02:38:56,892
- What? It's my painting. - What?

3186
02:38:56,892 --> 02:38:58,152
My painting is here.

3187
02:38:58,152 --> 02:39:00,062
Hyun Gyu gave it to me this morning.

3188
02:39:00,062 --> 02:39:01,322
- Really? - Yes.

3189
02:39:02,392 --> 02:39:03,691
What should I wear tomorrow?

3190
02:39:03,691 --> 02:39:05,031
Did you choose your outfit for tomorrow?

3191
02:39:05,031 --> 02:39:06,562
No way.

3192
02:39:06,662 --> 02:39:07,662
No way.

3193
02:39:07,831 --> 02:39:08,962
What should I wear?

3194
02:39:09,431 --> 02:39:11,701
Should I wear the mini skirt? I didn't wear that today.

3195
02:39:12,671 --> 02:39:15,542
Final decision. The best outfit.

3196
02:39:16,642 --> 02:39:17,972
What to wear?

3197
02:39:19,812 --> 02:39:22,042
(Hee Doo is home.)

3198
02:39:25,751 --> 02:39:26,851
What are you doing?

3199
02:39:29,822 --> 02:39:31,521
- Are you home? - What are you doing, Ji Yeon?

3200
02:39:32,591 --> 02:39:33,761
Do you want some ramyeon?

3201
02:39:34,492 --> 02:39:36,261
- Want me to make you ramyeon? - No thanks.

3202
02:39:38,261 --> 02:39:40,162
I'll go change my shirt.

3203
02:39:47,771 --> 02:39:49,001
Hey, Na Yeon.

3204
02:39:51,341 --> 02:39:52,972
What? Are you laughing at my face?

3205
02:39:53,712 --> 02:39:55,882
Are you laughing at my bare face?

3206
02:39:55,912 --> 02:39:57,212
- No. - Then?

3207
02:39:58,212 --> 02:39:59,781
Why are you so puffy today?

3208
02:40:01,122 --> 02:40:03,191
- I'm doomed. - What is Na Yeon taking so long?

3209
02:40:03,751 --> 02:40:04,921
I know. Why isn't she back yet?

3210
02:40:04,921 --> 02:40:06,351
Look at the time. Why is she still not here yet?

3211
02:40:06,351 --> 02:40:07,462
- Hae Eun. - Yes?

3212
02:40:08,062 --> 02:40:10,062
Don't cry. It breaks my heart.

3213
02:40:10,392 --> 02:40:11,562
Is it pitiful?

3214
02:40:12,591 --> 02:40:15,232
No, I understand. I cried too.

3215
02:40:15,232 --> 02:40:16,402
You cried too?

3216
02:40:16,802 --> 02:40:18,872
There's a difference between crying because I'm sad...

3217
02:40:19,941 --> 02:40:21,701
and crying because I have a lot on my mind.

3218
02:40:22,872 --> 02:40:26,441
It was both.

3219
02:40:27,011 --> 02:40:28,941
- Do you want to know the truth? - Yes.

3220
02:40:29,042 --> 02:40:30,581
When I cleared my mind...

3221
02:40:30,781 --> 02:40:32,611
and decided to sort my feelings for her,

3222
02:40:32,611 --> 02:40:35,751
I burst into tears.

3223
02:40:41,421 --> 02:40:42,421
Aren't you cold?

3224
02:40:42,421 --> 02:40:46,902
By the way, what are you so worried about?

3225
02:40:47,462 --> 02:40:49,562
Do you not know what your heart wants?

3226
02:40:49,562 --> 02:40:50,601
Me?

3227
02:40:51,001 --> 02:40:52,632
Or are you worried?

3228
02:40:52,872 --> 02:40:53,941
I don't know.

3229
02:40:55,472 --> 02:40:59,171
Just be cool about it. What can you do? You're too popular.

3230
02:40:59,712 --> 02:41:01,712
- When I choose her? - Choosing me...

3231
02:41:02,011 --> 02:41:03,912
doesn't mean I want you to love me.

3232
02:41:04,281 --> 02:41:05,552
I'm...

3233
02:41:08,652 --> 02:41:09,681
attracted to you.

3234
02:41:11,451 --> 02:41:15,861
I wish Na Yeon and I were like Hyun Gyu and Na Eon.

3235
02:41:17,992 --> 02:41:20,232
(Na Yeon is home.)

3236
02:41:22,431 --> 02:41:24,902
Hi. When did you get home?

3237
02:41:24,902 --> 02:41:26,031
Why are you so late?

3238
02:41:26,031 --> 02:41:28,441
- My goodness. - When did you get home?

3239
02:41:28,671 --> 02:41:30,642
- A while ago. - What?

3240
02:41:36,681 --> 02:41:37,681
(Hee Doo enters Ji Yeon's room.)

3241
02:41:37,681 --> 02:41:38,951
What are you doing?

3242
02:41:51,232 --> 02:41:54,331
What's going on? He entered Ji Yeon's room.

3243
02:41:54,761 --> 02:41:57,072
- Really? - I'll go call him.

3244
02:42:00,341 --> 02:42:02,341
(Hee Doo is measuring his weight.)

3245
02:42:03,511 --> 02:42:04,872
Hee Doo. Come here.

3246
02:42:05,671 --> 02:42:08,011
- Why? - You said you had something to say.

3247
02:42:08,111 --> 02:42:09,281
I don't.

3248
02:42:10,312 --> 02:42:12,081
Do I have something to say or is it you?

3249
02:42:12,081 --> 02:42:14,581
Probably both, right?

3250
02:42:15,122 --> 02:42:16,351
- What? - Come out.

3251
02:42:18,091 --> 02:42:20,492
Go ahead.

3252
02:42:20,492 --> 02:42:22,921
What is it? What's your deal?

3253
02:42:22,921 --> 02:42:23,962
What?

3254
02:42:24,992 --> 02:42:26,962
You had fun with Ji Yeon.

3255
02:42:26,962 --> 02:42:29,562
I had fun with her. What?

3256
02:42:30,531 --> 02:42:31,601
So what?

3257
02:42:35,642 --> 02:42:36,941
What's going on?

3258
02:42:38,271 --> 02:42:40,312
- It's a fight for Hee Doo. - It is.

3259
02:42:41,642 --> 02:42:43,081
They fight until the end.

3260
02:42:44,412 --> 02:42:46,482
There's no peace between them.

3261
02:42:50,992 --> 02:42:51,992
What?

3262
02:42:57,892 --> 02:42:59,662
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

3263
02:43:00,431 --> 02:43:02,732
I cried so much.

3264
02:43:02,931 --> 02:43:04,972
- Why? - Because it's tough.

3265
02:43:05,201 --> 02:43:08,201
I hate the fact that I have to feel this way.

3266
02:43:08,402 --> 02:43:12,271
About you and Ji Yeon.

3267
02:43:12,941 --> 02:43:14,882
You should choose Gyu Min.

3268
02:43:16,851 --> 02:43:18,212
You should choose Ji Yeon.

3269
02:43:21,181 --> 02:43:24,122
- No. - What?

3270
02:43:24,792 --> 02:43:27,392
I haven't started yet.

3271
02:43:27,392 --> 02:43:30,462
Then let's sit down and talk over there with everyone.

3272
02:43:31,162 --> 02:43:33,701
I don't want to talk in front of Ji Yeon.

3273
02:43:35,531 --> 02:43:36,671
I'm going to bed.

3274
02:43:37,902 --> 02:43:39,501
I was going to talk to Hee Doo...

3275
02:43:39,501 --> 02:43:41,941
one last time before the final decision.

3276
02:43:41,941 --> 02:43:43,671
But it didn't go well.

3277
02:43:43,671 --> 02:43:46,072
It seems he cried a lot.

3278
02:43:46,072 --> 02:43:48,812
His eyes were so puffy. He could barely keep his eyes open.

3279
02:43:49,382 --> 02:43:51,052
He said it was too tough.

3280
02:43:51,412 --> 02:43:54,681
Because of Ji Yeon and me.

3281
02:43:54,781 --> 02:43:56,722
He said he was having a hard time.

3282
02:43:56,722 --> 02:43:59,251
He never says he's having a hard time.

3283
02:43:59,492 --> 02:44:02,492
Today, he broke my heart big time.

3284
02:44:02,962 --> 02:44:06,962
My feelings for him hit rock bottom. I was sad because of him.

3285
02:44:07,501 --> 02:44:08,632
But why did he cry now?

3286
02:44:10,001 --> 02:44:11,572
(Hyun Gyu who got up early joins.)

3287
02:44:11,572 --> 02:44:14,572
Father if you're watching

3288
02:44:14,572 --> 02:44:16,402
- Give me the answer - Give me the answer

3289
02:44:26,451 --> 02:44:28,552
- I'm out of battery. - Is that right?

3290
02:44:29,081 --> 02:44:32,552
Ji Yeon didn't...

3291
02:44:32,552 --> 02:44:34,261
leave him alone.

3292
02:44:34,921 --> 02:44:36,662
So I asked Hyun Gyu.

3293
02:44:36,861 --> 02:44:38,962
"I want to talk to Hee Doo."

3294
02:44:38,962 --> 02:44:40,701
"Can you help me?"

3295
02:44:45,632 --> 02:44:47,701
- Do you want to talk? - Sure.

3296
02:44:56,042 --> 02:44:57,511
Na Yeon wanted some privacy.

3297
02:44:58,312 --> 02:45:00,351
- It's uncomfortable. - Why?

3298
02:45:00,751 --> 02:45:02,451
- I know that too. - Really?

3299
02:45:03,521 --> 02:45:05,992
Honestly, I didn't have to leave him alone.

3300
02:45:06,222 --> 02:45:07,521
It's over anyway.

3301
02:45:08,361 --> 02:45:10,261
But I still left him alone.

3302
02:45:10,831 --> 02:45:15,632
I know that I can't stop them from talking.

3303
02:45:16,201 --> 02:45:17,232
What am I doing?

3304
02:45:19,972 --> 02:45:21,941
Do what your heart tells you.

3305
02:45:23,242 --> 02:45:25,312
Hee Doo said he wants a couple more days,

3306
02:45:25,412 --> 02:45:27,611
and I agree with him.

3307
02:45:28,312 --> 02:45:31,052
Do you think that will bring you two closer...

3308
02:45:31,052 --> 02:45:32,611
and choose each other?

3309
02:45:33,482 --> 02:45:34,751
To be honest, yes.

3310
02:45:36,581 --> 02:45:39,822
I'm not sure what Hee Doo's going to do.

3311
02:45:40,392 --> 02:45:43,062
Ji Yeon. Do what you want.

3312
02:45:44,361 --> 02:45:45,962
Be crazier.

3313
02:45:48,101 --> 02:45:50,031
What made you cry?

3314
02:45:51,101 --> 02:45:52,632
That I have to make a decision.

3315
02:45:54,472 --> 02:45:57,042
- Are you feeling what I'm feeling? - What?

3316
02:45:57,142 --> 02:45:58,441
It's tough for me too.

3317
02:45:59,941 --> 02:46:02,441
I always said I wanted things to work out between us.

3318
02:46:02,441 --> 02:46:05,081
- Did you enjoy the date with me? - Yes.

3319
02:46:05,781 --> 02:46:07,152
- Did you? - Yes.

3320
02:46:07,152 --> 02:46:09,152
I cried four times today on our date.

3321
02:46:10,152 --> 02:46:13,492
I thought we would change during the date today,

3322
02:46:13,722 --> 02:46:16,562
but I didn't see any chance of change in us.

3323
02:46:18,261 --> 02:46:20,132
I kept telling you...

3324
02:46:20,132 --> 02:46:22,902
that we'd be able to change. That I'm looking forward to it.

3325
02:46:23,531 --> 02:46:25,931
But look what happened today.

3326
02:46:26,472 --> 02:46:27,902
Look what you did.

3327
02:46:28,402 --> 02:46:31,742
I want us to have a fresh start.

3328
02:46:32,511 --> 02:46:34,681
No repetition. Not because I missed you...

3329
02:46:35,181 --> 02:46:36,341
or because I'm clingy.

3330
02:46:36,951 --> 02:46:39,312
But first of all, I don't know what's on your mind.

3331
02:46:39,781 --> 02:46:44,152
Secondly, I haven't seen any changes.

3332
02:46:44,152 --> 02:46:46,392
The way you treat me hasn't changed.
