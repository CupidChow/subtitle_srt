1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,250
(EXchange 2)

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,949
(EXchange 2)

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,960
(They sit in the familiar order as usual.)

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,459
(Today, where everyone's faces are full of sadness, )

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,129
(is the viewing of the last episode of EXchange 2.)

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,070
(It's the perfect day for an overly-immersed conversation.)

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,799
- Hello, dear viewers. - Hello, dear viewers.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,170
This is the original variety show, EXchange 2.

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,038
- I'm Jeong Ki Seok. - I'm Kim Ye Won.

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,640
- I'm Yura. - And I'm BamBam.

11
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,078
You guys aren't ready to say goodbye to EXchange 2, right?

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,519
- Of course not. - Not yet.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,978
We can't let it go. Not over our dead bodies.

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,688
- Who will we see on Fridays now? - I know.

15
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,060
Couldn't you please just extend it by five episodes?

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,659
Seriously.

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,929
(The overly-immersed conversation about EXchange 2 starts now.)

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,769
(EXchange 2, the days of being overly immersed)

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,099
I have goosebumps.

20
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,069
That's it.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,408
(What was the best reaction scene to EXchange 2?)

22
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,949
Could I go first?

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,009
- Yes. - Yes.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,379
- You're so enthusiastic. - I really...

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,688
can't forget about this.

26
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,518
When Yura...

27
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,059
showed her bare feet...

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,789
and reacted while stomping her feet.

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,959
"See you tomorrow!"

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,699
It was during the scene where Hyun Gyu said,

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,030
- It was Hyun Gyu. - "See you tomorrow."

32
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,040
I remember her name.

33
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,540
It's Hae Eun.

34
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,540
Look at Gyu Min's face.

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,810
You don't have any feelings for me.

36
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,009
It's fine.

37
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,109
Enjoy your date.

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,319
See you tomorrow, Hae Eun.

39
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,790
Gosh.

40
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:00,059
But seriously, her entire body was scrunched up like this.

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,929
She was so cute as she reacted with her whole body.

42
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,429
I think I replayed that scene the most out of both seasons.

43
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,169
- Oh, really? - Yes, really.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,098
I thought everyone was feeling the same way as she did.

45
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,239
See you tomorrow, Hae Eun.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,709
(Oh, my goodness.)

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,908
I saw this comment online.

48
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,079
Hyun-Hae Couple is Jeong Ki Seok's creation.

49
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,739
(Ki Seok was so sincere about Hyun-Hae Couple.)

50
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,879
When that couple was having a conversation in the car,

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,718
they suddenly held hands.

52
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,919
They were like, "Don't look."

53
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,819
At the time, both Yura and I were covering our mouths in shock.

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,389
Hae Eun is frozen!

55
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,329
- She's frozen. - Hae Eun is frozen.

56
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,659
- What will she do? - Right now...

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,029
There were so many comments that said we had been synced.

58
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,339
- "Ki Seok and Yura are synced." - I know.

59
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,908
I felt as if my hand had just been grabbed.

60
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,239
My palms were sweating.

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,839
BamBam asked me if my hands were shaking.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
(Ki Seok was actually in sync with Hae Eun too.)

63
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,580
I feel like I can rely on you since you're not afraid.

64
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,349
My favorite reaction scene is...

65
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,779
It's the first day, but it's so satisfying.

66
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,818
It's all wrong.

67
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,489
The ten days they spent are more entertaining than my life.

68
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,249
I think I will get hair loss while watching this.

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,919
Ten minutes here will change everyone.

70
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,959
- I know, right? There were... - "I know, right?"

71
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,030
I think it has to be "They're funny people."

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,860
They're funny people.

73
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,499
It hasn't been that long since they read their ex's letters.

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,269
How are they already starting anew?

75
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,769
I'm still sitting here today because of that one reaction.

76
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,139
- I'm so grateful. - It's like...

77
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,279
That comment was like the beginning of BamBam's opening act.

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,839
I think it was the turning point in my life.

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,150
(Laughing)

80
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,609
- "They're funny people." - "They're funny people."

81
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,050
What a mess.

82
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,318
Seriously?

83
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,718
(What was the most overly-immersed time on EXchange 2?)

84
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,960
Why are you doing that?

85
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,689
Gosh, I can't breathe.

86
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,628
- There were too many. - I know.

87
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,759
- We were overly immersed so often. - Right.

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,799
Whenever Hee Doo and Na Yeon fought,

89
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,468
I think I was overly immersed.

90
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,598
- Really? - I was going to say the same thing.

91
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,468
- That suffocating feeling, right? - Right.

92
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,769
Hee Doo was standing in the doorway,

93
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,908
and Na Yeon was sitting while they fought.

94
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,109
I can't forget about that scene.

95
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,619
I want to start fresh, but how can I do that...

96
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,219
when you and I are the same?

97
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,089
I can't talk to her out of everyone in the world.

98
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,188
- It's just this tiny bit. - It's literally this much.

99
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,359
(Why is this the most overly-immersed scene?)

100
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,729
When you fight with a lover, there's a weird feeling afterwards.

101
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,930
But watching that scene made me feel the same way.

102
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,539
I thought, "I didn't do anything, so why do I feel like this?"

103
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,240
- I didn't have a fight, so why? - I know.

104
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,609
I don't have anyone to make up with,

105
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,740
- but I feel like I should. - I want to make up with someone.

106
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,539
- Talk it out with someone. - Yes, it feels that way,

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,979
- but nobody's there to do it with. - Right.

108
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,479
I think there are three types of love.

109
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,518
There's physical love, mental love, and these guys' love.

110
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,589
- These guys' love... - There are exactly three.

111
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:47,429
I think I was overly immersed in Hae Eun's emotional ups and downs.

112
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,028
Maybe it was because she cried a lot and had a hard time.

113
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:56,028
I found myself following along with Hae Eun's emotions a lot.

114
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,269
It hurt.

115
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,469
It was so...

116
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,740
We used to be so different to how we are now.

117
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,110
I was so sad.

118
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,809
(This time, we are breaking up for real.)

119
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,279
I hope you wouldn't be upset.

120
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,850
No, but...

121
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,148
I was upset earlier.

122
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,879
I'm sorry. Earlier...

123
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,920
- I felt that way. - Of course.

124
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,189
My heart was really fluttering.

125
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,759
It really was. How can he be like that?

126
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,699
I thought I should take my necklace off when going to see Hyun Gyu.

127
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,730
Hyun Gyu might not know, but it's meaningful for me.

128
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,470
I just took it off.

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,970
You waited for a long time, right?

130
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,579
Were you surprised?

131
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,980
Don't cry.

132
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,979
The part where I was overly immersed in terms of my emotions...

133
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,588
was at the end when Gyu Min cried.

134
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,388
- Oh, right. - I usually don't...

135
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,028
You guys both cried a lot.

136
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,189
I didn't cry a lot.

137
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,898
- I teared up a bit. - I held my tears back.

138
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,059
(The ex date is now over.)

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,129
(You can go on a secret date with one person besides your ex.)

140
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,100
I wanted to have omakase with you.

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,370
But it's suddenly over.

142
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,209
- I thought it would end at night. - I know.

143
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,839
I feel sad.

144
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:50,579
We have to go have omakase.

145
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,319
Let's go next time.

146
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,750
- Next time? - Yes, it's okay.

147
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,120
- Next time? - I'll buy it for you next time.

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,290
- We're going next time? - Yes, I'll treat you next time.

149
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,459
When? When is "next time?"

150
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,459
- I'll buy it for you. - Why are you crying?

151
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,410
Why are you crying?

152
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,220
It ended so unexpectedly.

153
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,789
I thought I would finally get to spend time talking to you.

154
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,818
I know.

155
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:35,089
(They all burst into tears at Gyu Min's true feelings.)

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,628
Gyu Min's complicated feelings?

157
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,730
I could see how sad he was for it to be over.

158
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,529
I really tried to hold back too.

159
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,999
But once I start crying, I cry for so long.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,499
So I didn't want to cry.

161
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,109
I never saw BamBam cry.

162
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,680
Usually, when you cry, you just say, "It's so sad."

163
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,938
But we were all like, "Why am I crying?"

164
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,648
- Right. - Why am I crying?

165
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,409
- I know. - Why am I suddenly sad?

166
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,318
I don't think I should be crying, so why am I sad?

167
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
We know how that feels,

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,589
- so we related to it and cried. - That's right.

169
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,790
Gosh.

170
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,160
- You're copying me. - Gosh, this is...

171
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,300
(You cried, I cried, and we all cried.)

172
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,969
There were hard moments of being overly immersed,

173
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,909
but I thought being overly immersed was kind of fun and therapeutic too.

174
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,979
When Na Eon and Tae I went to have omakase...

175
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,708
- The black pork? - Yes.

176
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,708
Watching them in that scene,

177
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,350
I thought it was a very representative scene...

178
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,960
of what it means to be happy in a small but sure way...

179
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,490
as lovers or even as a married couple.

180
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,659
(I'm happy.)

181
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,099
But I was so overly immersed in it...

182
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,399
that I said they should get married.

183
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,000
(Shouldn't they just get married?)

184
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,508
- Already? - You already want them to marry?

185
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,579
- I even wanted to go eat there too. - Me too.

186
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,480
They seemed to enjoy the food so much.

187
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,548
(What was the most upsetting moment of EXchange 2?)

188
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:13,689
That part where it was like watching Hae Eun's monologue...

189
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,330
when she was in front of the mirror...

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,788
- Oh, right. - Let's have fun this evening.

191
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,898
She was so sad, but she kept trying to hold emotions back.

192
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,600
But then she just ended up crying.

193
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,599
It was a scene that showed Hae Eun's emotions so well.

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,339
I think everyone describes that scene as one of the best.

195
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,409
- Really? - Yes.

196
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,808
Let's go eat lunch.

197
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,450
Okay, I'll look forward to it.

198
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,908
The people around me also said that scene...

199
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,049
- I mean, not that it's a movie... - That scene, yes.

200
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,308
- It's because you're an actress. - But it really seemed like a drama.

201
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,249
I know. It felt like a scene from a drama or a movie.

202
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,620
We could really see her emotions in that scene.

203
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,960
(From the first day...)

204
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,388
Won Bin, at the end,

205
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,158
seemed to lose his mental strength.

206
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,470
So he was sick and low on energy.

207
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,339
I felt upset for him then.

208
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,369
Right. Won Bin and Ji Soo...

209
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,080
had a misunderstanding.

210
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:42,648
I think I was upset when that happened too.

211
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,279
So after that, Won Bin was really down.

212
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,388
- Both of them were. - Yes, they were.

213
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,490
- It was neither this nor that. - Right.

214
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,080
I think the most upsetting moment for me was...

215
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,149
when we watched the last episode.

216
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,979
- The last... - The fact that it's over.

217
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,179
- Yes, the fact that it's over... - This moment, right now.

218
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:30,090
(How do you feel now that EXchange 2 is over?)

219
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,999
This kind of interview makes it feel like it's really over. I hate it.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,099
- We didn't do this in Season One. - No, we didn't.

221
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,500
Now that you ask us to say how we feel...

222
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,768
I'm not lying when I say that for the past three months,

223
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,909
I was so overly immersed...

224
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,148
that I was more into it than any movie or drama...

225
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,879
that I've seen before.

226
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,518
For me, our Monday shoots and the Friday broadcasts...

227
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,319
were like golden hours.

228
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,628
- Actually, all we did was watch. - Right.

229
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,359
It wasn't really hard for us.

230
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,168
We were here to enjoy it, and we truly like this show.

231
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,798
We're so sincere about the EXchange series.

232
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,638
Yes, you can feel it too, right?

233
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,240
I am just...

234
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,240
looking forward to EXchange 3.

235
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,409
As one of the participants?

236
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,678
As a participant?

237
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,249
"As one of the participants?"

238
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,750
- Are you going to be in it? - Let's go together.

239
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,008
What about you, Ye Won?

240
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,850
I also got to be a part of Seasons 1 and 2,

241
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,590
and I was so grateful that I got this opportunity.

242
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,959
I went through so many spectacular emotions.

243
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,699
We felt so many things, not just about love.

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,298
- We felt emotions of friendship... - Right.

245
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,600
- and emotions of growing up. - That's right.

246
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,440
I sympathized with them and also got comforted.

247
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,069
It's like I learned about life.

248
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,940
- That's right. - Learning about life.

249
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,909
It's like we felt emotions...

250
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,518
that we wouldn't normally feel by watching them.

251
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,619
- That's right. - That's what it felt like.

252
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,548
It's something we didn't feel from books or movies.

253
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,989
There were things that we never experienced.

254
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,360
I liked it because we could feel those things together.

255
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,100
I'm not sad that it's ending today.

256
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,700
We'll have Season Three anyway.

257
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,969
What if we won't have it?

258
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,729
What if we won't? Producer.

259
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,499
(That's not possible, Producer.)

260
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,638
There will be, right?

261
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,809
But it was a huge hit.

262
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,479
Maybe they won't do it because it's too much pressure now.

263
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,109
I can wait two years.

264
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,980
I can wait 2 years, so please make Season 3.

265
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,690
(Any last words for the participants of EXchange 2?)

266
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,190
I think I might cry.

267
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,990
Parting with the participants...

268
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,628
feels like I'm parting with my friends.

269
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,129
- That's right. - Exactly.

270
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,699
Every season, it's like saying goodbye to friends.

271
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,668
It feels sad to part with them.

272
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:58,778
It's like I won't be seeing my friends anymore.

273
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,210
- Like my friend is going abroad. - That's right.

274
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,178
I kept thinking how difficult it must have been...

275
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,379
for the participants in the show.

276
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,319
They must have been through a lot...

277
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,559
and felt a lot of things.

278
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,059
You all did a great job,

279
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,459
and I really hope everyone becomes happy.

280
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,199
We wish you happiness.

281
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,298
That's right.

282
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,000
Yong Jin couldn't come today.

283
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,499
But I remember what he said...

284
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,808
while watching one of the clips.

285
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:32,239
"After watching all this, they don't feel like strangers."

286
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,778
- That's what he said. - That's right.

287
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,908
I think we all feel like that.

288
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,120
You don't feel like strangers.

289
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,989
I hope you also keep supporting the participants...

290
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,319
even after the show ends.

291
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,959
I'd like to ask the viewers to cheer for them too.

292
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,128
- That's right. - Yes.

293
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,699
Please don't insult or attack them.

294
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,830
(Please don't insult or attack them!)

295
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:57,269
Even as this show is being aired,

296
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,508
you would have to interact with the public.

297
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,179
- That's right. - You would hear various opinions.

298
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,580
I hope you don't get hurt from that.

299
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,450
It's not like your life ends because EXchange ends.

300
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:17,489
I hope you use this time to look back on yourself.

301
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,820
And regarding the life to come,

302
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,229
I hope you live a better...

303
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,069
and happy life.

304
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,070
- That's right. - Yes.

305
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,528
That was a sincere word of encouragement.

306
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,038
- Why are you so good at Korean? - No, I'm not.

307
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,970
You speak better than me.

308
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,269
How long do you think it will take until you move on?

309
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,439
- It'll take the longest for her. - I was thinking...

310
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,408
of doing a marathon starting from Episode 1.

311
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,719
It might be more fun to watch when you know everything.

312
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,589
We will definitely wait for Season Three.

313
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,048
- Right? - That's right.

314
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,159
They want us to wrap up.

315
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,288
Because we need to start watching?

316
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,928
Anyway, thank you...

317
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,099
- for loving EXchange 2. - Thank you.

318
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,299
- Bye. - Bye.

319
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,558
- See you again. - Bye.

320
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,029
See you again. We'll come back soon.

321
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,570
(Welcome to the group viewing.)

322
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,239
Hello.

323
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm Producer Lee Jin Joo, of EXchange. It's nice to meet you.

324
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,220
It's an honor to watch the last episode with you.

325
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,149
Many things have happened, right?

326
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,489
We cried, and we laughed. You know it too.

327
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,829
You were immersed, right?

328
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,158
- Yes! - Yes!

329
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,960
You had the same reaction as us, right?

330
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,229
- Yes. - Yes.

331
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,869
As far as I know, only 100 people were selected...

332
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,870
among 8,000 people.

333
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,970
You're very lucky.

334
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:45,709
I'm very glad that we can be immersed in the show together...

335
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,949
with the same mind.

336
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,378
I hope you learn many things...

337
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:54,149
through EXchange.

338
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,888
If there will be a Season Three,

339
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,629
I hope I don't see you there.

340
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,829
You know what I mean, right?

341
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,199
They shouldn't break up.

342
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,528
You shouldn't break up.

343
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,699
If you break up with your lover, you'll appear in Season Three.

344
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,239
If you don't, you won't. You know what I mean, right?

345
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,568
(We know.)

346
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,769
"You know what I mean?"

347
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,240
Actually, we produced this show for one year.

348
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,078
So when we think of the participants,

349
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,278
we just think they are cute.

350
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,150
So, no matter what the ending is today,

351
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,989
I hope you will keep rooting...

352
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,758
for the participants.

353
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,130
Thank you so much.

354
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,828
Shall we go now?

355
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,829
- Are we watching from here? - Yes. We'll watch here.

356
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,029
Let's watch it together.

357
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,739
(They all sit down for the last immersion.)

358
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,809
Hello.

359
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,470
Enjoy, everyone.

360
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,578
I'm having my first stage greeting through EXchange.

361
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,649
I know.

362
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,779
It feels different watching from here.

363
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,449
(It feels more exciting to watch it on a larger screen.)

364
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,650
It's a movie.

365
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,329
The screen is too big.

366
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,729
Let's go!

367
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,700
Let's start.

368
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,200
(The day of the final decision begins.)

369
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,640
It's really big.

370
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,809
Amazing.

371
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,579
- Do you need more drinks? - I have it.

372
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,049
(Taking a peek at the group viewing of EXchange 2)

373
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,249
Her hair...

374
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,489
(They're watching the final episode of EXchange 2.)

375
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,720
Why is he lying down there?

376
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,430
(Final Decision: Sung Hae Eun chooses Jung Hyun Gyu.)

377
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:48,999
(Collection of Ki Seok, the creator of Hyun-Hae Couple)

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,069
See you tomorrow, Hae Eun.

379
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,140
We didn't see that.

380
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,308
(My babies are doing well.)

381
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,578
(Screaming)

382
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:01,909
(Screaming)

383
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,649
(Screaming)

384
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,119
(The viewers are getting too into the clip.)

385
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,890
(I can't get enough of this.)

386
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,190
Why did you like it so much?

387
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,729
What did you like so much?

388
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,989
- I love it. - I mean...

389
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,700
- Why did he whisper? - "Because you're pretty."

390
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,439
We haven't seen that before.

391
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,268
We haven't. What is this?

392
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,170
I was so surprised.

393
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,548
(Everyone gets immersed...)

394
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,849
(and starts screaming at the screen.)

395
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,420
(You can't help but feel excited for EXchange 2.)

396
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,119
Oh, dear.

397
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,430
(EXchange 2)

398
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,528
It was amazing.

399
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,069
(Everything on the schedule has been completed.)

400
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,179
Here we go.

401
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,349
One, two, three.

402
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,250
One, two, three.

403
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,358
I can't say goodbye.

404
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,629
Good work.

405
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,960
I'm so sad.

406
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,298
Look how much we cried.

407
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,940
- We used all our tissues. - We used them up.

408
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,868
It was so sad that I cried my eyes out.

409
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,778
I hope the three couples get married.

410
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,848
- Me too. - Seriously.

411
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,879
Keep your love alive for a long time.

412
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,949
I hope there's a happy ending for Na Eon and Tae I too.

413
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,789
I'm so happy. The last episode was legendary.

414
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:57,460
I could tell how much effort the crew put into it. I enjoyed it.

415
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,828
There's nothing I can ask for.

416
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:01,098
It was perfect as is.

417
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,930
- I want Season 3. - Please make Season 3!

418
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,569
I hope we won't be on the show.

419
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:19,779
(Why do you think people loved EXchange 2 so much?)

420
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,489
We wanted the viewers...

421
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,089
to follow the changes in the participants' feelings.

422
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:31,430
We tried to show...

423
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,598
what evoked certain emotions...

424
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,299
or changed their feelings in detail.

425
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,869
We included little details in the scenes...

426
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,539
in order to explain why and how their feelings changed in depth.

427
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,409
I think those little points...

428
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,180
helped the viewers understand better...

429
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,819
and relate to many scenes.

430
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:01,089
(What did you put the hardest work into?)

431
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,730
We put a lot of work into Ex Rooms in Season Two.

432
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,199
Even when we were choosing our participants,

433
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,538
their past relationships were the most important part.

434
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:16,869
Ex Rooms had to best show their dating history visually.

435
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,910
We've prepared Ex Rooms for each couple.

436
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,979
We worked hard for the rooms...

437
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,449
so that the participants can tell their relationship stories...

438
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,449
with symbols.

439
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,189
Our art director put a lot of thought...

440
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,390
into the artwork in the Ex Rooms too.

441
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,758
There was a big difference in the feelings...

442
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,528
of those who entered the room and those who didn't.

443
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,410
The rooms we put together helped the story develop.

444
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,879
Do you know the law of equivalent exchange?

445
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,220
What on earth is this?

446
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:04,318
(What are the best lines you can't deliver the same way?)

447
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,518
Until the last day, the one I wanted to be with...

448
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,229
(What are the best lines you can't deliver the same way?)

449
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,490
- It was you. - Right.

450
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,369
I liked the first thing Hee Doo said.

451
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,399
He said he wouldn't be fooled by how happy he was to see her.

452
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,140
I'm so happy to see you today.

453
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,338
But I won't be fooled by that.

454
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,039
(But I won't be fooled by that.)

455
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,119
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

456
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,920
It was a short line that summarized their relationship.

457
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,558
I thought I wouldn't have been able to come up with such a line.

458
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,390
When Hae Eun and Gyu Min reunited after a long time...

459
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,559
- We're so much older now. - Right?

460
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,000
We met at 21.

461
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,630
Now we're 29.

462
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,910
It showed how much time had passed,

463
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,069
so that line is also very memorable.

464
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,409
Why are you staring at me?

465
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,579
Because you're pretty.

466
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,318
(Say a few words for the EXchange 2 viewers.)

467
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,420
Goodness.

468
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,788
"Because you're pretty."

469
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,219
Our show had 20 episodes.

470
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,588
Even TV series have 12 to 16 episodes these days.

471
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:17,230
Some said our show had too many episodes.

472
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,700
We had no other choice...

473
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,899
because we wanted...

474
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,969
to squeeze our ten participants' stories into it.

475
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,439
We'd like to thank our viewers...

476
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,710
for joining us on the long journey.

477
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,939
I hope only good things happen to our participants.

478
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,379
I want to thank them...

479
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,720
for their sincerity on our show.

480
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,719
If you've been watching our show...

481
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,489
since Episode One,

482
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,288
you must feel close to the participants...

483
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:54,930
and have even developed friendships with them in your mind.

484
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,640
We wanted to be friends with them too.

485
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,970
