00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,570
I really don't know. I'm not sure.

166
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,340
He was different...

167
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,480
compared to the guys I had dated so far.

168
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,210
This is making me shy. Goodness. Oh, my.

169
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,850
He was the most supportive person here.

(Nam Hee Doo)

171
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,950
I'll follow my heart.

172
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,320
That's how I will make my decision.

173
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,830
(EXchange 2)

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,399
(Episode 20. Confession)

175
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,019
(Your ex is waiting for you at the address below.)

176
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,399
It would be simple if this was only about my final decision.

177
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,940
But the process of getting there... I had the most ups and downs.

178
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,909
(Your ex is on his way to you.)

179
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,649
I thought a lot about it.

180
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,190
I tried to see whom I was more emotionally invested in.

181
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,419
That was my focus.

182
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,429
So I decided to choose the person who made me laugh the most.

183
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,700
(Tae I has arrived.)

184
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,940
Hello.

185
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,450
Gosh. I thought I was going to pass out from waiting.

186
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,620
It says you're going to tell your feelings to someone,

187
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,019
so I have to drive you there.

188
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,169
Tae I, you know that I care a lot about you. Right?

189
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,169
Yes.

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,370
Why did you drink until late last night?

191
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,710
Hee Doo said he couldn't make up his mind.

192
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,279
That's why.

193
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,309
- I just chose... - Yes.

194
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,120
the person who made me laugh the most for the past three weeks.

195
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,789
- The person you had fun with? - Yes.

196
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,789
I realized that yesterday.

197
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,200
The person who had a positive influence on me.

198
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:07,830
But I still deeply care about you.

199
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,340
And you also knew how I was feeling...

200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
before I made up my mind.

201
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,340
But...

202
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,909
How come I can't seem to talk in front of you?

203
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,720
- Why can't you talk? - What?

204
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,019
Why can't you talk?

205
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,990
It just happens that way.

206
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,889
Anyway, it was hard to decide until the last moment too.

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,299
- You won't say anything? - What?

208
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,669
You don't have anything to say to me?

209
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,200
What do you want me to say?

210
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,269
Tae I... He still didn't say anything to me then.

211
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,879
I realized that there was a reason behind my decision...

212
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,610
when he was driving me.

213
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,120
It's just like Ariana Grande's song, "Thank U, Next."

214
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,389
Well, I didn't mean to be distant.

215
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,460
I thought getting emotional with her...

216
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,799
wouldn't be fair to the person I was going to see next.

217
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,529
I know what you're trying to say.

218
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,840
I know that I didn't express myself to you.

219
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,570
But you didn't do that either.

220
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,710
Right. It looked like you were doing well. So I didn't.

221
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,379
I do feel bad.

222
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,879
Actually, she did express to me...

223
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,980
that she was having a hard time.

224
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,590
Tae I didn't try...

225
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,059
to change who I was.

226
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,330
He didn't try to control me either.

227
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,159
He admired me like a cute being.

228
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,460
Are you going to take something out?

229
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,669
Hey, don't make it obvious.

230
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,779
Who will you ask out on a date? Ask me out.

231
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,179
(She cared about Tae I from the bottom of her heart.)

232
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,419
(He knew about her immature way of expressing her affection.)

233
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,419
I hate you.

234
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,360
What if it included me too?

235
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,029
- If it included you too? - Yes.

236
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,929
What if you could choose your ex too?

237
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,200
It was affection.

238
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,629
I was truly worried about him and had affection toward him.

239
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,769
I knew that you would know.

240
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,070
To be honest, I've never met anyone like Hee Doo.

241
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,179
I haven't met anyone like him.

242
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,509
He's full of energy.

243
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,379
Choosing someone who made me laugh a lot...

244
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,779
was being true to myself in the end.

245
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,629
We're here.

246
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,840
(You will now make your final decision.)

247
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,470
(If you get out of the car, you have chosen someone new.)

248
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,240
(If you don't get out of the car, you have chosen Keem Tae I.)

249
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,509
Good luck to you.

250
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm here as her ex-boyfriend.

251
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,519
If possible, I would like us to talk from time to time like good friends.

252
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,590
As for those difficult moments she had, I want to turn them into...

253
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,889
nostalgic moments we can share later.

254
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,559
I learned a lot about love and the relationships...

255
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,259
I had been in so far.

256
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,529
I want to be in a better relationship.

257
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,840
This doesn't only pertain to Tae I.

258
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
It includes all of my exes.

259
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,139
I think she needs someone who can help her stand strong...

260
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,350
the most.

261
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,149
Tae I. I'll always wish you happiness.

262
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,590
- Bye. - Bye.

263
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,029
- Bye. - Good luck.

264
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,200
- Bye. - Okay.

265
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,110
She's going to break the door.

266
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,970
(Your ex is waiting for you at the address below.)

267
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,509
(Your ex is on his way to you.)

268
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,690
After hearing that Hyun Gyu was picking me up,

269
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,900
I figured I should tell him about how I felt...

270
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,029
on our date yesterday.

271
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Get in.

272
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,549
Oh, gosh.

273
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,619
(Your ex is going to ask someone out.)

274
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,960
(Please escort her there.)

275
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,869
- You look pretty today. - Thanks.

276
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,339
How's the temperature?

277
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,670
It's good. Perfect, actually.

278
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,180
I had a lot of fun with you yesterday.

279
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:27,910
- It's been a while. - Me too.

280
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,009
I joked about it being a waste of time.

281
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,420
- It's fine. - But it was better than expected.

282
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,819
Anyway,

283
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,119
spending time with you yesterday cleared my head a bit.

284
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,190
Same here.

285
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,529
I got to think about where we stand...

286
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,829
and more about myself.

287
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:47,930
It seems as though I had been upset in a way...

288
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,529
that didn't occur to me.

289
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,400
Of course.

290
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,769
Spending time with him yesterday...

291
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:58,380
got me to relieve some of the resentment I had.

292
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,950
I never thought of him as someone who'd cry.

293
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,180
Our heart-to-heart conversation yesterday...

294
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,849
dissolved any leftover resentment.

295
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,859
And because of that, our time together was worth it.

296
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,160
What was it like to see me again?

297
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,390
I missed you.

298
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,130
We're not here to get back together.

299
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,299
Right.

300
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,599
I just want us to be good friends.

301
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,730
Same here.

302
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,640
I'm glad I came onto the show.

303
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:29,839
If I hadn't, I don't think things would've been good.

304
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,109
We'd be all right individually,

305
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,279
- but not as friends. - Exactly.

306
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,549
I didn't want us to end on a sour note.

307
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,779
Same here.

308
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,750
But now, we're more like good friends.

309
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,150
Don't we want the best for each other?

310
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,220
- Right. - That's how it is for me.

311
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,690
I want the best for you as well.

312
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,430
I said so during my interview.

313
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,299
That you dating someone else...

314
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,769
wouldn't make me angrier than you dating an inadequate guy.

315
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,400
- I said the same thing. - Really?

316
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,869
Yes, and I want you to be with someone nice.

317
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,009
Someone sweet and kind.

318
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,750
If I'm being honest, I'm very fond of myself.

319
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,319
- The person I am right now. - Yourself?

320
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,180
I like who I am,

321
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,690
and I think I'll like who I will be in the future.

322
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,750
I see.

323
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,759
If it weren't for you,

324

Not liking who I am now is my own issue.

I don't regret dating you.

When it comes to dating, she doesn't keep it casual.

The man she likes would be someone decent.

- No way. - You're right.

Even though his voice was distorted.

00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,799
It's the same for me.

485
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,769
I get along with you so well,

486
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,539
and I found myself saying things to you...

487
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,450
that I didn't expect to say here.

488
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,549
Until the last day, the one I wanted to be with...

489
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,150
(Until the last day, the one I wanted to be with...)

490
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,549
- It was you. - Right.

491
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,119
(It was you.)

492
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,720
Spending more time with you...

493
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,430
only made it more certain.

494
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,960
Being with you...

495
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,099
It's like my choice was you all along.

496
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,200
(It's like my choice was you all along.)

497
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,369
That's how it is.

498
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,279
I called you here to tell you that.

499
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:28,950
Got it.

500
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,410
How nice.

501
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,490
And I came here to hear you say that.

502
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,549
Gosh.

503
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,630
"And I came here to hear you say that."

504
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,690
That...

505
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,930
It was cool.

506
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,930
Her words struck me in the head,

507
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,029
and I was impressed.

508
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,630
I like women who I'm impressed with.

509
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,170
Her looks don't matter as much.

510
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,109
I'm not one to have high self-esteem,

511
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,440
so I found it to be cool.

512
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,710
She has qualities that I don't possess.

513
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,509
Everything about her is cool.

514
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,390
This is nice.

515
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,960
During the past ten days,

516
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,759
we have gotten comfortable with each other.

517
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,160
He's funny, and we joked around a lot.

518
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,130
He's very cute as well.

519
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,700
Tae I's attitude and behavior...

520
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,039
haven't changed at all.

521
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,200
He's exactly the same.

522
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,640
Getting to know him on our dates...

523
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,339
made me see him in a different way.

524
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,779
(The awkward first encounter)

525
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,319
You're the first person I'm getting to meet.

526
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,750
Why did you choose me of all people?

527
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,619
At first, I was puzzled.

528
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,430
He seemed inconsiderate in a way,

529
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,359
but I got to learn that he's the complete opposite.

530
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,099
He's considerate of those around him.

531
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,470
It's for you.

532
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,869
- Is this a gift? - Yes.

533
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,970
He had the GPS system on mute...

534
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:05,910
so that I could sleep in silence.

535
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,180
(Subtle but considerate)

536
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,880
Make me look cute.

537
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,880
Sure.

538
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,650
He's considerate,

539
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,750
prudent,

540
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,819
and mature.

541
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,289
- Did that hurt? - A little.

542
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:25,599
That's what I liked about him.

543
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,329
I was surprised whenever I talked to Na Eon.

544
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,299
I never know what to say,

545
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,170
but as soon as we meet,

546
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,900
I can't stop thinking about things to say.

547
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:36,569
- Quantum mechanics. - Quantum mechanics.

548
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,980
Rothko and Picasso.

549
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,410
Do you like Rothko's work?

550
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,910
- Yes. - He's my favorite artist too.

551
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,309
I even have an art book of his work at home.

552
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,710
(When you find a common interest)

553
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,250
- The buns kneaded... - Kneaded?

554
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,789
(When you burst into laughter over nothing)

555
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,789
- I'm exhausted. - In 1, 2, 3.

556
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,190
Why did you keep choosing me?

557
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,890
You're funny, and I'm comfortable around you. Also, you're cute.

558
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,930
The more I talk to her, the more I have to say.

559
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,829
That's why I like her.

560
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,170
(That's why I like her.)

561
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,869
(He realizes his feelings for her.)

562
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,210
I'm happy.

563
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,940
Happiness isn't far away.

564

(I'm happy. Happiness isn't far away.)

565
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,369
Anyway,

566
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,670
the last day actually came.

567
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,440
- Tell me about it. - I thought it wouldn't.

568
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,769
Time flew by for me.

569
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,470
Me too. The trip to Jeju made it that way.

570
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,839
- It's nice. - Yes, it's cold.

571
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,079
- I said that it's nice. - Really?

572
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,950
- That it's nice? - Yes.

573
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,380
Come by the cafe when we're back in Seoul.

574
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,650
I'll make you coffee.

575
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,849
I'll drop by.

576
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,690
Good.

577
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,390
Do you want me to take a photo?

578
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,829
The sun looks incredible.

579
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,099
It's behind you though, so...

580
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,670
The backlight is insane.

581
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,369
You're all black.

582
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,769
The sun looks great though.

583
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,410
Let me take a photo of you too.

584
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:20,180
You look really cool right now.

585
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,079
And I'll take a photo of you.

586
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:32,259
- You look so cool. - What are you talking about?

587
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,660
- Shall we go? - Shall we go?

588
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,539
I'd love braised hairtail.

589
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,470
That's what you say...

590
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,970
- when I'm here with you? - I mean...

591
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,380
"Give me half of your life, and I'll give you half of mine."

592
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,420
Isn't that the chant about the equivalent exchange...

593
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,990
that is said when drawing up a magical contract?

594
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,990
I guess so.

595
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,619
- You don't know what it is, do you? - I don't.

596
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,730
What I received was a crash course.

597
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:14,799
The fact that I got to spend time with you...

598
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,029
makes me a lucky person.

599
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,869
Thank you for letting it happen.

600
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,839
I hope we get along when we go back to Seoul.

601
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,410
Na Eon.

602
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,809
I'll see you in Seoul.

603
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,450
The sky looks amazing.

604
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,150
How about some braised hairtail?

605
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,019
That sounds delicious.

606
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,519
I'm going to eat until my stomach explodes.

607
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,000
- It's a happy ending for them. - Yes, a happy ending.

608
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,440
What a good-looking couple.

609
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,309
One down, guys.

610
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,309
- One down? - That's right.

611
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,279
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

612
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,450
It's like sending your kid off to school.

613
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,590
- And it's what we expected. - That's right.

614
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,260
- I hope it works out for them. - Me too.

615
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,320
- They look great together. - I hope they fall in love.

616
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,099
We're curious too because this was filmed months ago.

617
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,960
- But we don't know... - If they're still together.

618
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,969
That's right. We'd love...

619
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,469
to inform the viewers,

620
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,539
- but we're also clueless. - Exactly.

621
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,699
- All we can do is hope. - That's right.

622
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,309
I hope they're still together.

623
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:32,340
- Aren't they a sweet couple? - They are.

624
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,940
I hope they're going strong...

625
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,550
- eating delicious food together. - Right.

(Your ex is on his way to you.)

630

I was thinking, "Why is he coming to get me?"

631
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,409
"Maybe he's taking me somewhere else."

632
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,250
So I just waited.

After talking to Ji Soo,

636
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,530
I was able to check my feelings for Ji Soo...

637
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,429
that I wasn't aware of.

638
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,199
That caused a conflict between us.

639
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,099
And I felt bad for her because of that.

640

But now, I'm rather grateful for her.

I'll reflect those feelings on my final decision...

00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:41,769
Goodness.

646
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,610
Did you wait long?

647
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,809
- No. - Are you cold?

648
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,480
- Yes. - I'll lower the AC.

649
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,090
(Your ex is going to ask someone out.)

650
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,960
(You may change your ex's heart while giving her a ride.)

651
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,929
- Are you supposed to go somewhere? - Yes.

652
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,659
- Ready? - Yes.

653
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,869
Did they tell you anything?

654
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
No.

655
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:22,139
I received a message.

656
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,210
What message?

657
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,550
That this is my last conversation with you today.

658
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,920
And that you're going to ask someone out.

659
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:37,630
But why is my ex here?

660
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,630
So we can talk before you go.

661
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,929
Who did you choose?

662
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,440
Me?

663
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:54,710
(Won Bin does not answer.)

664
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,449
I've been thinking about it.

665
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,280
My time here with you...

666
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,420
was the best and meant a lot.

667
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,820
I'm grateful and sorry.

668
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,889
All kinds of emotions occurred when I was with you.

669
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,329
We became a layover for each other.

670
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,409
Yet I liked that layover so much.

671
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,409
(Ji Soo is the person I loved the most in my life.)

672
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,280
(I want Won Bin to be loved...)

673
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,429
(than love someone.)

674
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:51,429
(3 years and 4 months after their breakup,)

675
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:57,210
(they faced each other again wishing for each other's happiness.)

676
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,610
Do you want your ex to do well here?

677
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,909
Of course.

678
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:03,050
I want her to meet someone nice.

679
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,710
Before, I thought,

680
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,420
"If you meet someone new, I'm going to hate you."

681
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,949
(He was happy just to see Ji Soo smiling.)

682
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:15,289
You're good.

683
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:22,360
(The time he spent without realizing his feelings for Ji Soo)

684
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:26,440
I met you after the Ex Room.

685
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:32,480
At the time,

686
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,050
you were overwhelmed a bit.

687
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,679
That broke my heart so much.

688
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,820
That was...

689
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,389
What? That I said it might be the last time?

690
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yes.

691
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,440
We have nine minutes left.

692
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,550
Are you crying?

693
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,119
Something went into my eye.

694
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,559
I suddenly became overwhelmed.

695
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,599
It suddenly reminded me of the past.

696
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,599
Because Won Bin was so emotional,

697
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,039
I suppressed it on purpose.

698
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,920
I could feel that he was tearful.

699
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,920
If I'd cried,

700
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,989
he would've wailed.

701
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,960
Because I knew,

702
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,230
I held it back until the end.

703
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,329
Cry if you want to.

704
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,230
When will I get to see you crying again?

705
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,469
This could be the last time.

706
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,980
It might be the last time laughing or crying.

707
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,409
Stop talking like you're in a drama.

708
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,480
I didn't.

709
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,519
"It might be the last time laughing or crying."

710
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,289
- My goodness. - I wanted a cheerful ending.

711
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,150
I wanted to end it with a smile.

712
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,719
So I made jokes.

713
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:29,019
We're almost there.

714
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,230
- Are we? - Yes.

715
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:34,559
Because you're calm,

716
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,300
it's less sad.

717
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,519
(You will now make your final decision.)

718
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,949
(If you get out of the car, you have chosen someone new.)

719
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,420
(If you don't get out of the car, you have chosen Park Won Bin.)

720
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,460
What?

721
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,170
Thank you for the ride.

722
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,280
Do you know who I chose?

723
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,449
- You don't know, do you? - No.

724
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,320
- I'm curious though. - So you leave without knowing.

725
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,760
- What? - Who did you choose?

726
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,000
Me?

727
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,829
- If you... - You.

728
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,300
- What? - Me?

729
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,239
I was going to say you can tell me if you want.

730
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,469
I chose you.

731
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:57,250
I just chose you.

732
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,780
- You just chose me? - What do you think?

733
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,489
I chose you because I like you the most.

734
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,719
Still,

735
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,230
I loved you the most.

736
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:17,429
Thanks.

737
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:21,900
Thank you.

738
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,949
Bye.

739
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,650
You're not going to tell me?

740
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,250
You'll eventually find out.

741
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,150
- Just tell me... - Shake my hand.

742
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,920
Drive safe.

743
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,730
Okay.

744
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,599
- Bye. - Good luck.

745
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,159
- Yes. - See you later.

746
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,480
Hello.

747
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,679
I know Won Bin is diligent...

748
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,389
and thoughtful. I know that.

749
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,230
That's his charm,

750
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,699
and I'm sure someone will recognize it.

751
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,429
I hope he doesn't lose it.

752
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm sure...

753
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,409
the memories I made here...

754
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:33,780
will be happy memories...

755
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
when I look back later.

756
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,349
Thank you...

757
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,250
for the happy memories.

758
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,030
(Won Bin and Ji Soo left the layover.)

759
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:09,210
(Someone is waiting to ask you out.)

760
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,480
(Move to the location below and give her your answer.)

761
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:29,929
(Someone wants to ask Gyu Min out.)

762
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:40,980
(Final Decision: Kim Ji Soo chooses Jung Gyu Min.)

763
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,449
I decided to choose Gyu Min.

764
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,420
I thought he was a nice guy.

765
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,750
When I had a hard time on Jeju Island,

766
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,150
he was there for me.

767
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,230
I want to keep seeing him...

768
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,030
even after this, so I chose him.

769
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,760
Hi.

770
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,829
Parking must've been tough.

771
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:32,960
Yes.

772
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:38,130
It's awkward seeing you like this.

773
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,800
It's awkward to sit here like this.

774
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,010
- How did it go yesterday? - Yesterday?

775
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:46,280
- You went on a zip line. - Yes.

776
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,440
Didn't you get sick?

777
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:50,510
I'm not that bad.

778
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:54,650
The submarine had a narrow view.

779
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:59,050
I'm glad we went on a date a lot.

780
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,960
When will we get to go climbing...

781
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,530
and go on a submarine again?

782
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,130
Right?

783
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:08,699
What's this?

784
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,230
Guess what?

785
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,440
- Tomorrow, - Yes.

786
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,969
go on a date with me.

787
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,909
- Switch? - Yes.

788
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:23,610
I preferred him the most from the beginning.

789
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,949
You wrote it well.

790
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,320
- What's your favorite? - Chocolate.

791
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,449
I bought chocolate.

792
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,960
(It's for you. Enjoy your chocolate.)

793
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,820
- One who is good at it looks cool. - Yes.

794
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,789
You could fall in love while climbing.

795
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,699
Though we drifted apart halfway,

796
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:48,340
he always took good care of me.

797
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,610
The text said,

798
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,840
"Confess your feelings."

799
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,610
That's what it said.

800
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:00,179
Did you expect me to choose you?

801
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,849
I know how you feel.

802
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:07,590
- I know that. - It was fun to spend time with you.

803
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,530
I was grateful.

804
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:16,000
I never said it before,

805
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,400
but we were on the same wavelength here.

806
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,869
- You're very smart. - I am?

807
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:25,070
Yes, totally.

808
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,139
You always said I was foolish.

809
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,380
That was...

810
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,480
In a nice way. I meant you were cute.

811
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,250
I was saying you have the charm...

812
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,550
to disarm people.

813
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,119
There are only a few people I can tell what they're thinking...

814
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,130
from just looking at their eyes in here.

815
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:47,329
And I think you're one of them.

816
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,929
Is there anything you want to say before we go?

817
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,400
- Before we go? - Yes.

818
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,800
I want you to be happy.

819
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,239
You're a good guy.

820
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,309
Finish it well.

821
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,739
I should.

822
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,150
Good luck.

823
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:07,880
I will...

824
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,849
- See you later. - Bye.

825
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,750
- Bye. - See you.

826
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:28,070
(Your ex is waiting for you at the address below.)

827
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,420
I've made up my mind.

828
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:51,989
I choose Na Yeon.

829
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,829
I enjoyed spending time with Na Yeon the most.

830
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,670
I think I liked her...

831
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,530
the most.

832
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,670
If I had a day...

833
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,110
Or even less than a day.

834
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,309
If I had dinner with Hae Eun at least,

835
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,050
I would've contemplated more than now.

836
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,079
Yesterday,

837
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,389
my feelings for Hae Eun suddenly grew so much.

838
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,320
I don't know.

839
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,960
It's confusing.

840
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,099
This is the first time I feel this way since I came here.

841
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,800
I really don't know.

842
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,650
(It's time to decide her heart.)

843
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,559
I don't know.

844
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,230
After I came to Jeju,

845
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,199
Hyun Gyu appeared like magic.

846
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,769
During the time I was with Hyun Gyu,

847
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:12,510
he expressed his feelings a lot.

848
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,650
He tried to embrace my wound.

849
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,880
That melted my heart.

850
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,719
I was thankful.

851
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,190
It was a very short time,

852
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:30,389
but you were still very nice to me, and you really cheered me up.

853
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,800
I hope Jeju Island reminds you of me.

854
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,469
Let's be happy.

855
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:46,579
- I am. - Even happier than now.

856
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,739
One thing for sure. I was happy thanks to you.

857
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:52,079
Above all,

858
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,920
I expressed my feelings...

859
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,289
for Gyu Min every day.

860
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,360
I liked him, so I didn't care.

861
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,760
Yet I could see that it didn't change his heart.

862
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,099
He kept giving me a cold stare.

863
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,699
I cried all day yesterday.

864
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:15,440
When it was time to leave, he suddenly started crying.

865
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,739
I was surprised. I didn't see that coming.

866
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:23,250
That was the first time...

867
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,519
he expressed his feelings.

868
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,619
(A date with ex yesterday)

869
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:32,449
It's sad that we didn't get to spend more time here.

870
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,659
I thought we'd have more time together.

871
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,559
Were you happy to be with me today?

872
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,159
Why are you crying?

873
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,570
Why are you crying?

874
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,909
We could've spent a good time, right?

875
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,409
It's suddenly over.

876
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,280
Hyun Gyu was winning...

877
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,250
by 51 to 49.

878
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,090
But yesterday...

879
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,019
After yesterday...

880
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:14,099
Gyu Min who meant the world to me...

881
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,969
suddenly expressed his feelings.

882
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,769
I don't know.

883
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,469
Because Gyu Min meant so much to me,

884
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,739
I contemplated so much.

885
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,230
(Your ex is on his way to you.)

886
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,190
(He's going to Hae Eun.)

887
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,690
Yesterday,

888
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:23,570
I spent time alone to think about it.

889
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,000
So...

890
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,900
while spending time here,

891
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,940
I tried to keep my distance from her.

892
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,309
So...

893
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,349
I wanted to tell her I was sorry for giving her a hard time.

894
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,440
Even after that,

895
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,539
if she still chooses Hyun Gyu,

896
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,539
I wanted to let her go...

897
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,750
with happiness.

898
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:19,349
(He reached Hae Eun.)

899
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,000
Hi.

900
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:35,239
Were you pretending to open the door for me?

901
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,639
I was going to open the door for you.

902
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,539
- You were only going to pretend. - I was going to.

903
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:39,610
Just open the door.

904
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,480
Were you at the lodging?

905
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,550
Yes.

906
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,179
Was it hard yesterday?

907
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,590
Why?

908
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,889
We had fun yesterday.

909
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,789
Yes.

910
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:59,130
Did you enjoy the date?

911
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,530
It was hard for me yesterday.

912
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,159
Why?

913
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,539
I cried too much yesterday, didn't I?

914
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,429
I thought that would be the last time.

915
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,829
- That date? - Yes.

916
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:39,170
That's how I accepted it...

917
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,940
from your eyes, your look, your heart, and your speech.

918
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:43,869
From everything.

919
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,039
I felt miserable.

920
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,250
I pretended to look cheerful,

921
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,880
and I tried to talk to you, but...

922
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:00,190
I wanted you to...

923
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:03,119
be nicer to me.

924
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,989
That's why you cried so much.

925
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,769
Yesterday,

926
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,340
I actually...

927
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,179
felt bad for you.

928
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:21,739
I had a hard time.

929
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,480
I'm curious...

930
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,210
what gave you a hard time.

931
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:30,750
While we were spending time together,

932
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:34,420
you showed...

933
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,260
that you still had feelings left for me.

934
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,730
Yet, you liked someone else.

935
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:45,070
It was confusing for me.

936
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:46,670
Why...

937
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,840
"What is her intention?"

938
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,309
When...

939
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,780
there was something going on between you and Hyun Gyu,

940
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,280
I was jealous.

941
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:01,250
I was jealous,

942
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,619
but if I showed it,

943
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,360
it'd have ruined your relationship.

944
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,829
So you were jealous.

945
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,429
I had no idea.

946
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,730
I was jealous.

947
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,599
I had no idea.

948
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,199
If I showed it, it'd only give you a hard time.

949
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,969
You could've still shown it.

950
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:25,269
Even if it's tough, I can still make a decision.

951
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,440
If you were jealous,

952
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,579
you...

953
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:34,920
You could've just expressed it with a sigh.

954
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,349
I thought if I did that,

955
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,090
that would only hurt...

956
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,389
both you and the person I like.

957
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,429
Anyone would get hurt here.

958
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,260
If you say...

959
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,199
you couldn't do anything for me considering that,

960
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,900
that hurts my feelings.

961
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,969
It hurts my feelings big time.

962
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:58,940
So I regretted it yesterday.

963
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,980
I should've just said...

964
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,380
I was jealous,

965
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,719
and that I didn't want to see that.

966
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:12,789
I thought you didn't mind. I thought you didn't care.

967
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,190
That's not true.

968
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,030
You didn't have to be so cold. You were a fool.

969
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,500
You were so cold to me in the cafe and before that.

970
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,300
I have to say I wasn't happy.

971
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:29,969
That's so stupid.

972
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,510
You should've followed your heart.

973
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,780
(You should've followed your heart.)

974
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,880
When I faced you yesterday,

975
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,349
that was most memorable.

976
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,559
Because...

977
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:52,090
you looked at me and smiled at me.

978
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,829
So I was happy.

979
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:57,969
When we were in the cafe,

980
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:01,369
I was really relaxed.

981
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,239
I felt comfortable.

982
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,869
Since then,

983
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:09,210
I enjoyed it,

984
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,250
and I was happy.

985
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,280
Then it suddenly stopped.

986
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,119
That was a shame.

987
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:20,590
I was disappointed.

988
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,960
I was happy that you were disappointed.

989
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,329
And I was surprised...

990
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,699
because it was the first time...

991
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,199
in three weeks...

992
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,099
that you showed your tears.

993
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,840
Right.

994
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,840
I should've just told you.

995
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,440
I wished you had told me.

996
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,949
Even after seven years, I still wouldn't know.

997
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:47,980
I told you. You still need to tell me.

998
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,650
To tell you now,

999
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:56,389
I missed you so much yesterday.

1000
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,889
I missed you so much,

1001
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,500
so I looked at the photos in the car.

1002
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,369
I couldn't stop crying.

1003
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,840
Looking at the photos of us together.

1004
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:14,539
It felt like I was in that time again.

1005
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:16,179
I cried so much.

1006
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,380
- It felt like that time again. - Yes.

1007
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,289
(After the date with Hae Eun)

1008
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:58,789
I've never thought...

1009
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:01,489
that I wanted to spend some time with Hae Eun.

1010
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:02,719
But yesterday...

1011
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,300
After our date,

1012
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,900
when I saw the photos of Hae Eun...

1013
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:18,809
all smiling in my photo album,

1014
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,349
it felt like the old days.

1015
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:37,059
That's why it was so hard on me.

1016
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,309
I think all those years we dated...

1017
01:02:57,309 --> 01:03:01,280
means a lot more than I thought it would.

1018
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:04,219
The years we spent together...

1019
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,659
were much more powerful than I thought.

1020
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,739
It would've been nice if we had dinner together.

1021
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,179
He told me that he cried after our date.

1022
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,650
And that it reminded him of the old days,

1023
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,179
that he was disappointed.

1024
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:38,320
He also said it was hard on him after the date.

1025
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,719
I became sad all of a sudden,

1026
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:44,829
so I resented him. It was sad too.

1027
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:46,289
I was resentful.

1028
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,599
That's why I cried a lot.

1029
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:52,670
You could've given me a place in your heart.

1030
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,500
Here, I didn't have much time to see you,

1031
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,070
But in Seoul,

1032
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,639
you could've sat next to me.

1033
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,780
You plucked up my courage to see you in your room,

1034
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,550
but you kicked me out.

1035
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,019
I'm sorry.

1036
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:21,659
Thinking back, I felt bad for everything I did to her.

1037
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,469
The things I did for her sake...

1038
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,739
actually made her have a more difficult time.

1039
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,869
I was reminded of those moments, so I felt bad.

1040
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,550
Were you ever swayed after you saw me?

1041
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,250
I was swayed a lot.

1042
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,150
You were?

1043
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:50,829
I can't believe it.

1044
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:55,530
I had a really hard time yesterday, and I was swayed a lot too.

1045
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:01,039
It was only a brief moment in the cafe,

1046
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:02,769
but it hit me hard.

1047
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:06,570
It really reminded me of the old days.

1048
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,579
Also,

1049
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,650
we didn't get to have nice dates.

1050
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,650
So I was sad that we didn't get to.

1051
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:19,719
Our relationship was getting better.

1052
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:28,329
He said he regretted treating me badly...

1053
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:30,559
and that he felt bad.

1054
01:05:31,369 --> 01:05:35,239
He suddenly said he was swayed.

1055
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,610
When he said he was,

1056
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,880
I wanted to get back together with him.

1057
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,550
What do you think would've happened if we were given one more week?

1058
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,550
After today.

1059
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,190
I think things would've changed...

1060
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,889
because of what happened yesterday.

1061
01:05:57,489 --> 01:06:01,030
Why did we always have the worst timing?

1062
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,960
That's how it was in Jeju.

1063
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,230
We had plenty of time in Seoul.

1064
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:10,940
That's why I regret it.

1065
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,940
Would you have texted me if we were given one more week?

1066
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,849
Really?

1067
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:23,849
Actually,

1068
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,159
if we could send texts yesterday, I would've sent it to you.

1069
01:06:30,389 --> 01:06:31,530
For sure.

1070
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:41,570
Then it would've been my first.

1071
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,650
It would've been my first.

1072
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:05,559
Just hearing you say it makes me happy.

1073
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:15,769
You're not lying, are you?

1074
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:21,079
I told you. It was only a brief moment,

1075
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,579
but I was swayed a lot yesterday.

1076
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:27,679
A lot would have changed.

1077
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:33,750
If you opened your heart to me...

1078
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,690
a little earlier,

1079
01:07:36,389 --> 01:07:38,860
then a lot would've changed.

1080
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,900
It's so disappointing.

1081
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:49,269
I would've gotten a text from you for the first time.

1082
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:53,969
I've never gotten a text from Gyu Min in here,

1083
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:58,309
so if we could send texts that day, it would've been my first text.

1084
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,449
I was happy to hear that...

1085
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,119
but was sad because I was reminded of the difficult times I had.

1086
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,949
I cried my heart out because I was upset.

1087
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,260
I'm happy that we got to talk like this, at least.

1088
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,860
Stop crying now.

1089
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,859
I cry when I'm happy and sad.

1090
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:21,000
Just know that I did all those to make you suffer less.

1091
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,069
I'm sorry.

1092
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:27,810
I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd have a hard time until the end.

1093
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,649
But I'm okay now that I know...

1094
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:38,289
that you didn't mean all those things.

1095
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,560
It's all in the past now.

1096
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:54,069
I'm sorry for everything I did in Seoul.

1097
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:06,449
(Someone is waiting to ask your ex out. Move with your ex.)

1098
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:12,520
(Someone who is going to ask Hae Eun out)

1099
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,409
From the beginning to the end, it was always Hae Eun.

1100
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:43,520
Someone whom I wanted to get to know and date.

1101
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,289
Someone I wanted to choose.

1102
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,659
I've never thought of choosing someone else for my final decision.

1103
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,859
I don't regret it at all.

(Final Decision: Jung Hyun Gyu chooses Sung Hae Eun.)

1105

I thought, "The time has come."

1106
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:02,069
"What do I do?" That's all I thought about.

1107
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,810
I was swayed.

1108
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:10,310
Seeing her made it more difficult.

1109
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,510
But...

1110
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,960
We should go.

1111
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:23,920
I'll set off.

1112
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:27,029
Are you okay?

1113
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,010
- It's already night. - I know, right?

1114
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:50,020
I always chose your car...

1115
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:53,520
whenever we had to ride a car.

1116
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,520
It was funny.

1117
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:59,760
It was funny.

1118
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:05,369
Seriously.

1119
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,500
The good times were really short.

1120
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:15,039
It was very difficult.

1121
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:21,079
It was all because of you.

1122
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,420
It was all because of you.

1123
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:28,359
I didn't want to be this cold.

1124

I really didn't know you'd have a hard time until the end.

1125
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,729
Of course, I would. You meant a lot to me.

1126
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:43,739
Are you done crying?

1127
01:11:44,409 --> 01:11:46,970
No, my tears never dry.

1128
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,909
I might have cried what I would have cried for three years.

1129
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,449
During the three weeks.

1130
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,489
You also wouldn't have felt good watching me.

1131

01:13:34,449 --> 01:13:36,319
Get out of the car when you want to.

1138
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:43,659
Hyun Gyu was in front of me, and Gyu Min was next to me.

1139
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:47,689
I did have a conflicting mind between those two.

1140
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,600
When I saw Hyun Gyu after spending time with Gyu Min,

1141
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,569
he was looking at me...

1142
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:56,270
with very reliable eyes.

1143
01:13:56,670 --> 01:14:00,770
It was like he was telling me to stop crying.

1144
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:04,680
I was confused with all the emotions.

1145
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:06,909
I had many thoughts.

1146
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,659
I thought about this a lot last night.

1147
01:14:20,029 --> 01:14:23,260
Like you just said,

1148
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,699
I could have just...

1149
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:29,539
been more honest with you.

1150
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:33,510
Maybe that would have made you feel better.

1151
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:35,680
Would that have made our relationship better?

1152
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,180
That was what I thought.

1153
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:40,279
Of course.

1154
01:14:40,779 --> 01:14:41,949
I felt sorry.

1155
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,420
You never gave me a place in your heart.

1156
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,590
I couldn't approach you.

1157
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,130
I thought if I tried to be nice to you as well...

1158
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,600
and we became closer,

1159
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,869
it wasn't fair for you...

1160
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:10,279
because I was influencing you too much.

1161
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,289
You treated me like that.

1162
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:23,689
We were together for the most number of years,

1163
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,930
and we would have had the deepest relationship.

1164
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,970
But it felt like we had the weakest relationship.

1165
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,670
I always missed you...

1166
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,680
and longed for you.

1167
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:44,680
I was the only one looking at you.

1168
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,250
That made me very lonely.

1169
01:15:50,819 --> 01:15:51,949
I'm sorry.

1170
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:57,930
You should have come to say sorry if you were sorry.

1171
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:00,859
I was going to say that yesterday.

1172
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,239
I wanted to tell you that I should have been nicer.

1173
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,039
But I couldn't.

1174
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:17,380
Thank you for thinking like that and telling me.

1175
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:21,680
- It's a relief. - What is?

1176
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:25,489
- That I said it now. - I'm very glad too.

1177
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:38,470
I'm really sorry.

1178
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:42,170
I should have gone a little closer to you.

1179
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:48,039
Don't cry.

1180
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:51,109
I would have tried more if you did that.

1181
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,979
Stop crying.

1182
01:16:59,989 --> 01:17:03,989
You never comforted me whenever I was crying like this.

1183
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,569
Don't cry.

1184
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:28,979
It feels like a dream that you're comforting me like this.

1185
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,489
I'm thankful for this time...

1186
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,289
because I can be with you.

1187
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,869
She would have had a lot to say.

1188
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,239
It was natural that Hae Eun...

1189
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,109
still had feelings for him.

1190
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:02,279
The seven years' time means a lot.

1191
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,069
I kept my distance...

1192
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,369
because I wanted to respect your decision.

1193
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,739
I didn't want to ruin it.

1194
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,210
It doesn't look like you cried now.

1195
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,289
It doesn't show.

1196
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,500
(This is Sung Hae Eun's number.)

1197
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,270
(Call her to express your feelings.)

1198
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,439
This is suffocating.

1199
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,270
Right next to her...

1200
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,010
(This is Sung Hae Eun's number.)

1201
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,979
(Call her to express your feelings.)

1202
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:24,359
Hello.

1203
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,699
Hae Eun.

1204
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,470
You've been waiting for a long time.

1205
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,710
I enjoyed the time...

1206
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,579
in Jeju.

1207
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,079
I was happy.

1208
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,279
(I was happy.)

1209
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,060
And...

1210
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,260
I hope you wouldn't cry.

1211
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:53,430
I want you to be happy.

1212
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:57,560
I want...

1213
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,539
to make you smile more.

1214
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,539
But whatever decision you make,

1215
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,380
it's all right with me.

1216
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,050
Decide what you want to do.

1217
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:20,649
I was thankful to you.

1218
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,020
Me too.

1219
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:27,930
I also enjoyed it a lot.

1220
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,170
It was a call to ask her out.

1221
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,270
So he would have been expressing his feelings.

1222
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,840
It felt like they were exchanging their feelings...

1223
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:41,409
by saying things like they enjoyed the dates...

1224
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:44,810
and was happy when they were together.

1225
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,220
Don't cry.

1226
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:54,960
I didn't cry. Does it look like I cried?

1227
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,260
Not really.

1228
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:03,560
That's all I want to say.

1229
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,369
Yes. You said a lot yesterday.

1230
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,770
That's right.

1231
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:10,239
There's nothing more to say.

1232
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,810
I heard you well.

1233
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,109
Take your time to decide.

1234
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:22,319
- Okay. - Okay.

1235
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,020
Bye.

1236
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,119
I just said my honest feelings.

1237
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:34,489
I felt happy during the dates.

1238
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:40,029
What he said was what I already knew.

1239
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:44,039
It's what he kept saying over the few days.

1240
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:47,270
He said he'd respect whatever decision I make.

1241
01:21:47,909 --> 01:21:49,739
He was very considerate,

1242
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,449
and wished for my happiness.

1243
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:55,819
I could feel that again, and I was very grateful.

1244
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:17,239
You said you wouldn't mind sending me to Hyun Gyu. Do you now?

1245
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:19,510
I was just saying that.

1246
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:28,579
(You will now make your final decision.)

1247

(If you don't get out of the car, you have chosen Jung Gyu Min.)

1249
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,829
I received the text.

1250
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,930
It's here.

1251
01:22:58,449 --> 01:22:59,949
Well...

1252
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:06,090
We had a nice time yesterday,

1253
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,649
but before that,

1254
01:23:08,189 --> 01:23:09,789
we had many troubles.

1255
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:12,260
That's right.

1256
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,029
I got to know your feelings now.

1257
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,829
Before that,

1258
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:19,270
Hyun Gyu comforted me a lot...

1259
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,000
when I was hurt by you.

1260
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:25,869
I think...

1261
01:23:25,869 --> 01:23:28,039
the timing matters...

1262
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:31,140
a lot too.

1263
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,149
I understand.

1264
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:41,020
I'm sorry I kept hurting you.

1265
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,390
That's bad.

1266
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,159
You're the worst person.

1267
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,289
You know that, right?

1268
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:02,510
You'll also respect my decision, right?

1269
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,550
I do too.

1270
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,920
I...

1271
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:19,789
will get going since he's been waiting too long.

1272
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:25,470
Goodbye.

1273
01:24:28,069 --> 01:24:29,399
Goodbye.

1274
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:34,239
No, not goodbye.

1275
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,010
Don't leave so well.

1276
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:38,180
I won't.

1277
01:24:59,869 --> 01:25:01,899
Hurry on. He'll be waiting.

1278
01:25:02,939 --> 01:25:04,569
You'll be all right, right?

1279
01:25:07,939 --> 01:25:09,109
Bye.

1280
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:10,340
Bye.

01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,079
Bye.

(Final Decision: Sung Hae Eun chooses Jung Hyun Gyu.)

1283
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,239
Did you wait for a long time?

1284

- Quite some time. - Quite some time?

You came.

1288
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,560
Of course. Didn't you know?

1289
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,970
I didn't.

1290

- Really? - Really.

1291

Why didn't you know?

1292
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,369
You cried.

Why didn't you know?

1294

Don't cry.

- I wouldn't know. - Why wouldn't you?

1296
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:21,510
I didn't know.

1297
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,859
I thought I expressed a lot to you yesterday.

Seven years was a long time.

1300
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:35,630
I understand that.

1301
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,800
Thank you for choosing me.

1302
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:41,699
- No need to. It's what I feel. - Still.

1303
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:44,770
I hope...

1304
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:46,909
she doesn't cry anymore.

1305
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,579
I want to get to know Hae Eun more.

1306
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,640
I want to make her laugh more.

1307
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,949
I want to make her happy. That's what I want.

1308
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,750
I enjoy being with her.

1309
01:26:57,649 --> 01:26:59,489
- Why? - It's nothing. I'm not going back.

1310
01:27:03,789 --> 01:27:05,119
Did you say everything you wanted to say?

1311
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,760
I did. And I had also made up my mind.

1312
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,060
That's a relief.

1313
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:13,729
I think yesterday helped a lot in making my decision.

1314
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:16,199
You'll be having better days from now on.

1315
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,939
Only happy days.

1316
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:22,109
- You should be happy. - Yes.

1317
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,210
You said you wouldn't make me cry.

1318
01:27:24,279 --> 01:27:25,380
Did I say that?

1319
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,680
What? You don't remember that?

1320
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,850
I do.

1321
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,420
I'm just shy.

1322
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:34,189
When I saw Hyun Gyu in front of me,

1323
01:27:34,189 --> 01:27:35,760
I could make up my mind.

1324
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:38,319
In Jeju,

1325
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,399
Hyun Gyu was like a gift to me.

1326
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,300
(The first night in Jeju)

1327
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,130
"Choose the person you want to date tomorrow now."

1328
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:49,369
I remember her name.

1329
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,199
Hae Eun.

1330
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,869
(See you tomorrow, Hae Eun.)

1331
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:58,239
(A person who came to me like a present)

1332
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:02,319
(Why did you choose me as your date?)

1333
01:28:02,979 --> 01:28:05,590
(It was Hae Eun for Hyun Gyu from the beginning.)

1334
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:07,119
(When he really likes someone,)

1335

(he doesn't care who she is.)

1336
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:11,060
(That's so cool.)

1337
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,390
(I'm so happy right now.)

1338

(I think you're a very bright person.)

1339
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:20,500
(She's bright, and her smile is beautiful.)

1340
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,199
They look good on you.

1341
01:28:23,869 --> 01:28:26,710
(Hae Eun's closed mind...)

1342
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:28,369
More. I sweated a lot.

1343
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,140
(started to open up for Hyun Gyu slowly.)

1344
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:35,210
When I'm with someone like him,

1345
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:39,090
the moment with him is so precious, and I feel happy.

1346
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,689
He makes me feel like I'm a good person.

1347
01:28:41,789 --> 01:28:44,920
That's what I thought when I was with Hyun Gyu.

1348
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:47,729
(Stop crying now.)

1349
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,300
(You should only laugh.)

1350
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:55,130
(It would hurt my heart to see someone so bright like her cry.)

1351
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:00,770
(Hyun Gyu's eyes were always...)

1352
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,210
(fixed on Hae Eun.)

1353
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,119
(Don't cry.)

1354
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:16,689
(You cried in the end.)

1355
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:19,090
(We had so much fun during the date until the evening.)

1356
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:21,060
(And it must be hard to have your date...)

1357

(see you crying at night because of your ex...)

1358
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:24,930
(as well.)

1359
01:29:25,329 --> 01:29:28,329
He saw how I had so much fun during the date...

1360
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,899
then cry after that,

1361
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,869
but he still mouthed "Don't cry."

1362
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:34,739
It gave me strength.

1363
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,050
(I will not cry from now on for you. Thank you for today as well.)

1364
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,050
(From Hae Eun)

1365
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,350
You startled me.

1366
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:48,890
Hyun Gyu gave me nothing but love...

1367
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:51,260
for the past few days.

1368
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,359
And it made me feel assured.

1369
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:01,529
I'm going to look like an octopus.

1370
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,140
It's warm.

1371
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:12,680
It's warm.

1372
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,720
(I'm glad you didn't cry because I'm here.)

1373
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,350
Yes. Let's really do it.

1374
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:23,819
You did so many things for me.

1375
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,560
Isn't it so cold?

1376
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,239
- Don't get drunk. - I'm already drunk.

1377
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:44,140
When I'm with Hyun Gyu, he keeps assuring me,

1378
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,010
which is what I need the most now.

1379
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,510
He keeps expressing his feelings.

1380
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,579
I was so happy and thankful.

1381
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,949
I would've felt sad if your car had left.

1382
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,520
You said you knew what was coming and would respect that.

1383
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,729
Right. But I can still feel sad.

1384
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,100
Yes, you can.

1385
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:08,800
Actually, I just wanted to go and say, "Come out, Hae Eun."

1386
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:11,699
But I can't do that.

1387
01:31:12,739 --> 01:31:15,840
I think you would've said it if I had been by myself.

1388
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:19,810
There's the weight of those seven years.

1389
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:22,750
And I should respect that.

1390
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,149
I shouldn't force you to come to me.

1391
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,319
I thought...

1392
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:32,229
you came to me like a present.

1393
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:34,060
Thank you.

1394
01:31:35,859 --> 01:31:37,859
You were like a present for me when I came here.

1395
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,529
- Really? - Yes.

1396
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,600
It's amazing how it happened from the first moment.

1397
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:46,939
Right.

1398
01:31:47,539 --> 01:31:49,479
It's also amazing that your feelings haven't changed.

1399
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:51,409
What if I was here from day one?

1400
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,350
I think I would've still chosen you.

1401
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,979
I think so.

1402
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,619
If you did, I would've not cried.

1403
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:03,319
I know. You would've had more fun on Jeju Island.

1404
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,060
Right?

1405
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:10,300
So my heart...

1406
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:15,130
moved so much because of your words.

1407
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,670
They really comforted me and made my heart feel warm.

1408
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,539
I think that was a big reason.

1409
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:24,239
I think I cherish this moment and you more...

1410
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:27,710
- because of those hard times. - True.

1411
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:30,180
Thank you for making me happy.

1412
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:31,979
I'm glad to hear that.

1413
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:42,229
(Your ex chose Jung Hyun Gyu.)

1414
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:44,399
(Move to the location below and give her your answer.)

1415
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,069
I think this is how it feels when it's really...

1416
01:32:50,069 --> 01:32:51,470
our last moment together.

1417
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:54,939
It does hurt,

1418
01:32:57,279 --> 01:33:01,210
but I wish the best for her.

1419
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:06,090
I actually want Hae Eun to be the happiest.

1420
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:32,710
(Just like that, Gyu Min left.)

1421
01:33:45,189 --> 01:33:48,289
I'm so nervous...

1422
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,100
that I feel exhausted.

1423
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:54,270
I think Hae Eun made a decision that will make her happy.

1424
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,300
- Yes. - So true.

1425
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:56,840
And Hyun Gyu is an amazing person...

1426
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,909
who made her feel happy and gave her the reason...

1427
01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:01,310
of the decision.

1428
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,479
- Right. - Yes.

1429
01:34:02,779 --> 01:34:05,180
I think it might be Gyu Min...

1430
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,649
who is the most confused right now.

1431
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:07,810
Yes. I agree.

1432
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:11,779
I think he ended it in a way that wasn't so painful.

1433
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,649
In a way, I do think he made things confusing too.

1434
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,659
He went out on a date with his ex...

1435
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:20,460
- a day before... - Yes.

1436
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,630
and found out about the feelings even he didn't know.

1437
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:27,270
It happened just the day before.

1438
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:29,270
And he had to make the final decision the next day.

1439
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:30,569
It must've been very conflicting.

1440
01:34:30,569 --> 01:34:31,899
- Right. - Being true to your heart and...

1441
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:33,970
It must've been very conflicting.

1442
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:36,779
It happened in the span of a day,

1443
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:37,880
so he must've been so confused.

1444
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,579
We were actually confused more as observers.

1445
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:40,810
- Right. - True.

1446
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:44,750
It must've been hard for Gyu Min as well.

1447
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,989
I think he expressed his honest feelings...

1448
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:51,090
in a way.

1449
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:54,090
I really hope Hae Eun and Hyun Gyu will be happy.

1450
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:55,229
Be happy.

1451
01:34:55,229 --> 01:34:58,100
- Hae Eun... - I'm glad they're together.

1452
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,770
- Right. - Yes. I'm so happy.

1453
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:00,770
- I'm so happy. - Yes.

1454
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:02,399
I'm curious...

1455
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,970
if things are going well with Hyun Gyu.

1456
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,170
- Yes. - I think Hyun Gyu...

1457
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,210
- is treating her so well. - I bet they're doing amazing.

1458
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:29,399
(Your ex is on her way to you.)

1459
01:35:33,069 --> 01:35:36,000
Actually, while I was here,

1460
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:39,939
I tried to keep a distance from Na Yeon.

1461
01:35:40,409 --> 01:35:43,539
I kept trying to push her away.

1462
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:45,439
It must've made her...

1463
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:48,579
upset and sad.

1464
01:35:48,579 --> 01:35:50,520
Whatever decision she makes,

1465
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,590
I'll hope for the best for her decision.

1466
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,229
(She found Hee Doo.)

1467
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:13,470
What should I do? Should I let him get in?

1468
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:15,069
I didn't know he would get in.

1469
01:36:20,979 --> 01:36:23,520
(She looks around the inside of the car in a hurry.)

1470
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,819
No!

1471
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,489
Hey.

1472
01:36:30,989 --> 01:36:33,130
- I didn't know you would get in. - What?

1473
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,789
I didn't know you were waiting. Get in.

1474
01:36:36,829 --> 01:36:38,729
My car isn't usually as messy as this.

1475
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,270
Get in.

1476
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,170
- Were you waiting for a long time? - First time in this car in a while.

1477
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:45,600
The memory seat would still recall your position.

1478
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:47,310
Was it saved?

1479
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,680
You're the only one who was saved.

1480
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:02,960
(Someone is waiting to ask your ex out. Move with your ex.)

1481
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:07,489
(Someone is waiting to ask you out. Move with your ex.)

1482
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,029
- Did you get it? - Yes.

1483
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,770
It felt strange.

1484
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:18,739
We were going to see the person who was waiting to ask my ex out.

1485
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,210
It felt weird.

1486
01:37:22,579 --> 01:37:23,640
Let's go.

1487
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:25,979
You haven't been in a car I'm driving for a long time.

1488
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:27,109
I know.

1489
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:29,479
You don't like it, do you? Are you scared?

1490
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:30,779
It's fun because it's been a while.

1491
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:34,250
It's your first time in Nabong after a long time.

1492
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:36,659
- It's been a long time. - Right?

1493
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,789
- I'm not a bad driver. I improved. - You did?

1494
01:37:39,789 --> 01:37:41,659
Yes. I drive safely now.

1495
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,329
That's a relief.

1496
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:47,130
- I do want to slow down though. - Why?

1497
01:37:47,329 --> 01:37:49,170
This might be our last conversation.

1498
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:55,109
I didn't know you would get in my car.

1499
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,880
I would've cleaned up then.

1500
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:00,609
Do you know what I thought the moment I saw you from afar earlier?

1501
01:38:00,609 --> 01:38:02,850
"There's trash on the floor."

1502
01:38:02,979 --> 01:38:04,250
I saw there was a lot.

1503
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:07,949
"Nam Hee Doo will be shocked if he sees my car."

1504
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,560
- It didn't surprise me that much. - It didn't?

1505
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:13,189
Don't you feel strange today?

1506
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:14,960
Yesterday,

1507
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,529
I suddenly felt...

1508
01:38:17,529 --> 01:38:20,529
that we hadn't changed at all.

1509
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,739
You could've said it more nicely, but...

1510
01:38:24,369 --> 01:38:27,039
I acknowledge that to some extent.

1511
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:31,579
Compared to how I talk with other people here,

1512
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,979
I'm not nice...

1513
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:36,819
with you.

1514
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,890
Partially, I was trying to push you away.

1515
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:42,960
- Right. It was on purpose too. - Yes.

1516
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,460
You were harsher to me than to others.

1517
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,489
Right.

1518
01:38:48,829 --> 01:38:50,159
Have you made up your mind?

1519
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,130
It was so hard for me to make a decision.

1520
01:38:53,829 --> 01:38:55,770
- I won't regret it. - You won't?

1521
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:59,000
I should not make that decision if I think I would regret it.

1522
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:14,590
I had more fun and was happier when I was with Na Yeon.

1523
01:39:14,989 --> 01:39:16,560
That's the only thing I thought.

1524
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,989
I contemplated a lot yesterday,

1525
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:21,689
but I cared...

1526
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:24,430
about Na Yeon here more.

1527
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:27,729
(Final Decision: Jung Gyu Min chooses Lee Na Yeon.)

1528
01:39:44,779 --> 01:39:47,420
Where would it be? Here?

1529
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:02,029
(The three of them met.)

1530
01:40:06,609 --> 01:40:09,939
Honestly, I thought I should support them.

1531
01:40:10,479 --> 01:40:12,380
That's what I tried to think in my head,

1532
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:13,850
but I had different kinds of thoughts.

1533
01:40:33,029 --> 01:40:35,229
This might be the last moment for us to talk.

1534
01:40:36,569 --> 01:40:39,909
I won't have a chance to talk with you anymore.

1535
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:48,449
Honestly, our relationship here...

1536
01:40:48,449 --> 01:40:50,619
and our dates weren't beautiful.

1537
01:40:50,619 --> 01:40:51,619
You're right.

1538
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:54,250
So after the date yesterday,

1539
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:56,659
I cried on the way home.

1540
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:59,590
But didn't you go meet someone else?

1541
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:00,890
- Yes. - Then why did you cry?

1542
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:05,899
Because I thought I should really end the relationship with you.

1543
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:07,399
But...

1544
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:10,199
we might've been happy...

1545
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:14,909
to see each other again.

1546
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,939
We might grow feelings as we're seeing each other.

1547
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:20,579
Both you and I.

1548
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:22,579
Do you not want to get fooled by it?

1549
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,949
I'm trying to say that we shouldn't let only those feelings decide.

1550
01:41:26,689 --> 01:41:29,119
I know. I totally agree with you.

1551
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,289
Do I have to come back as a more mature version of myself?

1552
01:41:33,489 --> 01:41:35,590
I don't think I was mature...

1553
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:38,100
when we argued.

1554
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:40,300
- Me too. - I wasn't mature with you.

1555
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,770
If Ji Yeon did the same thing as me,

1556
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:47,340
you would be able to let it slide, blaming her young age.

1557
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:52,109
That makes me think...

1558
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:55,109
that you have higher standards for me.

1559
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:58,649
- I think so. - Yes.

1560
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,319
I felt it.

1561
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:01,489
You felt it?

1562
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,359
When I said things like that,

1563
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,560
you always said it wasn't a big deal.

1564
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,189
I know.

1565
01:42:09,329 --> 01:42:13,729
I realized it just now.

1566
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:18,170
I wanted many things from you.

1567
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:25,710
I realized that when I was thinking about Ji Yeon or others,

1568
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:28,109
I just took it as it was.

1569
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:29,649
I didn't really care much and move on.

1570
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:31,619
But I wasn't generous with Na Yeon.

1571
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,520
"It's not much to ask. You can't even fix that?"

1572
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,390
"Why is this hard for you?"

1573
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:39,489
"I don't expect too much from you." That's what I thought.

1574
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:43,699
But I realized that I actually did expect too much at some point.

1575
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,300
Hee Doo realized it in the car and looked shocked.

1576
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:51,140
He said, "Come to think of it, that's actually true."

1577
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,609
I was like Ji Yeon when I was younger.

1578
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:57,810
He thought about how he treated Ji Yeon.

1579
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,079
He realized that he didn't have to do that to me,

1580
01:43:00,409 --> 01:43:03,420
and he had acted like that around me only.

1581
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,750
That itself comforted me so much.

1582
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:07,890
Because no one knew.

1583
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,319
Even when I said it was hard for me,

1584
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:12,159
he said it was all for my sake.

1585
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,430
And that it was good for me.

1586
01:43:15,659 --> 01:43:18,630
He didn't understand why it was hard and why I didn't listen to him.

1587
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:19,670
That's what he said.

1588
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:22,130
But when you're in a relationship,

1589
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:24,500
you don't "listen" or "not listen" to the other. It doesn't make sense.

1590
01:43:24,539 --> 01:43:26,270
Hee Doo realized it.

1591
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:31,340
While I was with you here,

1592
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,779
I was so upset.

1593
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,210
I thought we hadn't changed a bit,

1594
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,720
which made me so sad.

1595
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,829
(This is Lee Na Yeon's number. Call her to express your feelings.)

1596
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,340
(You will now make your final decision.)

1597
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:59,399
(If you get out of the car, you have chosen someone new.)

1598
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:01,109
(If you don't get out of the car, you have chosen Nam Hee Doo.)

1599
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,420
"What should I say?"

1600
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:13,149
"How should I talk..."

1601
01:44:13,149 --> 01:44:17,090
"to move Na Yeon's heart..."

1602
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:18,119
"even just a little bit?"

1603
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,229
That's what I thought.

1604
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,029
Hello.

1605
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:28,329
- Hello. - Yes.

1606
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:29,699
What?

1607
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:31,500
What's this?

1608
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:33,239
What do you mean by what?

1609
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:35,140
- No speakerphone mode. - Hold on.

1610
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:36,810
It surprised me.

1611
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:38,079
(He almost heard their conversation in the speakerphone mode.)

1612
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,609
- Just a moment. - Okay. Can you hear me?

1613
01:44:41,409 --> 01:44:43,579
- Hello. - Hello.

1614
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:49,250
It must've been tough to come a long way.

1615
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:52,720
What? Were you waiting for a long time?

1616
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:54,229
A little.

1617
01:44:56,529 --> 01:44:58,159
I'm hungry.

1618
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,670
Yes.

1619
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:06,270
The fact that he has to listen to that next to her is...

1620
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:07,909
It's painful to be there.

1621
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:10,239
- Right. - I don't think I can do that.

1622
01:45:10,409 --> 01:45:13,010
How can he stay there hearing their talk?

1623
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,109
I think I would block my ears.

1624
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,550
I don't know what to say.

1625
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:25,789
Actually, we know as we talked about it many times.

1626
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:29,029
- We know well. - Yes.

1627
01:45:29,659 --> 01:45:31,859
How was it during the past three weeks?

1628
01:45:32,899 --> 01:45:35,300
- Things were tough. - Right.

1629
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:38,739
I struggled 90 percent of the time,

1630
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,840
- but there is gratitude. - Right.

1631
01:45:42,409 --> 01:45:44,239
I had fun. Right now, I feel...

1632
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:46,409
disappointed.

1633
01:45:46,409 --> 01:45:47,810
I understand.

1634
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:49,779
Despite everything,

1635
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:53,489
I was very happy...

1636
01:45:54,189 --> 01:45:59,590
to spend a lot of time with you in the past three weeks.

1637
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:02,130
Same here.

1638
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,300
I didn't know...

1639
01:46:05,329 --> 01:46:07,729
that someone could make my heart flutter in three weeks.

1640
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:16,140
After joining the show,

1641
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:19,949
the most exciting and nicest moment was...

1642
01:46:20,649 --> 01:46:22,880
my first date with you.

1643
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:26,850
- Back then, - I think about that day often.

1644
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:28,689
things were nice.

1645
01:46:28,819 --> 01:46:32,220
Yes. Things were quite nice. It was very exciting.

1646
01:46:33,829 --> 01:46:34,890
Why did you pick...

1647
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:35,960
- the first meeting? - Me?

1648
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:39,460
So the theme is the 1st meeting. This is our 1st meeting too.

1649
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:43,069
Look at me.

1650
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:44,539
Ta-da. Good.

1651
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:47,510
You look very pretty.

1652
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,380
I am overjoyed. I am really happy.

1653
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,079
I am really happy.

1654
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:53,449
You are really happy?

1655
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:56,250
It was the happiest I have been in the past few months.

1656
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,619
It was the happiest I have been this year.

1657
01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:01,119
(Their first date was memorable.)

1658
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:06,729
Doesn't it look better on me?

1659
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:07,960
The color matches.

1660
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,359
(They got matching rings.)

1661
01:47:10,329 --> 01:47:13,029
(But Hee Doo was always by Na Yeon's side.)

1662
01:47:13,699 --> 01:47:16,539
I could feel that they were tight.

1663
01:47:17,069 --> 01:47:18,869
(The ones without a date, Gyu Min, Hae Eun, and Ji Yeon...)

1664
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:20,670
(will leave for Jeju Island together.)

1665
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,539
From the start,

1666
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:26,239
I never thought that I would win.

1667
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,979
I could feel their love.

1668
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:37,520
Had I come here without my ex,

1669
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:40,460
I would have liked you a lot more.

1670
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:43,729
There was only one approach I could take.

1671
01:47:43,829 --> 01:47:44,899
I simply enjoyed...

1672
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,600
my time with Na Yeon as much as I could...

1673
01:47:49,029 --> 01:47:52,640
and told her that it was okay because my feelings weren't hurt.

1674
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:54,909
After breaking up with Hee Doo,

1675
01:47:55,069 --> 01:47:57,239
you were exactly the person I wanted.

1676
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:59,109
(You were exactly the person I wanted.)

1677
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:00,949
I am serious.

1678
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:09,090
Why do I feel like I always make you wait?

1679
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:13,989
Then you should get out of the car.

1680
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,869
The thing is,

1681
01:48:21,029 --> 01:48:24,600
I have only talked about it.

1682
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:29,170
I never gave you the photos I took during our first date.

1683
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:32,640
So I did bring them today for you.

1684
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,149
I picked...

1685
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:42,720
a few nice photos of you I liked.

1686
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,760
I will give them to you if you get out of the car.

1687
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:52,229
To be honest, it was funny.

1688
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:55,029
He continuously puts my heart at ease like that.

1689
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:57,939
Even in such situations, he makes me laugh.

1690
01:48:58,569 --> 01:48:59,840
This is hard.

1691
01:49:01,069 --> 01:49:04,409
I think Gyu Min looks the best when he is next to Na Yeon.

1692
01:49:04,409 --> 01:49:06,909
- I agree. It's true. - That's right.

1693
01:49:06,909 --> 01:49:09,510
It's a fact. I'm serious about that.

1694
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,180
- They have compatible energy. - They really do.

1695
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:13,989
They look happy together. They would make a cute couple.

1696
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,619
They can influence each other in a good way.

1697
01:49:17,289 --> 01:49:20,489
I am really thankful to you.

1698
01:49:21,829 --> 01:49:24,359
Come to think of it, you always comforted me...

1699
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,069
when I was going through hard times.

1700
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,380
In any case, things were really nice.

1701
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,520
I liked you sincerely.

1702
01:49:50,659 --> 01:49:51,890
Okay.

1703
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:58,130
Otherwise, this wouldn't have been so hard.

1704
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:00,229
You are right.

1705
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,369
Same here.

1706
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:06,710
I really liked you too.

1707
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:15,710
Should I step out for a second?

1708
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,970
In any case,

1709
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:37,840
you have always been my choice.

1710
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,970
I would be lying if I said that my feelings aren't hurt.

1711
01:50:42,739 --> 01:50:45,180
Still, I liked you continuously.

1712
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:55,850
Thank you so much, Gyu Min.

1713
01:50:56,119 --> 01:50:57,960
Whenever I met you,

1714
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,630
you told me the words I wanted to say to myself here...

1715
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:07,369
out of all places.

1716
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:09,729
You gave me so much strength.

1717
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:11,300
I think I grew thanks to that.

1718
01:51:18,539 --> 01:51:19,810
This is so hard.

1719
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,409
To be honest,

1720
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:23,779
I am scared.

1721
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:34,630
I am too scared to open this door.

1722
01:51:37,329 --> 01:51:38,560
It's understandable.

1723
01:51:57,079 --> 01:51:59,250
After all, it's your choice.

1724
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:05,819
I...

1725
01:52:09,159 --> 01:52:10,630
I don't think...

1726
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,170
I am ready to let go of this relationship.

1727
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,770
(I don't think I am ready to let go of this relationship.)

1728
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,569
In the end, she can't let go.

1729
01:52:23,369 --> 01:52:24,810
I don't think...

1730
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:28,250
I am ready to let go of this relationship.

1731
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:29,750
(I don't think I am ready to let go of this relationship.)

1732
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:34,649
I know that I will be very happy if I date you.

1733
01:52:36,859 --> 01:52:39,659
But I don't have the courage to let go.

1734
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:52,140
I think it will torment you later on.

1735
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:56,170
I am sorry.

1736
01:52:56,979 --> 01:52:58,079
It's okay.

1737
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:01,710
I always say "I am sorry" to you.

1738
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:04,979
I knew whom you would choose.

1739
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:07,550
Thank you for that.

1740
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,949
You are really cool.

1741
01:53:11,989 --> 01:53:13,260
Thank you.

1742
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,960
To be honest, I knew...

1743
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:20,100
that Na Yeon was very torn at the last minute.

1744
01:53:20,569 --> 01:53:23,640
When you have been in a long-term relationship,

1745
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:26,739
there is a high chance someone new can give you...

1746
01:53:26,739 --> 01:53:29,340
the emotions the current lover can't give.

1747
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:34,579
"That aspect could sway and confuse you further,"

1748
01:53:34,579 --> 01:53:37,819
"so you should think hard." I remember telling her that.

1749
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:42,550
She thought hard until the morning of that day.

1750
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:46,819
I was thankful for that...

1751
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,829
despite the disappointment.

1752
01:53:50,529 --> 01:53:53,829
She was torn because she enjoyed her time with me.

1753
01:53:54,869 --> 01:53:58,539
She made me feel like a good person.

1754
01:53:59,739 --> 01:54:02,140
I was happy and grateful.

1755
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:05,909
I don't know how to express these emotions.

1756
01:54:06,109 --> 01:54:08,949
I don't only feel apologetic.

1757
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:11,380
I had feelings for him.

1758
01:54:11,619 --> 01:54:13,020
I made memories with him.

1759
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,520
We meant the words...

1760
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,890
we said to each other.

1761
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:19,960
But in that situation, it was time for me to let go...

1762
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:21,289
of my feelings for him.

1763
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:26,829
You made my heart flutter a lot.

1764
01:54:26,829 --> 01:54:29,529
I liked you. I still have affection for you.

1765
01:54:32,899 --> 01:54:35,909
Thank you for giving me strength.

1766
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:40,510
- Okay. Have a safe trip home. - Okay.

1767
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:49,850
Hee Doo.

1768
01:54:52,859 --> 01:54:53,890
Get in the car.

1769
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:55,829
Are you done?

1770
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:01,800
- Are you done? - Yes.

1771
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:04,039
- Should I get in the car? - Get in.

1772
01:55:11,710 --> 01:55:15,550
I don't know what will happen to us from now on.

1773
01:55:15,779 --> 01:55:18,720
One thing I know for sure is this. I loved you a lot,

1774
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,750
and I still love you.

1775
01:55:21,949 --> 01:55:24,659
Love doesn't disappear in five months.

1776
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:32,800
(Someone is waiting to ask you out.)

1777
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,529
(Move with your ex.)

1778
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:41,840
Do we need to go here now?

1779
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,539
(Someone is waiting to ask your ex out.)

1780
01:55:43,539 --> 01:55:45,239
(Move with your ex.)

1781
01:55:46,939 --> 01:55:50,250
Ji Yeon liked Hee Doo a lot,

1782
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:53,420
but I thought she also had feelings for Tae I.

1783
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:55,489
I was the most curious about Ji Yeon's decision.

1784
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:57,489
When I saw that she chose Hee Doo in the end,

1785
01:55:57,659 --> 01:55:59,619
I was very nervous.

1786
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,729
Shall we go? Let's go.

1787
01:56:05,159 --> 01:56:06,460
This is how I feel.

1788
01:56:14,869 --> 01:56:16,970
I had no idea.

1789
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:21,350
- I thought you would get out. - Really?

1790
01:56:25,819 --> 01:56:26,880
Let's go.

1791
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:42,430
(Final Decision: Lee Na Yeon chooses Nam Hee Doo.)

1792
01:56:56,979 --> 01:56:58,850
He is surprised that she didn't get out of the car.

1793
01:56:59,449 --> 01:57:00,449
It's cool.

1794
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:02,850
I guess Hee Doo doubted Na Yeon's love...

1795
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:04,960
until the very end.

1796
01:57:05,689 --> 01:57:07,460
The more I see of Na Yeon, the maturer she seems.

1797
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,930
- I know. She is like a big sister. - Yes.

1798
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:12,529
She is a fool for love.

1799
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:14,699
I realize that now.

1800
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:16,729
The more I see of Na Yeon, the more surprised I become...

1801
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:18,670
because she is so nice.

1802
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:21,039
She has a good relationship with Hae Eun too.

1803
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:22,170
That's right.

1804
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,010
She is a really nice person.

1805
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:26,939
I often thought to myself, "She has a good mindset."

1806
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:28,609
Na Yeon is cool.

1807
01:57:28,609 --> 01:57:30,520
Na Yeon seems much older than Hee Doo.

1808
01:57:33,579 --> 01:57:36,020
- Is this your decision? - Yes.

1809
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,489
I was very torn.

1810
01:57:39,689 --> 01:57:42,789
In the end, I followed my heart.

1811
01:57:46,899 --> 01:57:50,869
To be honest, everyone could be against my decision,

1812
01:57:51,569 --> 01:57:54,609
judging from the way we behaved when we lived together.

1813
01:57:55,239 --> 01:57:57,579
Everyone might say that it's a stupid decision.

1814
01:57:58,479 --> 01:57:59,880
Why would they say that it's a stupid decision?

1815
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:01,710
You are a bad man.

1816
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:03,949
- Me? - Yes.

1817
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:05,880
You were bad to me.

1818
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:07,649
- Here? - Yes.

1819
01:58:08,189 --> 01:58:10,590
You pushed me away and scolded me.

1820
01:58:14,029 --> 01:58:16,359
It occurred to me that I might regret...

1821
01:58:16,359 --> 01:58:19,199
the way I behaved upon coming here.

1822
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:22,270
Many thoughts entered my head.

1823
01:58:24,069 --> 01:58:28,869
Had more time passed after our breakup,

1824
01:58:28,869 --> 01:58:32,439
would you have chosen differently?

1825
01:58:32,779 --> 01:58:34,210
Maybe.

1826
01:58:35,449 --> 01:58:38,350
Didn't you want someone new...

1827
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:40,489
- in the beginning? - I did.

1828
01:58:40,489 --> 01:58:43,859
I was firm in that attitude before you arrived.

1829
01:58:44,189 --> 01:58:45,520
My heart fluttered for real.

1830
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:48,489
You mean too much to me.

1831
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:50,800
My heart keeps going out to you,

1832
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,529
but I know that it's a bad idea.

1833
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,109
And for some reason,

1834
01:59:01,909 --> 01:59:03,710
I can see your affection.

1835
01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:05,539
I can see that you care about me.

1836
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:07,949
From the beginning to the end, my decision was you...

1837
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,279
despite being swayed.

1838
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:16,289
(She read the self-introduction by herself.)

1839
01:59:16,689 --> 01:59:19,020
(I cry every time I read it.)

1840
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,229
(Hee Doo moved in.)

1841
01:59:24,229 --> 01:59:26,859
- Hee Doo? - Hee Doo.

1842
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,270
(Did you hold hands?)

1843
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:30,130
(No, he pulled me.)

1844
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:32,569
(I was jealous.)

1845
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:35,840
(Na Yeon was confused.)

1846
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:40,439
(I also loved Hee Doo a lot.)

1847
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:47,119
(Had we overcome that, we wouldn't have come here.)

1848

(I have more feelings for you.)

1849
01:59:49,989 --> 01:59:52,260
I got a good look into my heart.

1850
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:57,090
I realized that I can't date anyone other than Hee Doo just yet.

1851
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,729
To be honest, I really want to get back together with him.

1852
02:00:00,729 --> 02:00:04,039
But I feel like I shouldn't do that.

1853
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:06,069
(Nam Hee Doo and Lee Na Yeon chose each other,)

1854
02:00:06,069 --> 02:00:07,810
(so they will leave for Jeju Island together.)

1855
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:11,840
I was torn, but my heart was set on choosing Hee Doo.

1856
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,250
(When I express my feelings, don't push me away.)

1857

(I am happy that I'm on Jeju Island with you.)

(It's too bad I couldn't sit next to you on the plane.)

1859

(Shall we sit together on our way back?)

(Na Yeon has always expressed her feelings with honesty.)

(I am giving you certainty.)

(Think hard.)

1863
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:34,569
I am sure you already know about my feelings.

1864
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:35,970
What feelings?

1865
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:37,500
My feelings for you.

1866

What I want.

1867
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:41,939
We talked at length. I showed you my decision.

1868
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:44,380
Now, it's your turn to decide.

1869
02:00:44,579 --> 02:00:48,510
I hope we can start anew.

1870
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:50,479
Make a decision that brings you happiness.

1871
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:56,250
No matter what happened, I told myself that I would make...

1872
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,789
my own decision.

1873
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:16,069
This is suffocating.

(Final Decision: Lee Ji Yeon chooses Nam Hee Doo.)

(My goodness.)

1876
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:30,890
Why is this so nerve-racking?

1877

- I am so nervous. I can't watch it. - I know.

1878
02:01:32,359 --> 02:01:34,090
- I am getting goosebumps. - I can't watch it.

1879
02:01:34,289 --> 02:01:37,060
They make me more nervous than Hae Eun and Gyu Min.

1880
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:40,029
I agree. With them, I could see what would happen.

1881
02:01:40,029 --> 02:01:41,069
I know.

1882
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:42,670
Don't feel pressured.

1883
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,470
I don't want you to feel bad for me.

1884
02:01:49,039 --> 02:01:50,109
Okay?

1885
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:54,250
You don't know what my decision will be.

1886
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:56,250
Either way, I want to be prepared.

1887
02:01:58,279 --> 02:02:00,689
I think it's perfectly natural to be swayed.

1888
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:10,899
I didn't choose you with any expectations.

1889
02:02:14,369 --> 02:02:17,100
But I think I'm the one who likes you the most among everyone.

1890

Today, I was in the lodging...

all by myself.

1892

Many thoughts entered my head.

1893
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:43,890
What thoughts?

1894
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:46,029
This and that.

1895
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:49,529
If you decide to leave, I won't stop you.

1896
02:02:50,569 --> 02:02:53,340
It looks like you are having a hard time.

1897
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,649
But...

1898
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:13,819
if we do start anew,

1899
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:17,930
I am confident that I will make you happy.

1900
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,470
- You are? - Yes.

1901

Be honest. You are happy when you are with me.

(If you don't get out of the car, you have chosen Lee Na Yeon.)

1906
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:55,470
Do you need to go?

1907
02:04:11,979 --> 02:04:13,350
I will receive a call.

1908

(This is Nam Hee Doo's number.)

1909

(Call him to express your feelings.)

1910
02:04:40,609 --> 02:04:41,779
This is fun.

What are you doing there?

1912
02:05:00,229 --> 02:05:01,329
What are you doing there?

1913
02:05:03,970 --> 02:05:06,670
Hold on. Is Na Yeon...

1914
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:11,010
- Is Na Yeon by your side? - Yes.

1915
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:14,479
- That's incredible. - Right?

1916
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,880
I never thought he would come with Na Yeon.

1917
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:22,119
"Na Yeon is between us again."

1918
02:05:22,789 --> 02:05:24,760
I am sure she had that thought.

1919
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,460
So I felt bad about the situation.

1920
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:34,529
Are you okay? Are you not hungover?

1921
02:05:35,729 --> 02:05:36,970
It wasn't easy.

1922

If I remember correctly,

02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:41,869
I swayed you a lot yesterday.

1924
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:45,479
If I remember correctly, you were very torn.

1925
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:48,350
I was torn all along.

1926
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:52,479
You are a wise person who can make a decision...

1927
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:55,750
that brings you happiness,

1928
02:05:55,989 --> 02:05:58,159
so I am sure you chose well.

1929
02:06:00,489 --> 02:06:03,760
- I chose you. - Yes.

1930
02:06:04,659 --> 02:06:06,029
Why do you think I did that?

1931
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:09,100
I am sure you made a decision...

1932
02:06:09,729 --> 02:06:11,340
with care.

1933
02:06:11,869 --> 02:06:14,199
I chose someone who brought me...

1934
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:17,539
happiness and laughter in the past three weeks.

1935
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:20,109
Thank you for thinking that.

1936
02:06:25,579 --> 02:06:28,619
Why am I so bad with words?

1937
02:06:29,319 --> 02:06:32,760
Say what you want to say. What's up with you?

1938
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:35,729
You spoke so eloquently yesterday. Why is it different today?

1939
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,569
- My goodness. - This is driving me crazy.

1940
02:06:48,739 --> 02:06:50,039
This is crazy.

1941
02:06:50,409 --> 02:06:51,710
Oh, no.

1942
02:06:54,579 --> 02:06:58,119
You know, I had thought about what I wanted to say.

1943
02:06:58,149 --> 02:07:02,649
I thought I would be able to speak eloquently.

1944
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:08,630
I can't speak with ease because I am caught in-between.

1945
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:12,930
I was very worried about you yesterday.

1946
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:14,899
Seriously.

1947
02:07:16,699 --> 02:07:18,140
I mean my words.

1948
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:22,670
I didn't know I was so easily swayed by my emotions.

1949
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:26,380
The conversation we had yesterday influenced my decision a lot.

1950
02:07:26,979 --> 02:07:29,850
Things were the same for me. In the past three weeks,

1951
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:33,250
I met an unexpected person...

1952
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,850
and had an unexpected time.

1953
02:07:36,289 --> 02:07:38,520
You saw my precious dog, Seol,

1954
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:41,859
- as well. - Seol.

1955
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:44,699
I had a happy time.

1956
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:52,899
- Hey. - Hi.

1957
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:57,470
Like this.

1958
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:01,579
(They laughed so much during their first date.)

1959
02:08:02,779 --> 02:08:05,550
(They exchanged notes in secret...)

1960
02:08:06,449 --> 02:08:09,619
(to check each other's feelings.)

1961
02:08:09,689 --> 02:08:11,989
(- Let's get a massage together. - Okay. At what time?)

1962
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,189
Seol, there are pigeons.

1963
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:17,560
Seol loves it.

1964
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:21,770
(The ones without a date, Gyu Min, Hae Eun, and Ji Yeon...)

1965
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:23,029
(will leave for Jeju Island together.)

1966
02:08:23,529 --> 02:08:26,640
(She couldn't hide her disappointment.)

1967
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:30,069
(A small misunderstanding left a void.)

1968
02:08:31,909 --> 02:08:34,909
(They grew distant.)

1969
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,079
Do you know how I feel?

1970
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:41,420
(They made an effort to close the gap.)

1971
02:08:42,949 --> 02:08:45,720
You are full of energy.

1972
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:47,560
I feel good when I am with you.

1973
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,289
It's fun to hang out with you.

1974
02:08:50,329 --> 02:08:52,199
Will you support me no matter whom I choose?

1975
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:54,159
I want you to choose me.

1976
02:08:56,399 --> 02:08:57,729
It's up to you.

1977
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:59,670
You are a really nice person.

1978
02:08:59,670 --> 02:09:02,510
I find you charming.

1979
02:09:06,539 --> 02:09:08,810
What are we doing?

1980
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:11,479
This is nice.

1981
02:09:14,989 --> 02:09:16,319
For me,

1982
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:19,760
it's more than having had a nice and happy time.

1983
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:23,460
Before the final decision,

1984
02:09:23,659 --> 02:09:26,329
I found myself worrying a lot about you.

1985
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:29,670
I rediscovered myself yesterday.

1986
02:09:29,869 --> 02:09:32,840
I have never had a serious relationship...

1987
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:34,609
with someone like you.

1988
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:37,979
At first, I thought you were similar to Tae I.

1989
02:09:38,210 --> 02:09:41,149
The more I spent time with you, the more I felt grateful...

1990
02:09:41,149 --> 02:09:42,909
for your expressions.

1991
02:09:42,909 --> 02:09:44,310
I have never been in a relationship...

1992
02:09:44,979 --> 02:09:47,319
in which a man expressed himself so openly.

1993
02:09:47,649 --> 02:09:49,789
And...

1994
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:52,859
I have never been in a relationship...

1995
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:56,760
with someone who has a personality and positive energy...

1996
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,029
like me.

1997
02:09:58,130 --> 02:10:00,100
While spending time with you,

1998
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:02,199
I discovered your positive energy.

1999
02:10:02,869 --> 02:10:05,270
- I did too. - Yes. I discovered it.

2000
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:08,710
I have always dated someone like cold water.

2001
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:11,510
I thought such relationships calmed me down.

2002
02:10:15,649 --> 02:10:17,979
But in a sense,

2003
02:10:17,979 --> 02:10:20,449
you made me think differently.

2004
02:10:20,779 --> 02:10:23,289
I want to love all of my past relationships.

2005
02:10:23,289 --> 02:10:25,420
I am sure I grew from them.

2006
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:28,659
But from now on,

2007
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,029
I want to feel what you made me feel.

2008
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:37,569
I want to be in a relationship...

2009
02:10:37,569 --> 02:10:39,270
that will bring synergy.

2010
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,140
Am I making any sense?

2011
02:10:41,409 --> 02:10:43,670
Totally. I understand what you mean.

2012
02:10:44,239 --> 02:10:46,640
This is my resolution.

2013
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:48,779
That's what my decision means.

2014
02:10:52,579 --> 02:10:54,420
I understand what you mean.

2015
02:10:56,989 --> 02:11:00,090
I didn't hear everything Ji Yeon said,

2016
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:01,760
but I could guess.

2017
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,359
I couldn't look Ji Yeon in the eye,

2018
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:07,029
but I stole glances.

2019
02:11:07,029 --> 02:11:09,829
She was speaking so calmly and confidently.

2020
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:12,300
The two of them...

2021
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:14,810
It seemed like she was pouring her heart out.

2022
02:11:14,869 --> 02:11:17,439
That's why I am very sad today.

2023
02:11:22,149 --> 02:11:25,680
I am really grateful to you.

2024
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:30,149
Thanks to my time with you,

2025
02:11:30,149 --> 02:11:33,789
I felt and learned many things.

2026
02:11:34,489 --> 02:11:36,829
I learned new things about myself...

2027
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:41,670
without even realizing it.

2028
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:44,670
Before I went on dates with you,

2029
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:47,739
I never thought about meeting someone new.

2030
02:11:49,909 --> 02:11:53,609
I didn't even think I wanted to work things out with my ex...

2031
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:55,350
until that point.

2032
02:11:55,949 --> 02:12:00,319
But I think there was a lot that happened since then.

2033
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:02,489
I had a change of heart too.

2034
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:04,760
If I choose you...

2035
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,819
If I have feelings for my ex...

2036
02:12:06,819 --> 02:12:08,460
and I choose you,

2037
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:10,060
I thought that wouldn't be right.

2038
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:13,500
- We always struggled with that. - I know.

2039
02:12:16,529 --> 02:12:18,500
Seriously, I...

2040
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:21,670
will just say this. You are...

2041
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:27,140
such a good friend to me.

2042
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:29,409
(You are a good friend to me.)

2043
02:12:30,449 --> 02:12:32,750
- Right. - Yes, that's it.

2044
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,920
Gosh.

2045
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:37,789
Watching their date yesterday,

2046
02:12:37,789 --> 02:12:40,689
they felt like friends. They put their arms around each other.

2047
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,329
- "We're buddies." - Yes.

2048
02:12:43,229 --> 02:12:44,699
You are...

2049
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:50,130
such a good friend to me.

2050
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:52,340
(You are a good friend to me.)

2051
02:12:55,239 --> 02:12:56,439
Okay.

2052
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:00,279
From now on...

2053
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:05,649
No, I'm thankful to you for a lot of things.

2054
02:13:05,649 --> 02:13:07,079
And I'm sorry about a lot of things too.

2055
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:19,359
Did you really contemplate until the end?

2056
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:21,670
It was so hard.

2057
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:22,869
- Really? - It was so...

2058
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,569
And it wasn't...

2059
02:13:29,109 --> 02:13:32,539
a simple question of this person versus the other.

2060
02:13:32,539 --> 02:13:35,710
- I didn't choose like that... - I know you didn't.

2061
02:13:38,479 --> 02:13:39,520
That's right.

2062
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:44,420
What made you want to go back? I'm curious.

2063
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:48,829
I really...

2064
02:13:49,489 --> 02:13:52,529
And I'm sorry to keep saying this too.

2065
02:13:52,829 --> 02:13:54,729
You're going to ask me if I've dated someone for four years again, right?

2066
02:13:55,029 --> 02:13:56,829
"Have you dated someone for four years?"

2067
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:02,470
But honestly, the four years isn't the important thing.

2068
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:06,579
I knew it. That's why I kept acting like that.

2069
02:14:06,779 --> 02:14:09,310
But I asked you again since it's the end.

2070
02:14:11,579 --> 02:14:13,720
But you know, I really did feel bad,

2071
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:15,850
but talking to you made me feel better.

2072
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:18,760
- Really? - Yes.

2073
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:21,430
Thank you and I'm sorry.

2074
02:14:23,090 --> 02:14:24,489
Don't be.

2075
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:28,670
I really want to cheer you on for choosing Na Yeon.

2076
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:33,399
I felt that you liked me.

2077
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:36,039
I'm really thankful that you let me feel that.

2078
02:14:36,909 --> 02:14:40,810
The person who made me feel like I'm worthy of being loved...

2079
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:43,979
was you, not Tae I.

2080
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:46,819
I'm thankful that you think of me that way.

2081
02:14:47,319 --> 02:14:50,189
I truly want you to be happy from now on.

2082
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,460
Go back.

2083
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:55,159
If you go out that way, you return to your four-year relationship.

2084
02:14:56,729 --> 02:14:59,630
Hee Doo is returning to his four-year relationship.

2085
02:15:00,630 --> 02:15:02,729
I don't think it's just because I have lingering feelings...

2086
02:15:02,729 --> 02:15:05,300
or because I can't let her go.

2087
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:07,939
And if I think of choosing Ji Yeon,

2088
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:11,710
when I still have so much emotions for my ex to make me think so hard,

2089
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,210
will I be able to date Ji Yeon?

2090
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:17,079
I realized that my feelings for Na Yeon were much bigger.

2091
02:15:18,350 --> 02:15:20,079
- Get going, Hee Doo. - Okay, I'll go.

2092
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:21,750
You hang up.

2093
02:15:22,449 --> 02:15:23,819
Why do I have to hang up?

2094
02:15:23,850 --> 02:15:26,590
I'm being dumped here, and I have to hang up too?

2095
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:28,659
Isn't it worse for me to hang up?

2096
02:15:28,659 --> 02:15:30,229
And what do you mean, you're getting dumped?

2097
02:15:30,289 --> 02:15:31,460
I was just dumped.

2098
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:33,130
"I was a car..."

2099
02:15:34,699 --> 02:15:35,970
It's not like that.

2100
02:15:36,529 --> 02:15:37,829
I shouldn't say stuff like this.

2101
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:40,300
I haven't come to my senses and am just saying whatever.

2102
02:15:40,439 --> 02:15:41,640
Hey, get a grip.

2103
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:43,670
I know.

2104
02:15:43,670 --> 02:15:45,680
- Get a grip. It's the end... - Then let's do this.

2105
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,579
It annoyed me when you told me to get a grip.

2106
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:49,810
But looking back on it later, it was all true.

2107
02:15:50,579 --> 02:15:52,550
You always say what's right, so I have nothing to say.

2108
02:15:52,649 --> 02:15:54,020
Although, you nag me all the time.

2109
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:57,520
Thanks.

2110
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,260
For thinking I was saying what was right.

2111
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:02,430
Okay, I'll hang up now.

2112
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:03,960
- Bye. - Bye.

2113
02:16:17,939 --> 02:16:19,880
I honestly don't think it was a simple decision.

2114
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:21,880
It's not like I'd have chosen Na Yeon...

2115
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:23,750
if no one else was good enough.

2116
02:16:23,979 --> 02:16:27,850
I made this choice after thinking about the future.

2117
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:29,449
"Let's just try dating again."

2118
02:16:29,449 --> 02:16:33,159
It was never a light decision like that.

2119
02:16:33,719 --> 02:16:35,729
Na Yeon is such a clear person,

2120
02:16:35,729 --> 02:16:37,159
and she doesn't have a hidden agenda.

2121
02:16:37,159 --> 02:16:39,299
She was always true to her feelings.

2122
02:16:39,930 --> 02:16:41,459
She's so pure.

2123
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:43,870
Let's go.

2124
02:16:48,569 --> 02:16:52,680
(Final Decision: Nam Hee Doo chooses Lee Na Yeon.)

2125
02:16:54,110 --> 02:16:56,049
I feel so relieved.

2126
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:58,920
Don't fight from now on.

2127
02:16:59,319 --> 02:17:01,280
Seriously, don't fight.

2128
02:17:01,719 --> 02:17:02,889
What Hee Doo said is right.

2129
02:17:02,889 --> 02:17:05,459
If he were to date Ji Yeon when he has so much lingering emotions,

2130
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:07,190
- Right. - they wouldn't have been happy.

2131
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:08,219
- Yes. - You're right.

2132
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:11,190
There's no need to date someone new just to get over another.

2133
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:13,329
- Yes, that's right. - Yes.

2134
02:17:13,329 --> 02:17:16,069
I feel like we could end up going to their wedding.

2135
02:17:16,069 --> 02:17:17,729
I'm going to give them a monetary gift.

2136
02:17:17,729 --> 02:17:19,639
I'll sing you a congratulatory song.

2137
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:21,569
How hard would it have been?

2138
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:24,709
I feel so relieved and refreshed now.

2139
02:17:24,979 --> 02:17:26,239
It's like I just watched...

2140
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:27,510
- the happy ending of a drama. - I know.

2141
02:17:31,049 --> 02:17:32,350
That was hard, right?

2142
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:34,620
Yes.

2143
02:17:41,629 --> 02:17:45,329
(All the decisions have been made.)

2144
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:47,260
- Hee Doo. - Yes?

2145
02:17:47,260 --> 02:17:49,129
We have become a final couple.

2146
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:52,739
Then are we reunited now?

2147
02:17:58,579 --> 02:18:00,309
- Is that right? - I know.

2148
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:02,780
Is it?

2149
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:05,350
Why are you laughing?

2150
02:18:05,479 --> 02:18:06,850
It doesn't feel real yet.

2151
02:18:09,719 --> 02:18:10,989
Can I be happy?

2152
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:13,190
But I really missed you a lot.

2153
02:18:13,959 --> 02:18:15,790
I'm tearing up. Why am I about to cry?

2154
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:18,430
I didn't know I could cry so much.

2155
02:18:18,559 --> 02:18:21,700
I also saw you cry the most while we were here.

2156
02:18:22,229 --> 02:18:23,899
But I really did miss you.

2157
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:25,969
After I saw you again,

2158
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:29,739
I wished I could be the person by your side.

2159
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:31,409
I felt jealous.

2160
02:18:32,479 --> 02:18:34,809
I still think we can change.

2161
02:18:35,579 --> 02:18:36,750
I feel it.

2162
02:18:37,350 --> 02:18:38,620
Did you not think of me?

2163
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:42,319
How could I not? I remembered everything.

2164
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:45,790
When I went to Lotte World for my first date...

2165
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:48,590
with Hae Eun, I was already thinking of you.

2166
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:51,799
(2 weeks ago)

2167
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:54,360
It's my first time meeting this person,

2168
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:57,569
and going to Lotte World is something I never considered.

2169
02:18:57,799 --> 02:19:01,399
I've been to Lotte World with Na Yeon too.

2170
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:04,870
That's why I thought I wanted to go there.

2171
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:06,040
(Hee Doo waited for Na Yeon.)

2172
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:07,909
Gosh.

2173
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:11,049
How is it? It's fun, right?

2174
02:19:11,049 --> 02:19:12,319
Yes, it's so much fun.

2175
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,979
Throughout the date,

2176
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:17,520
I kept thinking of Na Yeon without trying to.

2177
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:22,590
Going skating with a woman, just the two of us...

2178
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:24,790
She was the first.

2179
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:25,860
(Na Yeon was the first.)

2180
02:19:32,739 --> 02:19:35,340
And especially, the day I went on a date with Ji Yeon at the Han River.

2181
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:37,610
I thought of her a lot that day.

2182
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:40,309
- That was good, right? - Yes.

2183
02:19:41,139 --> 02:19:43,149
Going to the Han River...

2184
02:19:43,209 --> 02:19:46,479
with another woman, just the two of us, with Seol...

2185
02:19:46,479 --> 02:19:49,020
I've never talked or hung out like that.

2186
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:51,219
Na Yeon liked Seol so much,

2187
02:19:51,219 --> 02:19:53,790
so the way she treated Seol...

2188
02:19:53,790 --> 02:19:55,190
kept overlapping.

2189
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:56,889
I couldn't help but think of her.

2190
02:20:04,899 --> 02:20:07,469
On the one hand, we kept watching each other go on dates.

2191
02:20:07,469 --> 02:20:08,969
It was hard to watch,

2192
02:20:08,969 --> 02:20:10,340
and I kept getting jealous.

2193
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:15,079
If I was completely over her, I wouldn't have felt jealous.

2194
02:20:15,479 --> 02:20:21,420
I kept changing my mind to, "Do I want to get back with her?"

2195
02:20:21,719 --> 02:20:24,690
(Two days before the final decision)

2196
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:27,920
(Hee Doo's last text went to...)

2197
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:32,299
("Will we have time to go on a date before this ends?" From Hee Doo)

2198
02:20:33,899 --> 02:20:36,870
I felt happy. "He wants to go on a date with me too."

2199
02:20:36,969 --> 02:20:39,340
"Yes, it is our first time coming to Jeju Island."

2200
02:20:39,899 --> 02:20:42,270
So I was glad to see his text. I was happy.

2201
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:43,309
And I felt relieved.

2202
02:20:43,469 --> 02:20:45,709
She did seem like she was hoping...

2203
02:20:45,709 --> 02:20:48,549
that we might be able to work things out between us.

2204
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:54,219
The Na Yeon that I know...

2205
02:20:54,319 --> 02:20:56,350
is such a clear person.

2206
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:59,020
She knows how to be true to her feelings.

2207
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,159
There are so many positive things about her.

2208
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:07,200
I think it'd be good for me to become more like her.

2209
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:10,069
I have so much to learn from her.

2210
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:12,969
And I did learn a lot from her already.

2211
02:21:13,069 --> 02:21:14,940
Honestly, I have plenty of faults,

2212
02:21:14,940 --> 02:21:16,040
and I'm not perfect.

2213
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:18,610
Of course, I'm lacking in many ways.

2214
02:21:18,709 --> 02:21:21,739
But Na Yeon shows me that she loves me,

2215
02:21:21,739 --> 02:21:23,379
including all my imperfections.

2216
02:21:23,379 --> 02:21:26,120
She was the one who made me feel that way.

2217
02:21:27,879 --> 02:21:30,690
(Honestly, if you cry, I can't do anything.)

2218
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:33,620
Did you keep doing it?

2219
02:21:34,090 --> 02:21:37,530
(Why do you keep crying?)

2220
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:41,229
(He tried hard not to be fooled by the joy of seeing her again.)

2221
02:21:42,030 --> 02:21:45,639
(But he was the most afraid of losing Na Yeon.)

2222
02:21:46,899 --> 02:21:49,139
I had stopped...

2223
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:52,540
thinking about Na Yeon as I was treating her the way I did.

2224
02:21:52,979 --> 02:21:54,680
So I did nag her a lot.

2225
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:59,079
And I did think that I was being too harsh on her.

2226
02:21:59,149 --> 02:22:01,219
I think I wasn't being honest with my feelings.

2227
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,149
Now that I think of it, I feel very sorry.

2228
02:22:09,889 --> 02:22:11,030
Gosh, seriously.

2229
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:14,100
A precious person is really...

2230
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:16,100
It's more than just feeling giddy.

2231
02:22:16,729 --> 02:22:19,270
The trust that I have for Na Yeon...

2232
02:22:19,639 --> 02:22:22,639
and those feelings...

2233
02:22:23,469 --> 02:22:26,909
"Will I be able to feel that with other people?"

2234
02:22:26,909 --> 02:22:28,409
That's what I think.

2235
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,920
Shall we hold hands for the first time in a while?

2236
02:22:43,959 --> 02:22:44,959
I want to do it.

2237
02:22:46,930 --> 02:22:48,829
Oh, like this. This is it.

2238
02:22:55,809 --> 02:22:57,110
Gosh, this is crazy.

2239
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:01,510
Oh, I love it.

2240
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:06,719
- How is that? - What?

2241
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:08,649
I like this.

2242
02:23:13,459 --> 02:23:15,489
It's been a while since I held your hand.

2243
02:23:15,489 --> 02:23:17,729
I know. It's funny.

2244
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:26,469
I'm happy too, thanks to you.

2245
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:29,670
- I'm being sincere. Can't you tell? - Did you...

2246
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:32,209
- Did you read it on my face? - I'm being sincere.

2247
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:35,879
- Get in. - Thank you.

2248
02:23:39,149 --> 02:23:40,979
- Did you miss me a lot? - Yes.

2249
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:42,090
I missed you too.

2250
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:46,459
You don't remember yesterday very well, do you?

2251
02:23:46,459 --> 02:23:47,760
I remember everything.

2252
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:49,430
- I swear. - Really?

2253
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:53,899
When we were eating the sashimi and looking at the sea,

2254
02:23:53,899 --> 02:23:55,729
- I turned bright red. - do you remember taking a photo?

2255
02:23:55,729 --> 02:23:56,729
- I remember. - You do?

2256
02:23:56,729 --> 02:23:58,129
Do you remember how I soothed your face like this?

2257
02:23:58,129 --> 02:23:59,569
- Yes, I do. - You do?

2258
02:23:59,569 --> 02:24:02,239
Yes, your hand was warmer.

2259
02:24:03,239 --> 02:24:05,010
That place had really great food.

2260
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:07,379
Seriously, that place was the best.

2261
02:24:07,379 --> 02:24:08,909
I think we should remember that place.

2262
02:24:08,909 --> 02:24:10,049
Daesung Sashimi.

2263
02:24:10,309 --> 02:24:11,709
We have the address.

2264
02:24:11,709 --> 02:24:14,350
I know. And our photos are geo-tagged.

2265
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:16,719
- Right. - Let's go again sometime.

2266
02:24:18,389 --> 02:24:19,690
I hope we can do that.

2267
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:23,389
Let's go for sure. I want to go there now.

2268
02:24:23,389 --> 02:24:25,260
Should we go now? Should we run away?

2269
02:24:33,299 --> 02:24:35,639
The water is so calm.

2270
02:24:40,709 --> 02:24:41,780
You're cold, right?

2271
02:24:43,049 --> 02:24:44,149
Come with me.

2272
02:24:44,579 --> 02:24:46,620
Do you feel cold in this weather?

2273
02:24:46,719 --> 02:24:48,750
I'm okay, but you feel cold.

2274
02:24:51,819 --> 02:24:52,860
Look at the sea.

2275
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:56,790
It's so pretty. Let's remember this.

2276
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,899
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

2277
02:25:05,170 --> 02:25:06,569
I feel comfortable somehow.

2278
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:09,610
I know. A week has already...

2279
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:12,040
I liked yesterday the most.

2280
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,840
Me too. Wouldn't today be even better?

2281
02:25:15,239 --> 02:25:16,780
- It's good in a different way. - Right.

2282
02:25:17,579 --> 02:25:20,250
It feels like we're really in Jeju now that it's just us.

2283
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:21,979
Oh, right. It finally feels like it.

2284
02:25:28,389 --> 02:25:30,090
Thank you for choosing me.

2285
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:31,790
You really don't have to thank me.

2286
02:25:31,889 --> 02:25:35,159
It was long but short, thanks to you.

2287
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:38,840
It was nice, right?

2288
02:25:39,139 --> 02:25:41,299
We made so many memories on Jeju Island.

2289
02:25:42,809 --> 02:25:45,709
- Thank you. - I should say the same.

2290
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:52,319
Yes.

2291
02:25:52,649 --> 02:25:55,280
(They came to a photo booth like they promised.)

2292
02:25:55,950 --> 02:25:57,649
I look prettier on my right side.

2293
02:25:58,889 --> 02:26:00,819
- What about the pose? - Pose? Just do whatever.

2294
02:26:00,819 --> 02:26:01,959
Just do it on the spot.

2295
02:26:02,430 --> 02:26:03,659
This isn't easy.

2296
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:07,430
This is popular these days. Is it this?

2297
02:26:07,799 --> 02:26:09,270
- It's this! - Is it?

2298
02:26:09,799 --> 02:26:11,600
Make the heart look good.

2299
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:12,940
- Like this? - Make the heart look good.

2300
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:15,370
It worked.

2301
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:16,409
Did it work?

2302
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:21,540
Looking at each other?

2303
02:26:27,079 --> 02:26:29,719
- I like it. - Hey, it turned out nice.

2304
02:26:34,219 --> 02:26:35,389
This turned out nice.

2305
02:26:36,659 --> 02:26:37,690
It's pretty.

2306
02:26:40,059 --> 02:26:41,059
I like it.

2307
02:26:45,299 --> 02:26:48,239
- Your wish came true, right? - Yes, my wish came true.

2308
02:26:54,809 --> 02:26:56,909
(Na Eon and Tae I came to eat braised hairtail.)

2309
02:26:58,180 --> 02:26:59,620
Take one piece.

2310
02:26:59,819 --> 02:27:00,819
(They look very excited.)

2311
02:27:00,819 --> 02:27:02,319
Take two pieces.

2312
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,559
- Why are you laughing? - You're so funny.

2313
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:08,559
(His dignity has fallen.)

2314
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:11,190
Thank you.

2315
02:27:11,559 --> 02:27:14,459
You said you could eat all of this. Eat it all.

2316
02:27:14,899 --> 02:27:17,170
Did you debone the fish for me? I'm so touched.

2317
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:18,729
It seemed like you were having a hard time.

2318
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:20,370
Will you only eat if I debone it for you?

2319
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:21,370
No.

2320
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:24,069
- I ate so much. - I did too.

2321
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:29,950
Should we do this?

2322
02:27:30,549 --> 02:27:33,350
But if I go there...

2323
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:35,149
I said I could on Friday.

2324
02:27:36,649 --> 02:27:38,250
- Hey. - What was that?

2325
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:39,290
You always do this.

2326
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:42,989
What's this? They ended up together.

2327
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:49,200
Weren't you a bit too startled?

2328
02:27:49,430 --> 02:27:52,500
But I... Gosh. I didn't expect this.

2329
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,569
- What is this? - Really?

2330
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:56,270
I said this.

2331
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:57,909
I want you to be happy.

2332
02:27:58,170 --> 02:28:01,280
Hey. But why did everyone, while we were staying here,

2333
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:04,149
say that they wanted me to be happy? Everyone said it once.

2334
02:28:04,149 --> 02:28:05,850
I said this too, several times.

2335
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:08,680
- I heard everyone say it once too. - Why is that?

2336
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:12,690
So I was very grateful, and I really wanted to become happy.

2337
02:28:15,559 --> 02:28:19,260
Making the decision was really hard.

2338
02:28:19,459 --> 02:28:21,860
Being able to decide on my own takes courage.

2339
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:25,670
And I was able to have assurance about my own courage.

2340
02:28:25,799 --> 02:28:28,739
And choosing Hyun Gyu was my decision.

2341
02:28:28,969 --> 02:28:31,139
So I will have to find my happiness for myself.

2342
02:28:35,909 --> 02:28:38,350
- Hae Eun. - Girl.

2343
02:28:38,350 --> 02:28:40,219
I missed you!

2344
02:28:40,649 --> 02:28:42,389
- Hae Eun! - You went through so much.

2345
02:28:42,389 --> 02:28:44,389
You too. It was so hard, wasn't it?

2346
02:28:44,389 --> 02:28:46,520
- I know. - It was hard, right?

2347
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:48,590
- Goodness. - We both had it hard.

2348
02:28:48,690 --> 02:28:50,690
- We're already... - Hae Eun, don't cry.

2349
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:52,760
Let's only smile from now on. It's all over now.

2350
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:54,899
It's over. You went through so much.

2351
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:56,969
Hae Eun, did you choose Hyun Gyu?

2352
02:28:57,799 --> 02:29:00,370
Good. You really did well.

2353
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:02,370
Hae Eun. We're both couples.

2354
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:05,610
- We're couples now. - We are.

2355
02:29:05,610 --> 02:29:07,340
Now, you just have to be happy.

2356
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:09,610
While living here,

2357
02:29:10,379 --> 02:29:14,149
I felt all sorts of emotions at the same time.

2358
02:29:14,379 --> 02:29:17,250
I learned how to understand other people's feelings.

2359
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:19,860
I also learned how to sort out my own feelings...

2360
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:22,219
and think things through.

2361
02:29:22,659 --> 02:29:24,489
I used to be pretty bad at that.

2362
02:29:24,729 --> 02:29:27,129
I grew a lot thanks to the people here.

2363
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:31,569
- Thanks for everything. - You too.

2364
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:34,739
Seriously, thanks for everything, Bin.

2365
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:37,010
I didn't do much.

2366
02:29:37,139 --> 02:29:38,809
(Hee Doo comes outside...)

2367
02:29:41,879 --> 02:29:43,649
(and smiles at someone.)

2368
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:57,729
I feel really grateful to Hee Doo.

2369
02:29:57,729 --> 02:30:01,500
He made me feel a lot of things I haven't felt before.

2370
02:30:01,799 --> 02:30:03,700
Can I be honest?

2371
02:30:04,229 --> 02:30:08,340
After this, I'll meet a cool guy...

2372
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:12,209
who is a mix of Hee Doo and Tae I.

2373
02:30:12,610 --> 02:30:15,340
A guy who is attractive and also affectionate.

2374
02:30:15,379 --> 02:30:17,209
I'm sure a guy like that is out there somewhere.

2375
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:22,920
I feel like I completely let go of my hidden lingering feelings...

2376
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:24,319
I had for her.

2377
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:27,159
Now I want...

2378
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:30,629
to cheer for her like she has been doing for me.

2379
02:30:30,629 --> 02:30:32,459
Looking back now,

2380
02:30:32,629 --> 02:30:34,700
I don't think I would've been...

2381
02:30:35,969 --> 02:30:39,040
able to resolve things with Won Bin if we hadn't had this time together.

2382
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:43,069
There are a lot of good people in this world.

2383
02:30:43,069 --> 02:30:46,409
The time here allowed me to reflect on myself a lot.

2384
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:49,149
The time here especially helped...

2385
02:30:50,209 --> 02:30:53,750
Hyun Gyu and I to be honest with each other.

2386
02:30:53,850 --> 02:30:56,520
I was glad that Na Eon and I...

2387
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:59,420
were able to resolve things.

2388
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:00,920
- Can you eat sour things? - Yes.

2389
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:02,590
(The three are gathered in Hyun Gyu's room.)

2390
02:31:03,559 --> 02:31:06,559
Can you believe that the three of us are here together?

2391
02:31:06,559 --> 02:31:07,659
It's unbelievable.

2392
02:31:08,659 --> 02:31:09,969
It's possible because it's you two.

2393
02:31:09,969 --> 02:31:11,030
That's true.

2394
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,299
I could never.

2395
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:15,870
(Hae Eun tries to give someone a cookie.)

2396
02:31:16,409 --> 02:31:17,440
(They're like kitties waiting for food.)

2397
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:19,610
- I don't know what to do. - Who will you feed first?

2398
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:21,340
You should still feed me first.

2399
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:22,340
You should feed her first.

2400
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:23,909
I'll feed you first. Sorry.

2401
02:31:24,049 --> 02:31:26,020
That was the biggest decision I had to make in life.

2402
02:31:26,219 --> 02:31:27,219
Cheese.

2403
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:31,190
- Wait. - Your ex and current interest.

2404
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:34,360
- Which one of us is prettier? - Hey.

2405
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:35,590
He said you were prettier.

2406
02:31:36,430 --> 02:31:37,690
- I don't know. - You must feel sad.

2407
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:55,409
- What are you looking at? - You're pretty.

2408
02:31:59,350 --> 02:32:00,350
Oh, my.

2409
02:32:00,950 --> 02:32:03,219
- I'm struggling. - Why do you look so happy, Ki Seok?

2410
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:05,049
Why do you look so happy?

2411
02:32:05,049 --> 02:32:07,360
- I'm so happy. - Why are they whispering?

2412
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:08,389
"You're pretty."

2413
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,889
It makes my heart race.

2414
02:32:09,889 --> 02:32:12,500
- I want to date him. - We have our earphones in.

2415
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:13,659
We can hear him so well.

2416
02:32:13,659 --> 02:32:15,030
I want to be Hae Eun.

2417
02:32:15,030 --> 02:32:17,170
"What are you looking at?" "You're pretty."

2418
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:18,770
"You're pretty."

2419
02:32:20,739 --> 02:32:22,909
- What are you looking at? - You're pretty.

2420
02:32:28,579 --> 02:32:30,649
That's true. I'm quite pretty.

2421
02:32:31,350 --> 02:32:33,850
- I'm looking because you're pretty. - I am pretty, aren't I?

2422
02:32:37,549 --> 02:32:38,690
Your smile is pretty.

2423
02:32:39,290 --> 02:32:40,520
What if I don't smile?

2424
02:32:41,459 --> 02:32:43,690
- You're still pretty. - What if I smile?

2425
02:32:43,690 --> 02:32:44,829
You're pretty.

2426
02:32:44,829 --> 02:32:46,829
- What about this? - You're always pretty.

2427
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:51,870
When I'm in a relationship,

2428
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:57,610
I think it's very important to be my true self.

2429
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:02,209
That's why I felt sorry for Hae Eun.

2430
02:33:02,239 --> 02:33:03,909
She's normally a bright person,

2431
02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:06,350
but she wasn't able to be herself here.

2432
02:33:06,879 --> 02:33:09,020
I think Hae Eun is someone...

2433
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:11,819
who lets me be myself.

2434
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:14,190
After we came to Jeju,

2435
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:18,389
Hyun Gyu was like a gift to me.

2436
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:20,430
Meeting Hyun Gyu...

2437
02:33:20,629 --> 02:33:24,030
made my whole week here happy.

2438
02:33:25,069 --> 02:33:28,100
I couldn't believe how different I felt.

2439
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:31,940
I want Hae Eun to be happy and well...

2440
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:34,079
in whatever way.

2441
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:37,950
To be honest,

2442
02:33:37,950 --> 02:33:40,350
I kind of regret...

2443
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:42,250
not being truthful with Hae Eun...

2444
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:45,489
and not telling her that I felt jealous.

2445
02:33:45,889 --> 02:33:50,790
I wish I took some chances...

2446
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:52,090
to talk to her.

2447
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:54,159
I regret that.

2448
02:33:55,329 --> 02:33:57,270
I should've just told her.

2449
02:33:59,540 --> 02:34:00,899
(3 weeks ago, 1st day)

2450
02:34:00,899 --> 02:34:05,440
On the first day, I kept wondering if she would come that day...

2451
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:07,610
or the next day.

2452
02:34:07,610 --> 02:34:09,309
(3rd day, Gyu Min's birthday)

2453
02:34:09,309 --> 02:34:12,209
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2454
02:34:14,719 --> 02:34:17,450
I expected Hae Eun would come.

2455
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:20,459
I imagined...

2456
02:34:20,659 --> 02:34:24,489
that if my ex was here,

2457
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:26,700
she would've told me happy birthday.

2458
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:28,360
(Gyu Min secretly waited for Hae Eun.)

2459
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:30,930
I keep thinking you're younger...

2460
02:34:30,930 --> 02:34:32,129
because you use honorifics.

2461
02:34:32,129 --> 02:34:33,170
(After a new person came into his heart...)

2462
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:34,770
- You know what I mean, right? - Oh, really?

2463
02:34:36,170 --> 02:34:38,440
I didn't really think we needed to see each other.

2464
02:34:40,809 --> 02:34:44,209
I think me not caring about my ex...

2465
02:34:44,309 --> 02:34:47,149
is what's best for the person...

2466
02:34:47,149 --> 02:34:48,780
I'm currently interested in.

2467
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:53,889
(Two weeks later, last interview)

2468
02:34:53,889 --> 02:34:55,620
I was so mean to her.

2469
02:34:56,129 --> 02:34:57,559
I'm so mean.

2470
02:34:59,159 --> 02:35:00,430
I realized that.

2471
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:16,750
- I'll treat you. - When?

2472
02:35:16,750 --> 02:35:18,110
(He regretted...)

2473
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:19,579
Why are you crying?

2474
02:35:20,319 --> 02:35:25,350
(not being honest with her.)

2475
02:35:26,459 --> 02:35:27,559
Why are you crying?

2476
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:36,629
She was the one person...

2477
02:35:38,069 --> 02:35:40,500
I really didn't want to hurt,

2478
02:35:41,399 --> 02:35:45,069
but I ended up hurting her more...

2479
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:48,139
than anyone else.

2480
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:51,510
I keep thinking that.

2481
02:35:52,479 --> 02:35:56,450
I think I was very arrogant.

2482
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:58,590
I thought that I could control my emotions.

2483
02:35:58,590 --> 02:36:00,819
I thought that I could...

2484
02:36:00,819 --> 02:36:02,760
be mature.

2485
02:36:02,790 --> 02:36:06,659
I now think that I was very arrogant.

2486
02:36:07,159 --> 02:36:10,370
I'm not a great person myself,

2487
02:36:10,370 --> 02:36:13,500
but I kept criticizing...

2488
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,040
Hae Eun.

2489
02:36:17,409 --> 02:36:20,309
In the end, I was the one...

2490
02:36:20,309 --> 02:36:22,610
who was still stuck in our past.

2491
02:36:25,979 --> 02:36:27,780
I really regret it.

2492
02:36:31,149 --> 02:36:33,819
When I meet someone next time,

2493
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:36,290
I want to be more affectionate...

2494
02:36:36,659 --> 02:36:38,690
and more expressive...

2495
02:36:38,690 --> 02:36:41,100
about my feelings and emotions.

2496
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:43,969
I want to love that person...

2497
02:36:43,969 --> 02:36:46,639
just as they are.

2498
02:36:50,139 --> 02:36:54,010
(And now, Hae Eun's untold story.)

2499
02:36:57,879 --> 02:37:00,750
I never took off this necklace since I came here. Not even once.

2500
02:37:01,649 --> 02:37:03,920
(Hae Eun always kept this necklace on.)

2501
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:04,989
Do you know that?

2502
02:37:06,389 --> 02:37:08,420
Oh, this was a gift from Gyu Min as well.

2503
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:11,229
It was a birthday gift...

2504
02:37:11,229 --> 02:37:13,329
for my 26th, I mean, 25th birthday.

2505
02:37:14,329 --> 02:37:16,569
I wore this necklace like a tattoo...

2506
02:37:16,569 --> 02:37:19,969
ever since Gyu Min gave it to me.

2507
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:22,469
Hello.

2508
02:37:22,469 --> 02:37:23,870
(The necklace that she wore on the first day...)

2509

(was on her neck throughout the past three weeks.)

2510
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:43,129
Should I have grabbed that instead?

2511
02:37:43,129 --> 02:37:44,659
You're wearing that necklace again.

2512
02:37:45,290 --> 02:37:46,459
You didn't even look, did you?

2513
02:37:46,459 --> 02:37:48,899
I was wearing it for three weeks. You didn't see it, did you?

2514
02:37:50,469 --> 02:37:52,100
(2nd day)

2515
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:54,500
I think I'll always keep it on going forward.

2516
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:56,670
I'm not going to take it off even once,

2517
02:37:56,770 --> 02:37:58,170
not even when I shower.

2518
02:37:59,239 --> 02:38:01,909
(Now, it's the final decision day.)

2519
02:38:04,149 --> 02:38:07,219
(Hae Eun took off her necklace.)

2520
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:09,479
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, I see.

2521
02:38:09,479 --> 02:38:10,590
I see.

2522
02:38:14,459 --> 02:38:16,430
She was going to pick Hyun Gyu.

2523
02:38:22,729 --> 02:38:26,239
I felt I should take off my necklace before I went to Hyun Gyu.

2524
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:30,309
Hyun Gyu doesn't know, but it has some meaning to me,

2525
02:38:30,739 --> 02:38:32,040
so I took it off.

2526
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:35,510
You were waiting for a while, right?

2527
02:38:36,909 --> 02:38:38,079
Are you surprised?

2528
02:38:39,350 --> 02:38:40,579
Don't cry.

(Where was Hae Eun's text headed?)

2531
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:59,030
I think her ideal type is someone that doesn't get jealous.

That day, my hand was warmer somehow.

- Isn't my hand warm right now? - It is.

- Your hands are cold. How is it? - You're right.

2538

How does it feel to have your hands warmed up?

2539

It's warm.

2540

I sent him the text to express...

that I'd warm up his hands again.

even after Truth or Dare was over.

02:40:24,149 --> 02:40:26,860
When I'm scared and worried about something,

2562
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:29,219
he just says, "Why? It looks fun."

2563
02:40:29,319 --> 02:40:30,860
Or "Hae Eun, don't worry. Don't cry."

2564
02:40:31,959 --> 02:40:34,100
Him saying those kinds of things makes me feel supported.

2565
02:40:34,559 --> 02:40:36,430
I can rely on him.

2566
02:40:37,969 --> 02:40:39,940
(Is there something you want from Hae Eun?)

2567
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:42,500
No. I just want her to smile.

2568
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:44,940
She has a pretty smile.

2569
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:46,680
(Hae Eun has a pretty smile.)

2570
02:40:47,510 --> 02:40:48,739
Tae I...

2571
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:50,979
is funny.

2572
02:40:51,149 --> 02:40:53,950
Even if he doesn't say much,

2573
02:40:54,319 --> 02:40:56,719
he's the most comfortable and fun to be with.

2574
02:40:57,090 --> 02:41:00,190
Also, he has a lot of cute moments.

2575
02:41:03,889 --> 02:41:06,260
- My leg almost cramped up. - Hurry. Again.

2576
02:41:06,430 --> 02:41:07,559
Cheese.

2577
02:41:11,129 --> 02:41:12,430
In the room... Oh, my goodness.

2578
02:41:12,430 --> 02:41:13,799
- What did you say? - That scared me.

2579
02:41:15,870 --> 02:41:18,270
- Oh, goodness. - Hey, you scared me.

2580
02:41:18,370 --> 02:41:19,510
My heart is beating so fast.

2581
02:41:20,709 --> 02:41:21,809
- Let me see. - Touch it.

2582
02:41:22,809 --> 02:41:23,979
You're right.

2583
02:41:23,979 --> 02:41:25,309
I thought it was a bug.

2584
02:41:27,549 --> 02:41:30,520
(Are you interested in taking things further with Na Eon?)

2585
02:41:31,049 --> 02:41:32,290
I am.

2586
02:41:38,459 --> 02:41:40,430
(Thinking)

2587
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:41,930
We're dating,

2588
02:41:42,629 --> 02:41:44,299
but how should we count the days we've been dating?

2589
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:46,299
I don't know where to start.

2590
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:51,110
We've been dating for too long to say this is our first day.

2591
02:41:51,639 --> 02:41:53,639
I think it was a precious opportunity...

2592
02:41:53,639 --> 02:41:56,110
to reflect on myself.

2593
02:41:56,379 --> 02:41:57,680
I think I need to accept her...

2594
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,709
the way she is.

2595
02:41:59,950 --> 02:42:01,920
She is the way she is,

2596
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:03,989
and it's true that she has way more good sides...

2597
02:42:03,989 --> 02:42:06,420
than bad sides.

2598
02:42:07,360 --> 02:42:09,090
That's just who she is.

2599
02:42:09,090 --> 02:42:10,329
(That's just who she is.)

2600
02:42:10,489 --> 02:42:14,129
I was able to learn more about Na Yeon.

2601
02:42:14,530 --> 02:42:16,600
It was a really special time...

2602
02:42:17,569 --> 02:42:19,200
even if I got hurt in the process.

2603
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:26,579
Again.

2604
02:42:26,579 --> 02:42:27,809
- It's the second one, okay? - Okay.

2605
02:42:37,350 --> 02:42:38,920
Your hands are still warm.

2606
02:42:39,690 --> 02:42:41,489
Hold hands for the first time in a while...

2607
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:43,489
feels like... I don't know how to put it.

2608
02:42:43,489 --> 02:42:45,229
It feels awkward, nice,

2609
02:42:45,229 --> 02:42:47,030
exciting, and new.

2610
02:42:47,129 --> 02:42:48,360
You need to change this now.

2611
02:42:49,629 --> 02:42:51,069
- Oh, right. - You should change it.

2612
02:42:51,069 --> 02:42:52,270
I should put this ring on.

2613
02:42:54,370 --> 02:42:55,840
He needs to bring back the Cartier.

2614
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:00,840
I had completely forgotten about it.

2615
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:03,040
They should. It'd be a waste. It's an expensive one.

2616
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:05,250
- Right. - Yes. You have to put it on here.

2617
02:43:05,479 --> 02:43:06,979
Put it on for me too.

2618
02:43:09,219 --> 02:43:10,750
- You look so good right now. - Really?

2619
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:16,059
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

2620
02:43:16,059 --> 02:43:17,229
That's how I feel.

2621
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:19,629
Hug me.

2622
02:43:22,059 --> 02:43:23,170
You...

2623
02:43:26,969 --> 02:43:28,469
- It's really nice. - What?

2624
02:43:28,569 --> 02:43:30,469
- It's nice. - Today, you look especially...

2625
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:32,069
Am I short today?

2626
02:43:32,909 --> 02:43:33,979
Am I especially short?

2627
02:43:34,139 --> 02:43:35,239
No, I'm not.

2628
02:43:38,149 --> 02:43:40,049
- What? Are you happy? - I am.

2629
02:43:42,750 --> 02:43:44,319
Who knew we'd end up like this?

2630
02:43:44,389 --> 02:43:45,920
- We had no idea, right? - Right.

2631
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:48,290
How can I feel excited even after dating for four years?

2632
02:43:52,059 --> 02:43:53,229
What?

2633
02:44:01,569 --> 02:44:05,309
(And now...)

2634
02:44:05,409 --> 02:44:08,379
(The two went waterskiing where Hee Doo went with Ji Yeon.)

2635
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:10,610
I'm going to see my boyfriend today.

2636
02:44:10,610 --> 02:44:11,909
What kind of style does your boyfriend like?

2637
02:44:11,909 --> 02:44:13,750
He likes fresh and youthful styles.

2638
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:18,649
Then I'll do your hair in that style today.

2639
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:21,420
I think my hair is going to fall out.

2640
02:44:25,989 --> 02:44:27,200
What are they doing?

2641
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:30,600
Those two are funny.

2642
02:44:30,969 --> 02:44:33,840
- They have fun together. - They do have fun together.

2643
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:35,700
Why is he so serious?

2644
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:52,319
- Look over there. - Over there.

2645
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:53,520
- That's amazing. - That's amazing.

2646
02:44:58,590 --> 02:44:59,790
I panned the camera like this,

2647
02:44:59,790 --> 02:45:00,959
but you're not in the frame.

2648
02:45:10,770 --> 02:45:12,110
The pictures look nice.

2649
02:45:12,469 --> 02:45:13,680
Seriously.

2650
02:45:31,229 --> 02:45:33,600
- Will they show us the present? - They'll show us, right?

2651
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:35,659
Aren't they going to show us? Please show us.

2652
02:45:35,659 --> 02:45:37,299
- I think they're dating. - Please show us.

2653
02:45:37,299 --> 02:45:38,299
Please show us.

2654
02:45:38,299 --> 02:45:39,399
And now. And now.

2655
02:45:39,399 --> 02:45:40,500
- And now. - And now.

2656
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:41,600
And now.

2657
02:45:44,139 --> 02:45:45,639
- These look nice. - They do.

2658
02:45:49,379 --> 02:45:50,649
No, we should take it from the other side.

2659
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,649
Oh, that looks pretty.

2660
02:45:58,290 --> 02:46:03,430
(In September, the two went to an art fair.)

2661
02:46:07,629 --> 02:46:09,159
Oh, my goodness!

2662
02:46:09,399 --> 02:46:10,799
It's just a date.

2663
02:46:10,899 --> 02:46:12,229
They didn't say those two were dating.

2664
02:46:12,229 --> 02:46:13,700
What?

2665
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:16,440
- But I'm happy about the date. - Right?

2666
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:18,270
This is so fun.

2667
02:46:18,270 --> 02:46:20,309
It's nice to see them continue their relationship.

2668
02:46:20,309 --> 02:46:22,340
Exactly. It's nice.

2669
02:46:24,450 --> 02:46:25,649
Let's try walking like this.

2670
02:46:29,319 --> 02:46:31,389
- You're good at this. - Right? I'm good at walking.

2671
02:46:31,389 --> 02:46:32,420
Tae I should just...

2672
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:33,860
- I'm so curious about these two. - Seriously.

2673
02:46:33,959 --> 02:46:35,459
I want to see their "And now."

2674
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:37,059
And now. And now.

2675
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:42,559
You're good at this.

2676
02:46:42,629 --> 02:46:43,799
Right? I'm good at walking.

2677
02:46:48,969 --> 02:46:50,610
I think this is a lamp.

2678
02:47:01,450 --> 02:47:02,620
This is pretty.

2679
02:47:03,649 --> 02:47:06,350
- This one's really pretty. - This one's really pretty too.

2680
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:14,559
I'm getting a little bit cold.

2681
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:21,600
- Is it warm? - It is.

2682
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:22,799
That's so pretty.

2683
02:47:38,219 --> 02:47:39,520
Aren't you going to say, "What are you looking at?"

2684
02:47:43,059 --> 02:47:44,889
Daisy. I like daisies.

2685
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:48,530
I like daisies.

2686
02:47:50,469 --> 02:47:53,569
- Isn't my jacket big? - It is. I love it.

2687
02:47:53,569 --> 02:47:54,840
- It's roomy. - What?

2688
02:47:54,840 --> 02:47:58,340
- The shoulders are roomy. - You're right. They are.

2689
02:47:58,340 --> 02:48:00,979
- Right? - You're right.

2690
02:48:02,209 --> 02:48:04,180
You're awesome. The jacket is nice and roomy.

2691
02:48:04,180 --> 02:48:05,610
Your shoulders are so nice.

2692
02:48:07,950 --> 02:48:10,649
I wish this train keeps going.

2693
02:48:16,930 --> 02:48:19,329
I'm going to be upset if they don't show their "And now."

2694
02:48:19,329 --> 02:48:21,559
- I'm 100 percent sure they will. - They'll show us.

2695
02:48:21,659 --> 02:48:23,129
I told you not to be 100 percent sure.

2696
02:48:23,129 --> 02:48:24,469
If I'm wrong, I'm going to leave the show.

2697
02:48:25,430 --> 02:48:27,670
- You're still so funny. - There's no show to leave anymore.

2698
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:30,209
- How is it? - What?

2699
02:48:30,209 --> 02:48:31,670
How is it?

2700
02:48:32,209 --> 02:48:34,110
- Why? - Just asking.

2701
02:48:34,209 --> 02:48:35,680
Be careful not to fall.

2702
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:36,680
Of course.

2703
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:42,280
Let's hide.

2704
02:49:13,110 --> 02:49:15,319
- Oh, goodness. - This is crazy.

2705
02:49:15,319 --> 02:49:16,450
Oh, my goodness.

2706
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:19,149
They're being so affectionate.

2707
02:49:19,319 --> 02:49:21,389
- I've been waiting so much. - And now.

2708
02:49:21,659 --> 02:49:23,760
Please give us "And now."

2709
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:25,059
Please give us "And now."

2710
02:49:25,659 --> 02:49:26,790
And now.

2711
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:30,200
- What? - I'm getting all nervous.

2712
02:49:30,969 --> 02:49:32,069
Weren't you nervous?

2713
02:49:32,069 --> 02:49:34,840
I am nervous. I'm excited. That's why it's more fun.

2714
02:49:37,870 --> 02:49:41,079
(And now...)

2715
02:49:44,450 --> 02:49:45,879
They did it!

2716
02:49:45,979 --> 02:49:47,719
I got goosebumps.

2717
02:49:47,719 --> 02:49:50,079
- Really? Yes. - I seriously got goosebumps.

2718
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:52,020
- I got goosebumps. - I'm so happy.

2719
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:31,030
I got goosebumps.

2720
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:33,329
I'm getting goosebumps, seriously.

2721
02:50:33,659 --> 02:50:34,860
I'm getting goosebumps.

2722
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:36,860
I seriously got goosebumps.

2723
02:50:39,069 --> 02:50:40,200
- Oh, seriously. - I seriously got goosebumps.

2724
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:42,469
Seriously, congratulations.

2725
02:50:43,069 --> 02:50:45,709
The "And now" was such a twist.

2726
02:50:45,709 --> 02:50:47,610
- Really. - I wish you happiness.

2727
02:50:47,909 --> 02:50:49,280
I don't want to leave them.

2728
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:51,110
We have to leave them now.

2729
02:50:51,110 --> 02:50:54,180
What am I going to look forward to now?

2730
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:56,780
It was really nice seeing...

2731
02:50:56,780 --> 02:50:59,590
good people become good friends.

2732
02:50:59,690 --> 02:51:03,020
I really hope for all of them to find true love.

2733
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:06,090
I think our time talking together...

2734
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:07,959
was very meaningful...

2735
02:51:07,959 --> 02:51:10,370
for me as well.

2736
02:51:10,469 --> 02:51:12,870
I feel like I learned about life.

2737
02:51:12,870 --> 02:51:14,000
I watched a story about growth.

2738
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,440
- You're right. Growth. - I learned so much,

2739
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:17,969
not just about love,

2740
02:51:17,969 --> 02:51:19,110
but also about friendship.

2741
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:22,479
It feels like we got to indirectly experience...

2742
02:51:22,479 --> 02:51:24,379
all of those emotions with them.

2743
02:51:24,850 --> 02:51:26,649
I was sincerely invested,

2744
02:51:27,549 --> 02:51:30,219
and I really loved them.

2745
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:32,319
I gained a lot...

2746
02:51:32,319 --> 02:51:35,959
through EXchange 2.

2747
02:51:35,959 --> 02:51:37,260
What did you gain, for example?

2748
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:38,930
First of all, a lot more people know me now.

2749
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:41,659
What is that?

2750
02:51:42,729 --> 02:51:45,600
Why do you sound like a rookie?

2751
02:51:45,670 --> 02:51:47,569
You're not a rookie. Come on.

2752
02:51:47,569 --> 02:51:48,600
- Wait. - What do you mean?

2753
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,969
You have over 10 million followers.

2754
02:51:49,969 --> 02:51:51,309
Exactly. What are you saying?

2755
02:51:51,309 --> 02:51:54,879
- Honestly, I was going to quit... - Seriously, what?

2756
02:51:54,879 --> 02:51:56,379
after my contract with JYP ends.

2757
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:57,780
I was going to go back to Thailand.

2758
02:51:57,780 --> 02:51:59,180
- For real? - I was going to.

2759
02:51:59,180 --> 02:52:00,479
Since I debuted in Korea,

2760
02:52:00,479 --> 02:52:03,350
I wanted to be successful here.

2761
02:52:03,479 --> 02:52:07,959
EXchange made that possible for me.

2762
02:52:08,090 --> 02:52:10,860
It opened up a way...

2763
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:13,190
- for you to succeed in Korea. - You're so honest.

02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:18,500

- You were the best. - Thanks to EXchange,

2770
02:52:23,100 --> 02:52:25,209
I gained confidence...

2771
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:28,040
about my career in Korea.

2772
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:30,950
The participants really put their heart into this.

2773
02:52:30,950 --> 02:52:32,649
Their sincerity.

2774
02:52:32,649 --> 02:52:33,680
Exactly.

2775
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:36,079
I'd like to thank all of the participants who shared...

2776
02:52:36,079 --> 02:52:38,549
- their sincere emotions with us. - Seriously. You're right.

Thank you so much.

2778
02:52:39,549 --> 02:52:42,520
Thanks to them, I was so happy. I cried and laughed.

2779
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:44,860

- I'd like to say something. - Of course.

2783
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:53,299
- I'm curious to hear. - After watching you for a while,

2784
02:52:53,399 --> 02:52:55,469
I don't think you're funny anymore.

2785
02:52:55,899 --> 02:52:59,610
You're right. They're are all honest people.

2786
02:52:59,610 --> 02:53:00,610
Very cool people.

2787
02:53:00,610 --> 02:53:01,610
At least they're consistent.

2788
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:03,879
- Right. Cool people. - Cool people.

Seriously.

2793
02:53:10,379 --> 02:53:15,020
It was a nice memory, so I'm a bit sad that it's over. I'm a bit teary.

if we were to meet again outside of the show.

I really like Won Bin.

Won Bin kept approaching me.

2813

He came to me and asked me for my phone number.

2814

but I'm sure that there will come a time...

2819
02:54:51,649 --> 02:54:55,690
when I miss this after a while.

2820
02:54:57,020 --> 02:54:58,030
So cute.
