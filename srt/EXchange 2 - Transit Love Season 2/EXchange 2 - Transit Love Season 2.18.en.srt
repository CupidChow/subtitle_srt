00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,339
- So Gyu Min? - Of course.

162
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,269
I'm certain he chose me.

163
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,239
- Of course. - No. That's not what I meant.

164
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,179
I know he probably chose me. But I'm not sure who I should pick.

165
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,310
Isn't it obvious?

166
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,980
I did want to spend some time with him.

167
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,679
- I wanted to spend time with him. - What?

168
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,819
But it wasn't fun.

169
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
No.

170
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,319
- I should still do it? - Yes.

171
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,790
If you pull out now, you will never have this chance.

172
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,459
You'll end up with Tae I for the rest of your life.

173
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,370
Do it if that's what you want to do.

174
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:38,869
I'm sure Gyu Min chose you.

175
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,508
Right. Probably.

176
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:41,539
- He probably did. - Yes.

177
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,139
If you choose Tae I, not Gyu Min,

178
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:45,980
you'll try again.

179
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,910
But you can still choose Gyu Min today.

180
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,980
You'll have time to think about it tomorrow.

181
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,648
I see. Even if I go back?

182
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,220
- Right. - You'll still have time.

183
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,730
I'm in no position to give advice. But I'm worrying about you.

184
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:12,040
You'll still have time.

185
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,409
I'm not sure. Seriously.

186
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,040
By tomorrow, you'll be certain.

187
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,708
- You're certain they chose you. - Yes.

188
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:20,949
- I'm certain of it too. - Okay.

189
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,219
Then you should go on a date with Gyu Min. That makes sense.

190
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,819
- Gyu Min? - Obviously. Why think about it?

191
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,188
I'm not saying it because Tae I is my ex. This is a no-brainer.

192
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,060
I understand that. But I...

193
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,689
Okay.

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,930
- But you did come late. - One more person.

195
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,929
- But we still drank two bottles. - You were late.

196
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,129
- Two bottles. - More than two bottles?

197
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,470
You remember that earlier, right?

198
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,309
"Just give it to him."

199
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,979
Yes. I was impatient. I wanted to know what it said.

200
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,009
Okay.

201
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,250
But don't do stuff like that.

202
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,888
Okay. Sorry.

203
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,220
No. Don't do something like this.

204
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,959
- Usually. - I'm getting angry.

205
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,128
- Cheers. - Cheers.

206
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,029
- I'm so angry. - Why?

207
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,500
Let's talk later. I'm sorry.

208
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,209
Gosh. Why did I take the photo like this?

209
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,709
(The doorbell rings again.)

210
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,709
Again?

211
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,220
- I'll go this time. - This is driving me crazy.

212
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,120
This is getting fun.

213
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,419
- There's another one? - Hurry.

214
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,490
Gosh. I found it.

215
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,928
- Let's read it before we go back. - Okay. Really?

216
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,360
Let's read it first.

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

218
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,299
- I love you. - Sure.

219
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,169
- Yes. - Okay?

220
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,710
Why did you do that to me? I'm curious.

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,970
- Won Bin wants to read it. - Won Bin.

222
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,579
- I mean... - He's never read it before.

223
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,340
- You should read it. - You want me to read it?

224
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,479
- No. Won Bin should read it. - He wants to read it.

225
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,610
Read it, Ji Yeon.

226
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,919
- Hey, Ji Yeon. - Why is it folded?

227
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,189
I read it once.

228
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,319
- What is it? - Look at her face. She's serious!

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,559
- This is crazy. - She's serious. Oh, my.

230
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:14,329
- Gosh. - Did they just make this?

231
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,190
- What is it? - What are you doing?

232
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,659
That's the result?

233
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,359
I read it once.

234
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,459
- What is it? - Look at her face. She's serious!

235
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,669
- This is crazy. - She's serious. Oh, my.

236
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,398
- Gosh. - Did they just make this?

237
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,299
- What is it? - What are you doing?

238
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,840
- That's the result? - Read it already.

239
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,570
I already read it once.

240
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,980
Kim Ji Soo and Jung Gyu Min.

241
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,779
Sung Hae Eun and Jung Hyun Gyu.

242
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,919
Two couples have been matched for a date.

243
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,250
Gosh.

244
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,389
Give me that.

245
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,120
- Why? You can't believe it? - I can't.

246
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,289
He's talking.

247
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,090
- This... - They'll do it out in the open?

248
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,000
This is no joke.

249
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,429
You see?

250
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,869
I didn't hear it. What did you say?

251
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,870
- It is hard to believe. - Right.

252
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,740
- Gosh. - This is crazy. Unbelievable.

253
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,110
That was so random.

254
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,579
"What is this?" I thought it was misprinted or something.

255
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,989
I really thought Gyu Min was going to choose me.

256
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,120
Ji Soo out of nowhere?

257
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,090
I didn't know Gyu Min could be so secretive.

258
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,229
I was surprised at first because they both had to pick each other.

259
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,158
It might be that I'm slow at picking up things like this.

260
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,028
I didn't feel that Gyu Min and Ji Soo...

261
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,570
interacted that much that they chose each other.

262
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,440
Everyone was so surprised. "All of a sudden?"

263
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,038
I didn't hear it. What did you say?

264
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,039
This is so funny.

265
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,109
- This is getting interesting. - This is getting interesting.

266
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,678
This is getting interesting.

267
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,278
Ji Soo, Gyu Min, Hae Eun, and Hyun Gyu will go on a date.

268
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,678
- Okay. - Okay.

269
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,549
- I'll ride a motorbike tomorrow. - Nice.

270
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,759
Do you want to go to an omakase restaurant?

271
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,700
I thought we would go on a date tomorrow.

272
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,539
I thought I would be on a date with her.

273
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,339
But I heard only two couples got matched.

274
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,268
I figured out that she didn't choose me.

275
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,479
And I thought she wanted to talk to someone else...

276
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
because our time here is coming to an end.

277
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,450
(Who do you think Na Eon chose?)

278
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,750
It has to be Gyu Min.

279
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,279
So you're treating us to an omakase meal tomorrow?

280
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:24,058
- Do you want to go? - I want to.

281
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,689
They read it, folded it, and put it in.

282
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,219
- They probably folded it. - Seriously.

283
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,959
I didn't know that they put it in there.

284
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I thought Ji Yeon would have chosen me right away.

285
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,129
We spent a good time together here.

286
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,470
It was a chance to clear up a misunderstanding.

287
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,939
I thought that was still possible.

288
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,440
So I chose her.

289
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,878
But whenever we had these chances,

290
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,480
Ji Yeon seemed to take a step back.

291
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,750
It was a bit disappointing and frustrating.

292
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,279
(Sighing)

293
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,389
- Why are you sighing? - No. Nothing.

294
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,219
- Why are you sighing? - Earlier today...

295
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,518
- I... No. - You were flustered, right?

296
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,388
Everything I did today flashed before my eyes.

297
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,899
That's all.

298
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,069
That's why. I was just thinking about today.

299
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,100
(Sung Hae Eun)

300
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,370
I thought about choosing Hae Eun as soon as I heard it.

301
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,169
I didn't think about choosing someone else.

302
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,939
But around that time,

303
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,778
Ji Yeon and I miscommunicated.

304
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,250
Ji Yeon asked me out that day.

305
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,349
But I wanted to pick Hae Eun no matter what.

306
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,580
So I didn't pay attention to what she said.

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,849
I was surprised that I was matched with Hyun Gyu.

308
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,159
I thought Ji Yeon and Hyun Gyu would go.

309
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,689
I was surprised about that.

310
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,658
Despite making a promise to Ji Yeon,

311
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,360
he still chose me.

312
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,830
"I'm still going to pick Hae Eun." I could picture him thinking that.

313
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,538
It was unexpected. And I was happy...

314
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,799
that I would go on a date with him.

315
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,870
That was so random?

316
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,308
- Whatever. I don't know. - Why is this so funny?

317
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:52,409
I...

318

00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,268
Yes.

481
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,869
Then why did you suddenly send it to Hyun Gyu?

482
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,480
What's the deal with you?

483
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,709
No. Then why didn't you send me the message...

484
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,250
if you were going to choose me?

485
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,278
- I must have lost my mind. - Why?

486
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,519
Why did you do that?

487
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,890
I didn't think it through.

488
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,058
So Hyun Gyu was the most attractive one among the rest.

489
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,690
It's not that. He was just next to me.

490
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,098
- So... - I can understand it.

491
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,399
- I got it. - I...

492
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,700
- I'm sorry. - That's how you feel. I got it.

493
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,799
I regretted it right away.

494
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,369
Gosh. Forget it.

495
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,769
Why did you act like you had to think about it? It was so annoying.

496
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,109
- You saw that? - Yes.

497
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,179
- Ji Yeon. - Why did you put on an act?

498
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,710
I behaved the same way like any other day.

499
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,980
But I didn't think you would choose me.

500
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,449
- I thought you were... - As soon as I heard it,

501
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,118
- I thought of you first. - pushing me away.

502
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,118
Okay. I should have chosen Ji Soo then.

503
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,949
- Wait. Even if I did, - I thought you would choose her.

504
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,819
- she would've been with Gyu Min. - Seriously.

505
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,029
But still. I still chose you.

506
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,828
Anything could happen.

507
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,669
So I wanted to go on a date with you.

508
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,829
Anyway...

509
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,700
Same here. I feel the same way.

510
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,069
So you didn't choose me because you were upset.

511
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,139
You weren't honest with your feelings.

512
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,710
- You... - Admit it.

513
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,809
You're right.

514
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,179
Why did you do that?

515
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,349
You could've been honest to yourself.

516
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,220
This is so annoying.

517
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:56,950
It was your decision, not mine.

518
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,089
I chose you for my date.

519
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,960
What time are you going to sleep?

520
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,599
What time are you going to sleep?

521
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,200
- I don't know. Why? - Just because.

522
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,339
I don't know.

523
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,740
They look like your ears.

524
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,140
Why? I should go to sleep soon.

525
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,450
- What is it? Talk. - I just wanted to know.

526
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,950
Tae I, I really like you.

527
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,879
What was that? Me too.

528
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,588
Because you're so cool.

529
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:30,989
I like you too, Hae Eun.

530
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,460
- Hey, you're so cool. - Thanks.

531
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,890
But I can't go on a date tomorrow.

532
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,930
Is that the smile of a girl who's going on a date tomorrow?

533
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,500
No.

534
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,969
I just smiled. That's not it.

535
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,299
Good for you.

536
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,740
No.

537
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:51,939
At first, I thought you were scary and grumpy.

538
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,308
So I'm kind of sad that I thought so for the 1st 2 weeks.

539
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:55,548
It's already been two weeks.

540
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:56,750
- Time flies. - Right.

541
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,480
It's a pity.

542
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,549
We have three days left.

543
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,990
Don't talk to me.

544
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,859
But shouldn't we go grocery shopping?

545
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:17,230
Where are you going?

546
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,140
You two should talk.

547
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,240
What?

548
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,578
I'm just looking at you.

549
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,179
- Do you want chocolate? - Yes.

550
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,250
(He covers up his ears.)

551
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,319
You know for sure, right?

552
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,058
Right. Alcohol and food...

553
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,399
I felt really bad.

554
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,199
(I felt really bad.)

555
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,430
He said, "I can't go on a date."

556
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,200
I noticed that he wasn't in a good mood.

557
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,869
I wanted to spend some time with Gyu Min one last time,

558
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,180
so I could understand my feelings.

559
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,950
I took some time to think and chose Gyu Min.

560
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,179
But Gyu Min didn't choose me.

561
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,220
I regret it a little.

562
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,019
I should've just chosen Tae I.

563
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,858
Why didn't you choose me? It's upsetting.

564
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,629
- What? - You said you'd ask me out.

565
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,899
- You thought I would? - Yes.

566
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,630
- Oh, really? - Because I did.

567
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,469
- Oh, really? - Aside from everything,

568
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,700
I had the most fun on the dates with you.

569
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,869
You said you'd ask me out on a date.

570
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,579
- When did I say that? - When we were on a date.

571
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,078
You said you wanted to take me somewhere...

572
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,179
and that you'd ask me out.

573
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,879
I will.

574
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,019
But I didn't think this was the chance to ask you out.

575
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,518
We don't have many chances now. We only have three days.

576
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,789
- We do. - When?

577
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,358
I bet we'll have a chance.

578
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,788
When? What if we don't?

579
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,229
That thought never occurred to me.

580
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,029
If we don't have any more chances, you should regret it.

581
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,659
- I thought we'd have a chance. - You should regret it.

582
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,869
That's why I didn't choose you.

583
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,930
I wanted to go on a date with you again.

584
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,399
It'd have been nice if we had one more date.

585
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,609
I know. Will we have another chance?

586
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,640
Why didn't you choose me?

587
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,440
What do you mean? I did choose you.

588
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,380
- You didn't choose me. - It smells so nice.

589
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,079
You didn't choose me.

590
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,150
Life is so bitter.

591
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,859
What's so bitter? It's so sweet.

592
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,329
Na Eon.

593
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,269
Na Eon, what's wrong?

594
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:34,910
(Grunting)

595
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,169
Na Eon, what's wrong?

596
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,008
It breaks my heart to see you upset.

597
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,709
You're my favorite person.

598
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,750
What's wrong? Don't cry. What's going on?

599
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,420
Because you feel bad toward Tae I?

600
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:48,818
I get it. Tae I chose you,

601
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,289
but you chose Gyu Min.

602
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,220
But Gyu Min and Ji Soo chose each other.

603
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,129
That's what I understand so far.

604
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,890
- I bet everyone knows. - Right.

605
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,828
Why did they choose each other?

606
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,159
What's going on between them?

607
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,699
I told Ji Soo that I thought Gyu Min would choose me.

608
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,729
And I was like, "Whom should I choose?"

609
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,900
But he did text you today.

610
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,039
Right.

611
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:10,469
So naturally, I thought he'd ask you out for a date.

612
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,279
But he chose Ji Soo. What was that? Was something going on between them?

613
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,809
Should I ask her?

614
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,508
Ji Soo.

615
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,149
(They ran into Ji Soo just in time.)

616
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,849
- Why are you standing there? - Never mind.

617
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,450
It'd be funny to ask.

618
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,318
What is it? Ask away.

619
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,818
The thing is, we were surprised.

620
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,058
We were just curious. Was there something going on between you two?

621
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,358
Was something going on?

622
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,189
I'm just embarrassed. And I feel bad.

623
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,229
- Is it mutual? - I told you that I thought...

624
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,258
Gyu Min would choose me.

625
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,430
Actually, there's nothing much going on between us.

626
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,599
Earlier, Gyu Min just asked me...

627
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,769
if I wanted to hang out with him tomorrow.

628
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,008
- Tomorrow? Gyu Min did? - You did?

629
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,169
- Gyu Min did? - Yes.

630
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,639
- Is that so? - So that's why.

631
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,509
(A while ago, right after the letter arrived)

632
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,779
- Want to hang out with me tomorrow? - Sorry?

633
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,819
Do you want to hang out with me tomorrow?

634
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,349
Sure.

635
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,849
(After their conversation, they chose each other.)

636
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,489
I see.

637
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,730
When I was having a hard time because of Won Bin,

638
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,068
- Gyu Min took care of me a lot. - He took care of you?

639
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:14,269
And he said nice things to me.

640
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,568
I think Gyu Min just wanted to go on a date.

641
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,279
Or he could be interested in Ji Soo.

642
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,950
He just asked Ji Soo on the spot if she wanted to hang out.

643
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,279
That's why they chose each other.

644
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,349
I'd have understood it if he chose Na Yeon.

645
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,518
I guess he really wanted to go out on a date.

646
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,858
After I heard it, I was like...

647
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,729
If he was going to ask Ji Soo out,

648
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,400
he could've just asked me.

649
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,529
But he didn't.

650
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,500
The fact that he made sure he got a date before sending the text.

651
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,508
But I was being really honest when I made my choices.

652
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:50,940
When we were sending our texts and choosing our dates.

653
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,250
That's why I think Gyu Min wasn't being honest.

654
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,420
I contemplated a bit before choosing.

655
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,219
But I thought it'd be better...

656
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,720
to hang out with Ji Soo and have fun with her.

657
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,759
Although I shouldn't have,

658
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:09,459
I was bothered...

659
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,960
by how Hee Doo and Na Yeon felt about each other.

660
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,099
I thought you were all in for Tae I.

661
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,130
I'm not sure about how Tae I feels anymore.

662
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,098
Why not?

663
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,939
I thought Tae I was all for Na Eon.

664
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,809
- Right? - Well, you're right.

665
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,579
But if he was, he would've made a move.

666
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,420
You thought it wasn't enough.

667
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,980
But if you hear what's been going on from her,

668
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,150
the content of the text he sends is incredible.

669
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,960
- Why? Because it's bad? - No. He sends a long text.

670
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,828
- Tae I? - Yes.

671
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,129
Then he really likes you.

672
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,229
Right! Tae I wouldn't send such texts. He really likes you.

673
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,298
Of course.

674
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,170
Is that so? I thought...

675
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,170
- He really likes it. - I just realized it.

676
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,139
- That's why I'm annoyed! - It's hard, isn't it?

677
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,308
Excuse me, you told me...

678
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:00,709
Ma'am, you're the loudest here.

679
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,109
Excuse me. You told me to quiet down.

680
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,979
I was upset because you told me...

681
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,189
to quiet down.

682
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,690
- You should be quieter. - I'm sorry.

683
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,858
I thought Tae I might overhear about the long text.

684
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:15,890
You're right.

685
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:21,059
(Meanwhile, in the living room where Na Eon's voice is ringing)

686
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,039
Are you having fun? Are you happy?

687
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,539
What?

688
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,980
- This is ridiculous. - What is?

689
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,250
- It's just ridiculous. - Why?

690
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,150
I just find this ridiculous.

691
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,019
- You mean you? Not me? - Yes.

692
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,089
That's understandable.

693
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,629
- Are you having fun? - Well, it's not that.

694
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,630
You're crazy. Shall we take this further?

695
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,899
This is legendary.

696
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,940
What's wrong?

697
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,450
It's the worst mistake I made here.

698
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,690
Why?

699
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,960
Why is it the worst mistake? What are you talking about?

700
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,539
- I'm not sure. - I know.

701
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,869
Gosh, these darn bugs!

702
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,779
This is insane.

703
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,759
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

704
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,460
- What's wrong? - There are just so many bugs.

705
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,859
Not that.

706
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,970
I can't focus because there are so many bugs.

707
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,170
Okay, then.

708
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,739
(Won Bin is washing dishes.)

709
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,108
- Sorry about this. - It's fine.

710
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,549
They're not drinking more?

711
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,818
I don't think so.

712
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:21,078
Really? Oh, well. They need to wake up early tomorrow.

713
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,150
Right.

714
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,289
Ji Yeon.

715
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,329
- What is it? - Take your glass and follow me.

716
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,269
Why?

717
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,879
But he is texting you.

718
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,740
That means a lot already.

719
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:52,719
(Hyun Gyu and Ji Yeon are heading to his room together.)

720
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,848
That's understandable.

721
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,690
- We'll drink together for a while. - Okay.

722
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,559
Go ahead and have a talk.

723
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,058
I thought you two looked good together.

724
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,298
But you know,

725
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,828
when I had a talk with Gyu Min,

726
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,899
I said I wasn't sure about my feelings toward Tae I.

727
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,268
I came home after telling him such things.

728
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,338
- And I found Tae I cute. - That's right.

729
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,808
Do you know what's the scariest?

730
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:23,949
- When you find someone cute. - That's true.

731
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,149
It's not whether they're handsome...

732
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,348
- or pretty. - It's useless.

733
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:28,349
- It's about finding him cute. - When you find a man cute,

734
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,788
- then it's game over. - Nothing can beat cuteness.

735
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,558
You're being honest with your feelings. You did well.

736
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,059
I would've done the same.

737
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,359
Where are you going?

738
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,099
- Are you going back to your room? - Is this your room?

739
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,338
What? Where did you get the Pepero?

740
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,970
Hee Doo asked me to get it.

741
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,569
Seriously... Hee Doo?

742
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,410
Hee Doo asked for Pepero in the middle of this?

743
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:58,920
Where's everyone?

744
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,630
(He puts Nude Pepero on Hee Doo's bedside.)

745
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,230
Do you want to talk with Tae I?

746
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,339
Have a good night.

747
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,710
Good night.

748
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,410
I should've brought my headphones.

749
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,179
- I want to listen to music. - You should.

750
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,950
But I don't have headphones.

751
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,619
(Hyun Gyu's room)

752
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,759
- Was something up? - What do you mean?

753
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,029
Was there something going on between us?

754
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,369
- No. - Exactly.

755
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,469
Did I do something wrong?

756
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,539
- No, you didn't. - Right.

757
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,719
As soon as we got the letter,

758
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,820
I asked you if you wanted to hang out with me tomorrow.

759
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,119
Did you text me?

760
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,659
No, I didn't.

761
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,030
- I just asked you to hang out. - Right.

762
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,400
Aren't you treating me just like how you treat Won Bin?

763
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:29,710
So here's the thing.

764
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,039
I've had so many dates with Hee Doo.

765
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,880
But I'm not Hee Doo's replacement.

766
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,750
I'm not saying that you are.

767
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,018
Don't get me wrong.

768
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,920
I wanted to hang out with you more after having a beer with you.

769
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,760
I wanted to learn about you more.

770
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,090
Who did you text, though?

771
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,889
Text?

772
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,259
I sent it to Hee Doo because I spent time with him today.

773
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,169
- Exactly. - But...

774
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,868
if you were to tell me that I'm treating you...

775
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:03,039
and Won Bin the same way,

776
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,309
I have to dispute it.

777
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,578
What's there to say?

778
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,549
I've never thought of Won Bin as someone I could date.

779
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,980
Must I know about that?

780
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:13,780
No, you don't, but you compared yourself with Won Bin.

781
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,618
So, must I know that?

782
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,988
You don't.

783
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,359
I don't need to know that, so it looks the same to me.

784
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,519
(Thinking)

785
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,289
You want me to go on?

786
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,730
That...

787
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,070
would only affect someone who likes you.

788
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:35,769
Right.

789
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:38,980
It's not that meaningful to me.

790
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,449
- That's what I mean. - You're right.

791
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,489
Let's go.

792
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,819
- No, I don't want to. - Why not?

793
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,019
Let's have one more drink.

794
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,190
What about you, then? Let me ask you.

795
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,900
- About what? - Your feelings.

796
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,829
I want to hang out with Hae Eun.

797
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,768
"Hang out?"

798
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,799
- He's amazing. - He's tough.

799
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,839
- But... - He's tough.

800
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,268
He'd look so cool to Hae Eun.

801
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,078
- Of course! - Of course!

802
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,339
- If he was her man... - He's so cool.

803
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,550
He's really amazing.

804
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,179
I want to hang out with Hae Eun.

805
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,389
- Let's forget about it. - Okay.

806
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:32,699
- Let's go. - Okay.

807
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,429
Hyun Gyu.

808
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,840
Be happy.

809
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,439
Are you going to drink alone?

810
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,309
But no one was drinking.

811
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:50,179
(They spotted Ji Yeon and Hyun Gyu who just came out of the room.)

812
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,579
Why is no one here?

813
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,980
They all went back to their rooms.

814
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,050
- No one is here. - They all went back.

815
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,250
- Did you come to take alcohol? - Yes.

816
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,420
Come with me.

817
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,130
Aren't you hanging out with her more?

818
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,829
Let's drink some more in the room.

819
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,359
- You were hanging out with her. - Sorry?

820
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,070
Weren't you going to drink some more with her?

821
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,070
I wanted to drink more with you.

822
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,440
- What? - What?

823
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:16,869
What do you mean?

824
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,639
Did you think I was a player?

825
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,780
What are you saying? Of course I thought you were.

826
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,849
- You thought I was? - Of course I did.

827
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,779
I was confused until that point.

828
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,649
I thought he wanted to spend more time with me...

829
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,049
after spending time with Ji Yeon.

830
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,989
I was just confused.

831
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,019
To the right!

832
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,559
Hae Eun.

833
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,469
Why are there so many shoes?

834
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,239
They're all mine.

835
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,840
- I was so bored today. - Right.

836
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,909
There was no one to eat with.

837
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,808
So that's why I thought...

838
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:59,179
I mistook Ji Yeon when she asked me to eat with her tomorrow.

839
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,449
Oh, si that so?

840
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,690
It could be an excuse or not. It's up to you to believe.

841
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:07,420
- Is that so? - Yes.

842
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,929
Seeing you go into the room with Ji Yeon,

843
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,428
- I was a bit... - Were you upset?

844
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:14,529
Well, yes.

845
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,769
I told you in advance for a reason.

846
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,929
- That I'll be back. - What?

847
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,969
I told you that I'll have a talk with her for a while.

848
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:24,469
Oh, right. You told me that.

849
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:27,340
I called her here and told her.

850
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,050
That nothing she imagines will ever happen.

851
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,150
And that I'll only develop my relationship with Hae Eun.

852
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:39,820
- You're really straightforward. - Yes.

853
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:42,059
Oh, really?

854
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,129
I told her face to face.

855
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,099
I made her sit here and listen to me. Then I sent her away.

856
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,929
I told her I had to go because I needed to talk with you.

857
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,369
- You did? - Yes.

858
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,339
I was wondering what was going on...

859
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,679
because you said you wanted to drink with me.

860
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:04,980
Yes?

861
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,019
You guys are not too drunk, right?

862
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,349
- Of course. - Okay.

863
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:12,519
She's so cute.

864
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,789
She must've been worried that we might've been drunk.

865
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,630
That's what I did.

866
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,860
I hope you're not upset.

867
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,729
Well, I was upset earlier.

868
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,539
- Ouch. - Sorry. Earlier...

869
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,309
- I was a bit upset. - Of course.

870
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,869
It was really heart-fluttering.

871
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,309
It was really heart-fluttering. How is that even possible?

872
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,178
Seeing him going into the room with Ji Yeon,

873
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:44,590
I was jealous and upset.

874
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,719
But Hyun Gyu said something...

875
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,929
that was reassuring.

876
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,730
It was really nice.

877
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,429
Gosh, Hyun Gyu.

878
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,969
You should just hit on Hae Eun. Why would you hit on me too?

879
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,499
- My gosh. - Seriously.

880
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,538
He makes my heart flutter so much.

881
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:04,069
Why would you hit on Simon Dominic and me as well?

882
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,908
- Gosh, seriously! - Seriously...

883
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,179
It was like an internet novel.

884
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,078
That really reassured her of how he feels.

885
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,579
If such experiences...

886
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,448
keep piling up,

887
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:13,618
Hae Eun would only fall for Hyun Gyu.

888
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,619
- Totally. - Right.

889
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,718
- He doesn't make her insecure. - Exactly.

890
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,920
He even blocks the other ear when he whispers to her.

891
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,159
He even holds her hands.

892
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,129
- But he blocks out other women. - He's cold to them.

893
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,359
If she could feel secure even before she starts dating him,

894
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,729
she'd totally fall for him.

895
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,229
- He's so cool, though. - He's cool.

896
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,069
He's so cool as someone's boyfriend.

897
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,939
Seriously. He's the perfect type.

898
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,239
How can your heart not flutter for him?

899
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,868
What I'm really glad about is this.

900
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,209
It's hard to make Hae Eun's feelings...

901
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,448
toward Gyu Min go away.

902
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,479
But her feelings could be gone because he came onto her so strong.

903
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,448
Not anyone can make her swayed.

904
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:49,550
I'm already swayed.

905
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,689
Me too.

906
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,118
- I'm swayed too. - Me too.

907
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,260
I need to get a grip.

908
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,190
(A storm-like night passed.)

909
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,510
(Hee Doo came out to the living room.)

910
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,780
(He starts his day by cleaning.)

911
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,389
The gloves are too tight for me.

912
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,659
(He even does the dishes that piled up overnight.)

913
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,860
(Hae Eun, Na Yeon, and Na Eon's room)

914
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,129
It looks like Ji Yeon is interested in Hyun Gyu.

915
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,799
What? That's so sudden.

916
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,069
I was right about it.

917
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,699
They had a drink together.

918
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:41,968
In the room?

919
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,369
- Yes. - They drank together?

920
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,070
I had no idea.

921
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,980
I think Ji Yeon likes Hee Doo.

922
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,079
Doesn't Hyun Gyu have feelings for Ji Yeon?

923
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,449
I asked what he talked about with Ji Yeon.

924
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,219
He said, "What do you think we talked about?"

925
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,089
"Did you think I'd be swayed by her?"

926
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,589
- That's what he said. - Really? How cool of him.

927
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,260
It's what I find so charming about him.

928
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,659
He's so cool.

929
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,030
I didn't think my feelings for him were deep,

930
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:12,299
but seeing Ji Yeon go after him like that...

931
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,598
- made me jealous too. - Really?

932
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,009
I thought I wasn't interested in him...

933
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,279
and that I only enjoyed our dates.

934
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,679
Are you now excited to go on a date with him?

935
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,510
Yes, I am today. I'm excited.

936
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,250
It seems that way as well.

937
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,090
(Hee Doo heads somewhere.)

938
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,630
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

939
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,800
Ji Yeon.

940
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,469
Yes? Gosh, I'm still sleepy.

941
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,110
You had more to drink before bed, right?

942
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,079
With Hyun Gyu.

943
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,650
No, with Tae I and Na Yeon.

944
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:58,409
Is that so?

945
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,949
I thought it was just you and Hyun Gyu.

946
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,619
We only talked for a while, and that was it.

947
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,360
- Really? - Yes.

948
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,860
- Why? - What time did you go to bed?

949
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,489
I don't remember.

950
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:14,960
- Did you have a lot to drink? - Yes.

951
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,099
I turned in immediately.

952
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,300
Let's go grocery shopping today.

953
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,710
Grocery shopping?

954
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,039
Who's staying back today?

955
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,010
Everyone except those four.

956
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:32,379
Gosh. I still can't believe it.

957
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,419
What is it?

958
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,820

It must have been hard.

You came to my room and tried to talk to me.

1280

- Yes. - I was so touched.

1281

You and Won Bin struggled a lot.

Thanks to you...

- Okay. - The sun is in your eyes.

It seemed that way.

As I waited for you, I thought, "This is bad."

What? Does the shirt look good on me? What do you think?

- It's big. - Is it big?

I have a pretty big build.

Nothing. You are looking at me too.

- I have a reason. - What?

1306

You are pretty.

It's perfect. The sea, coffee, and cat.

The sea is on my right, a cat is on my left.

And you are in front of me.

Are there too many things to look at?

It's pretty.

It's very pretty. It's incredibly pretty.

- It's nice. - Seriously.

You are as pretty as the view.

Na Eon said you are very expressive. She was right.

It's so pretty.

1329
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:25,340
I talked about the pink sky all day long today.

1330

- You saw it in the end. - Yes.

1331
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,979
- I am so happy. - It's because the two fairies met.

Yes. You are right.

Thank you for picking me.

I am the one who should say that.

Still, I am thankful.

1336

I am thankful too. Thank you.

Let's go and get our photos taken.

1338

What?

1340
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,949
Even when I look at the front, I can see you.

1341
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:12,219
I can see you in my peripheral vision.

1342
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:17,960
Can't I look at you?

1343
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:21,699
You can. I guess you can.

1344
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,469
I am warm thanks to this shirt. It really saved me.

- I am glad. - I was so cold.

I was thinking, "This is bad."

1347

Then you brought this shirt.

You are the best. The sun wasn't down yet.

we would have shopped for groceries together.

1439
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,898
I am sorry.

1440
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:23,100
I know so many good restaurants around here.

1441
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,210
I feel like a fool.

1442
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:26,970
Why?

1443
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:30,738
The day passed by without anything happening.

1444
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,210
- Right? - Seriously.

1445
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:36,618
- Did you enjoy the day? - Of course. I was very happy.

1446
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:37,688
How happy were you?

1447
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:40,020
I was very happy. I was incredibly happy.

1449
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,229
I guess we are gathering around.

1450
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:49,560
- Is it far? - I am looking.

1451
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,569
Let's go.

1452
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,670
- It was nice, right? - Yes.

1453
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,680
The text soured my mood instantly.

1454

My goodness.

1455

Let's go slowly.

We don't know what will happen,

so please go slowly.

1458
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:12,890
Why? Are you nervous?

1459
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,859
No. I just like the current moment.

1460
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,389
This happened once in Seoul.

1461
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,560
Whenever we gathered around,

1462
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:24,929
there was a big issue.

1463
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:28,038
We had to choose.

1464
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,869
So I have a feeling something big will happen.

1465
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,039
I will make sure you don't cry.

1466
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:36,979
- You are so reassuring. - Really?

1467
01:09:37,909 --> 01:09:39,550
You are so cool.

1468
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,119
We don't know what lies ahead,

1469
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:46,119
but don't be nervous.

1470
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,930
Hae Eun froze.

1471
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:58,868
- Hae Eun froze. - Hae Eun froze.

1472
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:00,470
- Oh, no. - Just now...

1473
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:04,539
It looks like she is clutching at her heart.

1474
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:08,938
I feel as though he grabbed my hand.

1475
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:12,180
- Your hands are shaking. - He felt it.

1476
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:13,978
- You know, - My hands are sweating.

1477
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:16,618
Hae Eun held his hand when she was drunk.

1478
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:19,449
I think that gave Hyun Gyu the courage to hold her hand.

1479
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,390
We don't know what lies ahead, but don't be nervous.

1480
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,829
Let's do this.

1481
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,600
I feel reassured because you have no fear.

You know that you have to eat salad first to eat a lot, right?

Anything.

1597
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,960
But as we continued to go on dates...

1598
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,069
As we continued to go on dates, I'm growing to like him more.

1599
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:14,908
Can I ask a question?

1600
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,109
- Yes. - Yes.

1601
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:18,749
I'll ask Hee Doo.

1602
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,250
(Ji Soo will ask Hee Doo a question.)

1603
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,420
I'm curious how you feel about Na Yeon.

1604
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:33,259
- It's fun, right? - It is.

1605
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,429
Interesting.

1606
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,059
- It's so much fun. - Okay.

1607
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,399
But it's so direct.

1608
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,770
- How do I feel about her? - Yes.

1609
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,840
- I can answer as I please. - Yes.

1610
01:16:49,409 --> 01:16:50,739
Will he choose not to answer?

1611
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,949
From the start,

1612
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,289
she asked the question that I least wanted to hear.

1613
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,859
No, it's actually the question I wanted to hear.

1614
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:08,729
Ji Soo asked the question that I wanted to hear but was too afraid.

1615
01:17:09,229 --> 01:17:10,600
I was looking forward to the answer.

1616
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,439
I can refuse once, right?

1617
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,270
- Yes. - If I do, you can't ask me again?

1618
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,679
- Right. - Yes.

1619
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,310
- I'll refuse. - We can't ask you the same thing.

1620
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:29,520
(Hee Doo passed on answering the question about Na Yeon.)

1621
01:17:31,989 --> 01:17:33,550
But he passed on it.

1622
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,188
I think he might have passed on it because he was conscious of Ji Yeon.

1623
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:38,359
That's what I thought.

1624
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,760
Okay.

1625
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:42,960
Hee Doo can ask now.

1626
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:51,568
Hae Eun.

1627
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:52,609
(Hee Doo will ask Hae Eun a question.)

1628
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:54,140
How do you...

1629
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:59,680
currently feel about Gyu Min?

1630
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,159
This is interesting.

1631
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,000
(Contemplating)

1632
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:30,180
Honestly, my heart has been fluttering since Hyun Gyu got here,

1633
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:32,779
and we've been going on a lot of good dates.

1634
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:40,619
But to me, Gyu Min is like a big shadow.

1635
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:42,760
We did go out for a long time.

1636
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,559
So feeling giddy over Hyun Gyu makes me think...

1637
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,930
if it's okay for me to be like this.

1638
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,038
I feel very confused.

1639
01:18:56,039 --> 01:18:58,709
I'm standing at a crossroads.

1640
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,640
I'm still very confused.

1641
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,738
But I think it's okay for you to feel giddy.

1642
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:05,750
Me too.

1643
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,550
Me too. Why not?

1644
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,050
Why not?

1645
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,019
It's so... If I didn't have my ex,

1646
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:20,130
then things definitely would've gone well with Hyun Gyu.

1647
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:23,658
- But my ex is here, - Since he's right in front of you?

1648
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:26,529
And he was such a big person in my life.

1649
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:29,800
So I feel a bit confused.

1650
01:19:30,869 --> 01:19:32,270
I think I'm really half and half.

1651
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:33,369
Okay.

1652
01:19:46,989 --> 01:19:48,488
I'll ask Hee Doo a question.

1653
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,189
I'm the most afraid of her.

1654
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:53,890
- She's the most fun. - She's so scary.

1655
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:57,199
(Ji Yeon will ask Hee Doo a question.)

1656
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:00,899
I chose Hyun Gyu for my date.

1657
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:05,139
But why did you call me and ask?

1658
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,970
Did you think I'd choose you for sure?

1659
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:19,020
No, I... You texted me...

1660
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:20,649
but didn't choose me.

1661
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:24,559
- Honestly? - Yes, honestly.

1662
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,689
I asked because I thought you were foolish.

1663
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,959
- She was foolish? - Yes.

1664
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,970
In what way?

1665
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:36,368
I mean... Did you really have feelings for Hyun Gyu?

1666
01:20:36,369 --> 01:20:38,339
- Did you? I mean... - No, that wasn't why I did that.

1667
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,609
That's why.

1668
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:42,380
I felt that was a bit foolish.

1669
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,919
Can't he just say he was disappointed?

1670
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,189
"I was disappointed that you chose Hyun Gyu."

1671
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:55,788
I think it would've been nice if he had said that.

1672
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:57,390
But he didn't say that.

1673
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,288
But I did think he said that...

1674
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:02,199
because he was in front of Na Yeon.

1675
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:07,969
I didn't know that.

1676
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:10,539
Hee Doo did that. When did he do that?

1677
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,639
The fact that he said that means he chose Ji Yeon.

1678
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,710
He had asked Ji Yeon, "Why aren't you going on a date with me?"

1679
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,709
I felt that his relationship with Ji Yeon is deeper than I thought.

1680
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:24,649
After hearing that they talk a lot, I thought it seemed deep.

1681
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,819
Why did you do that? Tell me.

1682
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:31,090
Why did I choose Hyun Gyu?

1683
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:36,060
Because your relationship with Na Yeon is too firm.

1684
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:37,859
- From your perspective? - Yes.

1685
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,239
Okay.

1686
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:46,869
When she said our relationship was too firm, I wondered why.

1687
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,710
What's so firm about it? That's what I thought.

1688
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,149
I'll ask Hee Doo a question.

1689
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:05,289
You've gone on lots of dates so far.

1690
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:09,430
Which one did you think was the best?

1691
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:24,978
There was a date where I went to a barge,

1692
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:26,409
and it was the most fun for me.

1693
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,879
- Who did you go with? - Can't you say who it was with?

1694
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,920
I went with Ji Yeon.

1695
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,288
You went to a barge? It sounds like fun.

1696
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:35,519
(Everyone found out about Ji Yeon and Hee Doo's secret date.)

1697
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,590
I normally like going to barges.

1698
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:40,289
It was fun.

1699
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,500
- Yes, it was. Then, Hee Doo. - Yes?

1700
01:22:48,369 --> 01:22:50,369
Everything you said to me was sincere, right?

1701
01:22:53,609 --> 01:22:55,079
Everything I said was sincere.

1702
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:57,079
Well, yes.

1703
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,288
They're in their own world.

1704
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:08,519
- What is this? Are you dating? - They're living in their own world.

1705
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Are you guys dating?

1706
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,618
- This is Truth or Dare. - Nobody knows.

1707
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:13,688
- But nobody's asking us. - The eight of us became sidekicks.

1708
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:14,858
- What? - You two should just leave.

1709
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:15,898
It's fun, though.

1710
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:18,099
Hey, switch seats. You're so tactless.

1711
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,130
- Na Eon. - It's fun if nobody knows.

1712
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,099
It's not fun for us!

1713
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,300
- They're already dating. - But you're curious.

1714
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,109
I think I still wanted him to confirm it.

1715
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,978
"Were you being sincere in everything you did with me so far?"

1716
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:33,449
Even among the vague things he said, his answers...

1717
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,420
They do mean something, since everyone is listening.

1718
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,720
Gyu Min.

1719
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:41,760
(Na Yeon will ask Gyu Min a question.)

1720
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,789
You and I both felt...

1721
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,590
that we were sorting things out.

1722
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:55,300
Was that because of me or you?

1723
01:23:56,869 --> 01:23:58,069
I was curious.

1724
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:02,539
We suddenly grew apart for no particular reason.

1725
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:07,310
I wanted to know if it was because I still had...

1726
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,078
feelings for Hee Doo...

1727
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:12,420
or if his feelings had changed after going on dates...

1728
01:24:12,689 --> 01:24:13,989
with other people.

1729
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,270
We never ended this,

1730
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:32,939
so I thought the premise was off.

1731
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:38,649
I don't think we should be the only two choices,

1732
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:42,579
but if I had to choose between the two of us,

1733
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,920
I think it was because of you.

1734
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:53,829
Was it really because of my feelings?

1735
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:57,130
Was it because of what was going on around us? Or because of Hee Doo?

1736
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,969
It felt like he was saying...

1737
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,369
that it wasn't because of Na Eon.

1738
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:09,209
It really is fun to watch,

1739
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,849
but I want more provoking questions.

1740
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:13,810
You should ask one, then.

1741
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:15,249
- Really? - Yes.

1742
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,249
- No, don't do that. - That sounds great to me.

1743
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,948
He's too scary.

1744
01:25:18,949 --> 01:25:20,849
I can make every one of you ask to skip my question.

1745
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,019
- No, don't do that. - Go ahead.

1746
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,858
- This is so fun. - I'll ask you first.

1747
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:26,728
Who do you want to end up with?

1748
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:28,260
(Impressed)

1749
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,329
- I'll skip. - See?

1750
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,929
That's impressive.

1751
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,470
- Who wants to skip next? - Look at you.

1752
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,368
Do Ji Yeon next.

1753
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:36,469
Ji Yeon?

1754
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,539
I don't think she'll ask to skip the question.

1755
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,770
I know her well.

1756
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,309
She won't skip.

1757
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:44,139
Who wants to go next? You?

1758
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:46,209
- Do it. Hurry. - Do you want to go next?

1759
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:48,049
Wait. Calm down.

1760
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:50,318
I'm calm. I'm comfortable.

1761
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:51,989
Let's do Hyun Gyu next.

1762
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:53,688
- Hyun Gyu? - Hyun Gyu won't skip.

1763
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:55,819
- He wouldn't skip any questions. - Never.

1764
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:00,059
Tell us the three things you love about Hae Eun the most.

1765
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,488
- Three things? - Three things?

1766
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,800
You can't say eyes, nose, and mouth.

1767
01:26:03,029 --> 01:26:04,500
I have to be serious about this.

1768
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,430
She's bright,

1769
01:26:09,569 --> 01:26:12,340
thoughtful,

1770
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:13,939
and pretty.

1771
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:16,640
You're so cool. You're the coolest guy here.

1772
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:24,850
He said I was pretty.

1773
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:28,118
That made me the happiest.

1774
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:30,920
Hyun Gyu told me that a lot...

1775
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,090
during dates.

1776
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,259
I thought he was just saying that,

1777
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,199
but when he said it again,

1778
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:39,899
I was happy because he seemed sincere about it.

1779
01:26:42,069 --> 01:26:43,299
Gyu Min.

1780
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,500
- Me? - Yes.

1781
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:47,869
You knew that Na Yeon and I...

1782
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,310
were really close.

1783
01:26:50,409 --> 01:26:52,049
You knew that we were friends.

1784
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:55,578
Even when you knew that I could see you,

1785
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:57,618
you didn't try to hide...

1786
01:26:57,619 --> 01:27:00,489
your feelings for Na Yeon at all.

1787
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:02,959
I'm curious as to what you were thinking.

1788
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,759
Did you not think of me at all?

1789
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,600
Were you just acting as you wanted?

1790
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,069
I did think about you.

1791
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,699
- You did? - I did.

1792
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,670
I did think about you,

1793
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:21,169
so that's why I was careful with my actions.

1794
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,779
- That was you being careful? - Yes.

1795
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,579
Did he really think about me?

1796
01:27:25,779 --> 01:27:28,408
I couldn't completely trust his answer.

1797
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,220
It didn't seem like he was caring about me at all.

1798
01:27:30,619 --> 01:27:32,520
But I don't think...

1799
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:39,658
we have to be that careful.

1800
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:41,729
You're right.

1801
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:49,670
I want to go home.

1802
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,239
I can ask another question?

1803
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,479
- Sounds good. - Hae Eun. You never chose...

1804
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,709
who to go on dates with.

1805
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,810
Would you have chosen the same person?

1806
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,648
The last date I went on,

1807
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:05,988
- the one from today, - Was that partially your choice?

1808
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,349
Was completely my choice.

1809
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,059
Since we couldn't choose our ex,

1810
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,989
- it was a very easy choice for me. - I see.

1811
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:13,358
If we could've chosen our exes,

1812
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:15,829
it would've been a very hard choice.

1813
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,399
Right now,

1814
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:22,039
who's your top choice?

1815
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:24,769
Right now. I'm not asking who you'll choose ultimately.

1816
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:27,139
I'm asking about right now. Who do you choose now?

1817
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,709
It can be very close.

1818
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,139
I'm asking if you have a top choice.

1819
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,778
It can be very close?

1820
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:33,478
Of course. Why not?

1821
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:35,210
If it can be very close,

1822
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:40,350
my honest choice...

1823
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:44,020
for today...

1824
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:49,000
is Hyun Gyu. He wins by a little.

1825
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,069
- It finally happened. - Gyu Min is finally hearing this.

1826
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,698
I feel like I'm watching a drama.

1827
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:58,669
We get to finally hear it from Hae Eun.

1828
01:28:58,670 --> 01:28:59,709
Right.

1829
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,278
Honestly, Hyun Gyu was so romantic today.

1830
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:03,310
- Exactly. - Right?

1831
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:06,578
Hyun Gyu. He wins by a little.

1832
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:08,148
- Hyun Gyu? - He wins by a little.

1833
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:09,680
Does he win by a tiny margin...

1834
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:12,089
- or a little bit more? - I can't say.

1835
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,319
- Okay. - Anyway, Hyun Gyu wins by a little.

1836
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:15,689
This is so fun.

1837
01:29:19,989 --> 01:29:22,300
I was happy. When I heard her answer,

1838
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,858
I wanted to go on more dates soon so that I could...

1839
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,029
have a complete victory.

1840
01:29:27,069 --> 01:29:28,800
Timing is really important in love.

1841
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,299
I have a question.

1842
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,839
Was the bilateral agreement date today?

1843
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,439
- Yes. - Who did you pick?

1844
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:36,778
- Me? - Yes.

1845
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:38,209
You don't know?

1846
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:40,380
Right. You two didn't go on a date today.

1847
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:43,419
- Ji Yeon should answer first. - You should answer first.

1848
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,318
I picked Gyu Min.

1849
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:46,520
Why?

1850
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,760
(Sad)

1851
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,429
Tae I. Were you upset about that?

1852
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,430
- So cute. - No, it's not that.

1853
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:55,898
- This is fun. - He's so cute.

1854
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:56,929
But why?

1855
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:58,500
- So cute. - So funny.

1856
01:29:59,029 --> 01:30:00,170
Where's my drink?

1857
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,199
So cute.

1858
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,238
Let's drink.

1859
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:04,899
- I have a question for Na Yeon. - Me?

1860
01:30:04,939 --> 01:30:06,069
(Ji Yeon asks Na Yeon a question.)

1861
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,409
Is it my turn now?

1862
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:10,109
Did you ever...

1863
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:12,710
have feelings for Tae I?

1864
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,760
I did a little.

1865
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:25,529
You're so popular.

1866
01:30:25,789 --> 01:30:27,560
During our date, I got butterflies.

1867
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,429
Did you hug Tae I because you were drunk?

1868
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,500
Yes.

1869
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:36,469
(Feeling uncomfortable)

1870
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:37,938
I didn't know you hugged me.

1871
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:38,969
I didn't either.

1872
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:40,769
- I found out the day after. - The two of us didn't know.

1873
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:41,770
(Na Eon didn't know about this.)

1874
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:44,510
I was kind of surprised.

1875
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,979
If that happened before I came,

1876
01:30:47,409 --> 01:30:49,720
they really had just met.

1877
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,350
When I heard that she hugged him,

1878
01:30:51,449 --> 01:30:54,220
I was surprised. Can you hug someone so easily?

1879
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:57,920
I thought that she might have had feelings for him.

1880
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,129
(We heard that Na Yeon hugged you.)

1881
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:03,199
She hugged me? She didn't.

1882
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,359
Why can't I remember?

1883
01:31:06,569 --> 01:31:07,899
I hugged her?

1884
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,439
The three of us hugged?

1885
01:31:14,409 --> 01:31:16,309
That means he had no feelings for her at all.

1886
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:18,509
- He didn't notice her existence. - Exactly.

1887
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:20,049
It was nothing for him.

1888
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,978
- He was busy making food. - Right.

1889
01:31:21,979 --> 01:31:24,519
He'd remember if he felt something.

1890
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,549
- Right. - Exactly.

1891
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:26,949
It wasn't anything like that.

1892
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:29,389
It didn't feel any different than Won Bin or Hee Doo...

1893
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:30,759
hugging him.

1894
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,229
- Right. - Exactly.

1895
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:34,890
Why can't I remember?

1896
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,529
I hugged her?

1897
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,000
The three of us hugged?

1898
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,170
I really can't remember.

1899
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:46,408
Can you broadcast it...

1900
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:47,770
so that I can see?

1901
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:49,978
I'm so curious. I want to ask.

1902
01:31:49,979 --> 01:31:51,479
I'm seriously so curious.

1903
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:52,779
Did you...

1904
01:31:52,979 --> 01:31:54,179
ask...

1905
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,619
Na Yeon about it?

1906
01:31:57,619 --> 01:31:58,850
I can't even remember when it was.

1907
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,649
To be clear, I didn't hug him...

1908
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:03,819
because I had feelings for him.

1909
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:09,560
Okay.

1910
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:13,699
I don't remember that at all.

1911
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,800
I'll ask Tae I a question.

1912
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,340
Do you think you might change your mind...

1913
01:32:21,739 --> 01:32:24,479
if you go on a final date with someone else?

1914
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,079
No.

1915
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:31,219
This is going to be a very long answer.

1916
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:32,390
Let's hear it.

1917
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:35,619
I didn't have anyone I wanted to send the text to.

1918
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,630
I didn't want to send anything that didn't feel sincere to me.

1919
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:44,328
The text was supposed to be showing our true feelings,

1920
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:46,029
so I thought it was very important.

1921
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:48,470
I believe in the power of words,

1922
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:51,538
so I didn't think of it lightly.

1923
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:52,539
(I didn't think of it lightly.)

1924
01:32:53,869 --> 01:32:55,039
But then...

1925
01:32:55,609 --> 01:32:58,380
you chose me after just hearing my voice.

1926
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:00,278
After that,

1927
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:01,810
I realized...

1928
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,250
that I didn't have to take it so seriously.

1929
01:33:06,489 --> 01:33:09,419
Considering romantic interest...

1930
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,729
and other factors, I liked Na Eon the most.

1931
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:15,390
I just said what I felt.

1932
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:20,729
So no, I don't think so.

1933
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:22,340
I don't think I'll change my mind.

1934
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:30,109
He expressed himself in a way that made things clear...

1935
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:31,909
for everyone.

1936
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,380
I have a question for Ji Soo.

1937
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:38,179
You had a lot of hardship here.

1938
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:39,819
You had a hard time.

1939
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,520
When was...

1940
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,460
your happiest moment...

1941
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,789
during your time here?

1942
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:52,159
To be really honest,

1943
01:33:56,939 --> 01:33:58,500
I was happiest...

1944
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:04,039
when Gyu Min brought chocolate.

1945
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,549
- What? - What are you two doing?

1946
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,709
- What are you two doing? - Wait.

1947
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,019
- Are you two dating? - What are you two doing?

1948
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,920
I'm so curious. Why the chocolate?

1949
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:13,920
Did he buy it for you?

1950
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:17,960
- Oh, my. - Really? I had no idea.

1951
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:19,288
(No one knew what the chocolate meant.)

1952
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:21,158
- What? - I just ate it cluelessly.

1953
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,188
(My gosh.)

1954
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:24,599
Don't give me presents anymore.

1955
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,169
Oh, there was a reason?

1956
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,469
That really had a big impact.

1957
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:31,199
- You were such a player. - Was it okay for us to eat it?

1958
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:32,469
I enjoyed it so much.

1959
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:34,339
I was happy that everyone enjoyed it.

1960
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,539
- I cluelessly ate so much of it. - Seriously. Me too.

1961
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:37,639
No, it's okay.

1962
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,108
- I ate so much. - He brought it for everyone.

1963
01:34:39,109 --> 01:34:40,409
It was meant for everyone.

1964
01:34:40,449 --> 01:34:41,578
I only ate one.

1965
01:34:41,579 --> 01:34:42,679
There were a lot of secrets.

1966
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,050
- Seriously. Right? - I only ate one too.

1967
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:46,349
Gyu Min. You sly guy.

1968
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:48,118
- Such a fox. - You sly fox.

1969
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:49,920
- Sly fox. - Sly fox.

1970
01:34:51,659 --> 01:34:53,389
(It's Ji Soo's turn to ask a question.)

1971
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,489
Gyu Min?

1972
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:57,260
He's so popular.

1973
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,898
We went on dates...

1974
01:34:59,899 --> 01:35:02,300
and exchanged a few texts,

1975
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:04,398
but at some point,

1976
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:06,640
things ended.

1977
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:08,439
If I had...

1978
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:10,409
expressed...

1979
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,979
my feelings to you,

1980
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:20,720
I'm curious if your feelings could have changed.

1981
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:30,300
I think so.

1982
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:36,100
I think that could've happened.

1983
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,310
From what I felt,

1984
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:42,479
your feelings...

1985
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,439
seemed pretty set to me.

1986
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,310
That's why I asked.

1987
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:52,949
I just wanted to ask him once.

1988
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,489
I wanted to know what would've happened if I had done so.

1989
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:58,090
The timing wasn't great.

1990
01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:00,859
I should've just acted as I felt.

1991
01:36:06,029 --> 01:36:07,399
Hae Eun,

1992
01:36:09,699 --> 01:36:13,568
how do you think you'd feel...

1993
01:36:13,569 --> 01:36:16,680
if Gyu Min were to like you again starting today?

1994
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:21,109
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh!

1995
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:24,649
- My gosh. - What a question.

1996
01:36:24,819 --> 01:36:26,689
Oh, my goodness!

1997
01:36:32,789 --> 01:36:36,658
How do you think you'd feel...

1998
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:39,770
if Gyu Min were to like you again starting today?

1999
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,010
- Today? Starting now? - She's thinking.

2000
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:52,779
Nothing like that will happen.

2001
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:55,479
- But what if it does? - What if?

2002
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:58,180
If so...

2003
01:37:09,529 --> 01:37:10,559
I didn't know what to say.

2004
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,800
That was the part I was most confused about.

2005
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:16,669
That kept confusing me,

2006
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,439
and I couldn't make up my mind.

2007
01:37:18,869 --> 01:37:20,810
He asked exactly about that.

2008
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:32,819
I'd like to skip this question.

2009
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:37,520
(Hae Eun skipped Hyun Gyu's question.)

2010
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,829
I thought that it'd hurt Hyun Gyu to hear the truth.

2011
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:49,199
That's why I skipped the question.

2012
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,970
- Can I ask you something? - Go ahead.

2013
01:37:55,909 --> 01:37:58,310
You were always asked to go on dates.

2014
01:38:00,449 --> 01:38:02,619
If you could choose someone,

2015
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:05,550
including Gyu Min,

2016
01:38:06,289 --> 01:38:08,720
if you only had one chance, who would you choose?

2017
01:38:16,529 --> 01:38:17,560
One chance.

2018
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,100
One chance.

2019
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:24,770
One chance.

2020
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,210
Well...

2021
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,449
If I only have...

2022
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:39,079
one chance,

2023
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,289
I want to go on a date with Gyu Min,

2024
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:51,300
even though I know how he feels.

2025
01:38:55,699 --> 01:38:56,770
I want to go on a date with him.

2026
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,609
If I only have one chance,

2027
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:03,210
I have to choose Gyu Min.

2028
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:06,180
I didn't have a lot of chances with him.

2029
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:08,909
You need time to talk.

2030
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,978
Did you two go on a date here?

2031
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:12,618
No, we didn't.

2032
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:15,220
During our ex conversations, we didn't talk about anything deep.

2033
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:18,189
We didn't have a full day together.

2034
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:20,059
I think a date with him...

2035
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:23,529
would help me make up my mind the most.

2036
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,130
I want to have some time with him...

2037
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:29,300
- even if I have to force him. - It's better than not doing so.

2038
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:34,069
I think I need to spend time with Gyu Min to make up my mind.

2039
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:43,680
It's my turn now.

2040
01:39:44,949 --> 01:39:46,449
I'll ask Gyu Min.

2041
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,390
(Hae Eun picked Gyu Min again.)

2042
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:54,929
I had already spent the whole day on a date with Hyun Gyu...

2043
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:56,059
for the past few days.

2044
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:59,869
Hyun Gyu had already made his feelings for me very clear.

2045
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:03,398
I didn't have a lot of time to communicate...

2046
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:04,699
with Gyu Min.

2047
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:08,109
That's why I had to spend the rest of my time on Gyu Min.

2048
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:10,380
I'll ask Gyu Min.

2049
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:15,279
I'm only asking this since everyone knows I'm a crybaby.

2050
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:19,250
You were aware that I was always crying because of you.

2051
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,289
I'm curious as to what you were thinking...

2052
01:40:26,489 --> 01:40:30,199
while going on dates with other people...

2053
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:33,970
when you knew that I was always crying...

2054
01:40:35,369 --> 01:40:36,739
because of you.

2055
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:42,539
I want to know how you felt when you knew I was crying.

2056
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,698
Of course, I felt bad.

2057
01:41:09,699 --> 01:41:12,770
I felt bad ever since we first got here.

2058
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:17,978
I felt bad about going on dates...

2059
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:19,140
with other people.

2060
01:41:19,909 --> 01:41:22,079
I kept feeling bad.

2061
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:42,470
From my perspective, even if I felt bad,

2062
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:45,439
I couldn't...

2063
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:48,339
actively console you...

2064
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:51,140
or be sympathetic with you.

2065
01:41:51,579 --> 01:41:54,449
I thought I'd hurt you more if I did that.

2066
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,619
I couldn't do that.

2067
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,720
I know Hae Eun still has feelings left for me.

2068
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:04,219
If I give her any room...

2069
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,189
or a hint,

2070
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:10,629
that would encourage her...

2071

2073
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:19,140
I felt bad for you.

2074
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:23,579
I kept thinking about you and cheering you up.

2075
01:42:27,979 --> 01:42:30,420
You were cheering me up? Okay.

2076
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,488
It's obvious...

2077
01:42:39,489 --> 01:42:41,059
Hae Eun has feelings for Gyu Min.

2078
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:42,898
So she kept asking him...

2079
01:42:42,899 --> 01:42:44,560
about their relationship.

2080
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:51,368
I have a question for you.

Okay.

2082
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:56,710
Do you want to get back with Gyu Min?

I decided to ask her straight up.

So I asked her straight up.

I wanted Hae Eun to think about it carefully.

That way, neither Hae Eun nor Hyun Gyu...

2100
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,960
Because he meant a lot to me.

2101
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,209
Though her answer was vague,

2102

she was saying she wanted to.

2103

It was disappointing.

2106

I confirmed it twice.

what it means to date someone for seven years.

2109
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,800
But when I heard that in person,

2110
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:00,829
it was disappointing.

No matter how nice I am,

that would hurt Hyun Gyu.

But I couldn't say no.

2116
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:21,050
Though I felt bad for him, I had to tell the truth.

2117
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:25,520
Despite hearing that,

2118
01:45:26,289 --> 01:45:29,329
he kept watching me like this to see if I was crying.

2119

He thought I'd cry as I answered his question.

I felt grateful and sorry.

It was sad, but I understand.

But I'm just another man after all.

- Despite hearing such things. - That's the perfect answer.

He's like, "That's all."

- But that's true. - Yes.

- It's true. - Yes.

- He's mature. - With that attitude,

2132
01:46:08,899 --> 01:46:10,898
he'd get into her heart deeper than seven years.

His attitude is what matters.

2134

If he ends up thinking, "I can't get in between them,"

2135

it'll never work out.

he should wait, and she'll open up to him one day.
