Na Eon is a great girl.

But we met when we were so young.

We dated when I was 21 years old.

10

And we dated for a year and a half.

But we were on and off during that year and a half.

Just like me.

- How come you're not texting me? - I...

It's so annoying.

Why all of a sudden?

53
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,580
You... You know what?

54
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,849
Did you know that you were the last person to talk to me?

55
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,688
We got to know each other last.

56
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,419
- Right! - Right!

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,718
But I texted you once.

58
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,960
Right. Here's what I thought.

Sit down.

We've gotten close now.

61
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,239
To be honest, I thought you were just texting me as a friend.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,239
But I once chose you...

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,468
as my date before.

64
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,569
Right. That's why I thought you texted me as a friend.

65
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,979
I wanted to get to know you.

66
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,508
But I got a message saying...

67
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,479
you chose someone else for your date the next day.

68
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,319
It said you would go out with a new partner.

69
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,218
- Sorry. - "I see."

70
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,520
But I really regret it.

71
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,889
I do.

72
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,590
Hee Doo is really nice and takes good care of me.

73
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,959
When I wasn't in a good mood, he asked me how I was feeling.

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,370
He told me I didn't seem good. Then he would pay attention to me.

75
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:50,899
Seriously. You're so annoying.

76

(Ji Soo is curious about his thought.)

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,239
I spent a good time with Ji Yeon.

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,469
So I chose her after my date with her.

79
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,848
But then my ex started to get involved.

80
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,379
I could feel that she was getting jealous.

81
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,079
Given the situation I was in,

82
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,349
I wasn't ready to start something new.

83
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,319
I'm sure you know what I mean.

84
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,918
- I can understand that. - It was so complicated for me.

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,929
I was grateful that you sent me a message.

86
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,660
- We got close. - Right.

87
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,528
So I thought you were sending that as a friend.

88
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,870
- Do you understand that? - Yes.

89

I was sending it as a friend.

90
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,740
But...

91
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,008
I still wanted to spend more time with you.

92
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,969
I don't want to be sad anymore.

93
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,310
I know what you mean.

94
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,579
I just wanted to go on a date with you.

95
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,350
Well, we have a lot of time left. Let's have fun together.

96
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,018
By the way, you shouldn't have canceled it.

97
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,050
Why did you cancel it?

98
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,519
So I'm trying to make it up now.

99
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,959
Okay. Let's eat something delicious.

102
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,470
- So... - You fight because there's love.

00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,069
That's why I didn't have any lingering feelings.

104

After their exes have been revealed, everyone is...

105

106

- They feel at ease. - Right.

107

That's why I didn't have any lingering feelings.

108

- I gave it my all. - Right.

109
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,149
Then...

110
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,188
I made sure I got over Ji Soo before coming on to this show.

111
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,829
I was ready not to see her ever again.

112
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,828
I thought it was the right thing to break up with her...

113
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,659
because I had been sacrificing myself to be with her.

114
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,470
Maybe, even that thought is torturing you.

115
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,740
After that,

116
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,068
I told myself a lot...

117
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,970
- to be strong. I worked on that. - To yourself.

118
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,979
I read books.

119
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,309
I keep a journal for the same reason.

120
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,508
I focused on myself, so I got over her a lot.

121
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,920
But once that becomes a habit,

122
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,448
even that habit will tie you down.

123
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,120
- No. I think that helped you grow. - Right.

124
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,860
Yes, that's true too.

125
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,128
I've never felt like this before either.

126
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,328
Actually, I was never going to see her again.

127
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,898
But I got these new feelings when I met her again.

128
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,899
And I wasn't sure what I was feeling.

129
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,240
To get a better understanding, I went through what I did today.

130
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,869
And a part of me...

131
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,069
- regrets making this decision. - No. I think...

132
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,240
you should do everything you can.

133
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,680
- This is my room. - What? It's all the way at the end.

134
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,188
- How nice. - Watch out for the step.

135
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,490
You didn't bring a lot of stuff.

136
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,060
First of all, I wanted us to be alone.

137
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,289
Everyone has gotten close except for me.

138
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,599
I wanted to get close to Hae Eun...

139
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,698
and also get to know her.

140
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,069
When Hyun Gyu likes someone,

141
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,500
he takes action.

142
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,810
Once he deems someone a good person,

143
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,938
he definitely makes his moves first.

144
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,839
I think he tries to feel out the vibe.

145
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,709
And he believes in his decisions.

146

(Hyun Gyu's room)

147
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,319
- Cheers. - Cheers.

148
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,250
- Thanks for coming here. - No problem.

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,659
- You're still in school, right? - Yes.

150
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,219
I wanted to major in something related to sports too.

151
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,989
- Did you always like sports? - Yes.

152
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,589
- I brought a water bottle. - Okay. You should drink it.

153
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,129
- You can drink it if you need it. - Really? Gosh, what a sweet guy.

154
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,599
Actually, I had a plan.

155
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,409
I wanted to secretly ask her to drink in my room.

156
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,979
So I cleaned the room. And I wanted to set it up.

157
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,639
So I took a look at the room.

158
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,709
(It was 30 minutes ago.)

159
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,120
I thought about where would be a nice place to drink,

160
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,159
where she would feel comfortable, and if it was clean.

161
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
And I checked for things that would make her uncomfortable.

162
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,529
I checked what we might need like if there was water or food.

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,369
I went to the room first and checked it out.

164
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,110
Then I went back and asked her.

165
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,839
(Hyun Gyu's plan)

166
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,179
- Do you have any questions for me? - I have a lot.

167
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,219
Like what?

168
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,350
Why did you choose me as your date?

169
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,719
I was attracted to you when I first saw you.

170
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,019
- Really? - Yes.

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,089
When I first walked in,

172
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,628
you grabbed my eyes.

173
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,028
- Really? I wonder why. - Yes.

174
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,698
To be more accurate,

175
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,099
I could see you were thoughtful.

176
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,769
You were totally off!

177
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,838
- Was I? - No.

178
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,869
Really?

179
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,469
I like serious people.

180
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,069
I'm the opposite of that.

181
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,980
- I'm totally... Really? - But you can't say that about you.

182
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,878
- No way. - No.

183
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,649
You're totally off.

184
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,279
Come on.

185
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,849
Really? But I can tell you're a serious guy.

186
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,418
- But I'm the opposite. - Really?

187
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,389
I tend to be naively cheerful. Seriously.

188
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,360
Earlier, I was a bit uncomfortable.

189
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,928
Really? Why?

190
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,529
I joined the group pretty late.

191
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:49,399
I thought it wouldn't be easy.

192
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,469
But you didn't show it at all.

193
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,240
Everything about you seemed natural.

194
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,940
I'll try to help you although I'm not doing well myself.

195
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,079
By the way, we dropped our honorifics.

196
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Right.

197
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
- Right? - I'm sorry.

198
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:04,879
- No! I love it. I really do. - Okay.

199
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,949
I'm really happy that you feel comfortable.

200
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,220
I like it when you speak casually.

201
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,649
- That's good. - Just be yourself.

202
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,589
At first, I get attracted to their looks.

203
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,258
And then I find her personality, her thoughts,

204
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,000
and her values important next. They are important to me.

205
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,600
I've never dated any younger guys.

206
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,099
I like men I can rely on and who are strong.

207
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,469
So I preferred dating older guys than younger guys.

208
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,939
I have a hard time...

209
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,508
dropping my honorifics even though they are younger.

210
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,408
But within hours of meeting Hyun Gyu,

211
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,979
I had dropped my honorifics.

212
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,678
And Hyun Gyu was doing the same.

213
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,079
Age doesn't matter to me.

214
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,250
So I'm not bothered at all...

215
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,789
by our age difference.

216
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,158
We have to stay close to the wall...

217
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,960
- to get less wind. - Is that so?

218
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,429
This is much better.

219
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,570
By the way, I gave it a lot of thought.

220
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,039
I wanted to talk to Hee Doo too.

221
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,239
- I initially said I was over him. - Yes.

222
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,809
Actually, our breakup wasn't amicable.

223
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,739
We broke up too many times.

224
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,008
We were on and off again and again.

225
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,950
As you can see, we always fight.

226
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,549
Since we all live in the same house,

227
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,788
I got jealous.

228
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:18,919
I was uncomfortable to spend time with you when I felt this jealousy.

229
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,519
It bothered me.

230
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,360
But how come you don't have any lingering feelings?

231
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,200
To be honest, I'm not like you.

232
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,600
That's understandable.

233
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,669
- That's why I find you... - Yes.

234
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,299
I think you're cool.

235
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,740
- I bet you guys didn't fight a lot. - We didn't fight a lot.

236
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,840
To tell you the truth, we didn't have any reasons to fight.

237
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,909
- Gosh. - Stop torturing me!

238
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,309
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

239
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,249
- Do you hate me? - No.

240
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,648
- Hold on. - They are...

241
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,649
Everyone...

242
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,189
Everyone is talking to someone 1-on-1.

243
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,648
This is so funny.

244
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,090
This is fun. This has gotten fun to watch.

245
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,058
They're talking about their trips...

246
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,730
- to Jeju Island and their dates. - Right.

247
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,330
They have to talk about it now.

248
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,629
They're trying to explain it to each other.

249
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,529
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

250
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,429
- Do you hate me? - No.

251
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,169
Then why were you so mean yesterday?

252
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,240
- When was I mean? - I was disappointed.

253
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,809
Are you that upset...

254
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,409
because I gave the oil-based pasta to my ex-boyfriend?

255
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,409
He seemed to enjoy it.

256
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,649
- It was pretty good. - Right.

257
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,619
- It got your appetite going, right? - I had a bite.

258
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,349
I wanted to have another bite.

259
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,418
- To be honest, - It was so good, right?

260
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:26,690
I thought you would give me some.

261
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,330
But you didn't.

262
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,759
- I'm firm. I don't play around. - Right.

263
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,200
- "Right?" - Yes.

264
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,870
(Their last night in Pyeongchang-dong)

265
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,600
Of course, it's good. I cooked it.

266
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,970
(Ji Yeon made the oil-based pasta.)

267
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,309
- How did you make this? - Isn't it really good?

268
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,038
It's good.

269
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,279
(Glancing)

270
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,419
Isn't it really good? Be honest. You agree, right?

271
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,419
Yes. This is so good!

272
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,789
(Hee Doo keeps staring at the cup noodles.)

273
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,059
- You should eat it. Why? - Just have a bite.

274
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,659
(Thanks to Ji Soo, he ends up having a bite.)

275
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,700
It's good.

276
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,940
That hit the spot.

277
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,240
It did.

278
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,639
Really? Anyway,

279
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,409
are we good?

280
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,850
- Are you 100 percent sure? - Yes. For today.

281
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,049
Why are you wearing that?

282
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,350
Darn it.

283
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,330
- You really threw it. That hurts. - I feel good today.

284
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,288
By the way, I...

285
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,259
Wait. I don't have to tell you.

286
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,528
I shouldn't tell you.

287
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,669
(She can see the bracelet on his wrist.)

288
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,299
(It was 5 hours ago.)

289
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,740
Do you have a charger?

290
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,509
- Do you have a charger? - A portable battery?

291
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,408
I'll get you a charger.

292
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,480
Can I borrow it?

293
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,950
(Hee Doo goes out to his car to get a charger.)

294
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:06,490
(He puts on the bracelet again he took off.)

295
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,769
- Gosh. - Look.

296
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,469
- He has feelings for Ji Yeon. - He does.

297
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,099
- That's for sure. - Right. He likes her.

298
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,440
- He does. - In that short moment...

299
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,370
- That says everything. - He really likes her.

300
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,110
What about you? Do you know how I feel?

301
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,678
I don't. How could I? You never tell me how you feel.

302
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,048
Then why do you pretend as if you do?

303
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,779
- I'm not a mind reader. - Why pretend to know everything?

304
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,379
Did you think...

305
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,288
As for today and yesterday,

306
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,659
did you think I didn't think much before sending the text messages?

307
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,360
Because my mind is set?

308
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm kind of curious...

309
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,929
about your thought on that.

310
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,169
I don't think like that.

311
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,209
Be honest.

312
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,340
I mean it.

313
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,240
- Really? - Yes.

314
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,509
Anyway, that's why...

315
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,950
I wanted to ask you about that.

316
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,580
But it looked like you didn't want to talk to me.

317
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
To be honest, I shouldn't talk about this with you.

318
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,489
Why are you giggling?

319
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,490
(Laughing)

320
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,529
Didn't you think I wouldn't send it to you today?

321
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,469
I knew you wouldn't send it to me.

322
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,599
- Really? - Yes.

323
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,669
I think I've already expressed myself.

324
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,210
You're so cool.

325
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,408
I wouldn't have been able to do the same.

326
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,610
- Really? - Yes.

327
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,379
Actually, I expressed my feelings to you too.

328
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,879
I really like you.

329
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
It feels like you always comfort me.

330
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,759
Okay. I can understand everything now.

331
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,089
I'm grateful that you can understand that.

332
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,460
I'll be honest. Things have been tough on me lately.

333
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,500
But I really wanted you to comfort me.

334
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,600
I wanted to tell you everything.

335
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,669
You always comforted me.

336
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,970
Talking to you now is comforting me again.

337
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,970
If I'm the person you can talk comfortably around,

338
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,710
I can just be that person to you.

339
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,379
Cheers.

340
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,148
My two weeks in Seoul...

341
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,159
I joined them five days after they had moved in.

342
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:21,289
I had been having a hard time during my time in Seoul.

343
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,730
Why?

344
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,099
I just thought that I had moved on from my ex.

345
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,399
But being in the same house with him...

346
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:30,499
helped me realize that I wasn't over him yet.

347
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,740
While having these feelings,

348
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,269
I saw him go on dates with my roommate.

349
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,440
And I couldn't tell her that he was my ex-boyfriend the whole time.

350
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,610
When I talked to her, I could easily see she was a cheerful person.

351
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,480
She smiles a lot.

352
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,879
She's kind of...

353
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,090
bright like the sun.

354
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,058
- So you hugged him like this? - Yes.

355
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,330
- Be honest. - Yes.

356
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,899
I did this. "That looks good."

357
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,299
I don't know.

358
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,429
- Did you hug him with one hand? - Yes.

359
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,600
Did I hug him with two hands?

360
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,439
Is that what she said?

361
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,869
To be honest, I don't remember.

362
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,839
You told me you hugged him. Then you must have remembered it.

363
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,480
You just hugged him out in the open.

364
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,740
You said you remembered it.

365
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,210
Yes.

366
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,678
Then why are you asking me?

367
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,320
From what I remember, it was only with one hand.

368
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,489
I didn't even care much about it. It wasn't important to me.

369
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,819
Right. So you should think about that next.

370
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,158
I couldn't. What can I do?

371
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,888
You have to start thinking about that now.

372
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,329
I didn't. What can I do now?

373
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,700
- Please stop fighting. - Okay.

374
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,928
You broke so many glasses. How many glasses did you break here?

375
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:36,929
Only one.

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,669
It was just one.

377
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,839
- Just one? - Yes.

378
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,470
- You broke another one there. - Where?

379
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,710
At the house.

380
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:46,879
Right. Then I've broken two so far.

381
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,178
- That's enough. - You can't let that go?

382
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,379
Stop it, Na Yeon.

383
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,750
I'll go inside.

384
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,049
Stop it.

385
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,590
Rest up.

386
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,090
Why are you throwing a tantrum here?

387
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,159
Won Bin, you be the judge of that.

388
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,660
Gosh. Stop it.

389
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,599
This just shows we're so not compatible.

390
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,069
Some people aren't just compatible.

391
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,879
Hi.

392
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,079
- You're back early. - Yes.

393
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,920
- It's so cold. - I fought with Nam Hee Doo.

394
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,449
Nam Hee Doo is so annoying.

395
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,159
Did you 2 fight yesterday after the 3 of us talked?

396
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,220
Big time.

397
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,829
Why is he...

398
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,459
He's just like Gyu Min.

399
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,798
He never thinks he's wrong.

400
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,639
But in my opinion,

401
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,039
Gyu Min is kind.

402
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,699
- Really? - He's nice about it.

403
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,909
- But Hee Doo scolds me. - Really?

404
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,009
He said this earlier. "Hey, why are you doing that? Don't do anything."

405
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:54,879
Gyu Min doesn't do that.

406
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,278
Hee Doo isn't easy to please.

407
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,480
The same goes for Gyu Min.

408
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,879
- Really? I just haven't seen that? - He only...

409
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,679
He only puts it nicely when he talks.

410
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,189
Right. Hee Doo can't do that.

411
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,490
It's so hurtful.

412
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,719
I thought you were fine.

413
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,459
- Hi. Where have you been? - Where have you been?

414
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,889
I was doing my assignment in that room.

415
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,059
- Which room? - Which room?

416
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,298
You'll be all shocked to see how Hee Doo treats me.

417
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,700
"Hey, don't do anything."

418
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,529
He always says that to me.

419
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,768
But he still cleans up after you.

420
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,069
And that's so annoying.

421
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,768
- But you like him again. - Right.

422
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,609
He tells me not to do anything, and he does everything.

423
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,179
- He does. - Right. That's so sweet.

424
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,278
Let's say I spill something.

425
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,980
"What's wrong with you?" And he wipes everything.

426
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,119
That's why I thought earlier...

427
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,450
that he was sweet, but...

428
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,349
- Right? That's... - A sweet guy.

429
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,750
That's why I ended up dating him for four years.

430
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,160
That side of him made it impossible for me to move on.

431
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,630
- He's so annoying. - Then...

432
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,160
"Annoying."

433
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,569
She can now openly badmouth him after fighting with him.

434
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,598
You can ask me any questions if you have any.

435
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,569
I talked to the guys in the Talking Room.

436
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,670
Did Hee Doo say he still had feelings for me?

437
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,079
All of them said they didn't have any feelings left.

438
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,449
They all didn't have any feelings left...

439
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,249
and had someone they were attracted to.

440
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,348
But they hadn't completely made up their minds yet.

441
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,390
They all said that.

442
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,420
- Really? Is that so? - Darn it.

443
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,819
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

444
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,759
It depends on when we get up. But around 1pm or 2pm.

445
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,399
It will be so fun to go on a date on Jeju Island.

446
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Have fun on the date.

447
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,630
I'm really fine.

448
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,969
- Really? - Yes.

449
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,169
I kept telling him...

450
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,170
that I wanted him to meet a nice person.

451
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,868
And during the preliminary interview,

452
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,808
I told them I wanted him to find someone nice here.

453
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,108
I said I wanted him to meet someone new,

454
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,410
- and I would help him navigate. - How?

455
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,879
- So cool. Help him navigate? - You're so cool.

456
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,949
I can do that for him.

457
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,018
I did as much as I could.

458
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,419
- I liked him so much. - Really?

459
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,389
Then could you say you liked him more when you were going out?

460
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,689
- Yes! - Really?

461
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,489
When he said he wanted to break up,

462
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,430
I ran to him and grabbed him like this.

463
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,129
- But are you okay? - Na Yeon, get up.

464
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,259
- Na Yeon. Lean on me. - I just want to...

465
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:56,999
No, but... Didn't you ever do that?

466
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,099
Yes, I have too.

467
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,839
But I succeeded.

468
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,209
I did too. But in the end, he left.

469
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,639
But if you don't see each other for two years after that,

470
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,740
you'll end up like me.

471
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,549
If you don't see the guy for two years...

472
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,848
You did as much as you could,

473
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,249
and you clung to him and everything, but he still left?

474
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,949
I literally grabbed him by his coat as he was leaving.

475
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,490
I also ran to Hee Doo and just hugged him.

476
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,890
I said I couldn't break up.

477
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,729
We're all the same.

478
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,798
But this kind of experience isn't common.

479
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,799
What is it with us?

480
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,299
And I still got rejected. But he kept saying no.

481
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,469
I even blocked him like this so he couldn't leave.

482
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,769
- But he still left. - You poor thing.

483
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,400
Seriously, we all experienced this, and we're here together?

484
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,339
So I said, "Please hug me for the last time."

485
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,338
He was so cold,

486
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,749
but I asked him if he could say it while holding my hand.

487
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,949
I've said both of those things.

488
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,979
"Hug me one last time."

489
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,389
But he really hugged me and left,

490
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,949
- so I felt so sad. - I know.

491
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,920
Gosh, Hee Doo would've done that.

492
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,189
- But when we finally broke up, - The last time was the last time.

493
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,089
we were both so sick of each other.

494
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,028
We didn't even hold hands.

495
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,099
We were just fighting and said, "It's time for us to end it."

496
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:02,970
That was it.

497
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,470
But after you grew sick of each other,

498
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,108
you didn't see him for six months?

499
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,439
I didn't see him at all. My love for him was gone.

500
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,038
I was over him.

501
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,078
That's the same as me.

502
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,650
- Or I thought I was. - I was exactly the same.

503
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,920
But you were in the process of forgetting him, and you met again.

504
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,690
- So that's why. - It was so hard for me.

505
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,419
I think it's bound to be hard.

506
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,329
No wonder. Yes, you're right.

507
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,558
It was your first time seeing him after a year and a half, right?

508
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,528
- Right. - Gosh, seriously.

509
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:35,729
So I was... The last I saw of Gyu Min was...

510
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,630
his brutally cold departure.

511
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,709
I was so nervous at the thought of seeing him again...

512
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,909
because I thought he'd still be that cold.

513
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,809
But then he started crying the moment he saw you.

514
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,339
And he smiled at me, which was not what I expected.

515
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,750
And the thing is, I was totally... I met with him...

516
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,219
after all the pre-shoot interviews were finished.

517
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,919
During the interviews, I said that I was going to put myself out there.

518
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,459
I was like, "I'm going to meet so many new people."

519
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,389
But in the pre-shoot meeting, I saw him again,

520
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,329
and I thought, "He's the one for me."

521
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,899
Right as I saw him,

522
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,470
I couldn't help myself.

523
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,298
We didn't talk about much, but I was so happy.

524
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,669
I was so happy that night too.

525
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,940
- You were happy? - Yes.

526
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,639
Talking about all of this is...

527
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,739
- In Season One, - This just didn't happen.

528
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,479
it got more awkward after the exes were revealed.

529
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,249
- Yes, it was. It never happened. - Right.

530
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,419
But in Season Two, things got more comfortable after the reveal.

531
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,679
- A lot more. - Much more comfortable.

532
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,949
They're relying on each other more. They still keep their distance,

533
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,189
but they're talking about deep stuff.

534
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,989
- Right. - They are competitors,

535
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,028
but they still console each other.

536
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:38,028
- This friendship is growing deeper. - Yes, friendship.

537
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,129
Right, they're building friendship.

538
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,199
They were roommates, living together for two weeks.

539
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,569
Hae Eun has been waiting for this moment, actually.

540
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,670
Let's hurry up and reveal the exes.

541
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,670
Hae Eun is on a roll.

542
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:47,970
She's been waiting for this.

543
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,479
To be honest, I have a lot of feelings for Hee Doo.

544
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,539
Really?

545
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,709
But then, I am a bit afraid to see him again.

546
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,680
- Right. - I've been fighting nonstop here.

547
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,990
I mean, nothing has changed.

548
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,690
So what if we go out again?

549
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,358
It's just lingering feelings and nothing else.

550
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,259
I don't want to go out with him, but I just want to keep seeing him.

551
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,630
And I don't want him to see other women.

552
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:16,369
You must be the type to reach out after you process things first.

553
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,440
But Hyun Gyu doesn't try to change you,

554
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,539
and he doesn't get angry.

555
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,308
But if he likes someone? Then he doesn't get disappointed in her.

556
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,440
He just accepts her and says, "This is who she is."

557
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,180
- It's not common. - He's cool.

558
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,778
If he really likes someone,

559
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,149
then he doesn't care what kind of person she is.

560
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,089
He doesn't care about her appearance or her character.

561
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,858
Do you have someone you like? Do you like Tae I?

562
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,189
Honestly, up until when we went surfing, I was...

563
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,129
You said you weren't sure until then.

564
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,129
You said you guys might not be a good match.

565
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,098
I wasn't sure, and I thought, "Why is he acting this way?"

566
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,868
But today, he was all right.

567
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:57,669
The more you get to know him, the better he seems.

568
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,338
He's a good guy.

569
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,909
- Yes. - I think he's a good person.

570
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,749
He was so much fun today, and I felt so comfortable with him.

571
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,880
But here's the thing. I can see him trying to make an effort.

572
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,349
- Really? - And with other people,

573
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,220
he doesn't try this hard.

574
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,359
I can see him making an effort now.

575
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,459
But to regular people, that's not enough.

576
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,088
Right.

577
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,499
Today, we ate meat...

578
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,700
and had a fun date, so I felt more at ease with him.

579
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,199
We used to only send one-line messages to each other,

580
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,709
but he sent four lines today.

581
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,769
That's totally...

582
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,179
- I was so surprised. - Really?

583
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Yes.

584
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,049
- Really? - Yes.

585
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,220
He put a lot of thought into it.

586
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,720
I felt like, "He's starting to develop feelings for me now."

587
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,589
You must've opened up to each other.

588
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,160
I think so. He was more caring than I thought.

589
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,559
He was very caring.

590
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,028
And he's quite fun.

591
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,528
That's right.

592
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,598
- He's funny, right? - He is.

593
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,729
He's funny. He's a funny guy.

594
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,799
So I think you'd probably laugh a lot.

595
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,838
Sometimes, he's funny because he's silly.

596
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,239
- Right. - He's unexpectedly funny.

597
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,209
I always laugh at his jokes.

598
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,338
I laugh from afar, since I'm not close with him.

599
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,309
But he throws jokes out of nowhere, and they're hilarious.

600
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,089
(Living room)

601
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,519
- What is this? - It's gum.

602
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,190
If I give this to you...

603
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,858
Right, he gave that to you.

604
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,029
- Gosh, this is... - Up and down.

605
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,829
Are you done? Do you want to go outside? Let's go.

606
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,740
- I'll go outside with Won Bin. - Okay.

607
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,068
Are you guys going on the motorcycle?

608
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,608
No, we're not. How could I?

609
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:38,609
Right.

610
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,680
But like you said earlier,

611
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,379
I don't think I can figure out...

612
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,589
what I'm feeling at the moment.

613
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,930
But I'm not trying to force that on you.

614
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,469
I just want you to be more comfortable.

615
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,670
Like how you feel about yourself.

616
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,980
I just... The thing that upset me was...

617
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,048
I saw Ji Soo struggling a few times recently.

618
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,018
But I wanted to...

619
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,719
- You wanted to help her. - Right.

620
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,619
I came here thinking I'd try talking to her again.

621
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:29,789
But from how she acted today,

622
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,699
I could see that she didn't like...

623
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,758
I could see she felt uncomfortable around me.

624
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,769
- Try talking... - The conversation didn't go well.

625
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,298
I always ended up having to read her feelings.

626
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,838
"Why doesn't she want to talk to me?"

627
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,339
But isn't that what you think?

628
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,338
- Did you talk to Ji Soo about that? - But this is...

629
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,979
Yes, we talked about it today.

630
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,650
- But you ended up fighting, right? - Well, yes.

631
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,579
Then just listen to her first.

632
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,289
But until now,

633
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,960
I always listened to her.

634
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,858
But if you can't help it, then that's it.

635
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,759
If you're not a good fit, then that's it.

636
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,659
We broke up because we knew that, I guess.

637
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,930
Then don't put the focus on the breakup.

638
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,568
Do you think that Ji Soo is the same Ji Soo you first met...

639
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,038
- compared to who she is now? - She's very different.

640
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,980
Then you need to talk to her knowing she's different.

641
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,950
- I think I need to sort things out. - Yes, you should.

642
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,849
Do you want to be alone?

643
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,279
No, let's go.

644
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,220
I do need to give it more thought, like you said.

645
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,839
(Hee Doo went over to someone's room.)

646
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,670
- Who's there? - Who are you?

647
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,479
Do you want to build a snowman?

648
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,380
- Hi. - Hey, Hee Doo. Come in.

649
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,979
You know "Parasite," right?

650
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,749
- Come up. - Come in, Hee Doo.

651
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,950
You know "Parasite," right?

652
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,489
- Seriously... - What is with this timing?

653
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,220
Children. What's the problem here?

654
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,219
Not me, Ji Soo.

655
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,190
I see. I was talking to Won Bin until just now.

656
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,200
But you know, Won Bin is... Sure. I understand you, Ji Soo.

657
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,569
- You probably don't. - No, I do.

658
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,470
- Come in. - Come in.

659
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,779
Won Bin. I was about to head out.

660
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,008
- Sleep well, you two. - Thanks.

661
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,880
- Goodnight. - Thanks.

662
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,548
Is Ji Soo inside?

663
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:33,749
Hey, where is Tae I, by the way?

664
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,318
Wouldn't Tae I be sleeping inside?

665
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,190
- No, he's not there. Come here. - Here?

666
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,319
- This is Tae I's room. - Is he in the bathroom?

667
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,720
He's not here, really.

668
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,359
Excuse me.

669
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:48,259
What's this? He was sleeping.

670
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,569
- Was he sleeping? - Let's turn off the lights.

671
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,839
Let's go.

672
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,509
I thought he wasn't here.

673
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,009
I couldn't see him either.

674
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,879
- Where are you going, Gyu Min? - I was going to Ji Soo's room.

675
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,909
Anyone know where it is?

676
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,909
This way. Right there.

677
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,118
No, it's here.

678
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,890
Here. Right.

679
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,559
(Glancing over)

680
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,789
(He checks which room Na Yeon is in as well.)

681
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,630
(Their first day on Jeju Island comes to an end.)

682
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,180
(8:30am, Hyun Gyu gets up.)

683
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,990
(Hyun Gyu looks around the living room.)

684
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,759
(He starts cleaning up.)

685
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,640
(He even tidies the sofa.)

686
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,288
- I thought he was... - What's this?

687
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,529
- Goodness, he's shaking his booty. - He's dancing to music.

688
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,890
But why is he...

689
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,059
- so stiff? - He's stiff.

690
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,299
(Hyun Gyu goes back quietly after he finishes cleaning.)

691
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,539
(Na Eon comes to Tae I's room.)

692
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,680
Can I come in?

693
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:20,650
What are you doing today?

694
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,419
Nothing.

695
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,950
- Are you not doing anything today? - No.

696
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,659
- Do you want to go surfing? - What?

697
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,689
Surfing.

698
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,920
- Can we go? - Yes.

699
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,429
- How? - You can do it if you're with me.

700
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,499
Okay.

701
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,469
Can you be ready by 2pm?

702
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,099
- Yes, I can. - Really?

703
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,940
You can't be late, okay?

704
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,170
(She and Tae I promise to go surfing.)

705
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,909
He texted me and said,

706
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,078
"Let's go surfing next time."

707
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,279
So I wanted to go first with Tae I.

708
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,119
Hey, you must be happy to go surfing today.

709
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,219
- Have you guys been upstairs? - No.

710
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,318
Follow me right now.

711
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,420
- Upstairs? - Yes.

712
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,160
Gosh, the view is...

713
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:04,630
This is awesome.

714
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,598
You guys will be surprised when we get upstairs.

715
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,639
- Why? - I'm curious to know...

716
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,838
- what it's like up there. - Can we go up?

717
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,609
I went up there this morning.

718
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,139
- Close your eyes. - I'm coming, eyes closed.

719
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,939
- I'll take your hands. - Okay.

720
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,548
I'll take your hands. Close your eyes. Don't open them.

721
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:24,979
I'm so excited.

722
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,380
Oh, sorry. All right.

723
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,279
Open your eyes.

724
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,890
- This is amazing. - Isn't it? Look.

725
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,899
This is amazing. I'm so happy.

726
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,769
There are so many people on the beach.

727
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,910
- You're right, and they're surfing. - There's a lot of surfers.

728
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,480
I want to ride that scooter.

729
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,149
I didn't know this place existed.

730
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,119
Right? We can sit here too.

731
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,619
It's so nice.

732
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,390
Don't you think it'll be nice at night?

733
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,288
The sea is so blue. It's like emerald green.

734
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,859
- The color is beautiful. - I know.

735
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,400
You'll have fun surfing.

736
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,829
It's so nice.

737
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,469
- Good morning. - Are you looking around the house?

738
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,899
- What? - Are you looking around the house?

739
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,068
Should I have cereal?

740
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,309
- I love cereal. - I want some too.

741
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,480
- Who wants this? - There are eggs here too.

742
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,008
Should I make some scrambled eggs?

743
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,479
- I was going to make them. - Really?

744
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,509
Yes.

745
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,578
That's the only thing I know how to make.

746
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,750
- Same. That's why I said I'd do it. - Really?

747
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,390
What time will you leave and come back today?

748
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,729
I was going to leave at 11am,

749
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,229
but things kept getting delayed.

750
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,028
I wanted to ask you to go surfing, but I hear you hate the water.

751
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,729
I'm... Just don't worry about me.

752
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,969
- While you're surfing, - I wanted to...

753
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,200
I wanted to ask you to hang out for a day.

754
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:54,740
That's too bad.

755
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,440
Na Eon, let's hang out sometime.

756
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,079
Okay. You can suggest what we should do.

757
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,710
A suggestion? What should we do?

758
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,209
Suggest that we should go to a cafe later.

759
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,680
To a cafe? Okay.

760
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,289
- I'll help you. - Is this good?

761
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,590
What should I do?

762
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,559
Is it better if I just keep away?

763
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,459
- Na Yeon, do you know why? - Because I keep breaking things?

764
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,699
I think the cups might disappear. I'm just kidding.

765
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,469
The cup from yesterday was so ridiculous, right?

766
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,039
Hee Doo was running circles around you.

767
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,238
I know, that's why I ran away yesterday.

768
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,570
Right.

769
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,539
- It's like you were being scolded. - Right?

770
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,840
That's why we broke up.

771
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,510
This looks good.

772
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,119
Let's eat.

773
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,018
I don't know who made this, but it's so cute.

774
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,019
Agreed.

775
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,559
The scrambled eggs are pretty good.

776
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,889
It's not pretty good. It's so delicious.

777
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,860
It's so good.

778
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,570
- It's not bad, right? - Right.

779
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,769
Let's go to a bookstore.

780
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,239
- You don't have one in mind, right? - No.

781
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,639
What? Who cleaned everything up?

782
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,779
It was clean when I got here.

783
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,808
- Na Eon, you're going surfing? - Yes.

784
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,849
- Let's go together. - Do you want to join?

785
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,119
Do you want to join me and Tae I?

786
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,219
Hey, have some food.

787
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,460
There's some of that too.

788
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,199
- The low-calorie one. - Granola.

789
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,059
No, it's fine.

790
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,199
I'm going surfing today anyway.

791
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,268
- What? You're going surfing? - Yes.

792
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,769
- The three of you? - Yes.

793
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:37,739
I should go and get washed up.

794
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,079
- Let me know when we're leaving. - Okay.

00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,150
(Gyu Min goes back to his room.)

796
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:46,349
- What are you all up to? - We had breakfast.

797
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,179
- Did you sleep well? - Did you make this?

798
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,519
- Yes, have some. - I'm okay.

799
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,159
What are you going to do today?

800
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:56,189
I'm going to a glass studio today.

801
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,658
- Like making glassware? - Yes.

802
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,658
- Like dishes and cups? - Yes.

803
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,099
That sounds fun.

804
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,268
- Is this what you're wearing? - Why?

805
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,070
I'll tell Hae Eun about the dress code.

806
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,038
Why would you tell her?

807
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,339
Just because. She wouldn't know...

808
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,579
whether to wear a dress or sneakers.

809
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,179
- Oh, okay. - Yes.

810
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,550
I couldn't sleep much because I was nervous.

811
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,980
You were nervous? About the date?

812
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,820
- Just go have fun. - You could get nervous.

813
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,420
- You could. - Okay.

814
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,589
(Hee Doo gets up first.)

815
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,859
- It was fascinating. The similar... - Right.

816
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,329
Shall I go for a walk?

817
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,769
Are you going out?

818
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,840
(A walk to the sofa)

819
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,469
Yes, hello?

820
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,909
No, go away.

821
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,210
Don't.

822
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,118
- You look like I should tease you. - I said stop.

823
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,320
Okay, fine.

824
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,420
Do you feel like you need to do something?

825
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,920
Like what?

826
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,030
Do you feel like you need to be the MC or something?

827
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,959
- What's he saying? - What, MC?

828
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,260
What does he mean?

829
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,468
It's like, "Why are you trying to take care of everyone?"

830
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,529
I think that's right.

831
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,138
"Why must you look after everyone?" Something like that.

832
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,769
Oh, because she's talking to Hyun Gyu too.

833
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,808
- This is jealousy too. - But calling her an MC...

834
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:20,509
That's just Na Yeon's personality.

835
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,809
She's friendly and approaches people first.

836
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,908
- I know. - During the interview,

837
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,518
"Does he not like me as a person?" She said this a lot.

838
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,079
I think she definitely would feel that way.

839
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,819
He does like Na Yeon,

840
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,788
but it's like he wants to...

841
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:35,360
- change her to fit his style. - That's right.

842
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,659
- He scolds her. - You can't try to change someone.

843
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,598
- You have to accept that person. - Yes.

844
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,928
Right. Or you just break up, nice and clean.

845
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,928
- Right. - But they broke up and reunited.

846
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,339
And they're repeating the same thing.

847
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,400
That's the thing. He can't stop thinking about her.

848
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,239
Do you feel like you need to be the MC or something?

849
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,380
No.

850
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,139
What's that? That's not how it works.

851
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,349
No, that's not it.

852
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,179
I just want to be nice. That's all.

853
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,118
- You're doing that with everyone. - What?

854
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,489
You're going around...

855
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,030
- Can I not do that? - You can.

856
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,530
Why do you think negatively about that?

857
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,869
- I'm not being negative. - Really?

858
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,110
What is Ji Yeon doing today? Do you know?

859
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,210
Ask her.

860
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,179
I don't know where her room is.

861
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,309
Where's her room?

862
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,949
The pink one here?

863
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:40,619
- What? - Where is Ji Yeon's room?

864
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,400
Why won't you answer?

865
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,570
So annoying.

866
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,139
Bye, see you later.

867
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,969
Have fun.

868
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,380
He's so annoying.

869
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,219
- Hi. - Hey.

870
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,420
Hi.

871
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,090
Did you fight again? Why do you look pouty?

872
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,489
He's always just...

873
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,659
I find it fun and exciting to talk to Hee Doo.

874
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,570
But...

875
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,699
he's exactly the same as before.

876
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,170
Really?

877
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,670
- You must have a lot on your mind. - I really don't know.

878
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,138
Even just now, for example,

879
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,039
if I go like, "Give me some too. Give me."

880
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,309
He's like, "Just say it once."

881
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:39,879
Everything I say, he makes a comment like this.

882
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,979
So of course we end up fighting.

883
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,519
Of course you do.

884
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,320
But that kind of thing...

885
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,389
is really something you can't fix.

886
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,860
Yes, so I'm kind of...

887
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,530
- I see. - I'm annoyed.

888
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,069
You must be.

889
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,000
I like Hee Doo the most, but I hate him the most.

890
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:01,269
It's like a love-hate relationship.

891
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,070
I think I should keep my distance from him.

892
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,210
So annoying.

893
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:13,750
- Hi. - Hi.

894
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,550
Does anyone have any sunscreen?

895
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,388
I do, but it's for your face.

896
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,219
- Yes, I need it for my face. - Okay, do you want some?

897
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,860
Is this mild, perhaps?

898
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,400
I usually don't have skin trouble, no matter what product I use.

899
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,030
- Then maybe... - Do you have sensitive skin?

900
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,598
Yes.

901
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,329
Then I won't try it.

902
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,169
I think Gyu Min has some.

Hee Doo.

906

- Do you have some? - Yes.

907
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:42,809
- Is it mild? - Yes.

908
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,210
He's so picky about mild sunscreen.

909
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,949
He should use baby lotion.

910

(The sunscreen nomad settles down.)

911

Do I just put it on like this?

Yes.

913
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:04,130
The three people in front of the mirror are so funny.

914

Hey, Ji Soo! Where were you?

- What should we do? - I don't know.

922

But when will you be back?

923
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,059
I can finish surfing quickly.

924

Then should we eat dinner?

With Ji Soo and with Won Bin,

926
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,039
I gave each of them lots of advice.

927
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:44,868
I know their story, so I wanted to console them...

928
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,440
and tell them to cheer up.

929
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,110
I've been talking with them a lot, and we've gotten closer lately.

930
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,879
- Ten minutes on foot. - So we should walk.

931
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I got it.

932
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,150
Let me try those.

933
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,449
- These are cheap ones. - These are...

934
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,819
the trendy item these days.

935
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,389
- The cartoon character glasses. - They're really cheap.

936

Do they look good?

937
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,229
- They look okay. - I don't think they'd look okay.

938
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,429
Let me see.

939
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,599
- What? - It's not weird.

940
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,539
- It is. - They have a certain vibe.

941
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,599
- Na Eon, let's take some snacks. - Okay.

942
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,038
- Let's pack some fruit. - Grab some fruit.

943

Fruit. Take all the grapes.

944

These. The tomatoes.

945

(They raid the fridge.)

Oranges are a hassle.

00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,070
It's no joke.

957
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:50,309
It looks fun.

958
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:52,710
Where should we take pictures?

959
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,408
- Should we take one here? - Let's take one here.

960
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:55,539
Okay, let's do that.

961
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,980
Okay, I'll count to three.

962
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,849
I can't keep my eyes open.

963
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,380
Okay.

964
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,090
Wait, what?

965
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,659
I pressed it.

966
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,759
Let's do it again.

967
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,929
- This is... - Everyone, get closer.

968
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:14,030
Hold on. I can't see Tae I.

969
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:16,968
- Tae I, can you see? - Yes.

970
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,730
In 1, 2, 3.

971
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,469
Let's go.

972
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,440
Gosh, the weather is great.

973
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,550
- It's awesome. - "Hyung Bae."

974
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,780
"The weather today is great!"

975
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:34,780
"Hyung Bae."

976
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,090
Where are we going?

977
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,250
We need to keep going.

978
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,889
- Keep going? - Yes.

979
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,259
I think it's that place.

980
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,389
(They arrive at the surf shop.)

981
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,299
- Turn right. - I think it's here.

982
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,460
You're right.

983
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:50,868
(Bajeul Surfing Shop)

984
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,800
All right. Let's do some warmup exercises.

985
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,840
The men can wear those.

986
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,039
- Which way do we go? - Go straight.

987
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,019
- I want to get in the water fast. - It's no joke.

988
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,679
They're good.

989
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,049
Doesn't the breeze feel cool now?

990
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,489
The breeze is cool because we're by the ocean.

991
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,730
Jeju Island is so nice, isn't it?

992
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,429
It's my first time here.

993
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,300
- Aren't you really good? - I think...

994
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,670
- I have potential. I'm not good. - Really?

995
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,239
I'm not good, but I have potential.

996
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:29,909
Oh, it's nice.

997
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,619
She's good. How come she's so good?

998
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,960
I think she's the best out of everyone.

999
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,288
Na Eon.

1000
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,760
Na Eon was good.

1001
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,510
(Na Eon got pushed out on the waves and got stuck on a rock.)

1002
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,380
Na Eon doesn't know how to back out.

1003
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,388
If she falls in the water, she stops.

1004
00:46:58,389 --> 00:47:01,889
But she didn't stop and got stuck in the rocks.

1005
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,828
So the instructor said she couldn't get out on her own...

1006
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,530
because there are too many rocks.

1007
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,860
Someone had to go get her.

1008
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,300
(The waves are stronger.)

1009
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:18,110
(Just lie down.)

1010
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,449
Why did you come all the way out here?

1011
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:33,690
- Did you come to get me? - Yes.

1012
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,360
- Thank you. - It's dangerous.

1013
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,249
I put my foot down,

1014
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,349
and some rocks came up to my knees and were really sharp.

1015
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:02,750
So I had Na Eon go on the board,

1016
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,849
and I got on top of the rocks and pushed her when there were no waves.

1017
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,299
I was really thankful that he came to save me.

1018
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,900
Because I was so scared.

1019
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:19,499
There were so many rocks.

1020
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,610
And just putting my foot down, it hurt a lot.

1021
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,509
But I could see him coming from afar,

1022
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,238
and he joked and said, "Why did you come all the way here?"

1023
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,079
And he pushed me out. I was so grateful.

1024
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:32,749
I thought, "He's considerate."

1025
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,550
He's obviously pretty manly.

1026
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,249
- Did you sleep well? - I went to bed late.

1027
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,860
I had some more drinks with the others.

1028
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,360
Sweet guy.

1029
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:46,860
Thank you.

1030
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,260
We're going to a glass studio.

1031
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,339
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

1032
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,868
(Hae Eun and Hyun Gyu go on their date.)

1033
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:59,110
The weather is amazing. It's so nice.

1034
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:00,679
The weather is nice.

1035
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,780
The weather is great, and it really feels like Jeju.

1036
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,288
It's pretty here.

1037
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,259
I know. The sea...

1038
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,889
This is great. Thanks for getting me out of the house.

1039
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,759
I only got here yesterday, so things are still hectic.

1040
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,829
- Of course. - Even the names...

1041
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:24,299
- You don't know them all. - I don't.

1042
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,800
- Right. - You couldn't have memorized them.

1043
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,939
I immediately memorized yours though.

1044
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,139
- Really? - Yes.

1045
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:30,969
I really appreciate that.

1046
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,210
- Do you feel great as well? - I do.

1047
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:38,178
- I'm less tense now. - Really?

1048
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:39,649
It'll get easier for you.

1049
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,219
Too bad you won't have a lot of time.

1050
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,948
Still, I can make my week worthwhile.

1051
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:44,988
Of course.

1052
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:47,320
Are you attracted to someone that's the opposite...

1053
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,388
or someone you are like?

1054
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,359
I just like those who I'm fond of.

1055
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,859
Other things don't matter to me.

1056
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,699
No matter how they are like, you follow your heart.

1057
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:57,828
Right. Anyway, how tall are you?

1058
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,229
I'm 171cm. You?

1059
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,840
You're tall. I'm 183cm.

1060
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,369
- Why? - You're super tall.

1061
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,509
Maybe it's because you have a small face and head.

1062
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,308
I didn't think you'd be that tall.

1063
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,340
Really?

1064
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,249
You should be the model.

1065
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,678
- Me? Gosh. - Yes, you.

1066
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,319
I'm not tall enough to be a model though.

1067
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,190
- But you're also handsome. - Thanks.

1068
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,788
You should know that...

1069
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:23,960
I never hesitate to compliment people.

1070
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:25,860
You seem cheerful to me.

1071
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:28,428
- A little too much though. - But that's a good thing.

1072
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:30,670
You'll be flustered by my cheerfulness sometimes.

1073
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,239
The weather's great,

1074
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,869
- and so is everything else. - I know.

1075
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,050
- Is this the place? - Yes.

1076
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,780
(The two arrive at the glass studio.)

1077
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,920
Hello.

1078
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:54,789
(Bonk)

1079
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,230
"I'm here!"

1080
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,199
You'll be making a suncatcher doorbell.

1081
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,729
- I see. - Something like this.

1082
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,530
- This one's pretty. - I prefer that one too.

1083
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:07,268
- Should we make that? - This is the glass you'll be using.

1084
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:08,570
Please put on your goggles.

1085
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,509
Have you cut glass before?

1086
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,538
- No. - No.

1087
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:15,538
No, right? It's not something everyone gets around to do.

1088
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,578
They suit you.

1089
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,118
In front of you are two blades.

1090
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,919
- Right. - Let's try cutting the glass.

1091
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,849
Here. Just press down.

1092
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:28,218
Put some force into it. Good.

1093
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,760
- You're good at this. - Right.

1094
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,459
It's fun. I like how it snapped.

1095
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,959
- Right. - It was satisfying.

1096
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,859
Gently press down... Hold on a second.

1097
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,929
Why isn't it working?

1098
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,069
Okay. Let me see that.

1099
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,400
- I must be bad at this. - I'll give it a try.

1100
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,408
Until you can hear this sound.

1101
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,138
- I need to press down harder. - You should keep that in mind.

1102
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,408
Have it aligned and...

1103
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,808
Good. That's how you cut glass.

1104
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:50,948
(This time, they try cutting it a curved piece.)

1105
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,550
You're doing great.

1106
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,880
Now, press down on it.

1107
00:51:58,289 --> 00:51:59,349
Right.

1108
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,589
The scratch must be too shallow.

1109
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,459
Let me see that.

1110
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,259
I could tell you were putting force into it.

1111
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,299
All right.

1112
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,699
- If you're hot... - It's a little hot in here.

1113
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:12,369
- It's hot. - You should take off your cardigan.

1114
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,889
It's hot in here. I don't do well in the heat.

1115
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,089
He's not some innocent guy.

1116
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,319
Exactly. This guy has game.

1117
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,690
That reminded me of your catchphrase.

1118
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:38,029
"This guy has game."

1119
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,558
- This guy has game. - "He has game."

1120
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,169
The two of them together seems natural to me.

1121
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,899
Hyun Gyu doesn't seem like the younger guy.

1122
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,868
Rather than seeing her as an older woman,

1123
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,069
- he just sees her as a woman. - Right.

1124
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,408
That's why he doesn't seem like a younger guy.

1125
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:56,340
I feel like he will only go after one woman.

1126
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,209
He gives me that vibe.

1127
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,678
Na Eon said that about him.

1128
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,118
If he likes someone...

1129
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:04,118
- He drives toward that person. - Only his feelings matter.

1130
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,119
That's right.

1131
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,289
It's hot in here. I don't do well in the heat.

1132
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:11,989
Thanks.

1133
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:14,629
All right. Now, you can...

1134
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,569
- There you go. - You got it on your first try?

1135
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,570
It's so pretty.

1136
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,698
- You can get hurt, so... - Nicely done.

1137
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,099
- Smooth, right? - Yes, she's quite good at this.

1138
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,809
You'll now choose the glass you want for your project.

1139
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:28,709
All the glasses here are pretty.

1140
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,710
I know.

1141
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,110
Who knew they'd be a variety of them?

1142
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:34,980
- How about we match the colors? - Maybe we should.

1143
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,479
With the yellow moon.

1144
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,889
- Isn't it adorable? - It is.

1145
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,089
- Wouldn't this be nice as well? - That's pretty.

1146
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,289
- Shall we choose this one? - Yes.

1147
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,989
It's pretty. What a nice choice.

1148

(They put the goggles back on.)

1149
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,929
They suit you.

1150
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,769
Really? I'm actually worried.

1151
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,739
Nice! No way.

1152
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,820
Why can't I do this? I almost got the right shape.

1153
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,819
You're getting it done like nobody's business,

1154
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,090
while I'm struggling over here.

Please.

1157
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,530
Come on.

00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:25,570
(She sees it.)

1159
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,400
- It's adorable! - I'll try and make this.

1160
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,769
- My heart skipped a beat. - I'm loving your reaction.

1161
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:35,840
My heart skipped a beat. Who knew you were up to something cute?

1162
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,679
He was busy making something,

1163
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,750
and it turned out to be a heart.

1164
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,789
That was adorable. Don't you agree?

1165
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,789
I didn't expect that...

1166
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,260
which is why I thought it was so cute.

1167
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,529
I see you're making something special.

1168
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,159
Sweet, isn't he?

1169
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,760
Am I sweet?

1170
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,968
Maybe I should make a heart too. I'll make one for you as well.

1171
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:57,999
Give it a try.

1172
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,630
Mine will be bigger.

1173
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,738
Who cares? Let me see.

1174
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,380
I can't bring myself to open this.

1175
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,579
Go on.

1176
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,750
Seriously? It came out great.

1177
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:20,789
Here. Let me give it a try.

1178
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,130
That was so cool.

1179

(It is then soldered.)

1182

- This is fascinating. - I smell something delicious.

1183
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:45,550
It isn't edible though.

1184
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,079
But I want to eat it.

1185

(Their doorbell is complete.)

1186

It makes such a pretty sound.

(The hearts are also done.)

1188

This is great.

- Yes. - I have it.

1194

I'll bring mine, then.

This is great. I'm already having fun.

Hello.

I've been wanting to come to a place like this.

- Really? - Yes.

1210
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:16,738
- Philosophical writings. - This sounds like fun.

1211

"Why isn't there a first rain where there is a first snow?"

1212
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,440
- It's true. - The answer's simple.

1213
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,078
Why is that? Because it rains more often?

1214
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,650
Because it rains despite the season.

1215
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:29,349
I'm done talking to someone with an ENTJ personality.

This actually sounds interesting.

Let's read eight pages.

Right. It is.

1221

I love it. I can tick a box on my bucket list.

For the first time in Jeju,

I got to feel like I was on a trip.

I had a blast,

1225

and it felt like I was on vacation with my boyfriend.

1226
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:13,488
There were many cute cafes and pretty stores and spaces.

We took photos of each other as well.

My heart fluttered while I was with him...

to the point that it felt wrong.

1230

We're probably the couple who has been on the most dates.

I think so too.

Not really.

1235

You agree that I'm a blast to be with though.

I wonder how I look right now.

1242
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,828
I should keep my sunglasses on.

There's one last thing we have to do.

Let's play rock-paper-scissors, and the loser jumps into the water.

Let's play.

1246

It'll be you. You'll be the loser.

Why would you say that?

1248
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,868
What's so hard about going into the water?

1249
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:32,940
It'll be fun.

1250
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,780
Ready or not...

1251
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,138
Shall we have two people enter the water since it'll be lonely?

1252
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,250
- No, it's cold. Let's go back. - Hold her.

1253
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,280
Go ahead. You two go ahead.

1254
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,119
- Goodness. - That must hurt.

1255
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,630
No way.

- Shall we get going? - Yes.

I'll carry these, so can you get the slippers?

1259
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:01,739
Okay.

1260
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,809
Should I take this?

1261
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,710
- Tae I didn't have any strength. - That's not true.

1262
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,150
We... Something smells so good.

1263
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,389
Gosh, it smells so good.

1264
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,359
- Now... - This is...

1265
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,030
- We can eat a lot right now. - I'm starved.

1266
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:27,558
We should have sashimi since we're on Jeju Island.

1267
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:29,899
I can have the whole fish right now. I'm not even kidding.

1268
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,030
Me too. I'm so hungry.

Did you have fun?

They were going somewhere in a car.

You must've been hungry.

- Oh, thank you. - You stayed up late, right?

1302
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,109
I think I went to bed at 8am.

What did you guys talk about?

1304
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:52,908
We resolved all of our misunderstandings.

1305
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,279
- We could finally be open about it. - Oh, about your exes?

1306
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,690
Yes. We got to talk about the things we hadn't gotten to.

- Here. - Thank you.

You can have it. Thanks.

You said you liked salmon.

I did. What? You remembered that?

1311
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:18,340
You must be curious about the others' pre-show meetings.

- Aren't you? - Right.

1313
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,078
I'm most curious about yours.

I'm such a crybaby.

1316

They showed the clip of me crying,

1317

and I cried watching myself cry.

You should stop crying now.

1319
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:37,759
I even cried when someone told me to stop crying.

But I think I'll really stop crying now.

You should be smiling from now.

1322
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,769
Hae Eun told me that she had cried every single day.

1323
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,809
I thought it'd be heartbreaking to see someone so cheerful cry.

1324
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,149
She's a bright person,

1325
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,679
but the situation she's put in made her sad.

1326
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:03,449
I hoped she'd be happy...

01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,399
If you think about it, you can come to a place like this...

1429
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,940
- only if you're on a date. - Exactly.

1430
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,909
This is our first time talking by ourselves.

1431
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,739
I've never talked with Tae I much.

1432
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,709
Seriously... Why didn't you?

1433
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,808
It's because...

1434
01:07:57,809 --> 01:08:00,210
you always had dates with Ji Yeon.

1435
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,750
Also, it felt like your feelings were firm about her.

1436
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,919
- I couldn't get in between. - You thought too much...

1437
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,589
and didn't know what to do, but everyone had decided already.

1438
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,659
Exactly.

1439
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,759
I regret not deciding to go on a date with you...

1440
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,059
when I did at first.

1441
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,260
I shouldn't have changed my mind.

1442
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,869
I regret that a lot.

1443
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,209
I mostly talked with Ji Yeon,

1444
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,578
and we get along pretty well. Ji Yeon also thinks...

1445
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:28,979
Things could change.

1446
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,010
Of course. Things could change.

1447
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,250
That's why I asked you out for dinner.

1448
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:36,850
Right.

1449
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:42,260
I chose Hee Doo for the first date, but I decided not to do it.

1450
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:46,489
I thought it was just bad timing.

1451
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:49,059
I thought it was a shame and wondered,

1452
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,729
"What would it have been like if we had gone on a date?"

1453
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,569
But...

1454
01:08:57,539 --> 01:08:58,970
To be honest,

1455
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,180
there are so many things I must consider.

1456
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:06,649
There's my ex, Ji Yeon, and Won Bin as well.

1457
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,720
But I can't just disregard them.

1458
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:15,289
It's impossible not to care about them.

1459
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,630
It's not that you're not an option.

1460
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,060
I just can't disregard everything.

1461
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,770
If I didn't know about anything,

1462
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:31,010
I would have enjoyed my time here more.

1463
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,880
To consider Ji Soo as another option,

1464
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,949
I spent way too much time with Ji Yeon.

1465
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:40,680
And my relationship with Na Yeon is also complicated.

1466
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:44,550
I thought it was too late to get to learn about her as my date.

1467
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:46,789
There's no space for her in my heart.

1468
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,130
It's upsetting for me because...

1469
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:56,760
- we can't reset everything now. - Right.

1470
01:09:56,899 --> 01:09:58,069
As for Won Bin...

1471
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,800
I don't have feelings for him.

1472
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,239
You don't have to mind him.

1473
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,939
You're right. I don't have to mind him.

1474
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:12,278
When I was having a great time, going out on dates and all,

1475
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:14,079
he didn't mind me at all.

1476
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:16,979
But the moment I was struggling...

1477
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:19,890
and became depressed,

1478
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:23,960
he consoled me, and that's when he started having feelings for me.

1479
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,300
But you can't be sure if that feeling...

1480
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,329
is love or pity.

1481
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,939
He started having feelings for me because he was worried about me.

1482
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:37,340
It's different from liking me...

1483
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,810
- from the start. - That's true.

1484
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:45,079
So I don't intend to get back together with him at all.

1485
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,579
You realized it once again.

1486
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,750
That's not how I want to start a new relationship.

1487
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,288
You're right about that.

1488
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:56,520
- I think it's different. - I get you.

1489
01:10:58,659 --> 01:10:59,859
(Sighing)

1490
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,630
Gosh, seriously.

1491
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,770
Actually, I didn't know...

1492
01:11:06,869 --> 01:11:09,039
I'd have so many thoughts...

1493
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,340
and struggle so much on the show.

1494
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,039
But it's...

1495
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,710
It doesn't go the way you want it to.

1496
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,409
I had a counseling session with her,

1497
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:24,180
listened to her worries, and consoled her.

1498
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:26,989
I did those as her friend.

1499
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:31,760
It was our first time having a serious conversation,

1500
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:33,788
so it was meaningful.

1501
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:38,229
It appeased my disappointment.

1502
01:11:38,369 --> 01:11:42,369
We became friends who root for each other.

1503
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,210
I think this will become a nice memory.

1504
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,639
I seriously...

1505
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,149
want everyone to be happy.

1506
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:53,949
Me too. Let's be happy, everyone.

1507
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,550
It's already night.

1508
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:59,020
Sadly, we'll only get to see squid boats.

1509
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:00,289
I'm good with anything.

1510
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,488
(They've arrived at a cafe with an ocean view.)

1511
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:05,429
The ocean is beautiful.

1512
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,559
Do you always have iced Americano even when you're cold?

1513
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,629
- I always have hot coffee. - You do?

1514
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,759
I get cold easily,

1515
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,829
- so I always have hot coffee. - Got it.

1516
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:12,399
I'll be right back.

1517
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,028
Oh, right. You can keep this on.

1518
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,869
- No, it's okay. - I'll be inside anyway.

1519
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,739
I'm really fine.

1520
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,989
Hold on. Let me give this back to you.

1521
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,759
- I'm fine. - I'm really fine.

1522
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,818
I don't get cold easily.

1523
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:37,259
No. How can you not...

1524
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,288
- when it's this cold? - I really don't get cold easily.

1525
01:12:38,289 --> 01:12:39,390
- No, it's fine. - I really don't get cold easily.

1526
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,630
- I really don't. - Thank you.

1527
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,399
- Thank you. - I'm drinking cold coffee too.

1528
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:46,899
- Thank you. - I'm immune to cold weather.

1529
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,670
I want to take a walk there. It has no sand.

1530
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,779
This is nice.

1531
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,988
It's so nice.

1532
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,149
I want to ride a ship.

1533
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,890
That would be nice.

1534
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,159
I can see the stars too.

1535
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,430
I can see them.

1536
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,930
I can see them too!

1537
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,228
Do you have good sight?

1538
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:19,529
Yes, I do. Do you?

1539
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,829
I do too.

1540
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,438
Really? I can see really well.

1541
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,600
My vision is 20-15.

1542
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:24,938
- It's the same as mine. - You want a battle?

1543
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:25,939
Oh, really?

1544
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,710
- Want a battle? - Your vision is the same as mine.

1545
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,239
What's there to read?

1546
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,649
- Can you read that? - Which one?

1547
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:35,550
Can you see Seoul?

1548
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,090
- That's Seoul. - What?

1549
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,260
Just kidding.

1550
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,829
Do you want to take one with me?

1551
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,600
Have you ever met an older woman?

1552
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,439
Everyone I met was older except for Na Eon.

1553
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,409
She was born in 1994.

1554
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,840
- She's the same age as me. - You're right.

1555
01:14:03,409 --> 01:14:05,180
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1556
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:07,550
That's where you work.

1557
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,380
It's landing.

1558
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,618
- I saw so many planes today. - Right.

1559
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:15,260
It's because we're near the airport.

1560
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:20,028
I really wanted to see the ocean.

1561
01:14:20,029 --> 01:14:21,059
- My wish came true. - Really?

1562
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,560
- Thank you. - I'm glad.

1563
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,699
I had so much fun today.

1564
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,139
I know. Time went by so fast.

1565
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,670
My throat is hoarse now. Did you notice that?

1566
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:32,709
- Hold on, Hae Eun. - What is it?

1567
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:33,939
There's something on your face.

1568
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,909
- I thought it was a bug. - It was your hair.

1569
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,948
You're not the expressive type, right?

1570
01:14:40,949 --> 01:14:41,949
Sorry?

1571
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,520
You don't express your feelings a lot to your girlfriend, right?

1572
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,289
I do when I need to.

1573
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:49,460
- But that's rare, right? - That's true.

1574
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:51,858
- It makes me shy. - Right.

1575
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,960
- I can't be so expressive. - I thought so.

1576
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,800
- Why do you ask? - I just thought so.

1577
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,000
- What about you? - I express my feelings a lot.

1578
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,800
- You do? - I express them a lot.

1579
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:04,369
For the first time on this show, I was really happy...

1580
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:09,209
- without any worries. - I'm glad to hear that.

1581
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:11,449
I hope you'll spend the rest of your time here happily...

1582
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:13,979
without crying.

1583
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:17,220
Thank you.

01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,119
During the date I had with Hyun Gyu,

1585
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,859
I had a lot of fun, and my heart fluttered a lot too.

1586
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,829
He has every aspect that I like.

1587
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:29,500
But I wasn't sure if it was okay...

1588
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,899
for me to have a change of heart within a day.

1589
01:15:33,069 --> 01:15:34,369
It felt a little strange.

1590
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,398
- Yes, you can. - Yes, you can.

1591
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,538
- Of course you can. - You can.

1592
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,209
The characters in "Titanic" fell in love within three seconds.

1593
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,539
- They don't have much time. - You can.

1594
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:43,978
I was always at the house, waiting for them to come home.

1595
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:46,710
It's the first time for me to go home so late after a date.

1596
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,850
- It's parked. - Oh, here.

1597
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,720
(Handing the heart pieces that they made)

1598
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:54,589
- Amazing. - This is my big heart.

1599
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:55,720
I'll wear it later.

1600
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:57,489
- Isn't it heavy? - No, it's fine.

1601
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:03,029
- No one is here. - I know.

1602
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,229
- Aren't you tired? - Not at all.

1603
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,669
- You're not tired? - You are?

1604
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,869
- I'm not tired at all. - I'm seriously not tired.

1605
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,339
This place is so cute.

1606
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,369
(Sushimassim)

1607
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,909
All right.

1608
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:21,750
For the remaining five days...

1609
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:23,519
I hope I can just be happy during those five days.

1610
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,849
I was really happy today.

1611
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,850
Right. Me too.

1612
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:30,090
You express your feelings a lot.

1613
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,089
- Me? - "I was so happy today."

1614
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,359
- Really? - Things like that.

1615
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,399
Weren't you happy?

1616
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:37,130
I said, "Me too."

1617
01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:40,970
Is it hard to say that you're happy?

1618
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:43,199
Try it. "I'm happy."

1619
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:47,739
- You must find it hard. - No, I don't. It's easy.

1620
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,850
I'm happy.

1621
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,819
- This is... - So it's hard for you.

1622
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:58,689
Gosh, that looks good.

1623
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,789
Gosh, it's red-banded lobster sashimi.

1624
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,189
- Shall we try it? - Let's do that.

1625
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,090
Thank you for the food.

1626
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,399
How is it? Is it good?

1627
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,630
Of course it is.

1628
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:20,140
- Cheers. - I was so happy today.

1629
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:26,510
Honestly...

1630
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,949
When they joined us, they had a date before that.

1631
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,350
- Who are you talking about? - Hee Doo and Hae Eun.

1632
01:17:33,489 --> 01:17:34,890
They went to Lotte World.

1633
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:38,390
I was really jealous because it sounded like a fun date...

1634
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:41,130
even though I had a lot of fun with you on a date.

1635
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:42,858
I was really jealous.

1636
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,199
I resented her then.

1637
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,569
But I don't think that's the case for Hae Eun.

1638
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,569
I don't think she resented me.

1639
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,239
Not even once.

1640
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:54,339
I see. Is that so?

1641
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,739
I realized once again that she's a really nice person.

1642
01:17:58,649 --> 01:18:00,510
I feel like I'm the one hurting everyone.

1643
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:02,979
That's how I feel.

1644
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:05,520
But I bet everyone thinks similarly.

1645
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,960
You're not the only one who thinks that way.

1646
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:12,359
Once, I was drunk, so I hugged Tae I.

1647
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,389
He was making something for us in the kitchen,

1648
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,159
and I hugged him from behind while saying, "It looks good!"

1649
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:21,100
I realized that I was thoughtless.

1650
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,899
So it felt like Hee Doo was right about me.

1651
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,869
But...

1652
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:27,408
it's true...

1653
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:29,738
that you need to be more careful.

1654
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:32,049
I wasn't aware of it at all,

1655
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,710
and I hate myself for not being aware of it.

1656
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,919
- Don't blame yourself so much. - I don't know where I should stop.

1657
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,978
I thought that you'd think badly of me.

1658
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,050
- Of you? - Yes.

1659
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:43,220
If I thought you were bad, I wouldn't have sent you a message.

1660
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,789
I'm sure there are so many people who like you.

1661
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,130
That's so comforting. I'm about to cry.

1662
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:57,039
Hee Doo never said that to me.

1663
01:18:58,439 --> 01:18:59,469
I think when Hee Doo said that,

1664
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,239
- I know. - he was being considerate of you.

1665
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,579
Don't worry so much.

1666
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:06,310
You and Hee Doo are similar.

1667
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,619
As I felt that,

1668
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,420
you really made my heart flutter.

1669
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,359
- Today? - No, up until now.

1670
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,689
I like to feel that way.

1671
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:23,529
If I came on the show without my ex,

1672
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:27,029
I'd like you much more than I do now.

1673
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:31,909
- Thank you. - For what?

1674
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:34,880
Why did you send me a text message yesterday?

1675
01:19:35,079 --> 01:19:36,239
- Yesterday? - Yes.

1676
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,379
You knew that I wouldn't send you a message yesterday.

1677
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,249
- Right. - That's what's surprising.

1678
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:44,750
But that's not important to me now.

1679
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:47,219
I don't send you a message...

1680
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,390
hoping that you'd reply.

1681
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,220
I'm just doing as much as I can.

1682
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:58,270
I really don't know yet.

1683
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:01,600
I don't know what to do.

1684
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:04,368
I still have feelings for Hee Doo.

1685
01:20:04,369 --> 01:20:06,368
I don't know if I'm willing...

1686
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,738
to abandon those feelings to be with Gyu Min.

1687
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:11,649
However, Gyu Min is also a nice guy,

1688
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,579
so I might regret it.

1689
01:20:14,979 --> 01:20:18,749
I have to make a choice. I can't be indecisive all the time,

1690
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,220
but I can't decide my feelings right away.

1691
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,289
It makes me sad.

1692
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,559
I made an effort to stop someone from liking me,

1693
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,499
and I'm dedicated to only one person.

1694
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,139
However, Na Yeon hasn't decided between two people.

1695
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:38,310
It's impossible not to feel sad about it.

1696
01:20:38,409 --> 01:20:40,108
My stomach is about to explode.

1697
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:42,310
- It was so delicious. - It made me happy.

1698
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:44,509
- The sea is beautiful. - It's nice to be out.

1699
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:45,579
I'm glad that we came out.

1700
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,179
- It's We Love Coffee 3000. - Let's go.

1701
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,319
- Hello. - Hello.

1702
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:53,188
- Let's look around. - It's so nice here.

1703
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:54,189
(They take a table at the terrace.)

1704
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,920
What were we talking about?

1705
01:20:57,159 --> 01:21:00,358
I've been going on dates only with Tae I.

1706
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:02,959
This is our fourth day,

1707
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,698
and I've been going out only with Tae I.

1708
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,699
That's why I like him now.

1709
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:11,769
I didn't know that it'd be definite from the start.

1710
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:14,908
Of course. You've only been with one person.

1711
01:21:14,909 --> 01:21:18,249
What I want to say is that I'm curious about Gyu Min.

1712
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,879
We were talking about perfume.

1713
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,219
He found out that I'm interested in perfume...

1714
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,919
and that I like it...

1715
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,720
when I announced my plans for Jeju Island.

1716
01:21:27,989 --> 01:21:29,989
(The last day in Seoul, Terre)

1717
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,229
What's the perfume's brand?

1718
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:34,728
(Na Eon was interested in the perfume Gyu Min bought.)

1719
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:37,159
Do you want to...

1720
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,029
(Gyu Min came upstairs with the perfume.)

1721
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:41,600
(Knocking)

1722
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,499
May I come in?

1723
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,309
- Yes. - You may.

1724
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,310
What's that?

1725
01:21:46,311 --> 01:21:49,538
I wanted to unwrap it.

1726
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:52,179
- You said that you liked perfume. - Are you unboxing it?

1727
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,979
- I wanted to do it with you. - That sounds good.

1728
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:58,180
Are you unboxing it with me?

1729
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:01,049
- It's nothing big. - I liked its smell.

1730
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,318
- Have you smelled it? - We went there together.

1731
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:04,460
That's true.

1732
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,590
This is how it smells.

1733
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,828
- Wow. - It's slightly sweet.

1734
01:22:09,829 --> 01:22:11,769
- It's really sweet. - Is it sweet? Try it on.

1735
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:13,729
- Can I spray it on here? - Yes.

1736
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,339
Gyu Min came to our room...

1737
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,569
to unbox it with me.

1738
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:22,140
- With you? - In front of everyone.

1739
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,849
While Na Yeon and Hae Eun were there?

1740
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,549
Yes, everyone was there.

1741
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:29,318
Wait, this means green light.

1742
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,019
- Everyone was there. - It's a green light.

1743
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,349
What ended up happening was...

1744
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:35,619
that everyone was unboxing it on my bed.

1745
01:22:35,859 --> 01:22:39,089
Do you think that his intention was...

1746
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,929
to do it with you?

1747
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,499
I thought that he came to see Na Yeon,

1748
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,769
but he kept talking to me.

1749
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:48,269
Suddenly, Na Yeon looked very serious.

1750
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:50,500
This is entertaining.

1751
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,568
I was walking on eggshells.

1752
01:22:52,569 --> 01:22:55,879
In my opinion, Gyu Min is very careful.

1753
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,279
He's careful about everything that he does.

1754
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,749
Once, I was disappointed by Gyu Min...

1755
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,818
because he hides his feelings too much.

1756
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:04,179
Now that I think about it,

1757
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,920
he was being sensible and careful.

1758
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:09,719
- However... - And that's what he did?

1759
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,318
He wouldn't do that to provoke.

1760
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,259
- Really? - You know what I mean?

1761
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,788
- This is fun. - I like people...

1762
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,158
who are mature and whom I can learn from.

1763
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,170
Gyu Min is the maturest among all of us.

1764
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,898
- But Hae Eun... - You don't have much time.

1765
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:23,238
You have to move quickly.

1766
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:25,868
Honestly, I hope that things go well between you and Tae I.

1767
01:23:25,869 --> 01:23:27,970
I wouldn't lie. You know what I'm saying?

1768
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,640
- Okay, I got it. - Among the four men,

1769
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,049
- Gyu Min is the most careful, - I agree.

1770
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,649
the most serious, and maturest.

1771
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,050
I think so too.

1772
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:38,118
After our conversation,

1773
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:39,988
think about what you want.

1774
01:23:39,989 --> 01:23:43,419
Since you're smart, think about it fast and go with it.

1775
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,420
Go with it.

1776
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,659
I have enough problems of my own.

1777
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:49,399
Suddenly, this came to my mind.

1778
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,698
Gyu Min doesn't say anything just to leave room for confusion.

1779
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:55,898
- He won't do anything... - Right.

1780
01:23:55,899 --> 01:23:57,099
that makes you misunderstand.

1781
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:00,408
I told you that he sat next to me yesterday...

1782
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:01,509
for the first time.

1783
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,079
We were talking, and he said that I was very cute.

1784
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:08,579
(Last night)

1785
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:10,618
Do you not drink alcohol at all?

1786
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:12,749
When I usually hang out with my friends?

1787
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,948
- No. - Really?

1788
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:16,189
Yes, I just drink coffee.

1789
01:24:16,289 --> 01:24:17,489
That's very cute.

1790
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:21,559
- He said, "That's very cute." - It's a green light indeed.

1791
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,430
- Is it? - It's confirmed.

1792
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:27,068
You don't have much time. We only have six days left.

1793
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:29,340
- Is that so? - You should be forward with him.

1794
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:32,470
How many hearts has Gyu Min stolen?

1795
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:35,279
Oh, my goodness.

1796
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,819
(Won Bin and Hae Eun came to the rooftop terrace.)

1797
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,020
This is where the new cafe is.

1798
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:48,859
- Let's sit here. - Okay.

1799
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,119
- We can't see the sea from here. - Weren't you hot?

1800
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:52,459
Aren't you having a hard time too?

1801
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:56,930
I'm figuring out what kind of state I am in.

1802
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,329
When we went out on a date,

1803
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:04,599
you said that you're happy and that you're over her.

1804
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,970
- That's what I thought, but... - Really?

1805
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:11,379
When I thought about it,

1806
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:14,680
I realized that I covered up my feelings for her.

1807
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:17,648
I covered them up and lied to myself.

1808
01:25:17,649 --> 01:25:19,049
Gosh, really?

1809
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:22,158
I hadn't seen her for three years.

1810
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,219
I didn't want to hear anything about her.

1811
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,060
I wanted to avoid her because I was afraid...

1812
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,960
of having feelings for her again.

1813
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:35,000
When did you realize that?

1814
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,839
- That's... - While you were going out on dates?

1815
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,909
I realized that I wasn't over her at all,

1816
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:44,140
but it made her feel uncomfortable.

1817
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:47,310
I can totally understand that.

1818
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,818
It can't be helped.

1819
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:52,890
It's cruel that when you face your honest feelings,

1820
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:59,090
- it really hurts. - Yes, it's cruel.

1821
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,129
I might have matured in other ways...

1822
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,770
during the process.

1823
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:08,000
However, I haven't changed when it comes to relationships.

1824
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,568
I can't go farther with anyone.

1825
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:11,670
Right.

1826
01:26:11,869 --> 01:26:14,839
That's why this happened, and I feel sad.

1827
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,509
It's impossible not to have feelings for your ex again.

1828
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:20,710
- That's what I think. - Right.

1829
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,880
Love is difficult.

1830
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,750
It can't be helped. We can't control our feelings.

1831
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:29,159
Right, that's how you feel.

1832
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,389
I hope that it will be concluded before you leave.

1833
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:34,228
I hope that we'll reach a conclusion.

1834
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:36,659
Right. I hope that things go well for you from now on.

1835
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,329
Really? I'm going to cry again.

1836
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:42,970
I'm so grateful and moved that I'll cry.

1837
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,710
Since you're a good person,

1838
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,470
you'll meet someone nice.

1839
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:52,449
You could meet someone who's better than Gyu Min.

1840
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:54,409
Thank you so much.

1841
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:59,749
The time that you spent with Gyu Min...

1842
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:01,618
will help you...

1843
01:27:01,619 --> 01:27:03,519
find someone better.

1844
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,720
You're right.

1845
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,189
You're my healer.

1846
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,829
You'll also be happy because you're a good person.

1847
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:18,710
If I get a chance, I want to apologize and tell her.

1848
01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:21,170
Starting tomorrow, I'll smile more...

1849
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,679
and do more things that I can.

1850
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,408
Let's hang out again later.

1851
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:27,050
- Yes, let's do that. - Let's go somewhere fun.

1852
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,380
I'll propose something to you.

1853
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,118
That would be great. Thank you.

1854
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:32,689
Somewhere... Sure.

1855
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,989
Let's stay strong.

1856
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:37,090
- Stay strong. - We'll do well.

1857
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:40,430
- Let's go. - We can do it.

1858
01:27:40,859 --> 01:27:43,358
- We can do it. - Shall we go?

1859
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:44,460
Let's go.

1860
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,099
Is everyone here? It looks like there are more cars.

1861
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,699
- No, it hasn't changed. - Really?

1862
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,199
Gyu Min's car isn't here yet.

1863
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:53,568
Let's find out what everyone is up to.

1864
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,538
Shall we go knock on their doors?

1865
01:27:55,539 --> 01:27:57,439
Yes, let's start with the last room.

1866
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:00,079
(Investigating the current situation of the participants)

1867
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:02,550
Whose room is this?

1868
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,778
- Hello? - Yes?

1869
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,689
- What are you doing? - Hello.

1870
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:10,220
- I was resting. - Why are you talking like that?

1871
01:28:10,989 --> 01:28:12,759
Don't say hello that way.

1872
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,459
- Okay. - Were you sleeping?

1873
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,000
No, I just came back.

1874
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,300
- What were you doing? - I was on a date.

1875
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,429
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

1876
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,340
- What did you do? - We went to a glass workshop.

1877
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,499
- We made this. - Did you make that?

1878
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,970
- Yes. - It's cute.

1879
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:29,278
What did you do? Did you go surfing?

1880
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:31,439
You look very tired. What are you going to do now?

1881
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,509
- We don't know. - We ordered some chicken.

1882
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:34,578
Have you eaten yet?

1883
01:28:34,579 --> 01:28:35,818
I'll eat some.

1884
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:37,779
- Come out later. - I'll be out in ten minutes.

1885
01:28:38,449 --> 01:28:40,420
- They're here. - You're right.

1886
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,920
- Ji Soo. - I bet she's with Ji Yeon.

1887
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:45,020
Show me your face.

1888
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:47,789
- You look completely fine. - I know.

1889
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,728
Hey, you.

1890
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:52,629
- Hey, girl. - Hey, you.

1891
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,099
- Where's the chicken? - What are you doing?

1892
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,500
- It's not here yet. - It'll be here soon.

1893
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:59,608
- That was a full day. - We were so busy today.

Why are you doing that?

1896

Am I someone who doesn't organize?

1897

- Am I someone who doesn't organize? - What?

Let's share it.

1908
01:29:46,119 --> 01:29:47,349
We need it.

1909
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,960
Isn't my room really clean?

1910
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,889
- Hey. - What?

1911
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,890
- Is there a bug? - Stay still.

1912
01:29:54,329 --> 01:29:55,430
What is it?

1913
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,158
- What's in your hair? - What is it?

1914
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:59,368
- It looks like bird poop. - Really?

1915
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:00,828
- I'm not kidding. - Are you serious?

1916
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,139
- Yes. - Let's see. I should wash my hair.

1917
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,868
- Assorted chicken. - I can use my credit card.

- Hee Doo. - Really?

01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:08,640
Is it gone?

1920
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,738
I'll get going. I'm going to lie down.

1921
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,448
- I'm going to read. - Okay.

1922
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,148
- See you later. - Go and lie down. Thank you.

1923
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:15,180
Sure.

1924
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:17,750
My head hurts.

1925
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:28,899
Her behavior isn't consistent with her words.

1926
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:31,999
She told me not to push her away,

1927
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,629
so I didn't want to see her coming home late...

1928
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,840
from a date.

1929
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:40,509
Whatever she had promised...

1930
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:42,108
to Gyu Min,

1931
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:44,310
based on what I saw,

1932
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:46,149
I wasn't pleased.

1933
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,419
Who wants some cheese? It's really good.

1934
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:54,188
- Me. - I'll take a break.

1935
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:55,489
Aren't you hungry?

1936
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:57,589
I'm really... Why aren't I hungry?

1937
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,390
- What did you eat today? - Today?

1938
01:30:59,529 --> 01:31:01,359
We had something called...

1939
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,429
- Sous-vide. - sous-vide.

1940
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:04,430
- Pork? - Korean beef.

1941
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:05,599
- Korean beef. - Beef?

1942
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,229
- Was it good? - It was delicious.

1943
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,369
We went to a glass workshop today and made this.

1944
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,769
Everyone, look what I made.

1945
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,809
It looks so pretty.

1946
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:16,840
- We went to a glass workshop. - Is it a mobile?

1947
01:31:16,909 --> 01:31:18,038
You hang it by the door.

1948
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,779
What is it called?

1949
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,209
A bell?

1950
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:23,179
It's a bell, but it's something that you hang.

1951
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,180
Doorbell?

1952
01:31:24,181 --> 01:31:25,219
It has two syllables.

1953
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,349
Ding-dong?

1954
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,590
Let's call it ding-dong.

1955
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,219
What is it?

1956
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,688
(It's your 2nd day on Jeju. Who has made your heart flutter?)

1962
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,079

I didn't expect it to be so much fun, but it was.

1966
01:32:07,859 --> 01:32:08,898
What?

1967
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:10,259
You expected it to be boring?

1968
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,999
I can admit it now. I didn't expect it to be fun.

1969
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,329
I'm not good at making things, so I thought it'd be boring.

1970
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:15,869
But it was so much fun.

1971
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:17,568
I concentrated a lot on making it.

1972
01:32:17,569 --> 01:32:19,868
This is what I made...

1973
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:21,609
for Hyun Gyu.

1974
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:24,839
- You made it so well. - Right?

1975
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,379
- You can even sell it. - A moment ago,

1976
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,648
I asked him jokingly if it came off.

1977
01:32:30,649 --> 01:32:32,488
- Then he said, "No way." - Really?

1978
01:32:32,489 --> 01:32:34,090
You should've told her that I made it.

1979
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:37,519
Why did you make it heart-shaped?

1980
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,188
- I made it so well. - She's pretending not to hear you.

1981
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:41,260
Why did you make it heart-shaped?

1982
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,060
It's because...

1983
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,898
I was making what was assigned,

1984
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:48,300
but Hyun Gyu was making a heart.

1985
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,439
- It was for her. - For me.

1986
01:32:50,869 --> 01:32:52,469
- He was making it. - Did he give it to you?

1987
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:53,739
Of course. I have it.

1988
01:32:53,869 --> 01:32:56,139
- Where is it? - Here's mine.

1989
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,379
- It's so cute. - It's smaller.

1990
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,679
- I had more feelings for him. - It's smaller.

1991
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,349
- It's small and full. - Right.

1992
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:02,449
- You had more feelings? - My heart for him was bigger.

1993
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:06,318
- Now, I see what it is. - It's also made of glass.

1994
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:07,519
They probably made it over there.

1995
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,720
Really? This is made with...

1996
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:12,989
- the same principle. - This?

1997
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,288
- The glass is... - It was soldered.

1998
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:16,930
- Soldered? - I soldered.

1999
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,770
Is it soldered on top of the glass?

2000
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:23,640

01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:53,489
"It's possible to pick the same person,"

2212
01:45:53,949 --> 01:45:57,060
"but you can't pick someone that he failed to match with."

2213
01:45:58,189 --> 01:46:00,060
"Failed to match with"?

2214
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:01,829
I don't understand the last part.

2215
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,630
If you can't pick anyone, your ex will stay home.

2216
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,898
Do I get two choices,

2217
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:08,499
or can we pick the same person?

2218
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,538
It's possible that two of us go on a date...

2219
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:12,840
- Okay. - with Na Eon.

2220
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:14,908
- Shall we go and discuss? - Yes.

2221
01:46:14,909 --> 01:46:16,739
Shall we meet here at 35 minutes?

2222
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,938
Let's meet at 30 minutes.

2223
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:21,050
- Thirty minutes? - We can come earlier.

2224
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:23,618
I don't think we need such a long time.

2225
01:46:23,619 --> 01:46:25,720
Just come back when you've decided.

2226
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:33,430
(To pick their ex's date, they have a talk with their ex.)

2227
01:46:33,489 --> 01:46:35,358
(Ji Yeon and Tae I)

2228
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:36,829
I haven't unpacked yet.

2229
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:40,069
Please excuse me.

2230
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:46,469
It's a bit difficult to discuss it.

2231
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:47,970
We're not picking each other's date.

2232
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:49,979
We have to pick one person.

2233
01:46:50,979 --> 01:46:53,350
(Na Eon and Hyun Gyu)

2234
01:46:54,149 --> 01:46:56,680
You have to pick my date, right?

2235
01:46:57,149 --> 01:46:58,779
What's wrong with you? Come here.

2236
01:47:00,149 --> 01:47:01,750
You look terrible.

2237
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,960
- Thank you. - Show me your face.

2238
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,890
Don't split your hair like this.

2239
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:08,859
Even if your scar shows...

2240
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:11,359
You should groom yourself more.

2241
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,470
You're making me lose my dignity.

2242
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,939
(Na Yeon and Hee Doo)

2243
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:19,199
We don't have to go inside.

2244
01:47:19,369 --> 01:47:20,509
But it's cold.

2245
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:22,010
- Let's just go back. - Why?

2246
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:24,279
Let's pick someone that we want for each other.

2247
01:47:24,609 --> 01:47:26,239
- Really? Let's stay here. - Yes.

2248
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:28,309
What?

2249
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:31,319
Decide fast so that I can sleep.

2250
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:33,550
I haven't decided.

2251
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:36,020
- What? - I haven't picked your date yet.

2252
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:39,260
Let's pick someone that we want.

2253
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:40,488
Who we want?

2254
01:47:40,489 --> 01:47:42,289
You can't pick my date.

2255
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:45,028
- Why not? - Only women get to pick.

2256
01:47:45,029 --> 01:47:46,460
- Only men go on a date? - Yes.

2257
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,000
I'll go on a date with Ji Yeon.

2258
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:53,340
- But I get to choose. - Right.

2259
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:55,670
I'd have picked Gyu Min for you.

2260
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,409
- Really? - Yes.

2261
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:05,079
You've already made up your mind, I see.

2262
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,420
I didn't right away. I thought about it when they told us.

2263
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:11,059
Why did you pick Ji Yeon? I want to hear your reason.

2264
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:13,329
That way, I can decide.

2265
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:15,760
I asked you to come in so that we could talk about this.

2266
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:16,959
Why are you leaving?

2267
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,829
It's too hot. Let's turn on the air conditioner.

2268
01:48:20,069 --> 01:48:22,100
Do you not want to talk to me?

2269
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:26,640
It's not like that. I'm just tired.

2270
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:30,939
(Ji Soo and Won Bin)

2271
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:34,909
Who do you want to go with?

2272
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:37,550
I don't know.

2273
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:40,850
Who do you want me to go with?

2274
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:43,489
Whoever you want.

(Won Bin's throat isn't feeling well.)

(Hae Eun and Gyu Min)

2277
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:55,630
(Gyu Min left for a moment.)

2278
01:49:43,149 --> 01:49:44,420
Let's talk.

2279
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,689
What? Again?

2280
01:49:53,729 --> 01:49:55,489
It seemed like you had fun today.

2281
01:49:59,329 --> 01:50:00,929
- Why did you come back so late? - What?

2282
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:01,930
Why did you come back so late?

2283
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:04,769
I was on a date. Well, it wasn't exactly a date.

2284
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:07,868
We were all going to go out together,

2285
01:50:07,869 --> 01:50:09,408
but everyone else suddenly had other plans,

2286
01:50:09,409 --> 01:50:11,778
so the two of us ended up going out alone.

2287
01:50:11,779 --> 01:50:13,550
I guess things just happened that way.

2288
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:18,449
Is there someone you want to go on a date with?

2289
01:50:19,649 --> 01:50:22,720
I had a lot of fun today,

2290
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:24,760
so I'd like to do it again with Na Yeon.

2291
01:50:27,729 --> 01:50:31,000
You want to go on another date with Na Yeon because today was so fun?

2292
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:35,670
Yes. That'd be nice. You know.

2293
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,340
- Know what? - What?

2294
01:50:40,939 --> 01:50:41,969
You know.

2295
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,739
You guys must've talked in your room.

2296
01:50:51,319 --> 01:50:53,119
I can't let you do that.

2297
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:55,449
Why not?

2298
01:50:56,890 --> 01:51:00,060
I get to choose who you go on a date with.

2299
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:01,829
Right?

2300
01:51:02,829 --> 01:51:06,060
Who are you least interested in?

2301
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:07,469
The least?

2302
01:51:07,470 --> 01:51:10,100
I'm least interested in Na Yeon.

2303
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:14,140
I'm least interested in meeting her.

2304
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,970
It sounds terrible to go on a date with her.

2305
01:51:20,649 --> 01:51:22,079
Who do you want me to go on a date with?

2306
01:51:23,949 --> 01:51:25,750
Whoever you want.

2307
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,989
Then this isn't a discussion.

2308
01:51:28,649 --> 01:51:31,520
I'm asking for your opinion. That's what a discussion is.

2309
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,659
Who do you think I want to go on a date with?

2310
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,560
Isn't it Na Eon?

2311
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:38,800
You're right. She's the only one.

2312
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:41,869
What if you had the option of choosing me?

2313
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,538
You?

2314
01:51:43,539 --> 01:51:45,399
Yes. What if people were allowed to choose their exes?

2315
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:49,038
- Oh, my. - Here they go again.

2316
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:53,648
"There are only four women in the world."

2317
01:51:53,649 --> 01:51:54,850
"Who will you choose?"

2318
01:51:55,479 --> 01:51:58,680
- She's just asking, "What if?" - Here she goes again.

2319
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:00,920
She's so cute.

2320
01:52:01,149 --> 01:52:03,119
What if people were allowed to choose their exes?

2321
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:09,060
Then there's nothing to discuss,

2322
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:10,460
so no comment.

2323
01:52:12,130 --> 01:52:13,259
It's the last day.

2324
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,898
You can go on a date with any of us.

2325
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:16,899
Who would you choose?

2326
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:20,239
The last day? If it's the last day, I can't tell you.

2327
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:27,609
Why? Did you think I would tell you?

2328
01:52:28,279 --> 01:52:31,819
No way. That's no fun.

2329
01:52:34,819 --> 01:52:37,560
Is there someone...

2330
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,189
you would like me to go on a date with?

2331
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,460
It should be someone you like.

2332
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:46,029
But you know everything.

2333
01:52:47,729 --> 01:52:49,069
You do too.

2334
01:52:52,569 --> 01:52:53,840
Let me know when you decide.

2335
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:57,639
I wanted to hear your opinion.

2336
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,579
And I'm telling you that I don't have one.

2337
01:52:59,979 --> 01:53:03,010
Do you just not want to get involved?

2338
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:05,350
Just do what you want.

2339
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:14,689
Do you have time today?

2340
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,800
Time for what?

2341
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:23,270
Time for me to apologize to you.

2342
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,679
Let me know if you don't want to have that kind of conversation.

2343
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,909
I won't say anything.

2344
01:53:35,409 --> 01:53:39,750
Would it be possible to spend some time together?

2345
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:42,948
It's too late.

2346
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:45,890
The time? Okay.

2347
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:55,170
Why do you want to choose Ji Yeon?

2348
01:53:56,470 --> 01:53:58,439
- What? - Why do you want to choose Ji Yeon?

2349
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:02,239
I'll decide after you tell me.

2350
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:04,109
I want to think about it.

2351
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:07,578
- Is it important? - Yes.

2352
01:54:07,579 --> 01:54:08,579
Why?

2353
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:11,750
I need to know. I need to know what you're feeling.

2354
01:54:12,579 --> 01:54:14,419
It's your decision. You decide.

2355
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:15,519
I'll decide,

2356
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,259
but you said you chose Ji Yeon right away.

2357
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:21,460
There must be a reason why.

2358
01:54:21,689 --> 01:54:22,689
There is a reason,

2359
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:25,698
but I'm saying that you should just choose for me.

2360
01:54:25,699 --> 01:54:26,970
That's how I feel.

2361
01:54:27,229 --> 01:54:29,068
I want to hear your reason first.

2362
01:54:29,069 --> 01:54:32,499
I just want you to decide for me.

2363
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:35,569
But I already heard your opinion.

2364
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:37,179
I'll go with it.

2365
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,538
So you want me to decide?

2366
01:54:38,539 --> 01:54:41,879
Just tell me your reason.

2367
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,578
- Tell me what you're feeling. - What are you saying?

2368
01:54:43,579 --> 01:54:45,379
Just tell me what you're feeling.

2369
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,889
So do you want me to decide? Or will you decide for me?

2370
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:50,289
- I'll decide for you. - Then you decide.

2371
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,089
That's not what I'm saying.

2372
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:55,228
It's not about who decides.

2373
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:56,488
Why are we here?

2374
01:54:56,489 --> 01:54:58,759
- To talk about this kind of thing. - We came here to have a discussion.

2375
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,728
If we were just going to choose who gets to decide,

2376
01:55:00,729 --> 01:55:03,770
we could've just decided over there without having a discussion.

2377
01:55:03,869 --> 01:55:06,439
We're having a discussion right now, Na Yeon.

2378
01:55:07,739 --> 01:55:10,069
- What? - Let's discuss first.

2379
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,038
- Hae Eun? - Yes.

2380
01:55:12,039 --> 01:55:15,349
Sit down. I was going back and forth...

2381
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:17,648
- because with Hae Eun, - But I...

2382
01:55:17,649 --> 01:55:18,649
You go first.

2383
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,049
- Did you see her face? - Why?

2384
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:22,589
- She looked upset. - She did?

2385
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:23,590
Yes.

2386
01:55:23,689 --> 01:55:27,828
Hae Eun likes her ex too much.

2387
01:55:27,829 --> 01:55:29,529
Yes. It seemed like it.

2388
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:32,100
I texted her, but it wouldn't send.

2389
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:33,770
What do you mean it wouldn't send?

2390
01:55:35,069 --> 01:55:36,699
I don't think she got it.

2391
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:39,939
She did. She just didn't respond.

2392
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:41,510
I got something from her,

2393
01:55:41,939 --> 01:55:44,209
but she said she didn't get my text.

2394
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,738
She kept looking at her phone, all confused.

2395
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:48,078
- Was it late? - But she was tearing up...

2396
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:50,349
seeing them next to us...

2397
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:52,349
looking at the pictures they took together.

2398
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:54,089
The pictures they took together? What are you talking about?

2399
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:57,319
- Hae Eun's ex-boyfriend? - Sit comfortably.

2400
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:00,260
So...

2401
01:56:00,261 --> 01:56:02,889
- Hae Eun likes Gyu Min so much. - I know.

2402
01:56:02,890 --> 01:56:05,600
- Did you have fun today? - Yes, I did.

2403
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,029
Why aren't you listening to me?

2404
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:12,640
She totally has feelings left for him,

2405
01:56:13,069 --> 01:56:16,568
but he doesn't seem interested in her at all.

2406
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:19,408
I think he's purposefully being colder towards her...

2407
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:22,209
so that he doesn't hurt her. He doesn't want to get her hopes up.

2408
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:24,778
So Hae Eun's really hurt...

2409
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:26,050
She must be crying right now.

2410
01:56:32,659 --> 01:56:33,760
But...

2411
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:38,659
you must be able to tell.

2412
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:47,470
To be honest,

2413
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:50,380
you're seeing everything, right?

2414
01:56:50,579 --> 01:56:52,539
You two share a room,

2415
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:56,010
and you can tell by seeing us talk to each other...

2416
01:56:56,609 --> 01:56:58,819
going on dates.

2417
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:02,890
I have to see it again.

2418
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:07,789
- I... - I have to send you off again.

2419
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:10,500
I have to tell you to go have fun.

2420
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:13,899
Do you think you'd feel better if I were to go with someone else?

2421
01:57:15,069 --> 01:57:16,228
No, right?

2422
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:18,369
If you send me off with someone else...

2423
01:57:19,069 --> 01:57:22,210
I can already see where your heart is headed,

2424
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:25,009
so I want to avoid you going there.

2425
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:27,550
Don't you think I'd be upset...

2426
01:57:27,979 --> 01:57:29,750
if you were to do that?

2427
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,430
But I can't let you go like that.

2428
01:57:42,090 --> 01:57:45,100
Do you want to do so...

2429
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:49,170
even if I'd resent you for it?

2430
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:53,399
No, right?

2431
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:14,789
But if you'd rather die...

2432
01:58:16,029 --> 01:58:18,460
than see that,

2433
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:23,470
if you'd be that upset by seeing that happen,

2434
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:28,210
you can choose someone else.

2435
01:58:28,369 --> 01:58:30,840
I'll understand.

2436
01:58:34,449 --> 01:58:35,909
But I want you to know...

2437
01:58:36,979 --> 01:58:38,749
that I could resent...

2438
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:41,420
that choice.

2439
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:44,818
You resent me anyway.

2440
01:58:44,819 --> 01:58:46,158
I don't.

2441
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,329
You don't have feelings for me anyway.

2442
01:58:48,529 --> 01:58:50,189
But I don't resent you.

2443
01:58:52,329 --> 01:58:54,600
You're strongly telling me...

2444
01:58:55,399 --> 01:58:58,539
that you want to go on a date with Na Yeon.

2445
01:58:58,800 --> 01:58:59,970
Do you really like her that much?

2446
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:03,939
I think you already knew from the beginning.

2447
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:08,179
- You made sure that I knew. - Yes. I'm sure you could tell.

2448
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:11,050
I had to send you two off today.

2449
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,119
You already feel so cold and distant now.

2450
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:24,399
You're saying that you'll resent me more if I make that decision, right?

2451
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:27,970
Personally, I don't think I'm being that cold and distant.

2452
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:32,269
I don't want to hurt anymore.

2453
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:34,738
It hurt when I sent you off on a date.

2454
01:59:34,739 --> 01:59:36,339
It hurt when you two were out together.

2455
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:39,979
You kept talking about the date in front of me after you got back.

2456
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:41,810
How do you expect me...

2457
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:45,250
to choose to go through that again?

2458
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:48,489
Whatever it is, it's your choice.

2459
01:59:49,789 --> 01:59:52,090
It's up to you what happens.

2460
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:54,129
It's a threat. A semi-threat.

2461
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:56,029
- It's not a threat. - Yes, it is.

2462
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:58,430
I'm just telling you to choose.

2463
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:04,339
I don't think what I choose now...

2464
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:06,500
will affect your final decision,

2465
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11,779
but I still can't stand it.

2466
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:16,778
That's why I'm always crying.

2467
02:00:16,779 --> 02:00:19,880
How can I make myself go through that again?

2468
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,329
You're so harsh.

2469
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:34,500
There's nothing more I can do for you at this point.

2470
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,439
You're not my girlfriend.

2471
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:48,579
Who haven't you gone on a date with?

2472
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:52,279
Who would you choose between Ji Yeon and Na Eon?

2473
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:55,689
If you want to choose between those two,

2474
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:58,260
I'll talk to Na Eon.

2475
02:00:58,619 --> 02:00:59,789
Okay.

2476
02:01:00,729 --> 02:01:03,060
If that makes you feel better, go ahead.

2477
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:05,260
I will.

2478
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:07,970
I'm going to, so don't worry.

2479
02:01:16,039 --> 02:01:17,340
Be careful.

2480
02:01:22,149 --> 02:01:23,210
Be careful.

2481
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:26,549
- Tae I. - Yes?

2482
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:27,649
I've...

2483
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:30,818
made up my mind.

2484
02:01:30,819 --> 02:01:31,890
What?

2485
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:34,859
What did you say?

2486
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,799
"The loveliest person in my eyes."

2487
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,529
I don't think my feelings from the day I sent this text...

2488
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:46,600
will change until the end.

2489
02:01:48,939 --> 02:01:49,970
Why not?

2490
02:01:52,079 --> 02:01:53,380
I just think so.

2491
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,050
There's no reason.

2492
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:05,559
So you can like someone else.

2493
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:07,659
I'm just going to think whatever I want.

2494
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:21,340
There's something I don't like about each person, but not you.

2495
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,310
That's good.

2496
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:27,948
Do you want to decide?

2497
02:02:27,949 --> 02:02:29,879
Or are you asking me who I want to choose...

2498
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:30,978
so that you can pick that person for me?

2499
02:02:30,979 --> 02:02:33,318
I want to hear your thoughts. I'll make the final decision.

2500
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:35,788
If you picked Ji Yeon for no particular reason,

2501
02:02:35,789 --> 02:02:37,858
then I'm going to choose whoever I want for you.

2502
02:02:37,859 --> 02:02:40,359
If you are serious about Ji Yeon,

2503
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,960
I'll pick Ji Yeon.

2504
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:45,560
What are you talking about?

2505
02:02:45,659 --> 02:02:47,869
I'm saying that it depends on your feelings.

2506
02:02:48,899 --> 02:02:51,269
Depending on why you want to go on a date with Ji Yeon...

2507
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:53,698
I'm not saying I want to go on a date with Ji Yeon.

2508
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:55,710
- You did. You said... - But you...

2509
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:58,309
- you'd pick Gyu Min for me. - But you...

2510
02:02:58,310 --> 02:02:59,710
- I would. - Why?

2511
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,350
It seems like things are going well for you two.

2512
02:03:01,649 --> 02:03:04,319
Does that mean things are going well for you and Ji Yeon?

2513
02:03:04,649 --> 02:03:07,520
But you also texted Ji Soo today.

2514
02:03:07,819 --> 02:03:10,890
I don't want to talk so deeply...

2515
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:14,560
- about how I feel about whom. - Normally...

2516
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:16,560
- Okay. - Okay.

2517
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:19,960
Then you'd also be okay with Ji Soo, right?

2518
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,568
Are you playing with me?

2519
02:03:23,569 --> 02:03:24,898
I just mean...

2520
02:03:24,899 --> 02:03:27,299
picking Ji Yeon for you...

2521
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:28,970
is kind of a big deal for me.

2522
02:03:29,539 --> 02:03:30,569
I know.

2523
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:34,778
That's why you said you'd pick Ji Yeon If I was serious about her.

2524
02:03:34,779 --> 02:03:36,510
- Exactly. - Exactly.

2525
02:03:40,619 --> 02:03:42,189
Okay. I'll pick Ji Yeon.

2526
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:47,090
Okay.

2527
02:03:51,159 --> 02:03:54,029
Let's get some fresh air.

2528
02:03:55,829 --> 02:03:58,939
You know that me picking Ji Yeon for you...

2529
02:03:59,069 --> 02:04:01,470
is a big deal for our relationship, right?

2530
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:03,140
What?

2531
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:06,509
- I mean, a big deal for how I feel. - You're contradicting yourself.

2532
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:08,050
I don't understand what you're saying.

2533
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:11,379
Me making the choice...

2534
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:14,618
to have to you go on a date with Ji Yeon...

2535
02:04:14,619 --> 02:04:16,589
means that I'm giving up on our relationship.

2536
02:04:16,590 --> 02:04:18,688
You asking already meant that you were already giving up.

2537
02:04:18,689 --> 02:04:21,129
- You asked me. - You picking Ji Yeon means...

2538
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:22,459
that you were giving up.

2539
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:25,999
I think you're letting your ego get in the way.

2540
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,299
- Still? - Yes.

2541
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,970
That just shows how shallow you are.

2542
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:30,898
- You think this is about my ego... - I don't want to fight with you.

2543
02:04:30,899 --> 02:04:33,769
- Look. You're... - What? I'm not fighting you.

2544
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:35,709
I'm just saying I'm going to end our relationship.

2545
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:37,010
Okay. Fine.

2546
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:41,350
I don't know why you're talking to me like that.

2547
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:45,179
Honestly, I wanted to make up with you here.

2548
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:46,679
But I couldn't feel so...

2549
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:48,889
- from your actions. - Do you know why?

2550
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:50,719
- It's because you didn't change. - No.

2551
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,059
I'm still getting scolded by you.

2552
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:54,959
- You're still looking down on me. - Even before that,

2553
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,358
I couldn't feel anything from you,

2554
02:04:57,359 --> 02:04:59,259
- so I couldn't do anything more. - I told you and expressed...

2555
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:00,358
my feelings as you asked.

2556
02:05:00,359 --> 02:05:02,769
Are you saying you did enough?

2557
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:05,538
- No, I don't think I did enough. - I don't want to do this right now.

2558
02:05:05,539 --> 02:05:07,770
I don't want to do this right now.

2559
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,438
What was that face just now?

2560
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:14,978
You saying that you don't want to do this right now...

2561
02:05:14,979 --> 02:05:17,750
is so like you, cutting off our conversation like that.

2562
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:20,749
I don't feel like you're being genuine.

2563
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:21,818
You're contradicting yourself.

2564
02:05:21,819 --> 02:05:22,989
What do you mean?

2565
02:05:23,149 --> 02:05:26,059
Honestly, trying to explain would be a waste of time.

2566
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:28,858
Are you acting like this because I went on a date with Gyu Min?

2567
02:05:28,859 --> 02:05:30,389
- We rooted for each other. - We did.

2568
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:31,658
And what did you say to me?

2569
02:05:31,659 --> 02:05:33,999
I said that I'd have fun and that you should too.

2570
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,028
What did you say after that?

2571
02:05:35,029 --> 02:05:37,670
You told me not to get in the way.

2572
02:05:38,199 --> 02:05:40,469
- And what happened after that? - I get it.

2573
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:41,739
I get it.

2574
02:05:42,069 --> 02:05:44,578
- You're just repeating yourself. - Yes. I get it.

2575
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:47,679
You're the one who's saying one thing and doing another.

2576
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:48,849
Why are you mad at me?

2577
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:50,249
What did I say and do?

2578
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:52,920
I don't even know why you're saying this to me right now.

2579
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:54,288
I don't like this kind of thing.

2580
02:05:54,289 --> 02:05:56,219
- Why am I saying this? - I don't want to do this right now.

2581
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,318
I feel...

2582
02:05:57,319 --> 02:05:58,559
I don't want to do this right now.

2583
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:59,720
What do you want to do, then?

2584
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:02,929
- Do you just want to be strangers? - I just don't like having...

2585
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:03,959
pointless arguments.

2586
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,799
- You think this is pointless? - Yes. I do.

2587
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:06,828
It's really important for me.

2588
02:06:06,829 --> 02:06:09,528
If it's so important, don't talk in such a dumb way.

2589
02:06:09,529 --> 02:06:11,868
I sound dumb? Maybe you're just too dumb to understand.

2590
02:06:11,869 --> 02:06:13,100
This is what I'm talking about.

2591
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:16,170
Is this dumb? You're just not listening.

2592
02:06:16,569 --> 02:06:19,310
Honestly, you haven't changed one bit...

2593
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:22,078
since we saw each other yesterday. I know I haven't changed,

2594
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:23,908
but you haven't changed either.

2595
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:26,019
How do you expect me to keep going for you...

2596
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:28,489
and keep having feelings for you?

2597
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:32,060
Keep going.

2598
02:06:33,489 --> 02:06:36,390
I don't want to say anything bad to you.

2599
02:06:36,829 --> 02:06:39,158
- I just... - Go ahead.

2600
02:06:39,159 --> 02:06:42,868
- I was wrong. I'm the bad guy. - Okay. Be quiet. Let me talk.

2601
02:06:42,869 --> 02:06:44,738
I'll be the bad guy.

2602
02:06:44,739 --> 02:06:46,469
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

2603
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:49,140
I'm not telling you to be the bad guy.

2604
02:06:49,239 --> 02:06:50,340
I'll say it directly.

2605
02:06:50,739 --> 02:06:53,578
I like you, and I want to get back together with you,

2606
02:06:53,579 --> 02:06:55,709
but I can't. We didn't want to do this all over again,

2607
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:57,849
- but here we are. - You wanted to get back together?

2608
02:06:57,850 --> 02:06:59,349
For someone who wanted to get back together...

2609
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:00,988
I don't want to anymore.

2610
02:07:00,989 --> 02:07:02,519
Exactly. Since when? Now?

2611
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:03,688
No. Since last night.

2612
02:07:03,689 --> 02:07:05,089
So why did you talk to me again this morning?

2613
02:07:05,090 --> 02:07:07,959
- Did I tell you that this morning? - You don't need to say this...

2614
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:10,728
- if you don't want to make up. - I do. Honestly, I still want to.

2615
02:07:10,729 --> 02:07:12,228
Then you're just playing games with me right now.

2616
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:14,158
- I still have feelings for you. - I asked you if you wanted...

2617
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:15,728
to get back together, and you said you didn't want to anymore.

2618
02:07:15,729 --> 02:07:16,828
I don't anymore.

2619
02:07:16,829 --> 02:07:18,568
If you don't want to, you don't have to say any of this.

2620
02:07:18,569 --> 02:07:19,799
I told you that we should stop this conversation,

2621
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:22,538
but you kept going. That's what I mean. You're playing games.

2622
02:07:22,539 --> 02:07:24,608
That's just how I feel. What can I do? You're the same.

2623
02:07:24,609 --> 02:07:26,108
- No, I'm not. - How do you feel?

2624
02:07:26,109 --> 02:07:27,948
How can our feelings for each other go away so easily?

2625
02:07:27,949 --> 02:07:29,509
You easily said that we should end things.

2626
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:30,750
You just said so.

2627
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:33,149
You said so yourself that we should end things.

2628
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:37,118
You're just the type of person who says things like that easily.

2629
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:38,259
Do you think this is easy for me?

2630
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,419
- Honestly, you're... - Does this look easy to you?

2631
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:42,259
You said those things easily so far,

2632
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:43,829
Does this look easy to you?

2633
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:46,259
If it isn't easy, you shouldn't say those things.

2634
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:48,269
- I did it although it wasn't easy. - Once you say something,

2635
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:49,630
- follow it through. - I did it although it wasn't easy.

2636
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:51,800
- Okay. - Follow it through and leave.

2637
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:53,500
Where?

2638
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:01,409
You will never be able to admit it.

2639
02:08:01,449 --> 02:08:02,550
I admit it.

2640
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:05,050
Then what's the problem?

2641
02:08:05,051 --> 02:08:06,220
All right then. It's over.

2642
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:09,350
- Let's go. - Okay.

2643
02:08:10,189 --> 02:08:12,289
Go ahead. I am going to get a drink of water.

2644
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:13,890
We should go together.

2645
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:15,829
(I see.)

2646
02:08:16,989 --> 02:08:19,300
- You are incredulous, right? - No.

2647
02:08:19,329 --> 02:08:21,569
- You brought this on to yourself. - Okay.

2648
02:08:21,699 --> 02:08:24,100
I said you aren't the one at fault, but...

2649
02:08:24,199 --> 02:08:26,139
- It's because I hugged Tae I. - To be honest... What?

2650
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:27,368
It's because I hugged Tae I.

2651
02:08:27,369 --> 02:08:30,209
- It's because I flirted with men... - It's not like that.

2652
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:32,340
and behaved in a thoughtless manner.

2653
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:33,809
It's not like that.

2654
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:35,750
Then I don't know what the problem is.

2655
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:38,880
- You mistreated me because of that. - That's not true.

2656
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:41,148
- Why do you keep... - For what other reason...

2657
02:08:41,149 --> 02:08:43,488
would you mistreat me?

2658
02:08:43,489 --> 02:08:45,460
You keep sidetracking.

2659
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:47,959
I never mistreated you.

2660
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:49,629
You did mistreat me!

2661
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:51,659
That was the reason why we broke up.

2662
02:08:53,659 --> 02:08:54,829
Okay.

2663
02:08:58,470 --> 02:09:01,170
For me, the best option would be dating you happily.

2664
02:09:01,939 --> 02:09:04,979
- But we can't date happily. - Someone who wants that...

2665
02:09:05,079 --> 02:09:07,578
shouldn't follow another man just because she is bored.

2666
02:09:07,579 --> 02:09:09,379
I am not saying you are wrong.

2667
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:11,220
You are no longer someone I like.

2668
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:14,789
You don't know how to refuse.

2669
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:18,818
You do whatever you want without thinking about consequences.

2670
02:09:18,819 --> 02:09:21,629
You looked down on me in front of everyone.

2671
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,090
- What we do... - In front of everyone?

2672
02:09:23,189 --> 02:09:24,858
- Listen. - What did you do before Won Bin?

2673
02:09:24,859 --> 02:09:26,629
Before Won Bin, you...

2674
02:09:26,630 --> 02:09:28,669
- I was in the wrong too, but... - You picked a fight with me.

2675
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:30,369
No. That's not what Won Bin thinks.

2676
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:33,238
You are so strange. Stop talking about other people.

2677
02:09:33,239 --> 02:09:35,639
If I speak honestly, you will get even more annoyed.

2678
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:37,840
Are you on this show to ruin your image by any chance?

2679
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:42,309
The way you act mindlessly isn't very...

2680
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:45,049
You act mindfully, but we are similar in the end.

2681
02:09:45,050 --> 02:09:46,419
It's unbecoming.

2682
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:47,849
You and I are the same.

2683
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:49,989
Don't pull me down to your level.

2684
02:09:50,149 --> 02:09:51,289
Here is the conclusion.

2685
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:53,760
I want to get back together with you.

2686
02:09:53,859 --> 02:09:55,629
- But what would be the point? - Don't say that.

2687
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:58,099
Don't say that. You just say that when you are with me.

2688
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:00,658
When we can't help but meet on the day the Ex Room opened...

2689
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:02,198
or the very first day...

2690
02:10:02,199 --> 02:10:04,469
- If you don't believe me, fine. - I am talking.

2691
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:06,038
- I am talking. - Everything you say is wrong.

2692
02:10:06,039 --> 02:10:08,408
- If you don't want me to talk... - You think I was acting.

2693
02:10:08,409 --> 02:10:10,139
You are wrong, so I don't want to hear it.

2694
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:11,609
All right. I won't say anything then.

2695
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:15,179
You treat me the same way as you did before,

2696
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:17,549
so why am I choosing you instead of Gyu Min?

2697
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:19,579
Why should I treat you any differently?

2698
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:21,319
In what ways did you change?

2699
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:22,549
What did you do?

2700
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:24,688
- Stop. - You didn't change in any way.

2701
02:10:24,689 --> 02:10:25,960
To be honest,

2702
02:10:26,119 --> 02:10:27,788
you just want me to change...

2703
02:10:27,789 --> 02:10:28,959
without changing yourself.

2704
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:30,130
I am the same.

2705
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:31,630
That's why this won't work.

2706
02:10:33,699 --> 02:10:37,568
If we are going to reunite, we should...

2707
02:10:37,569 --> 02:10:39,840
- Reunite? That makes me laugh. - Yes.

2708
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:41,439
If we are going to get back together...

2709
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:48,579
I don't know what I am doing here.

2710
02:10:54,119 --> 02:10:56,850
You are getting to know people without a problem.

2711
02:10:57,619 --> 02:10:59,019
There are women who like you.

2712
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:00,789
It doesn't matter either way.

2713
02:11:01,229 --> 02:11:02,630
I came here comfortably.

2714
02:11:03,659 --> 02:11:04,930
It's not like I came here uncomfortably.

2715
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:06,899
I came here comfortably too.

2716
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:08,729
I could tell.

2717
02:11:15,539 --> 02:11:18,709
It was a mistake to be on this show with you.

2718
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:19,810
Yes.

2719
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:23,279
I shouldn't have changed my mind after saying no.

2720
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:27,850
- It's 35 minutes. We need to go. - Let's go.

2721
02:11:37,529 --> 02:11:39,060
I am going to use the restroom first.

2722
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:43,000
Being proud won't get you anywhere.

2723
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:52,778
For goodness' sake.

2724
02:11:52,779 --> 02:11:54,139
This is driving me crazy.

2725
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:55,479
It's one argument after another.

2726
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:00,379
Seriously.

2727
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:02,989
Why does this happen every evening?

2728
02:12:03,189 --> 02:12:04,589
- Seriously. - Why?

2729
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:06,158
They were affectionate during the day.

2730
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:08,460
Does the production crew change in the evening?

2731
02:12:09,029 --> 02:12:10,989
Why do they do that?

2732
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:13,130
This is driving me crazy.

2733
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:16,228
- Oh, no. - I have never delved so deep...

2734
02:12:16,229 --> 02:12:18,398
- into someone's relationship. - Same here.

2735
02:12:18,399 --> 02:12:21,069
Now, I could explain their relationship to someone.

2736
02:12:21,239 --> 02:12:22,369
Same here.

2737
02:12:23,069 --> 02:12:24,739
- Sometimes, it happens. - It feels strange.

2738
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,408
- Sometimes, you wake up... - It does, right?

2739
02:12:26,409 --> 02:12:28,510
- because of a loud fight outside. - That's right.

2740
02:12:28,579 --> 02:12:30,680
- They are fighting the same way. - That's right.

2741
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:32,419
"I said I don't like it." "I did too."

2742
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:34,118
"I said it first!" "No, I did!"

2743
02:12:34,119 --> 02:12:35,948
They don't even know why they are fighting.

2744
02:12:35,949 --> 02:12:38,920
- They twist each other's words. - Yes.

2745
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:40,889
When we pass by a park,

2746
02:12:40,890 --> 02:12:43,489
we sometimes see a couple who stare at each other wordlessly.

2747
02:12:43,630 --> 02:12:45,259
"They must be fighting."

2748
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:46,829
Even on your way back, you see them doing the same thing.

2749
02:12:46,899 --> 02:12:48,600
- That's what it feels like. - I know.

2750
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:52,198
She screams and says, "I want things to work out between us."

2751
02:12:52,199 --> 02:12:53,738
- That's right. - Na Yeon keeps doing that.

2752
02:12:53,739 --> 02:12:55,970
"I love you. But why do you act that way?"

2753
02:12:56,069 --> 02:12:58,180
Na Yeon expressed her feelings...

2754
02:12:58,310 --> 02:13:00,680
- even during the fight. - Yes.

2755
02:13:00,779 --> 02:13:02,478
- It was her genuine feeling. - Yes.

2756
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:04,920
Na Yeon always shows her genuine feeling first.

2757
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:07,979
Did you hear what Hee Doo said at the end?

2758
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:09,919
"Being proud won't get you anywhere."

2759
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:11,519
It was like,

2760
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:15,159
"You like me more, so stop acting proud."

2761
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:18,760
But in a sense, Hee Doo is being more proud.

2762
02:13:18,899 --> 02:13:20,099
- Yes. - Both of them are doing that.

2763
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:21,929
Hee Doo has more pride.

2764
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:23,629
Both of them have pride,

2765
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:26,239
but I think Hee Doo wants Na Yeon to yield.

2766
02:13:26,399 --> 02:13:29,108
Na Yeon is more honest than Hee Doo...

2767
02:13:29,109 --> 02:13:30,568
when it comes to feelings.

2768
02:13:30,569 --> 02:13:32,038
- It drives me crazy. - It's never-ending.

2769
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:34,180
Seriously. It doesn't end.

2770
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:37,148
- I feel comfortable around you. - Seriously.

2771
02:13:37,149 --> 02:13:39,278
- You feel comfortable around me. - Yes. I can finally breathe.

2772
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:41,050
You can finally breathe? I will come more often. My goodness.

2773
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:43,090
As for your hair... Come here.

2774
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:45,618
You have thick hair,

2775
02:13:45,619 --> 02:13:47,759
so you should push this part back.

2776
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,159
I didn't do my hair.

2777
02:13:49,289 --> 02:13:50,789
You should do it.

2778
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,858
I looked that way earlier since I had washed up and lied down.

2779
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:55,069
You should do your hair.

2780
02:13:55,670 --> 02:13:57,729
Every moment was weird.

2781
02:13:58,239 --> 02:13:59,699
I am telling you this because you look weird even now.

2782
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:02,140
Don't make your hair come down. Push it back like this.

2783
02:14:03,069 --> 02:14:05,309
- Here. I will apply BB cream. - Okay.

2784
02:14:05,310 --> 02:14:07,478
- I did it for other people too. - Good job.

2785
02:14:07,479 --> 02:14:10,209
Look in the mirror. This hairstyle is better.

2786
02:14:10,210 --> 02:14:12,049
- You think it's better, right? - Yes.

2787
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:13,549
- You admit it, right? - Yes.

2788
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:15,049
- You think it's better, right? - Yes.

2789
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:16,220
Take a good look.

2790
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:18,619
- You look much better. - Yes.

2791
02:14:18,859 --> 02:14:20,019
Be cool.

2792
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:21,188
What should I do to be cool?

2793
02:14:21,189 --> 02:14:23,759
Don't try to be cool. Don't try anything.

2794
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:24,828
I will stay still.

2795
02:14:24,829 --> 02:14:26,429
That tone is okay.

2796
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:27,600
But earlier, you were like,

2797
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:30,129
"Hello." Why did you do that?

2798
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:32,038
- Over there? - Yes.

2799
02:14:32,039 --> 02:14:34,069
I was at ease, so I said, "Hello."

2800
02:14:35,010 --> 02:14:37,340
- No one was at ease. - Okay.

2801
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:39,839
You are at ease around me,

2802
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,180
but you never said "Hello" like that.

2803
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,109
Right? You did that because you felt awkward.

2804
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:45,350
I don't know.

2805
02:14:45,979 --> 02:14:47,149
In any case,

2806
02:14:47,819 --> 02:14:49,319
- help me with Hae Eun. - I mean...

2807
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:51,619
I will do that. But I...

2808
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:54,289
- You don't want anyone else. Okay. - No.

2809
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,989
Hae Eun is the nicest. She is really nice, right?

2810
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:00,159
- You like nice women. - I feel comfortable around her.

2811
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:02,170
I made that.

2812
02:15:04,029 --> 02:15:06,438
- Are you happy? How annoying. - I am happy.

2813
02:15:06,439 --> 02:15:07,699
I am joking.

2814
02:15:08,140 --> 02:15:10,569
How did you fall for her in a day? What do you like about her?

2815
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:12,839
I thought you would like her.

2816
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,538
Why did you think that?

2817
02:15:14,539 --> 02:15:15,909
I know everything about you.

2818
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:18,618
I knew from the start. Even during the interview,

2819
02:15:18,619 --> 02:15:20,220
I said you would like Hae Eun.

2820
02:15:20,619 --> 02:15:21,750
You got it right.

2821
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:24,148
She is cheerful.

2822
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:25,658
- She is so nice. - I know.

2823
02:15:25,659 --> 02:15:26,919
- She is cheerful. - She is cheerful and nice.

2824
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,929
- You like such women. She is pure. - Yes.

2825
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:31,389
- She isn't calculative at all. - No.

2826
02:15:31,390 --> 02:15:33,159
I hope she doesn't get her feelings hurt.

2827
02:15:33,899 --> 02:15:36,369
- She isn't calculative at all. - I know.

2828
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:39,670
I think she got her feelings hurt already.

2829
02:15:39,939 --> 02:15:41,710
- She cries every day. - I know.

2830
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:44,640
As for me,

2831
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:52,920
I am not focused on getting back together with you.

2832
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:55,920
I just want to apologize to you.

2833
02:15:57,989 --> 02:15:59,659
I really hope...

2834
02:16:01,829 --> 02:16:04,289
we can talk later.

2835
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:22,550
I will do it with Hae Eun.

2836
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:28,920
Shall we go?

2837
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:32,319
You can go ahead.

2838
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:55,340
(The conversation with the ex ends.)

2839
02:17:56,809 --> 02:17:59,510
(Everyone gathers around in the living room.)

2840
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:09,620
- Don't cry. - You startled me. I am not crying.

2841
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:11,690
- You cried in the end. - I am not crying.

2842
02:18:15,629 --> 02:18:17,459
You can take a break.

2843
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,049
I couldn't face Hyun Gyu,

2844
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:46,020
so I left the room.

2845
02:18:46,590 --> 02:18:49,689
I didn't want to show that side of me to Hyun Gyu.

2846
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:51,059
I shouldn't have done that.

2847
02:18:51,159 --> 02:18:53,700
But I couldn't stop the tears.

2848
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:56,930
After having a nice date with him,

2849
02:18:57,629 --> 02:19:01,099
I was being sad because of Gyu Min.

2850
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:03,309
It was hypocritical, so I felt bad.

2851
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:06,339
Enjoying a date until the evening...

2852
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:08,279
and crying because of an ex at night...

2853
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:11,719
in front of the man you went on a date is hard.

2854
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:15,919
I am someone who can give her better memories,

2855
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,689
but Hae Eun is having a hard time because of her ex.

2856
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:20,619
Erasing and processing the past...

2857
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:22,158
is up to Hae Eun.

2858
02:19:22,159 --> 02:19:25,699
I wanted to go and comfort her,

2859
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:28,569
but I didn't want to show pity.

2860
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:31,739
I thought my presence might make her cry even harder.

2861
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:35,969
I didn't want her to feel more pitiful, so I stayed put.

2862
02:19:49,889 --> 02:19:52,818
I think she had a hard time...

2863
02:19:52,819 --> 02:19:54,190
because of our conversation.

2864
02:19:54,819 --> 02:19:57,030
Seeing her struggle...

2865
02:19:57,389 --> 02:19:58,930
made me feel uncomfortable.

2866
02:20:00,299 --> 02:20:03,298
It's between the two of them, so I don't know the full story.

2867
02:20:03,299 --> 02:20:05,599
But I didn't understand.

2868
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,798
If you date someone for seven years,

2869
02:20:07,799 --> 02:20:09,939
she is precious to you even if you break up with her.

2870
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:13,079
Seeing her cry and hurting her feelings...

2871
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,578
is something I would never do.

2872
02:20:15,579 --> 02:20:18,850
I am sure Gyu Min had his reasons,

2873
02:20:18,950 --> 02:20:20,620
but I didn't understand.

2874
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:36,500
Do you want some water?

2875
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:41,239
Drink some water.

2876
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:48,609
- Are you okay? - What?

2877
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:50,649
- Are you okay? - I am okay.

2878
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:54,179
But Hae Eun had a hard time.

2879
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:55,290
- Really? - Yes.

2880
02:20:58,090 --> 02:20:59,260
Thank you.

2881
02:21:03,459 --> 02:21:04,489
Aren't you hot?

2882
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:08,770
Me? I am cold.

2883
02:21:09,069 --> 02:21:10,869
Why is everyone dazed...

2884
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:12,639
as if they visited the Room of Spirit and Time?

2885
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:17,138
- Seriously. - Hae Eun, aren't you cold?

2886
02:21:17,139 --> 02:21:19,308
My hands are freezing.

2887
02:21:19,309 --> 02:21:20,440
Stop crying.

2888
02:21:21,209 --> 02:21:24,548
Gosh, you are warmhearted. You keep getting me a tissue.

2889
02:21:24,549 --> 02:21:27,479
- I saw you cry. - You keep getting me a tissue.

2890
02:21:27,579 --> 02:21:29,250
It's because you cry the most.

2891
02:21:31,389 --> 02:21:32,420
Is everyone here?

2892
02:21:32,889 --> 02:21:34,420
- I think so. - Where is Ji Soo?

2893
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,059
- She is over there. - Yes.

2894
02:21:37,329 --> 02:21:38,529
Is everyone here?

2895
02:21:38,530 --> 02:21:40,399
Did you miss me because I am too small?

2896
02:21:47,799 --> 02:21:49,269
(Female participants, please pick your ex's date.)

2897
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:50,738
(Take turns and say the name.)

2898
02:21:50,739 --> 02:21:52,939
- "Take turns and say the name." - We are doing it openly.

2899
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:53,979
We are doing it openly.

2900
02:21:55,979 --> 02:22:00,620
(In front of everyone, )

2901
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:08,729
(they must call the ex's date.)

2902
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:16,169
I chose Hae Eun.

2903
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:18,069
(Won Bin's date, Hae Eun)

2904
02:22:19,370 --> 02:22:22,039
Ji Soo said to me,

2905
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,510
"Pick the person you want as your date."

2906
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:28,139
I remembered having a conversation with Hae Eun.

2907
02:22:28,909 --> 02:22:30,249
(Hyun Gu's date)

2908
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:31,749
I chose Hae Eun.

2909
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:33,780
(Hae Eun)

2910
02:22:34,549 --> 02:22:36,689
I thought I should pick...

2911
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:38,520
the woman he wants.

2912
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:40,419
Hyun Gyu is like a friend to me.

2913
02:22:40,420 --> 02:22:41,859
I think he is my family.

2914
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:44,759
Thus, I feel comfortable around him and want him to do well.

2915
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:46,559
I want Hyun Gyu to be happy.

2916
02:22:47,629 --> 02:22:51,299
When Hyun Gyu first picked Hae Eun and went on a date with her,

2917
02:22:51,399 --> 02:22:53,969
I didn't think much of it...

2918
02:22:54,370 --> 02:22:56,408
because his decision was based on the first impression.

2919
02:22:56,409 --> 02:22:58,679
When he chose her for the second time,

2920
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:02,549
I thought, "Hyun Gyu likes Hae Eun even after the first date."

2921
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:06,749
I felt anxious and uncomfortable.

2922
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:08,219
Those emotions came to me.

2923
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:16,529
(Tae I's date)

2924
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:17,558
I chose Na Eon.

2925
02:23:17,559 --> 02:23:20,700
(Na Eon)

2926
02:23:22,329 --> 02:23:25,699
"I will have fun tomorrow. It will be a fun and relaxing date."

2927
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:26,799
I had that thought.

2928
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:34,809
I chose Na Eon.

2929
02:23:40,250 --> 02:23:43,420
(Gyu Min's date, Na Eon)

2930
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:49,029
Hee Doo isn't the only one Na Yeon is interested in.

2931
02:23:49,030 --> 02:23:51,690
Na Yeon is torn,

2932
02:23:52,930 --> 02:23:54,299
so I couldn't let Gyu Min go.

2933
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,200
She told me to pick between Na Eon and Ji Yeon.

2934
02:23:58,430 --> 02:24:01,068
Since the day Na Eon came,

2935
02:24:01,069 --> 02:24:03,370
I thought she seemed like a nice person.

2936
02:24:03,469 --> 02:24:05,239
So I did want to get to know her.

2937
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:09,849
I was happy because I did think...

2938
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:12,548
that it would be nice to go on a date with Gyu Min.

2939
02:24:12,549 --> 02:24:15,589
It was my first date with another man,

2940
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:17,219
so I didn't know what to expect.

2941
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:20,719
I thought, "I might get swayed."

2942
02:24:23,159 --> 02:24:26,459
I chose Ji Soo.

2943
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:32,370
- She twisted it. - She twisted it.

2944
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:40,479
I don't know if I should be happy about it.

2945
02:24:46,450 --> 02:24:49,520
(Hee Doo's date, Ji Soo)

2946
02:24:53,219 --> 02:24:55,158
His ex chose the date,

2947
02:24:55,159 --> 02:24:59,628
so I knew that Hee Doo didn't have a complete say in the matter.

2948
02:24:59,629 --> 02:25:02,568
In Na Yeon's opinion, I am someone...

2949
02:25:02,569 --> 02:25:05,969
who is a friend to Hee Doo.

2950
02:25:06,069 --> 02:25:09,840
I think I was the one she was the least worried about.

2951
02:25:11,270 --> 02:25:12,909
Ji Soo.

2952
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:17,309
I don't know.

2953
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:19,920
I wonder if I was among the options.

2954
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,120
Perhaps Hee Doo and Na Yeon...

2955
02:25:24,389 --> 02:25:27,719
didn't have an agreement.

2956
02:25:29,559 --> 02:25:32,100
I just blurted out that name.

2957
02:25:33,399 --> 02:25:35,669
I hated myself for it. I felt miserable.

2958
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:37,370
I felt silly.

2959
02:25:37,770 --> 02:25:40,170
In the end, I couldn't let go of Hee Doo...

2960
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:41,639
even though I had agreed to do that.

2961
02:25:41,739 --> 02:25:43,739
I thought she would choose Ji Yeon,

2962
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:45,510
but she chose Ji Soo.

2963
02:25:45,709 --> 02:25:48,850
"She must really hate seeing me go on a date with Ji Yeon."

2964
02:25:49,479 --> 02:25:52,249
The bracelets too. The two of them are the closest.

2965
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:53,749
They have feelings for each other.

2966
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:56,389
I think Hee Doo is interested in Ji Yeon too.

2967
02:25:58,389 --> 02:25:59,590
I can see...

2968
02:26:00,219 --> 02:26:02,020
if it's genuine or not.

2969
02:26:02,129 --> 02:26:05,059
So Hae Eun has two dates.

2970
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:06,860
Na Eon has two dates.

2971
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:08,629
For Ji Soo, the date is set.

2972
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:10,628
Na Yeon and I have zero dates.

2973
02:26:10,629 --> 02:26:11,770
- Right. - Let's hang out by ourselves.

2974
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:14,139
There are five of us.

2975
02:26:18,309 --> 02:26:22,680
(The exes finished choosing the dates.)

2976
02:26:24,549 --> 02:26:26,318
I realized today...

2977
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:28,120
that Hee Doo and Na Yeon aren't compatible.

2978
02:26:28,989 --> 02:26:30,089
(Shall I shake things up?)

2979
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:32,019
(It's selfish of me, but I like Ji Yeon...)

2980
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,659
(and still have feelings for Na Yeon.)

2981
02:26:34,159 --> 02:26:36,030
(To be honest, I am not worried about Na Yeon.)

2982
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:39,499
(I can't deny that I really enjoy spending time...)

02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,659
(with Hee Doo.)

2984

(For the first time in a long while, )
