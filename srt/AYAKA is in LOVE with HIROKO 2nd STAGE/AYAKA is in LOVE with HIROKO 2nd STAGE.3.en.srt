1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,499
Hiroko-san, I want to have a
deeper relationship with you.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,300
Even though I didn't remember, once things get out
of control, I have no idea what might happen next.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,199
I've never done it!!

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
You haven't done it?!

5
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:13,589
Great! She didn't get hurt!

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,579
What do you mean by "that's great"?!

7
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,024
My first time.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
When is it finally going to happen?!

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,900
The result...

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
nothing happened all the way until morning.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,600
So that's it, nothing
happened! That's a relief!

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
That line.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,400
What does that even mean?

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,000
It really suits you.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Thank you.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,300
You've always admired wedding
dresses, even since way back, haven't you?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,900
Because it's only at that moment during the
wedding that I get to be the main character.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Huh?

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,500
Someone as ordinary as me only gets
noticed by everyone at times like this.

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,199
What are you talking about!

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,700
- That's not true at all.
- It is!

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,890
Ah! But Hiro-chan, you used to really dream
of wearing a wedding dress too, didn't you?

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,099
Huh, is that so?

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,803
See, we're supposed to be
drawing wedding ceremonies,

26
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:26,866
but Hiro-chan, you always end
up drawing a bunch of brides.

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,700
You really used to dream of
becoming a bride, didn't you?

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,376
From that moment on, I was
absolutely sure I'm totally into girls!

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,400
You've always been really
passionate about the things you love.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,100
That's exactly the
kind of Hiro-chan I love.

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,529
Like that?

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,530
Hmm...

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,479
Someone who doesn't just go with the flow.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,490
Like saying you don't even need a groom at a wedding,

35
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,983
or drawing all sorts of
weird and quirky houses.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,999
Saying things like, "One day,
I'm going to build a house like this."

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,200
- Hahaha... Is that so?
- Yeah...

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Back then, I always
thought you were really cool.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,500
Yeah.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,500
Back then, I could think about
those things so naturally...

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,200
So beautiful.

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,940
Hiro-chan! Let's go!

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,509
Where are we going?

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,329
Catch the bouquet! Let's go!

45
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,199
I'm not going! Tsumugi, you go instead.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,680
- It's fine, it's fine, let's go, hurry up.
- Tsumugi, wait up.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Wait!

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,700
Here it comes!

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Over here, over here! Throw it this way!

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
Here!

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Congratulations!

52
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,599
Congratulations, Hiro-chan!

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
- Is Hiroko the next one to get married?
- That's right.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,020
- Sorry...
- Hiro-chan, are you getting married?

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,400
Marriage?

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Getting married, huh...

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm not sure.

58
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:33,735
Not getting married?

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,800
Why?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,270
Huh?

61
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,000
Why is that...

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
(The goddess of Hawaii)

63
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,400
Oh... goddess.

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,900
The goddess for me is...

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,999
Come here...

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,700
Ayaka...

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,780
Oh, come on.

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,300
What's wrong?

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,276
Because you kept staring at me...

70
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,099
Ah! Um... I was just daydreaming.

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,990
Fantasizing?

72
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,000
It's nothing, really. I just think the stories
about Hawaiian goddesses are really fascinating.

73
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,600
Ayaka, do you like Hawaii too?

74
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,629
I absolutely love it too. I go to Hawaii every year!

75
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,300
Oh! Is that so?

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,060
It also says here that there are a lot
of goddesses in Hawaiian mythology.

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,269
I think that's how it is!

78
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,599
For example,

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,800
in Hawaii, they say that what you see on the
moon isn't a rabbit, but the goddess Hina!

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
- There's a goddess living on the moon.
- That's right!

81
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,800
Everyone believes that deities
reside within the things of nature.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's why people even go to
the beach to bathe in the moonlight!

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,900
Huh! I've never really paid
attention to the moon before.

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Everyone says the moon
holds a special power!

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,500
Oh! By the way, tonight's a full moon.

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,699
This is really lucky!

87
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,000
Huh, why?

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,217
Doesn't everyone say that during a full moon,
your inner strength and potential get awakened,

89
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:53,498
and your luck gets a boost too?

90
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,500
Today's event is sure to be a huge success.

91
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,500
Inner strength!

92
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,500
Luck is on the rise!

93
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,600
Good luck...

94
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,200
Ayaka...

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,900
In other words, we absolutely
have to take the initiative today.

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Um... Ayaka, are you okay?

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
No problem!!

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,650
Give it your all at work!

99
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,850
Alright.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,500
Watch me, Moon Goddess.

101
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,000
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

102
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,200
(Episode 3: Life is Beautiful!)

103
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,800
Always watching over me with such kindness.

104
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Dad.

105
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Mom.

106
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you all so much.

107
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,500
And... my favorite, Hiro-chan.

108
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,999
Hiro-chan has always been there for me.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,700
That kind of courage to
honestly speak your mind.

110
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,500
Even though we sometimes argue,

111
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,800
But no matter what, you're
always honest and sincere.

112
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
A Hiro-chan like that.

113
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
You're the one I look up to!

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,700
Thank you so much!

115
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,300
Sorry, Keiko!

116
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm really not that amazing, you know.

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,300
Honestly, back then, it felt like anyone
would do as long as they had a chest.

118
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Everything changed after I met Ayaka.

119
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Hiroko-san.

120
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Aloha... My love... This is for you♡

121
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,190
This time...

122
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,400
My aloha is about to get all aloha too!

123
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,280
No, no way.

124
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,999
I've decided I won't look
at Ayaka that way anymore.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,339
I need to be more serious
and cherish her even more.

126
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,900
Vanish, worries! Be gone, desires!

127
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,000
My father-in-law and mother-in-law
have a really good relationship!

128
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,180
Because I like her the most.

129
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,976
When she goes out, I make sure
she carries pepper spray for protection.

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
I even secretly followed her to her lunch date
with her mom friends, and ended up getting scolded!

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,300
He was interfering in my life too much, I just
couldn't take it anymore and ran away from home.

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,640
This is a misunderstanding that
only happens because of love.

133
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Love...

134
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
That's way too much...

135
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,480
Oh, right!

136
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,830
Hiroko-san, I'll be
having dinner out tonight.

137
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,599
- Who are you having dinner with?
- Risa.

138
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,380
Where?

139
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,200
At her place.

140
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:22,759
Then remember to let me
know when you're done.

141
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,099
- I can pick you up at the station.
- No need!

142
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,600
If you're going to be home
late, make sure to let me know.

143
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Hiroko-san, you really worry too much!

144
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm heading out.

145
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,000
Stay safe on your way.

146
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,499
Be careful, okay?

147
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,100
Okay.

148
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,499
Make sure to contact me!

149
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,300
I'm already doing it!

150
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
I almost asked her if she
wanted to put a GPS on herself.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,500
Hiroko's personality is a lot like mine. If we're
not careful, you might end up being disliked...

152
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,500
I'm totally fine!

153
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,600
This kind of bloodline... that's not good!

154
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,900
Alright, thank you.

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,639
It's finally over!

156
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah! The reason this event turned out so
great this time is all thanks to everyone.

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
- Really appreciate it.
- Thank you so much.

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,859
- Then let's wrap things up here.
- You did a great job.

159
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,900
Great job, everyone.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Senior Ayaka.

161
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
What time are you planning
to take the train back?

162
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Sorry.

163
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,810
Are there any rooms available today?

164
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,600
Alright, let me check that for you.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,850
Huh?

166
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,600
Ayaka, aren't you heading home?

167
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,050
I... still have things to do!

168
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,499
Is it something work-related?

169
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,699
Let me help out, too.

170
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,899
It's okay.

171
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,300
This is my own problem.

172
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,130
Miss, we have rooms available.

173
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,000
And also...

174
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,900
The deluxe suite is also
available. Would you like to book it?

175
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
This has happened before!

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I want the special deluxe suite!!

177
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,100
Understood.

178
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,700
Full moon...

179
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,000
Grant me strength!

180
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,700
For you.

181
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Hm?

182
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,929
Thank you so much for today.

183
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,869
This is just a little something from me, and, when
I was looking through photo albums back home...

184
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,499
I also put in the drawing
we talked about earlier!

185
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,240
Oh, come on, thank you!

186
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,999
No problem. You're heading
back to Tokyo tomorrow, right?

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Yeah, what about you and Keiko?

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,419
We're heading to Daisuke's
hometown tomorrow.

189
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,999
We're heading to Singapore for a trip next!

190
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,430
Oh! A honeymoon trip?

191
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:45,825
Yeah.

192
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,540
When we got married, it just wasn't
the right time for us to travel abroad.

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,800
We're planning to make
up for that lost time now.

194
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,699
Tsumugi!

195
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,540
This is your very first
time traveling abroad!

196
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,399
I'm really looking forward to
the souvenirs you'll bring back.

197
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,300
Got it.

198
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:03,100
I'll bring the souvenirs straight to
Hiro-chan's place for you as soon as I get them!

199
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Huh?

200
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,300
Because I want to
give it to you right away!

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Can I go to Hiro-chan's place?

202
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Thank you.

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
I'm really looking forward to it!

204
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,700
A lot happened, but I'm really glad
everything turned out okay in the end.

205
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Even if we can't get married...

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,200
As long as I can always be with Ayaka.

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just this is enough.

208
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,599
Hiroko's personality is a lot like mine. If we're
not careful, you might end up being disliked...

209
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,024
You might end up being disliked...

210
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,100
Hm?

211
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,600
Goddess of the Moon, Hina...

212
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,199
Hina's husband is rough and selfish.

213
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Completely disregarding Hina's feelings.

214
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
I can't stand living like this anymore.

215
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,660
I want to go somewhere far away by myself.

216
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,300
So Hina walked along the rainbow in the night sky, leaving
her husband behind and heading to the moon all by herself.

217
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
This can't go on!

218
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,300
I need to hold myself back a bit more,
so Ayaka won't end up disliking me.

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,700
- Hello, Ayaka?
- Hi, Hiroko-san!

220
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:55,775
I've decided to stay one more night.

221
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Ah! Really?

222
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:58,500
Did something go wrong?

223
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,300
No, it's nothing! Work's already wrapped up smoothly.
I just thought I'd go back with Hiroko-san tomorrow.

224
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
- Yeah.
- So...

225
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Do you want to come to my room?

226
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
Got it, I'll be right there.

227
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
What's this?

228
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Wh-why are we in such a luxurious place?

229
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,400
Putting on a samurai-like expression...

230
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Hiroko-san.

231
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I want to have an honest talk with you.

232
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,000
Honestly... talk things out?

233
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
I have something I want
to ask you, Hiroko-san.

234
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,099
Are you listening, Hiroko-san?

235
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,720
I'm listening!

236
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,460
I'm listening!

237
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:31,500
Are you really?

238
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,340
No way!

239
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,500
I just made up my mind to restrain
myself so I won't end up being disliked!

240
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,800
How can you get so excited
over something so simple!

241
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Yesterday...

242
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,800
Hearing it was just an attempt... Hiroko-san,
didn't you say that was a good thing?

243
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Yes...

244
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,100
What was so great about it?

245
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,799
Th... That's...

246
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,520
That really shocked me, you know?

247
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Yes.

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
So that Ayaka won't hate me.

249
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,400
I absolutely have to stop
myself from making a move!

250
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Does Hiroko-san
still not like it after all?

251
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:17,867
Don't people say that when there's a full moon,
your inner strength and potential get awakened,

252
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:19,900
and your luck gets a boost too?

253
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,280
No, I really have to make up my mind today.

254
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,700
To become a real couple.

255
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,600
Please grant me strength,
oh Goddess of the Moon!

256
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,200
If you have any thoughts,
please let me know!

257
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,804
Ah, so cute!

258
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,400
No, no! If I touch it now, it'll end up
just like the story of the Moon Goddess!

259
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,200
Oh, right, I've got some
of CoCo's cookies here!

260
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,460
- Go ahead, eat up!
- Cookies?

261
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,599
More than anything, I just
wish you'd come over to my side.

262
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,899
You look like you're a little cold.

263
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,199
There's a blanket here, do you want to put it on?

264
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,160
Come on!

265
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,509
Wow, I'm not cold at all!

266
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,080
- Come over here instead.
- You look really tired!

267
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,876
- Want to do some stretches? One, two, three, four.
- Even though you're stretching out a lot…

268
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
- Two, two, three, four.
- But I'm not here to do stretches!

269
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,700
This isn't going to work.

270
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
If that's the case!

271
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,700
Wow! I can't believe
there's a move like that!

272
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,800
Please don't run away.

273
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,800
I want to be with Hiroko-san

274
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,008
to become a real couple!

275
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,400
For real...

276
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
My determination.

277
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,700
Did it get through?

278
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Hiroko-san.

279
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hiroko-san... I...

280
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm so happy.

281
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,500
Good morning, world!

282
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,000
This is already a timeline where
we've been through this before!

283
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:11,782
Life is beautiful!

284
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,500
Aloha... My love... is all for you♡

285
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:18,555
Now, my relationship with
Hiroko-san is bound to change!

286
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,100
Good morning, Hiroko-san.

287
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,700
Hiroko-san?

288
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm going to take a shower.

289
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,199
Finally home.

290
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Yeah.

291
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,599
You can take a shower now.

292
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,500
Hiroko-san, please go in first.

293
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,950
It's okay.

294
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:23,200
Ayaka, you go first.

295
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Wait... are we supposed to shower together?

296
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,080
No need.

297
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,000
Ayaka, you go ahead.

298
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,100
I'm going to pack my things.

299
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,479
(Next Episode)
Hiroko-san, take care on your way.

300
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,400
Why?

301
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:37,959
Once it's over, won't we
become a real couple?

302
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,909
Could this be what they
call the relationship slump?

303
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,860
- A rough patch?
- Hiroko actually cares a lot about Ayaka!

304
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,300
- What does it really mean to be a true couple?
- Jun!

305
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:49,985
Never look directly into Jun's eyes!

306
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,900
Ah! It's already too late...

307
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,800
I have absolutely no idea
what Hiroko-san is thinking.

308
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,500
If you want to be together,
you have to endure.
