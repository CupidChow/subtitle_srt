1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(I would like to be alone for a while.
Please don't come looking for me.)

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
Hiro-chan, I miss you so much!

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,430
Tsumugi.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,510
Tsumugi said that no matter what,
she wants to give you the stuff today.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,710
Tsumugi, here.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,430
Here, this is the souvenir from the honeymoon.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,230
Thank you.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,790
But...

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm a little… right now.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,190
You're off today, right?

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,080
Is Hiro-chan's boyfriend here?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,820
Since I rarely get the chance,
I thought I'd say hi to him.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,500
Sorry to bother you~

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,760
Tsumugi!

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,870
Sorry about that~

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,480
Wow!

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,700
What a great room.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,270
As expected of Hiro-chan, you really have great taste!

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,510
No, not at all...

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,250
So?

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,360
What about your boyfriend?

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,060
Not here.

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,010
Oh, is that so.

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,330
Will he be back soon?

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,010
It's Ayaka!

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,400
Ayaka is...

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,010
The one we ran into last time?

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,270
Hmm...

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,400
Hey!

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,990
You still have photos with your coworkers up as decorations.

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,540
Hiro-chan is smiling so happily.

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,640
Yeah.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,620
Because being with Ayaka makes me really happy.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,420
Hiro-chan, do you like Ayaka?

35
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,690
Hmm...

36
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,930
I do.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,050
I love her the most.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,240
It's Ayaka.

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,640
Huh?

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,540
She lives with me.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,170
Not a boyfriend.

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,590
It's Ayaka.

43
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:08,840
Huh?

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,190
So are Hiro-chan and Ayaka family?

45
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,880
I don't know if we're family.

46
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,870
With Ayaka...

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,440
I hope that even when we become old ladies,
we can still live in the same house.

48
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,040
What does that... mean?

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,940
I...

50
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,900
I'm dating Ayaka.

51
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,100
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,500
(Episode 6: I'll never treat you like a stranger.)

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,380
Dating...

54
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,170
Are you serious?

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,460
Yeah.

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,420
That's not…

57
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,500
something Ayaka-san insisted that you say, right?

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,310
No, it's not like that.

59
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,860
I really like Ayaka, too.

60
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,080
As a woman.

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,740
So, in other words...

62
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,850
Hiro-chan is...

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,260
a "lesbian"?

64
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,700
Yeah.

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,730
I've never said it out loud.

66
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,540
Sorry.

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,270
I knew it.

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,270
Hiro-chan really is different!

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,850
Huh?

70
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,780
Gay people...

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,860
You all insist on being yourselves. That's so cool!

72
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,030
It's like being the main character in a story.

73
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,370
I knew you're totally different from someone like me
who's been ordinary since birth.

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not like that…

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,610
So, does that mean you two are thinking about getting married?

76
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,890
Hm?

77
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,690
Ah!

78
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,610
You can't do it in Japan yet, right?

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
Then are you thinking about going abroad?

80
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,640
Ah, no...

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,160
I'll help out.

82
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,980
I also hope that someone like Hiro-chan can experience true happiness.

83
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,260
True happiness...

84
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,520
Um, Keiko.

85
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,550
Don't worry.

86
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,770
Huh?

87
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,600
For me, being with Ayaka

88
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,310
really makes me happy.

89
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,340
I see.

90
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,760
Yeah.

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,640
Hiro-chan.

92
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,940
You're really so cool, just as I thought.

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,060
Keiko, you...

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,340
You always say that.

95
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,600
But I've always thought you were really cool.

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,830
Me?

97
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,840
No way.

98
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,450
Keiko, you know.

99
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,500
You've always been so straightforward since you were little.

100
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,630
Working hard, getting married.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,690
You and your husband have a great relationship too.

102
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,500
You also raised Tsumugi so well.

103
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,210
I think...

104
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,490
Keiko, you're able to truly cherish the people who matter to you.

105
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,130
That's honestly really impressive.

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,780
Things like that...

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,860
are just ordinary.

108
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,200
Not ordinary at all.

109
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,700
It's actually something

110
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,370
really special and super cool.

111
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,090
Hey, Tsumugi.

112
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,610
You also think Mom is really cool, right?

113
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,190
Yeah!

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,350
Mom can fold clothes perfectly just using her feet!

115
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,870
- That's so cool!
- Huh?

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,250
- So cool!
- Tsumugi!

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,460
Just with her feet?

118
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't say weird things!

119
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,670
No, don't listen to her.

120
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,530
Sorry.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,300
I should get going soon.

122
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,880
Enjoy the sweets together with Ayaka-san.

123
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,650
Thank you.

124
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,150
Then let's go too.

125
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,820
Ayaka?

126
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,940
Hiroko-san.

127
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,340
Thank goodness, you're safe.

128
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,670
You saw the note, right?

129
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,540
Please let me have some time alone.

130
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,380
It must all be my fault, right?

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,920
Why are you apologizing?

133
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,440
It's all because I'm so useless.

134
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,230
I made Ayaka feel uneasy, didn't I.

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll do it even better next time, so...

136
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,450
Huh?

137
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,550
Ayaka?

138
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
I knew it...

139
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,250
You don't understand anything.

140
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,890
Hiroko...

141
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,030
I don't care about you anymore!

142
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,950
Huh?

143
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,630
Hey, wait up, Ayaka!

144
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,830
Hey!

145
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,770
So fast!

146
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,960
I said wait a second, Ayaka!

147
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,800
Ayaka, I'm sorry.

148
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,820
So what exactly are you apologizing for?

149
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,820
I clearly said “Please don't look for me”, but you still came.

150
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,830
Of course I'd go look for you.

151
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,480
From the very beginning, dating Hiroko was never even possible!

152
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,130
That's not true at all!

153
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,450
Then...

154
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,360
Why won't you touch me?

155
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,470
Huh?

156
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,470
I heard you used to get all cozy with those other girls so easily.

157
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,560
You...

158
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,010
You pervy big-boobed demon!

159
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,280
If you put it that way,

160
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,060
Ayaka, didn't you also get close with Jun…

161
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,770
Miss Jun?

162
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,650
Never mind.

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,650
Huh?

164
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,720
Ayaka!

165
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,140
What do you mean by "Never mind"?

166
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,210
There's definitely something going on, isn't there.

167
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,950
Let's just forget about this!

168
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,890
I'll get rid of all my bad habits!

169
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,150
Come back!

170
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,120
Why are you avoiding my question?

171
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,920
I already told you.

172
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,010
Our family just has this kind of bloodline...

173
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,150
It'll make things difficult for Ayaka.

174
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,590
Bloodline?

175
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,600
So,

176
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,570
this is...

177
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,950
How should I put this...

178
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,190
You've been hemming and hawing this whole time.

179
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,360
If you have something you want to say, just say it clearly.

180
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,760
No, that's not it.

181
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
So.

182
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,570
Speaking of which...

183
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,470
This is my problem.

184
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,640
It has nothing to do with you, Ayaka.

185
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,260
What do you mean by “nothing to do with you”?

186
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,950
Ayaka!

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,250
I...

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm Hiroko-san's girlfriend, right?

189
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,760
You...

190
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,700
You big idiot!

191
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,270
Big idiot?

192
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,000
Ayaka, wait a second.

193
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,200
Ayaka, please.

194
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,860
Listen to me!

195
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,050
I've always been willing to listen!

196
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,330
Isn't it you who doesn't want to talk?

197
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,980
That is...

198
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,730
I think,

199
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,950
for Hiroko-san's sake,

200
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,270
we shouldn't stay together anymore.

201
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,660
With me being like this,

202
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,810
You can't really see me as your girlfriend, can you?

203
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,770
Since you can't even touch me,

204
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,050
and I can't even tell you how I really feel,
you might as well just forget about me.

205
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,990
Why don't you just hurry up and find your next girl already!

206
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,460
Words like that...

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,610
I don't want to hear that from you, Ayaka!

208
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,730
I'm just...

209
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,910
I'm afraid that if I tell you everything, you'll end up hating me.

210
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm just an outrageous desire monster.

211
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,360
Up until now, I've only had reckless love affairs.

212
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,740
A tragic mess like me has completely lost control,

213
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,110
making a move on you, Ayaka.

214
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,880
If you ever left me, Ayaka...

215
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,610
Just thinking about this happiness disappearing,

216
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,810
I really can't take it.

217
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm sorry...

218
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,060
for not being able to become the girlfriend you wanted.

219
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,650
You...

220
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,250
You big idiot!

221
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,840
Big idiot?

222
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,140
Up until now, what have you really seen in me?

223
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,040
Do you have any idea
how many challenges we've overcome together?

224
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,000
The trust between us...

225
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,450
Is it really so fragile?

226
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,960
But...

227
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,290
Those completely honest words...

228
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,620
are just what I've always wanted to hear.

229
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,470
I deliberately said a lot of harsh things.

231
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,330
I felt like I have to have a fight with Hiroko.

232
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,590
So...

233
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,830
I looked up all kinds of different words.

234
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,460
I...

235
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,570
I won't leave you.

236
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,290
You don't need to be perfect.

237
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,360
Even if Hiroko is a tragic monster,

238
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,040
just bring it on.

239
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,990
So...

240
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,580
From now on, please tell me everything.

241
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,200
I won't hold back anymore either
I'll just say it straight out.

242
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,950
Sorry.

243
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,400
From now on,

244
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,940
let's just argue as much as we want.

245
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,870
Yeah.

246
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,010
You cry way too much!

247
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,110
Hmm, this is really tasty.

248
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,750
Tell Tsumugi I said thiank you.

249
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,320
Um, about that.

250
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,460
I told Keiko about Ayaka.

251
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,150
Is that okay?

252
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,490
Yeah.

253
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,020
You didn't force yourself, did you?

254
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,090
No.

255
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,910
Because I couldn't really say it properly at the wedding.

256
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,950
I'm really glad I was able to say it out loud.

257
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,520
Hiroko-san.

258
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,740
But, you know.

259
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,760
I never really thought I'd actually talk to my family about it.

260
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,330
I have no regrets.

261
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,680
Hiroko-san.

262
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,980
Huh?

263
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,780
Let's build a house.

264
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,270
A house?

265
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,630
It's a place where you can see the sky from your room.

266
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,330
A really big house.

267
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,690
There's a big tree in the yard.

268
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,410
And there's also a white dog.

269
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,170
That's really specific.

270
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,100
Why did you suddenly say you want to build a house?

271
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,720
Um...

272
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,300
I took a look without asking.

273
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,490
Sorry.

274
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,280
But...

275
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,950
Hiroko's childhood dream.

276
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,690
Shall we make it come true together?

277
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,630
I...

278
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,180
Even when I become an old lady,

279
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,830
I want to be with Hiroko.

280
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,380
Let's build a house.

281
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,620
Let's keep living together forever.

282
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,210
Okay.

283
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,380
For an ending that belongs only to us...

284
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,240
let us

285
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,500
decide together.

286
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,270
A home for just the two of us...

287
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,710
A future that happy.

288
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,200
I never thought I could even imagine it.

289
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,020
Seriously.

290
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,360
Hiroko's really a crybaby today!

291
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,570
You really won't hate me?

292
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,780
You're so annoying.

293
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,980
It runs in our family bloodline that...

294
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,700
we are easily jealous.

295
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,110
What's with you going on and on about that “bloodline” thing?

296
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,100
If you get jealous because of me, I'd be really happy.

297
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh, really.

298
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,570
Ah.

299
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,510
But.

300
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,010
That time when you didn't come home until morning.

301
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,380
I still can't accept it.

302
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,060
I'll listen carefully to your explanation.

303
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,030
Y-Yes!

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Alright.

305
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,970
And then, I'm really sorry.

306
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,620
OK, OK, oh!

307
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,530
It's out!

308
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,990
Look!

309
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,660
So pretty.

310
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,460
You went to Hiroko's place?

311
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,530
Yeah.

312
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,620
Because Tsumugi said she wants to give her the sweets directly.

313
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,580
Oh, really!

314
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,460
Was Ayaka-san there too?

315
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,890
Huh?

316
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,620
Mom, did you...

317
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,360
did you already know about the two of them?

318
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,070
Because...

319
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,200
they said that back then.

320
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,620
Do you really like Hiroko?

321
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,110
Wait a second, Mom.

322
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,650
Yes.

323
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,290
About that.

324
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,270
That's how I truly feel, there's not a single bit of pretense.

325
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,200
Well then...

326
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,800
About Hiro-chan...

327
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,310
liking girls...

328
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,740
Did you already know, too?

329
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,590
Of course.

330
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,300
Ever since way back,
she was always drawing tons of pictures of brides.

331
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,670
I think she's probably more interested in girls than in guys.

332
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,100
So that's how it is.

333
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,910
After all, I've raised her since she was little.

334
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,390
That much is obvious, of course!

335
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,180
Oh, really...

336
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,020
As long as she's healthy and happy, that's all that matters.

337
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,810
That girl named Ayaka is a bit of a special kid too.

338
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,540
She'd probably be a great match with Hiroko, right?

339
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,310
Yeah, maybe.

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,870
Oh no!

341
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,050
Tsumugi!

342
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,340
Don't play so rough.
You're a girl, you know…

343
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,630
As long as she's happy and healthy,
it doesn't matter what kind of kid she is.

344
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
(Ayaka is the "tempting type." As long as she makes herself smell nice,
someone like Hiroko will fall for her right away!)

345
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,800
(Kyoko said so.)
(You can do it!)

346
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,810
I absolutely have to...

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
Time to make the first move!

348
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,850
Plan of action is as follows.

349
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,840
First, set the mood with some luxurious bath oil.

350
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,400
Ayaka...

351
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,010
You smell so good.

352
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,610
Next...

353
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,430
Use body lotion to create some skin-to-skin contact.

354
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,520
Ayaka's skin.

355
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,650
So smooth...

356
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,770
And then...

357
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,020
And then, in a room lit with scented candles.

358
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,210
Kissing while sipping red wine.

359
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,070
Smooch~

360
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,920
After that...

361
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,630
Finally!

362
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,700
Alright!

363
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,930
Get your neck washed and wait for me!

364
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,690
Hiroko-san!

365
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,430
Hiroko-san, I prepared a special bath oil for you.

366
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,290
Sorry...

367
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,960
I couldn't hold back any longer.

368
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,030
The weather's really nice.

369
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,260
Good morning, Ayaka.

370
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,750
What's wrong?

371
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,480
I've never heard of that…

372
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,670
Hm?

373
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,670
That's actually amazing…

374
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,020
Isn't that what you wanted, Ayaka?

375
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,690
That's true, but…

376
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,440
But I didn't know…

377
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,370
I didn't know it'd be that amazing!

378
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,400
- What kind of face are you making?
- I'm a little embarrassed, so please don't look!

379
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,110
- Embarrassed?
- Super embarrassed!

380
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,700
- Ah! You're blushing~
- Super embarrassed.

381
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,890
You're so embarrassed, even your ears are turning red!

382
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,750
Please don't look! Seriously, it's so embarrassing!

383
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,200
You're getting way too close.

384
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,360
Why?

385
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,200
Doesn't matter!

386
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,450
This tastes really good too.

387
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,230
Yeah!

388
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,330
It's nice to slack off once in a while.

389
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,170
Yeah.

390
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,150
Definitely.

391
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,150
Well then...

392
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,220
Wanna…

393
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,250
Take a nap together?

394
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,760
I will...

395
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,610
I will not hold back anymore.

396
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,800
