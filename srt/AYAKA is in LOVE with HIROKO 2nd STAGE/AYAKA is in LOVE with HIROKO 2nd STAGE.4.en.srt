1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,600
I...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,600
with Hiroko-san...

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,600
we haven't done that kind of thing.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
We should become a real couple, too.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,700
It's a festival!!!

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,300
Oh no, did I let her drink too much?!

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,600
I think we need to become a real couple.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,420
For real?

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,080
Did my determination get through to you?

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,700
Good morning, Hiroko-san.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,800
Now, the relationship between
Hiroko-san and me is bound to change!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hiroko-san?

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm going to pack my things.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,600
I have a meeting to attend,
so I'm heading out now.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,200
Hiroko-san, take care on your way.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm heading out.

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
Huh?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
A kiss...?

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,700
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,030
Huh?

21
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,300
(Episode 3: Getting jealous is so childish)
Has Hiroko-senpai always been like this?

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Yeah.

23
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
Even when I'm sleeping...

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Hiroko-san.

25
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Good night.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Good night.

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,200
The kiss that kept me going
from morning till night is gone!

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,209
But I still think you two are pretty close.

29
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,340
Even though that's true, I still
feel like I'm being brushed off a little.

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,000
And her smile is a little strange, too.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,500
Everything else seems normal, right?

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,800
Not just normal, it's absolutely perfect.

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Just like the attentive service
of a top-class hotel hostess!

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Is this... is this a hotel breakfast?!

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
She's way busier at work than I am.

36
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,440
I don't think you need to worry so much.

37
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,740
Is that so?

38
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,989
Yeah, when things get busy, it's only natural
that there's less time for close interactions.

39
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,510
No, that's not right. Everything
just happened all of a sudden.

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
We used to be so happy.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Could it be...

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,900
This is what they call the slump phase.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,019
A rough patch?

44
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,270
What should I do, Risa! What if
Hiroko-san ends up disliking me!

45
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,479
Calm down, Ayaka!

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,590
But Hiroko-san is different
from me. She's a real veteran!

47
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,500
Hiroko-san was my first
love. I really don't get it at all…

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Maybe it's better to ask
the seniors after all, right?

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Huh?

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,170
Ah! Welcome!

51
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,700
Ayaka-chan, Risa-chan.

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,500
Sorry to interrupt!

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,309
You still carry yourself with that
same samurai spirit as always.

54
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,600
So bold!

55
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,560
I have something I'd like
to ask everyone today.

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,300
You can ask anything.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,100
Is this the start of the slump?

58
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,810
If it's a rough patch.

59
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,300
Most of the time, yes...

60
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
Everything gets turned upside down?

61
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,460
Turn everything upside down?!

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,699
They start talking less,
and their attitude gets colder.

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,900
Running off to someone else.
The worst-case scenario would be breaking up, right?

64
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,000
Break up?!

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Yeah, there are people like that too!

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,090
I'm totally devoted to my
darling Risa. Don't worry~

67
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,700
I know, I know.

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,300
But I don't think Hiroko
would ever get tired of Ayaka.

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,386
Before we even started dating, she kept going on
and on about her subordinates, it was so annoying.

70
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,600
She's never dated anyone as
long as she has with Ayaka-chan.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Really?

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,700
- Because Hiroko...
- She only ever goes for short-term flings...

73
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,489
Even if they broke up
because of a rough patch,

74
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,000
They might even get back together
because of some small chance.

75
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,000
At the end of the day, the people who come to
bars like this, it's really just a small circle.

76
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,570
That's right, the lesbian bar
scene is actually pretty small.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Really that small?

78
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,176
Your ex-girlfriend's ex-girlfriend is also your
ex-girlfriend's ex-girlfriend, that's normal.

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Hey!!

80
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
So if you mess around everywhere, things
will get completely out of hand later.

81
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Oh, come on, Risa, baby! I really
won't do that kind of thing ever again!

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Really?

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,100
Of course!

84
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,600
So please don't be mad anymore, okay?

85
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Don't ignore me, I'm sorry.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,967
Being totally controlled.

87
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:30,800
Risa-chan, you're amazing
for being able to handle Kyoko.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Um...

89
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Does that kind of conflict
only happen between women?

90
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,278
Of course, it also depends on the person,

91
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:44,638
but if someone blurs the line between love and
friendship, conflicts can definitely happen.

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,000
Some couples even end up in a mess because of
jealousy and wanting to possess each other.

93
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
A complete mess...

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,500
But I think Hiro-chan
will be just fine, don't you?

95
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,700
She really cares about Ayaka-chan.

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,886
By the way, are you two going
through a rough patch right now?

97
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,700
I honestly couldn't tell at all.

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
I don't know…

99
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,999
Back at the hot spring resort in Hawaii, I really
thought things were going smoothly between us...

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
Huh?

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Things are going great!

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
Congratulations!

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Thank you!

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,640
That was the best feeling ever!

105
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,399
Hey! Come on, tell us all about it and more details!

106
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,799
Hey, Kyoko-san! That's way too personal!

107
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
What does it matter?

108
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:32,300
This was the night when Hiroko embraced the
pure-hearted Ayaka-chan—definitely a night to remember!

109
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Well...

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,300
My whole body was caressed so smoothly, it felt amazing!

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,000
Hiroko-san's hand gently caressed my leg.

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,900
Starting from my calf, her hand
slowly moved up to my thigh.

113
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,000
My heart's racing now.

114
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
And then her hand slid down to my waist.

115
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,200
Hiroko-san...

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Sometimes it's an intense sensation,
and other times it's a gentle caress.

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Hm?

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,000
And then slowly move
upward toward the neck.

119
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,140
Gentle yet intense.

120
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,700
That feels so good there.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Got a good squeeze!

122
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,980
That is...

123
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,000
Finally, Hiroko-san's hand
gently caressed my cheek.

124
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,970
Hiroko-san.

125
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,300
I...

126
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,000
So happy...

127
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,900
I... I didn't know because
it was my first time...

128
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
So that's what it feels like, it's so comfortable!

129
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,900
The swelling in my legs has gone down, and
my shoulders are moving much more easily now.

130
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
- Ayaka...
- Hm?

131
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,710
Um...

132
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,100
That's not right.

133
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
Not right?

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,700
Um... wasn't that a full-body massage?

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
A... massage?!

136
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,760
No way.

137
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,999
Every part of my body feels so comfortable!

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
Well, it is a massage, after all.

139
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,499
The way the pressure
changes is really impressive.

140
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,540
- Even my lower back feels lighter now.
- That's the magic of a good massage.

141
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,270
My metabolism's improved too.
I feel like a whole new person!

142
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,000
That's the magic of a good massage.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
How could this happen?

144
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,000
That guy backed down. What a coward.

145
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Alright.

146
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Alright, thank you.

147
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,690
Sorry to trouble you.

148
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,300
Sorry for being rude.

149
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Ayaka has probably already gone back...

150
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
Hiroko-san.

151
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's go grab a drink…

152
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Hiroko-san, why?

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Why a massage?

154
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,999
It's alright, there's really
no one right way to do things.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,059
Yeah.

156
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,079
Risa was just a clueless
little puppy at first, too.

157
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,069
Now she's a wolf who'll bare her fangs.

158
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,400
Hey, Kyoko-san!

159
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
No way?! Risa's the top?!

160
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,389
What a surprise.

161
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,400
Do you hate it?

162
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Hiro-chan, you know...

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,600
She really cherishes Ayaka-chan, you know.

164
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Cherish...?

165
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Yeah.

166
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,999
So...

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,400
I think she probably doesn't
want to make a move so easily.

168
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,400
The more I care about her... the more
I wish she'd reach out and touch me.

169
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,100
Hiroko-san's feelings.

170
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,100
I don't get it at all.

171
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Ayaka-chan...

172
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Welcome!

173
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Oh my!

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,149
Hi.

175
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,449
Jun?!

176
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,699
No way, you're back?!

177
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,600
Kyoko and Marina, long time no see.

178
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,950
That's a new face.

179
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,300
So cute!

180
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,230
Risa, sweetheart! Whatever
you do, don't look into Jun's eyes!

181
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,300
Ah! It's too late!

182
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,500
Risa, darling! Risa,
darling! Come back, quick!

183
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,109
Mama-san, I'm thirsty.

184
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,400
What would you like to drink?

185
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Anything's fine. As long as it's made
by you, Mama-san, it'll taste great.

186
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,940
Seriously! You're just
as sweet-talking as ever.

187
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,819
Hey, Jun! Tell us about things overseas!

188
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,859
Sure, what do you want to hear about?

189
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,500
Where's the most fun place?

190
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,460
Hmm... I'd say Los Angeles, probably.

191
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,009
There's a café called Planet.
It's a really interesting place.

192
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,800
It attracts a lot of open-minded people.

193
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,900
- Oh! I really want to check it out!
- Come back soon! Risa, darling!

194
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,500
Hey, who's Miss Jun?

195
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,499
She's the rival for both me and Hiroko.

196
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,300
Huh?! Hiroko-san's rival?!

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,820
She's the kind of woman who makes every
girl connected to her fall head over heels!

198
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,500
(10 years ago)

199
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
If you don't mind.

200
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,100
Wanna grab a drink together?

201
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,189
Hey, it's you again!

202
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,999
You're the one who
doesn't know when to stop!

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,069
I started the conversation
first! You back off!

204
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,299
You're the one who should back off!

205
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,899
Huh? Don't tell me you
like me or something?

206
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,959
Why are you here again today?!

207
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,850
Ugh! So annoying!

208
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:15,976
Are you a stalker or something?

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,099
- So scary, so scary.
- No way!

210
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,660
That's so disgusting.

211
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:18,755
Ah! I'm calling the police!

212
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,776
Huh?! I should be the
one calling the cops first!

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,900
Huh?! Didn't I tell you
to get out of the way?!

214
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Moscow Mule? Or Salty Dog?

215
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
What?

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,600
You're looking at the vodka, aren't you?

217
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I can also make a "Sex on the Beach."

218
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,800
Let's go with that one.

219
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
OK! It's on me.

220
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Jun's success rate at picking
people up is honestly off the charts.

221
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,756
As much as I hate to admit it, both
Hiroko and I were completely defeated.

222
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,089
Ayaka-chan and Risa should be careful too.

223
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,440
They say that anyone who's ever looked
into those eyes can't escape their fate.

224
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,870
So there really is something out
there that sounds just like a legend...

225
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,869
Actually, she just broke up
with her girlfriend recently...

226
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,900
Yeah...

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Oh...

228
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Is it really that impressive?

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,780
Everyone ends up acting strange.

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Uh...

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,500
Me... I'm not interested in
anyone except Hiroko-san.

232
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Hiroko is... who?

233
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,300
Do you like Hiroko?

234
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,830
Yes.

235
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,700
We're seriously dating.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,610
A serious relationship, huh.

237
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,600
That's great.

238
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,500
For Hiroko to be in such a serious relationship,
it looks like you've truly captivated her.

239
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,700
I don't know.

240
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Why?

241
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Hiroko-san.

242
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
She never touches me.

243
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,800
Hiroko-san, who's known as the ace, must have had
relationships with a lot of girls in the past.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,500
But why is it only me?

245
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,479
I want her to touch me more, too!

246
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,800
I just...

247
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,900
I just want us to be a real couple.

248
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,800
If you're feeling unsatisfied,
how about I keep you company?

249
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,800
I don't want to!

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,500
My heart belongs to
Hiroko and Hiroko alone!

251
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
So cute.

252
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Just like a spoiled child.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A spoiled kid?!

254
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
So innocent.

255
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't know anything.

256
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,300
Isn't it just throwing a tantrum
because your opinion wasn't accepted?

257
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
Now that you mention it, I always...

258
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I...

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,500
I want to have a deeper
relationship with Hiroko-san.

260
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
I hope we can always
be together from now on.

261
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,000
I didn't consider how Hiroko-san feels.

262
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,000
I have to make it work
today... My very first time.

263
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,800
Please accept this!

264
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
Please don't run away.

265
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,900
I want to be with Hiroko-san.

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,200
To become a real couple!

267
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400
For real?

268
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
I've always just been forcing
my own feelings onto her...

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,300
Because I was too childish.

270
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,620
So that's why she hasn't made a move on me?

271
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,800
You said you want to
be a real couple, but...

272
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,800
What does it really
mean to be a true couple?

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
Huh…?

274
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:16,700
Can I go to Kyoko-san's place today?

275
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,710
Of course!

276
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:19,800
Does sleeping together
make us a real couple?

277
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Or is it...

278
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,900
If everyone around you acknowledges
it, does that make you a "real" couple?

279
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
For example,

280
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,500
Maybe it's easier to understand
if we're talking about marriage.

281
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,000
But even though Japan now has a partnership
system, you still can't legally become spouses.

282
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,300
So, what I'm saying is…

283
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,940
The finish line, there are as
many kinds as there are couples.

284
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,600
That finish line.

285
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,500
This isn't something you
can decide on your own.

286
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
The finish line...

287
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Not just one person...

288
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,400
If you want to stay together forever

289
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,700
I just have to become more mature.

290
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
Do I have to endure it?

291
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,600
That answer.

292
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,200
It's up to you to decide.

293
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,789
It feels pretty lively today...

294
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,790
Ah!

295
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Here you go.

296
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,089
Here comes the new drink!

297
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,200
Thank you.

298
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
So cute!

299
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
Even though I get tipsy really easily...

300
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,820
How about we go check
it out together next time?

301
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Getting jealous like
that is just so childish!

302
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,300
Why is it always with Jun…

303
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
If I show possessiveness,
people will dislike me.

304
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,700
At that moment...

305
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,700
My determination.

306
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,200
Did it get through?

307
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,000
I've already put everything on the line.

308
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
But...

309
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,500
If my selfish desires
spiral out of control...

310
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,300
If this would hurt Ayaka...

311
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,500
If we want to be together...

312
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
Then I'll just have to hold back...

313
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,200
The weather's really nice…

314
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hm?

315
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Huh?

316
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Huh?!

317
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Good morning.

318
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Big sis.

319
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Last night was really amazing...

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Impressive?

321
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Me too...

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,800
That was the first time
I've ever been that bold.

323
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,800
Bold?

324
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,900
What do you mean by bold?

325
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Could it be...

326
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
I did that?!

327
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,119
(Next Episode Preview) Staying out all night
without even checking in. How irresponsible!

328
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,699
Why did you only come back in the morning?

329
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,660
Who were you with?

330
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:38,749
Why didn't you contact me?

331
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,800
Hiroko-san, you naughty
perv! You big dummy!

332
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,600
I just want to be with
Ayaka all the time, that's all.

333
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,899
I just want to be with
Hiroko-san all the time, that's all.

334
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,829
I don't want my selfish desires
to make you feel disappointed.

335
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,300
This can't go on like this!

336
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,399
Has Hiroko-san always been forcing herself?

337
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,100
I hope this happiness lasts a lifetime.
