00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,300
(2 hours ago)

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,499
- Ayaka, senpai!
- Hm?

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,419
It looks like the host
suddenly isn't feeling well...!

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,270
- Huh?
- What should we do?

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,870
We need to find someone
to fill in as soon as possible.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,039
Got it.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,339
Misato-chan, go arrange
for medical help right away!

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,000
Huh? Then where's Ayaka?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Leave it to me!

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,700
Everyone, aloha!!

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,700
First, let me introduce
our special collaboration.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,199
Pickled squid with shredded carrots

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,700
Hawaiian burger!!

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Who is that woman?!

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,359
Thank you for your hard work, senpai.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,600
You really are amazing.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,520
Yeah.

18
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,700
Leave the rest to us.
Senpai, please take a break.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Thank you.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,500
Hiroko-san lied to me. She ran off to a Hawaiian
hot spring resort with a woman I don't even know!

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Scold that husband for abandoning
his wife and fooling around outside!

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
This...

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
That's undeniable evidence!

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
He really looks cool.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,400
That kind of muscle-bound macho vibe!

26
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,490
Huh?

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,500
So that was a local event organized
by your company, Hiro-chan!

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah.

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,600
But did the person from that
event just now say something weird?

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,900
What was that again?

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Hiro-chan?

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,220
Sorry.

33
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,560
I'm feeling a bit tired.
I'll go grab a drink.

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,819
Are you okay? Do you
want me to go with you?

35
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,800
Yeah, yeah, it's fine,
don't worry about it!

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,899
Speaking of which, the
project Yuya is in charge of.

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,279
That's right, it's going to be held
at the Hawaii Hot Spring Resort!

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,700
That day, I'll be going on the
business trip in place of Yuya-senpai.

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,700
I can't believe that
event is actually this one!

40
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,060
Since I left everything to Yuya, I'm not
really up to speed on the situation myself…

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,800
I have to apologize to Ayaka!

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Hiroko-san... where are you?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
It's that person...

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Um...?

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,910
This person... is
Hiroko-san's affair partner!

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,280
I'm Toda Ayaka, and I work at
the same company as Hiroko-san.

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,100
And she's her girlfriend, too!

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,899
So that's how it is!

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,499
Thank you for always
looking after Hiro-chan!

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,000
What...

51
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
What a queenly attitude
from the main girlfriend!!

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,900
May I ask, when did you
and Hiroko-san start seeing each other?

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,399
I've already been
dating her for over a year!

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
When did it all start...?

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
Maybe it started from
the moment I was born?

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
From birth?!

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,800
This way of staking a
claim is just too powerful!!

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,500
Same here. Ever since I joined the company,
Hiroko-san has always looked out for me.

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,400
She personally taught me everything about
the ups and downs at the company, one-on-one!

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,361
If they're staking their claim,
you've got to stake yours right back!

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,500
Hiro-chan at the company...

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,100
She must look really cool!

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,410
Completely useless!!

64
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,500
So? What did you want to talk to me about?

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Um...

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,939
I don't know what you're thinking.

67
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,200
- But I'm actually Hiroko-san's girlfrie…
- Hiroko?

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,300
Are you a friend of Hiroko's?

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,350
C-could it be that this beautiful, mature
woman is also one of Hiroko-san's lovers?!

70
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,600
They're from Hiro-chan's company.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,539
Her name is Toda Ayaka.

72
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,900
Ayaka-san.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,170
Thank you for always looking after Hiroko.

74
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,100
Is this the vibe of the
main girlfriend too?!

75
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Excuse me...

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
How much do you know about Hiroko-san?

77
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,420
I even know that Hiroko-san absolutely loves
spicy food, and I know the pattern on her pajamas!

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
How much…

79
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Well...

80
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Like, does she have a row of
moles on her butt or something?

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
So cute!

82
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,999
Even I...

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,100
I've never even seen Hiroko-san's butt...
I haven't even seen her stomach yet!

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
Ayaka-san?

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Are you okay?

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
Is she not feeling well?

87
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
I...

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,300
Where did Ayaka run off to?!

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Why are you with those two?

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I...

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,600
I love her more than anyone else.

92
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I love Hiroko-san even more!!

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,170
Huh?

94
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,800
I love her...

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,699
What does that mean?

96
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
It means exactly what it says!

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,000
I see Hiroko-san as a woman, and I love
her deeply from the bottom of my heart!

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Ah!

99
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,020
Mom, Keiko! This is,
um... how should I put it?

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,268
There's just a lot going
on, though it's not… you know!

101
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,000
Huh? Mom?

102
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:28,707
My... mother and sister.

103
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Huh?

104
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Ehhhhhhhhhh~.

105
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,100
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,700
(Episode 2: Aloha... My love... This is for you♡)
I'm really, really sorry!!

107
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,499
You don't have to apologize like that.

108
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,599
No...

109
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:39,000
I had no idea it was Hiroko-san's mother and
sister who made such an embarrassing mistake!

110
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,090
Seriously! Ayaka,
you're really so careless!

111
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,900
Alright, it's about time to
get back to work, isn't it?

112
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,289
Ah, alright! I'll be heading out now!

113
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,300
Go for it!

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,900
Ayaka-san.

115
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
What I just said...

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,429
Do you really like Hiroko?

117
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,100
Mom, don't be like that.

118
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Yes.

119
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,500
About this matter.

120
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,580
This is how I truly feel.
There's not a single bit of pretense.

121
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,900
So, in other words...

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Mom.

123
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,500
It's that LGBTQ thing!

124
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,500
Ayaka-san, isn't that right?

125
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,950
Ah! I think I've heard
something like that before…

126
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,700
Don't do that! It's too...

127
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,899
Amazing! This is my first time seeing this!

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
There really are people like that!

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,300
Lately, I've been really into Thai dramas,
so I know a bit about this kind of thing.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
A drama series?

131
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,100
At event companies in Tokyo, there are a lot
of people who are on the cutting edge of fashion!

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,329
Cutting-edge fashion?

133
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,200
There's absolutely no one
like that near where I live.

134
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,230
Hiro-chan really is so cool!

135
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,500
There's no way something as dramatic as a
scene from a TV series would ever happen to me!

136
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm really sorry.

137
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,500
About the wedding
ceremony, I kept it from you...

138
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,451
No... it was actually me. I
misunderstood everything,

139
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,929
let my imagination run
wild, and totally lost control!

140
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,000
No, no, Ayaka, you didn't
do anything wrong at all.

141
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,500
I must have made you feel
uncomfortable just now, didn't I?

142
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
It was entirely my fault.

143
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm really sorry.

144
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,700
- Hiroko-san, um...
- Hiro-chan!

145
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,500
Tsumugi!

146
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
Tsumugi?

147
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,579
Hiro-chan, I miss you so much!

148
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,400
I've missed you so much too!

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
My niece.

150
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,100
That hug is way too tight!

151
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,550
Who is that?

152
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,000
This person.

153
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
She's a junior colleague at the company.

154
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,400
Hmph!

155
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Uh... seems like someone's a little upset?

156
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,769
Nice to meet you.

157
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,100
Hiroko-san and I are really
close! My name is Toda Ayaka!

158
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,200
Hmph!

159
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,100
What!

160
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,999
Hey! Excuse me.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,399
I'm Keiko's husband, Igari Daisuke.

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Come on, say your name.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,700
No, I don't want to talk to Ayaka.

164
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,000
Just call me by my name!

165
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey!

166
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,496
I'm really sorry about this…

167
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,959
It's all right, this kid is
really straightforward.

168
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,700
You can't do that, Tsumugi.

169
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,760
Because Tsumugi loves
Hiro-chan more than anyone else!

170
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,299
I love her even more than Ayaka does!

171
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,700
What! There's no way I'm going to lose!

172
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,499
I like her even more!

173
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,399
I like her even more!

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,999
I like her even more!

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,900
I like her even more!

176
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,999
What are you talking about?

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,620
Oh, right.

178
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,299
Hiroko-san, my parents are
here. Let me introduce you to them.

179
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,900
Absolutely!

180
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,915
It's really been a long
time since we last met.

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,500
- How have you been lately?
- I'm good.

182
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Thank you for always looking after Keiko.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
At least it's not an affair.

184
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:21,269
But..

185
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,400
- I just have this feeling!
- Ayaka-senpai, could I have a word with you?

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,688
Feels like she's taking on
everything by herself again…

187
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:30,061
Huh?

188
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,780
I just have this feeling...

189
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,580
I just have this feeling...

190
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,483
So frustrating!!

191
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,229
So Hiroko-san, have you been working
in Tokyo ever since you graduated?

192
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,900
Yes.

193
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,000
I've been living in Tokyo
for quite a long time now.

194
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,979
I heard from Keiko that your
English is really fluent, too.

195
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,180
No, honestly, I'm not that confident.

196
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,819
- I just studied abroad in the US before.
- Oh, I see.

197
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,590
So I guess it's not too bad...

198
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,600
Isn't she cool? She's
the sister I'm so proud of!

199
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,659
Just now, I even ran into a girl
who's genuinely fallen for Hiro-chan…

200
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,500
Let's not bring that up…

201
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,729
But I can totally see why
someone would look up to her!

202
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,000
She's so natural even around kids like that.
Hiro-chan really is so gentle!

203
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,761
Keiko, it's better not to share
too many personal things...

204
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:23,829
Why not?

205
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,400
Hiro-chan is popular with both guys and girls.
Everyone loves her!

206
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,200
Even young, adorable
girls have a crush on her!

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,600
That's so like Hiro-chan!

208
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,300
But Hiro-chan already
has a wonderful boyfriend…

209
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,700
I see.

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,310
So... Hiroko came to attend her
younger sister's wedding, right?

211
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah...

212
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,209
I think she's hiding it from me.

213
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,800
It's probably because she can't
talk to me about things at home.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,169
It's true, with Hiroko's personality,
she probably overthinks things a lot.

215
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,170
Yeah.

216
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm not really sure about the details.

217
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,300
I just feel like Hiroko-san...

218
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,500
Once again, she's taking
everything on by herself for my sake…

219
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,700
I... don't want Hiroko-san to
worry about everything all by herself.

220
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,700
How can we build a relationship where
we can truly be honest with each other...?

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hmm...

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,120
There's no point in worrying about
that and getting all flustered, Ayaka-chan.

223
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,600
Ms. Kyoko?

224
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,999
Everyone's here, too.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is that okay?

226
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,569
I heard about it from Risa.

227
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,400
You haven't slept with her yet?

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,500
That's right!

229
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
Hiroko's such a perv. Once she's done it just
once, that thick skull of hers will finally get it!

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Really?

231
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

232
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,900
Seriously, don't say things like that!

233
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,799
That's right! Ayaka-chan, you're at the Hawaii
Hot Spring Resort right now, aren't you?

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,869
Isn't this the perfect opportunity?

235
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,600
The right occasion?

236
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,336
Exactly, Ayaka-chan, what you're missing
is the right mood and the perfect setting!

237
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,329
Someone like Hiroko? She's a piece of cake.

238
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah, totally. She's such a flirt.

239
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,300
Hey, isn't that a bit too casual to say?

240
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Yeah, that's right.

241
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:18,400
Hiro-chan has been
thinking a lot about it, too.

242
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,499
After thinking about it for so long, I ended
up making my girlfriend worry like that.

243
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,300
Isn't that putting the
cart before the horse?

244
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,000
Hmm... that's true.

245
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,900
When you throw yourself into it, body
and soul, all your worries will disappear.

246
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
This is exactly what I've been missing.

247
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
The mood and the setting.

248
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Ayaka?

249
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,200
Thank you, everyone.

250
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,900
I'm going for it!!

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,600
Hey! What are you doing?!

252
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,500
If our bodies and hearts
collide completely bare,

253
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
You two can definitely
become a real couple!!

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,100
Wait! Ayaka? Aya...

255
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Hung up...

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,100
Ayaka-chan is really something else!

257
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,100
It's like charging straight ahead, just like a wild boar!

258
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,000
I wonder if she's okay.

259
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm exhausted.

260
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Ayaka must still really
care about it, huh...

261
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
My family found out about it in that way...

262
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,100
She must have really wanted
me to introduce her properly...

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,700
I really wanted to cherish her more...

264
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm such an idiot.

265
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,300
That day, too.

266
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Last night.

267
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,400
That's really impressive.

268
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Even though I don't remember what happened.

269
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:07,000
Looks like I messed up.

270
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Sigh...

271
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:17,000
What should I do to make things right...?

272
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,700
To a kid that straightforward.

273
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,900
About that matter.

274
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,704
This is how I truly feel.
There's not a single bit of pretense.

275
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't want her to get hurt again.

276
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Who is it?

277
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,789
Hiroko-san, may I bother you for a moment?

278
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,700
Ayaka! I'm opening the door right now!

279
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,799
Ayaka...

280
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,300
Um... how should I put this...

281
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Hiroko-san.

282
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We...

283
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
I think we... need to become a real couple!

284
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,060
- For real?
- Yes.

285
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,200
That's why I've made up my mind.

286
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
What?

287
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,500
I want you to feel my true feelings!

288
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,600
I'll dance for Hiroko-san and no one else!

289
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Okay.

290
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Found it.

291
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Music.

292
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,100
In ancient Hawaii, before
the written word existed.

293
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,299
The hula took the place of words.

294
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:16,300
It became an important means of communicating
emotions between the gods and people.

295
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,409
Even without words, I know
I can get my feelings across!

296
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,489
Let my feelings reach you!

297
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,700
Hiroko-san.

298
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,500
Aloha... My love... This is for you♡.

299
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Thank you.

300
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Ayaka.

301
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Did my feelings get through?

302
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,700
Even though I have absolutely
no idea what this dance means.

303
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,900
All I know is that Ayaka is super cute!!

304
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
Not at all!

305
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,500
Hiroko-san, I've always
longed to go to Hawaii.

306
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
I see!

307
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Yes.

308
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,000
If I had to make memories,
I'd want to choose Hawaii.

309
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,300
But honestly, this place feels less like Hawaii
and more like a Hawaiian hot spring resort.

310
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
W-w-w-w-what?!

311
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Hiroko-san.

312
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,900
Today...

313
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
My first time.

314
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,120
Please accept it!

315
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,300
Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold on!!

316
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,500
First time?

317
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Yes.

318
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Um...

319
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,000
Didn't you already do it a few days ago?

320
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,100
- Huh?
- What?

321
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
I haven't done it before…

322
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Huh?

323
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,700
We haven't done it!!

324
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,770
You didn't do it?!

325
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:25,500
That's right!!

326
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Hiroko-san is drunk.

327
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,400
Today is... festival day!!!

328
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,700
Took off her clothes and started dancing.

329
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500
Made a huge mess in the
room, causing a total ruckus.

330
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,500
And then just fell asleep like that!!

331
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,100
So I didn't even get touched, not even a finger…

332
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:57,184
Could it be that you don't remember?

333
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,500
That's..

334
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,800
That's...?

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's such a relief!!

336
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,300
So... that's such a relief?!

337
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,599
I see, so nothing happened...!

338
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,790
That's great!

339
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,300
I didn't accidentally make a move!

340
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,499
That's great! She didn't get hurt!

341
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,249
What do you mean by "That's great"?!

342
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,600
Does that mean you don't have
those kinds of feelings for me?!

343
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,860
Hiroko-san.

344
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Um...

345
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,400
Once I let my guard down,
I suddenly feel sleepy.

346
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Ayaka.

347
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,400
Let's sleep together.

348
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Huh?

349
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Come over here.

350
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Is that okay?

351
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Of course.

352
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
Let's sleep close together.

353
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Alright!

354
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Ayaka is so warm and
soft, it feels wonderful!

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Ayaka is such a cutie today, too!

356
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Hm?

357
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,600
Ayaka is living her best life again today, how wonderful!

358
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is...

359
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Ayaka is the most special
person in the whole world!

360
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,535
No way.

361
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,500
Now it's just like usual.

362
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,100
Hiroko-san, it's not like that, I...

363
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Why?

364
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,000
Why did it turn out like this?

365
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,299
My first experience.

366
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,500
When will it finally happen?!

367
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,899
- Next episode preview-
How about getting married?

368
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,689
Inner strength.

369
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,160
Luck is on the rise.

370
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,179
I need to be more disciplined,
so Ayaka won't dislike me.

371
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,000
I really want to become a
real couple with Hiroko-san.
