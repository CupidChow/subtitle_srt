1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
The weather is really nice.

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Huh?

3
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,200
Good morning, Hiroko-san.

4
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,740
Why am I completely naked?

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Hiroko-san.

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Last night...

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,800
That was really amazing.

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,300
Amazing?

9
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,900
So bold.

10
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,540
It's my first time seeing this.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Bold.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Oh no.

13
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,900
I can't believe she actually
made a move on Ayaka.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

15
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,400
(A few days ago)

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,779
- I'm heading out now.
- Hiroko-san.

17
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,199
(Episode 1: Get rid of spoiling! Welcome a passionate night!)
Do your best today, too!

18
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,709
Yeah, you too, Ayaka.

19
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,500
I'll do my very best!

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,000
For that reason.

21
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,600
Got it, got it.

22
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
I'm heading out.

23
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,000
Safe travels, Hiroko-san.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,300
The best mornings, the best every day.

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,000
It's been half a year since I
started living with Hiroko-san.

26
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,800
Good night, Hiroko-san.

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,100
Good night, Ayaka.

28
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,100
Let's sleep together.
Waking up together.

29
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Mm, it's really tasty.

30
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, come on, you got it all over yourself!

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,100
Let's eat together.
Laughing together.

32
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,919
- Never thought there would be days like this.
- Do you like strawberry jam?

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,400
Yeah, I really like it.

34
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm so happy, it feels
like I'm about to melt.

35
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
It was supposed to be like this...

36
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,280
I just have this feeling...

37
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,000
I just have this feeling...

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,610
Isn't it just super sweet?

39
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,700
What exactly are you not satisfied with?

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,900
I just have this feeling, but I
can't really put it into words...

41
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,860
I'm wondering if this is
really the right thing to do.

42
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
The right thing to do?

43
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,510
Oh, come on, you got it on you!

44
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,000
Ayaka really is such a cutie.

45
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,388
Cutie?

46
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,900
Sorry, I was supposed
to make breakfast today.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
It's all right, it's all right.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,256
Ayaka, it's totally fine if you
sleep in until the very last minute.

49
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
But...

50
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,670
Ayaka, you just need to stay right here.

51
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,500
Just stay here...?

52
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,107
Ah, I forgot to clean up.

53
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,700
No problem, I've already taken care of it.

54
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Ayaka, it's amazing that you
made it through another day.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's impressive!

56
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,150
Leave it to me.
I'll do it.

57
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,400
Just being alive is enough...?

58
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Ah.

59
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,829
My mom used to say
the same thing to our cat.

60
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,700
A cat?

61
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,920
Is Hiroko the doting type?

62
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,169
That's a bit surprising.

63
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,800
And isn't it true that when you live
together, your flaws become even more obvious?

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,820
Not at all.

65
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm the only one who keeps
exposing my own flaws.

66
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,700
How are things going
between Risa and Miss Risako?

67
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Huh?

68
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,400
You're blushing way too obviously...

69
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,030
Amazing at night!

70
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,369
Hey! Whispering is totally pointless!

71
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,600
And then? And then?

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
From head to toe, all over the body.

73
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,600
And there are also changes in intensity.

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,300
Your metabolism will even get better!

75
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Yeah.

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,100
It's completely beyond what I imagined.

77
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,900
This is my first time dating a girl
too, so I honestly don't really get it.

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
But I'm really happy.

79
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Our family...

80
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
It's completely different.

81
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,600
Huh?

82
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:50,000
I... haven't done that kind
of thing with Hiroko-san yet.

83
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,900
Hey!

84
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,100
For real?

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm really happy to hear how Ayaka feels.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,600
So could you wait for me a little
longer, until I've sorted out my feelings?

87
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,780
Even though that's what
she said at the time...

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,799
When will you be ready?

89
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,189
Isn't that taking way too long!?

90
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,019
But, things like this really depend on how
you feel. It's not a race to see who's faster.

91
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,400
Risa, please, give me some advice.

92
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,875
Give you advice...?

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm back.

94
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,400
Huh?
It's on fire!

95
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Fire...

96
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,540
Huh? What kind of act is this?

97
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Christmas?

98
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
Hiroko-san.

99
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Welcome back.

100
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Ayaka...?

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ayaka.

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
What on earth is this...?

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,580
Hiroko-san always works so hard, so
today is a day to show our appreciation.

104
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Oh, so that's how it is!

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,700
Oh wow, this is such a delight!

106
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,049
Actually, I was just
saying that to be polite.

107
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,710
Risako always lights candles and plays
beautiful music, helping me truly relax.

108
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,200
With this, the relaxation
effect is just amazing.

109
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,600
Please take this as well.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Is it red wine?

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you.

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
Risako really enjoys drinking
red wine, so she has it often.

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,600
When you're just a little tipsy,
the nerves start to melt away.

114
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,129
It's been a while since I had
some, but I really do love red wine.

115
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,200
Please have a little more.

116
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,100
- Come on, come on.
- If you keep drinking this much, you're going to get drunk~

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,009
If red wine can help you relax and
ease your nerves, then that's your chance.

118
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:26,700
At first, I was really shy... but I think...
I've truly become a real couple with Risako.

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,000
We're going to become a real couple, too.

120
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
I just have this feeling.

121
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,800
It's so warm.

122
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,800
My whole body feels hot...

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I...

124
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,100
I want to take my relationship
with Hiroko-san to a deeper level.

125
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,500
I hope we can always, always
be together from now on.

126
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,360
Say goodbye to being spoiled!

127
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
Let's welcome a blazing hot night!

128
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,600
Hiroko-san.

129
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,819
I don't remember anything.

130
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,100
Last night...

131
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
That was really amazing.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,500
I don't remember anything.

133
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,050
Did you really make a move on Ayaka?

134
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Hiroko-san...

135
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
You idiot.

136
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Today is...

137
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Festival time!!!

138
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,300
Oh no, did I let her drink too much!?

139
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
My pet, oh yeah!

140
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Huh?

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Huh...?

142
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Hiroko-san?

143
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,550
Hey!

144
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,800
How did it end up like that?

145
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,500
Nothing's going my way at all.

146
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,730
Ah, Ayaka, can I have a word with you?

147
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,330
Yuya-senpai, what's wrong?

148
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,600
No, it's just that...

149
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Ayaka, could you cover for
me on this business trip today?

150
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,900
I might have to make an
appearance at another event...

151
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,100
Sure, no problem.

152
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,760
That's the local food event, right?

153
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,129
That's right, thank you. You're
really helping me out a lot.

154
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,020
It's a really warm place over there, so take
the chance to relax a bit while you're at it.

155
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:37,044
Sure.

156
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,100
Ayaka, could you take a
look at this proposal for me?

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,239
That's the panel about romance, right?

158
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
That's right, exactly.

159
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,380
Ayaka, your perspective is always so unique, and
you always come up with great ideas every time.

160
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,860
Ayaka, you really are
someone everyone can count on.

161
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,200
“Scolding husbands who abandon
their wives to seek pleasure elsewhere!”

162
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,400
This is...

163
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,850
Ah, that one's a bit too sensational.

164
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,570
Feels like a proposal that's going to
get eliminated, so don't worry about it.

165
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Could it be...

166
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
The reason you're not
making a move on me is...

167
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Could it be...

168
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,274
an affair!

169
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Huh?

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,080
What are you talking about?

171
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Sorry.

172
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,850
You finally made it to the shop.
So what's got you worried again?

173
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,100
Mama-san...

174
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,792
I might have made a move on Ayaka.

175
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Huh?

176
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,600
By the way.

177
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,200
You two haven't done it yet?

178
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,620
Maybe I had too much red wine,
so I don't remember anything.

179
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,539
This isn't good. You've never been able
to hold your liquor, even back in the day.

180
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,500
Yeah, that's true.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,300
But she kept egging me
on and refilling my glass...

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,080
Still drinking like you did
when you were younger...

183
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,640
Make sure to keep an eye on
your liver numbers from now on, too.

184
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,000
Stop talking about health stuff already.

185
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:16,550
I never thought
I'd do something like this.

186
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,600
But right now, you're
dating Ayaka, aren't you?

187
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:23,315
Making a few little mistakes
isn't such a big deal, right?

188
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Me?

189
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,300
So far, haven't you been pretty wild
when it comes to relationships with women?

190
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,367
You've got a point there.

191
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:35,081
Speaking of Hiro-chan...

192
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,300
Flirting with a girl, taking her home...

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Got punished again.

194
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,400
Then, I hit on another girl... and
ended up getting punished again.

195
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,923
Still, I just couldn't learn
my lesson and hit on another girl again,

196
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,900
brought her home, and
got punished all over again.

197
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,200
Just following my desires all the way.

198
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
That's right.

199
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,575
It's a little embarrassing
to admit,

200
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,903
but I really am like a wild beast,
completely true to my own desires.

201
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,700
So...

202
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm really scared!

203
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,591
This time, even though I
didn't remember,

204
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:22,690
once I lose control, I have no
idea what might happen next.

205
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,650
I know better than
anyone that I'm a monster!

206
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,199
Do you see yourself as a green monster?

207
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,440
Ayaka is more than twelve years younger than
me, and she's also my junior at the company.

208
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,600
So when it comes to the power
dynamic, I still have the upper hand.

209
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
I don't want to do anything wrong.

210
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,400
I can understand why
you've become so cautious.

211
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
For me,

212
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:54,500
Right now is the happiest time of my life.

213
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So...

214
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,100
I absolutely don't want
to mess up Ayaka's life.

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,300
(Keiko is calling)

216
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,649
Oh no, this is bad!

217
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,650
I forgot.

218
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,009
I'm heading out!

219
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,700
- Oh, is something urgent?
- Yeah, I'll be back!

220
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Hey, hey.

221
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Seriously, Hiro-chan, you never keep in
touch with me because you're always so busy!

222
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
Sorry, sorry!

223
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,430
You didn't forget, did you?

224
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,010
Of course I didn't forget. This is my precious
little sister's wedding party, after all.

225
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, that's great!

226
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
That's right.

227
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,600
Because the pandemic kept pushing
it back, we can finally hold it now.

228
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,569
You have to come, okay?

229
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,300
Yeah.

230
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,200
- Tsumugi really wants to see you too.
- Really?

231
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,360
I really want to see Tsumugi too.

232
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,400
Oh right, you mentioned before that you
were living with someone else, didn't you?

233
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,530
Ah...

234
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh no, that's right... I mentioned it because
I couldn't come up with a better excuse.

235
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:03,041
If possible, bring them along to the party.

236
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,650
I'd like to say hello properly, too.

237
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:11,415
But it seems like they've been really busy
lately, so it might be a bit difficult.

238
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,999
Oh, come on~

239
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,600
What a shame...

240
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,299
Since it's someone you're dating, Hiro-chan.

241
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,500
He must be really handsome.

242
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,699
This matter concerns Ayaka.

243
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,000
And Keiko.

244
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,200
I can't talk about this.

245
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,700
If it really is an affair...

246
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,100
With whom, and where?

247
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm home.

248
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,200
Welcome home.

249
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,500
You went to a bar today, right?

250
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,070
Yeah.

251
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,400
I just had a little to drink.

252
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,199
Were you by yourself?

253
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,600
Yeah, but Risako and
Marina weren't there today.

254
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,500
I see.

255
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
She probably wasn't lying...

256
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,680
But I still can't help
but wonder if it's true.

257
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,280
Huh?

258
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
What's wrong?

259
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,600
Did she notice something?

260
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, right.

261
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Ayaka, do you have any
plans for this weekend?

262
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,000
That day, I have to go on a
business trip in place of Yuya-senpai.

263
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,369
Oh, is that so?

264
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes, we're giving it our all to get ready right
now. I'm sure it's going to be a lively event.

265
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,800
I see, I see.

266
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,100
Did something happen?

267
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,999
No, actually, I just happen to
be meeting my family that day.

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
I really wasn't lying...

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,169
Is that so?

270
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,000
Are you going back to your hometown?

271
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,979
It's just that kind of feeling.

272
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,200
Not bad.

273
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,359
Please enjoy your time with your family.

274
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Yeah.

275
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,439
It's not exactly a complete lie.

276
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Even though I say that.

277
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,900
My heart hurts so much.

278
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,160
Really...

279
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,400
Are you here to see your family?

280
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,900
Ah, welcome!

281
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,299
Long time no see, Mama-san.

282
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,700
Oh, Jun! It's been years
since I last saw you.

283
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,329
When did you come back to Japan?

284
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,330
A while ago.

285
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
You're as beautiful as ever, Mama-san.

286
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,400
Thank you.

287
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,899
Hiroko was just here, too!

288
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Hiroko?

289
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,360
Those were the days.
I really miss that time.

290
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,000
Hiro-chan!

291
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Keiko!

292
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,400
Ah! Hiro-chan!

293
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,600
Long time no see.

294
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,099
Wow! This is the place
our family visited on our trip!

295
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were probably
still in elementary school back then.

296
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,000
Keiko, you know, when you saw a wedding here,
you said, "I'm definitely having mine here too!"

297
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Dreams finally come true.

298
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,899
Congratulations!

299
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
Thank you.

300
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,199
Daisuke's family will be coming next.
Before that, you should take a good rest.

301
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Yeah, got it.

302
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,700
Looks like they hold
all kinds of events here.

303
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Huh... this event...

304
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,000
By the way, it's such a shame we didn't
get to meet your boyfriend, Hiro-chan.

305
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,420
Yeah, we'll meet again someday.

306
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,300
So, is Hiro-chan's
boyfriend really an elite?

307
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Tall and handsome type?

308
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Who knows...

309
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,190
Ah! Someone's performing a fire dance!

310
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,430
Let's go check it out up front.

311
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:33,300
Wow, you're right. Hold on a sec!

312
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,189
A local food and Hawaii collaboration event.

313
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,000
It's finally starting!

314
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,800
Hey everyone, aloha!!

315
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,710
Huh...?

316
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Ayaka?

317
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,500
First up, let me introduce
our special collaboration.

318
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Marinated squid with shredded carrots

319
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Hawaiian burger!!

320
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
That woman...

321
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Who is it?!

322
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:45,575
(Next Episode)

323
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,213
This is the person Hiroko-san
is having an affair with.

324
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:50,616
Hiro-chan has always
been taken care of by you.

325
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,589
Hiro-chan, I've really missed
you and wanted to see you.

326
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,470
Even though I really want to cherish you.

327
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,910
- I'm such an idiot.
- Let my feelings reach you...

328
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,360
Aloha!
