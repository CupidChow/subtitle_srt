1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,380
Nu Kuea.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,640
Hia Lian, is that really you?

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,910
Come here.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,670
Is something wrong?

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,750
You don't want to talk to me?

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,930
No-

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,930
Forget it. I don't think you want to talk to me right now.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,000
Hia Yi.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,990
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming here?

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,380
It's the last day of your internship, so I want to take you to celebrate.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:44,240
♪ I love you more than anyone. I give you my whole heart ♪

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,290
Oh, Nuer.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,330
Oh, Syn.

14
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,000
Thank you for coming to see me.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,040
Hia.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,350
Will you marry me?

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,890
Yes.

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,840
I will marry you.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,860
"Hi, Kirin."

20
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:25,680
"Congratulations on your offer from Cosmixo Entertainment."

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,990
Huh?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,370
What?!

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,060
Cosmixo Entertainment?!

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,259
In Korea?!

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,610
What offer is this?

26
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,150
"We would love to have you as our new artist."

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,240
And they want to talk to me today?!

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,770
New artist...

29
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,479
Kirin...

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,300
Make some noise!

31
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,240
Wooohhhhh!!

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,330
Come on, together!

33
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,680
I can't hear you guys at all, louder!

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,730
Come on, sing with me~

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,210
♪ Hey, you cutie! You're making me crazy in love ♪

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,170
♪ Where did you learn that? I can't handle your cuteness, oh bae~ ♪

37
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,170
- Nu Kuea.
- ♪ I want to- ♪

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,790
What are you up to?

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,010
I'm just doing some morning stretching... I feel like my body's a little sore.

40
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,700
Come down for breakfast after you're done.

41
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,010
Okay.

42
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,580
I'm still not quite used to your new house.

43
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,110
Not mine.

44
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,690
But ours.

45
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,250
Thank you.

46
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,850
How does it taste?

47
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,690
As good as I remember.

48
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,490
What do you want to do after this?

49
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,970
What do you mean?

50
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,410
Everything.

51
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,570
Since you've graduated.

52
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,850
What do you want to do after we get married?

53
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,170
Have you thought about it yet?

54
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,050
Yes, a bit.

55
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,770
Kirin?

56
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,650
Yes.

57
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,810
If you need help with anything, you can always tell me.

58
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,490
Okay.

59
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,690
Hia.

60
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,330
You stare at me so much I'm getting embarrassed.

61
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,850
But I want to look at you.

62
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,090
You should also eat.

63
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,450
Are you done?

64
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,130
Should we get going?

65
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,210
Hia.

66
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,730
Can we...

67
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,410
Meet at the wedding studio at 1 PM?

68
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,090
Why?

69
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,610
Well...

70
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,690
I just saw Kon Diao's message. He asked me to go somewhere with him in the morning.

71
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,490
So I thought I'd pop in to see him first.

72
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,570
Mhm.

73
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,170
Sure.

74
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,570
So you won't have to come wait at my office.

75
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,090
Okay.

76
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,810
Then I'll get going first.

77
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,930
Okay.

78
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,410
I love you.

79
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,370
I love you, too.

80
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,810
See you later.

81
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,610
Okay.

82
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,130
Diao! SOS!

83
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,610
"Okay, I'll be right there."

84
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,970
Let's go.

85
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,650
Where are you going so early in the morning?

86
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,010
I'm going to see Kuea.

87
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,370
Didn't we agree to go meet them in the afternoon?

88
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,650
It's moved to now.

89
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,370
I didn't hear anything from Lian though.

90
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,970
It's just Kuea and I.

91
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,570
Then I'll give you a ride.

92
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,130
It's fine, Hia, I can go by myself. I'll get going now.

93
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,810
Bye bye, Nong~

94
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,410
Bye bye, Hia.

95
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,370
Kon Diao!

96
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,490
How should I reply to them?

97
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,570
Mhm.

98
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,610
Yes.

99
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,810
But this. This is Cosmixo Entertainment!

100
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,650
I'll think about it some more.

101
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,210
Thanks, Jay.

102
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,130
Sorry for the sudden change of plans.

103
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,450
Cosmixo Entertainment wants to talk to you?

104
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,850
Yeah.

105
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,170
Kuea! That's amazing!

106
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,850
You checked to see whether it's actually from the company, right?

107
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,370
It's surely not a spam, right?

108
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,850
Yeah, I checked.

109
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,610
I also checked with Jay just now.

110
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,450
Wow, my friend will join a Korean agency and become a famous artist now!

111
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,730
Annyeonghaseyo~

112
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,770
Don't joke around.

113
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,210
I still haven't replied back to them yet.

114
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,970
Then what are you waiting for?

115
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,690
Reply back to them, then.

116
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,210
Ah... Hia Lian?

117
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,090
Yeah.

118
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,410
But that's not the only reason.

119
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,690
I have a lot to think about.

120
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,650
Mhm.

121
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,770
The meeting at the wedding studio at 1 PM today is confirmed.

122
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,010
As for the rest, the studio sent these for you to try in advance.

123
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,050
I'll take a look, but I'll let Nu Kuea make the decisions later.

124
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,650
What about you? Don't you have work to do? Why are you here?

125
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,210
I'm your best man, how can I not be here?

126
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,290
Do you really want to help me? Or are you curious about what needs to be prepared for a wedding?

127
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,090
Don't give me that smile.

128
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,290
I just don't want my friend to be a workaholic. You need to prepare yourself for the wedding.

129
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,930
I've arranged everything for you.

130
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,530
Don't you dare refuse.

131
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,410
You need to look as handsome as possible for Nu Kuea.

132
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,810
What should I do about my wedding?

133
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,370
How many things do I have left to do?

134
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,370
Including what you have to do and what you have to think about...

135
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,890
Around 30.

136
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,850
Here.

137
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,370
Woah.

138
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,170
Diao. You made a whole list for me?

139
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,690
Aren't I your best man? This is nothing.

140
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,770
My Diao~

141
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,250
How would I live without you?

142
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,250
You will survive without me.

143
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,330
But about your wedding, I can't help you decide.

144
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,850
I know.

145
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,170
Mhm.

146
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,450
Then...

147
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,890
Do you still want to marry Hia Lian?

148
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,570
Of course.

149
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,450
I've wanted this for my whole life.

150
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,250
Out of the things you've listed for me, is there anything I have to get done today?

151
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,090
Except for going to the wedding studio in the afternoon...

152
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,210
You have to look the best for your wedding.

153
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,570
We should go get some treatment done.

154
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,850
Huh?

155
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,850
Us?

156
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,530
You. I mean you.

157
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,570
We're here!

158
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,130
This is the Mariza Clinic.

159
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,050
What do I have to do?

160
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,930
I've already planned the program for you. By the time we're done, you'll look very handsome for sure.

161
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,890
Are you ready?

162
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,010
Yeah.

163
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,650
How do I look?

164
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,610
The most handsome in the world.

165
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,090
Uh, Kuea.

166
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,010
Let me ask you something.

167
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,150
Uh, Kuea.

168
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,910
Let me ask you something.

169
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,360
What is it?

170
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,820
What does your dream wedding look like?

171
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,560
A grand wedding, fit for Nu Kuea and his family.

172
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,680
A relaxed wedding without too much ceremony.

173
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,830
What color do you want as the main theme?

174
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,090
Grey and white.

175
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,410
Anything that looks formal.

176
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,520
What about guests?

177
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,230
Just Nu Kuea's side should already be 500-600 people.

178
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,490
Just close friends and family.

179
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,430
Music?

180
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,130
Live band.

181
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,670
Classical music.

182
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,370
Pre-wedding?

183
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,030
In the studio.

184
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,380
Street style.

185
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,420
Wedding location?

186
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,670
Location...

187
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,710
Anywhere as long as it can receive all of our guests.

188
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,810
By the sea!

189
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,460
"Ukasa..." (Reciting Thai prayer)

190
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,370
"Ukasa..." (Reciting Thai prayer)

191
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,270
"Wanta..." (Reciting Thai prayer)

192
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,210
"Ukasa wanta..." (Reciting Thai prayer)

193
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,960
What is it?

194
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,420
I should be asking you that question.

195
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,430
What are you looking at?

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,310
Do you want to be ordained soon?

197
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:20,850
Yes.

198
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,060
Since I've graduated.

199
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,030
I think right now is a good time to be ordained.

200
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,600
I already found a good date for the ceremony.

201
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,770
And after you get ordained...

202
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,400
What are you going to do?

203
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,110
I don't know yet.

204
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,710
I haven't thought about when I will leave the monkhood yet.

205
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,790
I see.

206
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,010
Mr. Lian.

207
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,170
Mr. Yi.

208
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,760
Please try this cake.

209
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,220
It is from a shop called 'Patisserie'.

210
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,230
The queue to buy their cake is soooooo long.

211
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,020
It smells nice.

212
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,030
It's sweet.

213
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,230
And it tastes amazing.

214
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,560
Does it taste good?

215
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,020
Yeah.

216
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,390
It's nice.

217
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,690
It smells nice.

218
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,890
It's sweet.

219
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,720
It's very good.

220
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,829
Next is my turn.

221
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,430
Nu Kuea.

222
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,560
Come try this cake.

223
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,650
Woah.

224
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,550
Come sit here.

225
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,730
Okay.

226
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,660
What took you so long.

227
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,010
Hia, don't scold me.

228
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,380
Isn't the seat too crowded.

229
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,300
Oh. Nevermind. You guys are couples, so of course, you'd sit together.

230
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,890
I understand.

231
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,580
Here.

232
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,240
I'll give you a bite.

233
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,550
Hia.

234
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,650
You got it all over your lips.

235
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,590
He's learnt some tricks now.

236
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,640
Oh, sorry.

237
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,990
What did you and Kon Diao do this morning?

238
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,680
Did you guys have fun?

239
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,170
We did many things.

240
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,060
It's quite enjoyable.

241
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,580
You and Hia Yi should try it too.

242
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,040
Then I'll go with you next time.

243
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,990
I was about to ask you to come with me.

244
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,370
Foei and Hia Yi helped me plan the wedding details.

245
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,400
If you like something, you can make the final decision.

246
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,510
How can I like it alone?

247
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,960
You should like it too.

248
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,050
I only have one requirement.

249
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,630
And that is you, Nu Kuea.

250
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,780
Hia.

251
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,520
What are you saying!

252
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,300
Hia.

253
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,050
Can I talk to Jay about the band for our wedding?

254
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,090
Is that what you plan to do?

255
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,010
Or do you already have a singer that you prefer?

256
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,110
If we're talking about the singer I want...

257
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,210
I don't think he'll be free to perform for us.

258
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,770
He'll be too busy receiving guests at our wedding.

259
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,540
It'll be that busy?

260
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,520
Or does Mr. Kirin want to perform at our wedding?

261
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,360
Kuea! Let's try on your wedding suit.

262
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,900
Mr. Lian, please come this way.

263
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,410
Mr. Kuea, please head that way.

264
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,030
Why do we have to go to separate places?

265
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,510
So it'll be a surprise!

266
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,760
Then would our suits match?

267
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,100
Why are you worrying so much?

268
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,790
This is our wedding.

269
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,790
We can just try it first.

270
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,390
Then we can pick them out together later.

271
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,300
If you say so.

272
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,740
What are you doing here, Mr. Groomsman?

273
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,140
Shouldn't you be helping Hia Lian?

274
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,630
Foei is already helping him.

275
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,480
Aren't you also a groomsman?

276
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,910
Hia, you're no good at all.

277
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,900
What did I do?

278
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,560
You already saw Kuea's answers.

279
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,110
Why didn't you convince Hia Lian for Kuea?

280
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,180
How can I force him?

281
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,540
I'm not asking you to force him, but just try to convince him.

282
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,050
You also saw Lian's answers.

283
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,760
Why don't you try convincing your friend?

284
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,620
I think their choices are quite compatible anyway.

285
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,480
How are they compatible? They're completely opposites.

286
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,740
We should let them discuss among themselves first.

287
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,020
And if they really can't agree on something...

288
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,690
What should we do then?

289
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,420
I'll try to convince Lian again.

290
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,740
Okay.

291
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,590
You should go back to help Hia Lian.

292
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,630
Kon Diao.

293
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,720
What is it?

294
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,070
Let's go on a date this evening.

295
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,430
Okay?

296
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,150
What's up with him...

297
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,030
Kuea! How is it?

298
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,600
Can I go in?

299
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,510
Sure.

300
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,760
What is it?

301
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,900
Have you found a suit that you like yet?

302
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,680
Not really.

303
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,000
What about you?

304
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,450
Why do I need to find one?

305
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,540
Aren't you the most into it?

306
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,580
Just look at the list you made for me. I think you're more prepared to get married than me.

307
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,120
I just...

308
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,220
What?

309
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,240
You just what, Mr. Diao.

310
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,050
I just want to help you.

311
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:00,780
Then...

312
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,200
Then come help me choose a suit.

313
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,340
Sure!

314
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,040
Woah!

315
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,750
Who's calling you?

316
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,300
Cosmixo!

317
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,370
Pick up the phone!

318
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,760
Answer the call.

319
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,780
Hi.

320
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,590
Yes.

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,220
It's Kirin speaking.

322
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,300
Foei.

323
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,680
Foei.

324
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,640
Foei!

325
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,030
Foei!

326
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,330
What's up, my sweetheart...?

327
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,250
Hia Yi!

328
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,650
What's up?

329
00:24:59,370 --> 00:24:59,990
Nothing at all.

330
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,790
Mr. Lian, excuse me.

331
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,290
Thank you.

332
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,410
You've already chosen one?

333
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,050
It's not difficult to choose.

334
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,550
That's good.

335
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,150
Nu Kuea and Kon Diao still hasn't finished?

336
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,220
Not yet.

337
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,630
That's fine. He can take his time.

338
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,170
Yes!

339
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,460
Thank you so much for the offer and the call.

340
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,490
I'll... think about it and give you the answer before midnight, your timezone.

341
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,700
Yes!

342
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,320
Thank you.

343
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,530
You, too.

344
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,200
Have a good day. Goodbye.

345
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,040
Dude! Did I just talk to Cosmixo just now?

346
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,890
I can't believe it!

347
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,020
What should I do now?

348
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,240
I think you already know what you want to do.

349
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,570
But...

350
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,830
What if Hia won't wait for me?

351
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,870
What should I do then?

352
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,610
Then I think you should have a talk with Hia first.

353
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,130
"Kasa wantami pante sappang..." (Reciting Thai prayer)

354
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,810
"Kamatamep pante..." (Reciting Thai prayer)

355
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,860
Focus, Syn.

356
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,430
Suddenly, I can't recite the prayer properly.

357
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,920
Normally I have no problems at all.

358
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,060
Do you want to go and recite it on your own first?

359
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,020
I've already done that.

360
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,890
I'm not scolding you about it.

361
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,660
But I really practiced it.

362
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,520
Syn, you have to ask yourself first whether you are ready to be ordained yet.

363
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,560
You should come when you are ready.

364
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,080
Nuer!

365
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,230
Nuer, wait!

366
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,700
Oh, what's wrong?

367
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,730
You!

368
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,650
Me?

369
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,670
You just left without saying a word.

370
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,760
I just didn't want to interrupt you.

371
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,580
I'm afraid you won't be able to concentrate.

372
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,660
But...

373
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,480
I didn't plan to leave first.

374
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,820
I just felt like you were getting scolded because of me.

375
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,910
Syn... What's the matter?

376
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,630
I lost my mindfulness. And when there's no mindfulness, there is no precept.

377
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,460
I've never asked you what you wanted to do before.

378
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,050
You're always the one who comes to spend time with me.

379
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,010
Maybe this isn't the right time yet.

380
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,030
I just want to be with you.

381
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,530
Whether you can be mindful or not.

382
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,300
I just want to be with you no matter what.

383
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,630
But if we lose mindfulness, there will be no precept.

384
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,290
I just need you.

385
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,260
Where are you going? It's this way.

386
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,850
Everything is up to you.

387
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,300
Hia.

388
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,220
We can't do it like that.

389
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,790
Why not? This is our wedding.

390
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,550
Yes, it's our wedding.

391
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,050
Not just mine.

392
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,960
What about this one?

393
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,900
Hey, hurry up. Thanks.

394
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,480
Mr. Lian!

395
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,380
Young Master Kuea Keerati!

396
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,260
You're also here as customers?

397
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,050
This is Madam Sonoko Lee, the owner of the laxatives brand "The Pagoda-climbing Rabbit."

398
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,590
What event are you planning for?

399
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,260
Thank you for your question.

400
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,650
I'm about to get married.

401
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,010
But!

402
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,200
The first marriage has to be the best.

403
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,970
Because you can only experience the first time you get married once in your life.

404
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,180
Young Master Kuea Keerati.

405
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,440
Yes?

406
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,290
I wish the best for you.

407
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,160
Thank you.

408
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,740
Your welcome.

409
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,890
Okay.

410
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,800
I have to get going first.

411
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,650
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

412
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,160
See you next time.

413
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,490
Madam, weren't you here to buy something?

414
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,870
Oh, I forgot.

415
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,760
It's fine, I'll come back again later.

416
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,380
Choose your pick, I'll buy out the rest of the shop.

417
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,050
Bye!

418
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,440
Goodbye.

419
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,440
Bye~

420
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,340
Thank you!

421
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,470
Eh?

422
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,800
Don't worry, this is how she usually is.

423
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,160
Let's continue to discuss about the wedding.

424
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,320
Mr. Lian, Mr. Kuea, what ceremonies do you want for your wedding?

425
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,070
You can decide.

426
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,540
I'm fine with anything.

427
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,350
How about an exchange of vows?

428
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,180
Okay.

429
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,470
That sounds good.

430
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,830
Then I'll schedule an exchange of vows for the evening ceremony?

431
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,160
Yes, that's fine.

432
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,480
Yes, sir!

433
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,030
Nong Diao.

434
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,340
Nong Diao!

435
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,100
Yes, Hia?

436
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,440
You're zoning out.

437
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,020
What are you thinking about?

438
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,220
I'm just wondering why our date is always at home?

439
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
You don't like it?

440
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,660
It's not that I don't, I'm just asking.

441
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,280
Where do you want to go for a date then?

442
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,950
At home with you.

443
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,800
With Nong as well.

444
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,310
Isn't she smart? She even responds to her name.

445
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,770
Natasha.

446
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,350
Romanov.

447
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,310
Bok-bok.

448
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,930
Chen.

449
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,020
Tasha.

450
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,770
She's not smart.

451
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,600
She just loves to bark.

452
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,510
She only barks at you.

453
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,200
I think she loves talking to you.

454
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,000
Don't you want to talk to me too?

455
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
What are you thinking about?

456
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,820
Nothing much.

457
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,080
I'm just a little worried about Kuea.

458
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,110
Lian is there. Kuea will be fine.

459
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,350
Mhm.

460
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,460
What about you? Aren't you thinking about it too?

461
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,330
Thinking about what?

462
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,909
About us.

463
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,550
Getting married is not a bad thing.

464
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,480
Don't you think so?

465
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,020
Nong Diao.

466
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,730
Yes?

467
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,550
Actually, you and I...

468
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,060
Shouldn't we also be moving forward with our relationship?

469
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,730
Aren't you too good at barking?

470
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,550
Nong~

471
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,480
Hia.

472
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,370
I'll go take a shower first.

473
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,310
I have to come down and work later.

474
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,280
You can just work in our bedroom.

475
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,400
It's okay, I don't want to disturb you.

476
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
You have work early in the morning tomorrow.

477
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,420
Do you want anything?

478
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,880
Warm milk? Porridge?

479
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,170
Nah, I don't want anything.

480
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,770
But thank you.

481
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,800
Then, I'll go ahead and take a shower.

482
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,280
Nu Kuea.

483
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,980
Hm?

484
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,110
Yes?

485
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,280
About the wedding...

486
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,550
If it's not how you want it, we can choose again.

487
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,840
Afterall... I'll leave it-

488
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,370
- Up to you-
- Up to you-

489
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,020
Hia.

490
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,550
I...

491
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,460
I'll hurry up and take a shower, quickly finish my work, and go to sleep.

492
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,910
You don't have to wait up for me.

493
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,170
Then...

494
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,260
I'll go take a shower first.

495
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:24,350
I love it when I'm on stage as Kirin and my heart races every time I perform.

496
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,680
It's a dream that I've always been wishing for.

497
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,930
I'm getting a headache just thinking about it!

498
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,330
Do you know anything at all?

499
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,510
Why am I talking to a doll?

500
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,000
[Hia: Are you going to come up yet?]

501
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,020
[Hia: Is there anything you want to talk to me about?]

502
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,660
Hia.

503
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,480
I have something to tell you.

504
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,020
What is it?

505
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,550
This morning when you asked me...

506
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,310
What I wanted to do next.

507
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,170
I have an answer for that question.

508
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,710
I want to be Kirin.

509
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,510
Aren't you already Kirin?

510
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,330
I got an offer to be an artist at Cosmixo Entertainment in Korea.

511
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
I want to go.

512
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,800
That's fine.

513
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,440
What about our wedding?

514
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,770
What do you want to do about our wedding?

515
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,800
I want to marry you.

516
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,510
I also want to marry you.

517
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,500
Mr. Lian, Young Master Kuea.

518
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,240
Right now, the situation...

519
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,050
It's 100% an SOS!

520
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,740
There won't be any changes in the law.

521
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,020
Why do you still want to get married right now?

522
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,980
Then how long will I have to wait for?

523
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,020
What are you doing out here alone, Hia?

524
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,450
Just thinking about stuff while waiting for you.

525
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,020
Let's get married.
