1
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,910
Kuea!

2
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,070
Everyone's life is like a novel.

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,750
- Where's Jab?
Everyone's life is like a novel.

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,090
Everyone's life is like a novel.

5
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:38,150
I'm reading the story of a character named Kuea Keerati. I keep turning page after page.

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,730
And now, I've almost finished reading the end of chapter 21.

7
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,270
21 chapters which are filled with all kinds of feelings.

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,950
I've learned a lot of things in 21 years.

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,200
Hey.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,400
- Hey, Kuea!
Especially what happened last year. That was the climax of my life.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,380
Especially what happened last year. That was the climax of my life.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,290
Nu Kuea!

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,020
- Nuchy, let's take a picture together!
- Ton, get over here!

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,390
- Ton! Come here! Quick!
- I'm sorry! I'm coming!
It's because of one person. He's the most important person in my life.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,050
- Ton! Come here! Quick!
- I'm sorry! I'm coming!

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,960
It's quite hard to believe that this one person exists in the story of my life from the very first page until now.

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,870
Nu Kuea.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,670
Hia.

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,110
Congratulations, Nu.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,640
Well done.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,170
Thank you, Hia.

23
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,520
Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him!

24
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,600
Kiss him!

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,610
You've finally graduated.

26
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,840
And you've also finished your internship program.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,350
I think it's time.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,540
Time...?

29
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,810
It's time for us to get married.

30
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,980
I've waited for a long time.

31
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,340
It's only been a year.

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,470
21 years, 4 months, 3 days, 6 hours, and 12 minutes.

33
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,700
Will you marry me?

34
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,650
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

35
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,780
We have modified many things, including the air intake hose and different parts of the electronic system.

36
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,720
In terms of the engine control unit remapping, I have upgraded the nozzles to ensure optimal engine performance.

37
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,100
Keep fighting!

38
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,030
I know you can do it.

39
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,880
Here.

40
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,710
I'm afraid that you might faint.

41
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,770
Keep it for yourself. You might need it when you keep an eye on Kon Diao during his taekwondo matches.

42
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,830
Just take it.

43
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,940
I have many of these.

44
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,650
You're acting like his father.

45
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,740
Don't you have practice with Teacher Diao today?

46
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,960
You should focus on what's in front of you.

47
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,850
You might miss the most important scene.

48
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,070
Eh?

49
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,560
Hold it, Kuea, hold it.

50
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,740
Turn it slowly.

51
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,210
Do it again.

52
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,070
Hey! Don't touch the gear when you start the car. It might suddenly accelerate.

53
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,380
- Okay.
- Try it again.

54
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,780
Start the car and press the accelerator again.

55
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,270
That's right.

56
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,159
Release it. Okay.

57
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,210
Good job.

58
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,630
Easy-peasy.

59
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Did you know that this car actually has lots of issues? You're amazing.

60
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,970
You did such a good job of modifying the engine.

61
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,110
Thank you.

62
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,050
Okay!

63
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,050
Both of you, Kuea and Nuer, I'll give you guys a pass!

64
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,690
Thank you.

65
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,470
- Thank you.
- Make sure you finish writing your internship report.

66
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,870
And don't forget to work on your presentation.

67
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,050
You can ask Sia if you have any questions, so you don't have to waste time revising it.

68
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,980
Okay.

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,020
My treat tonight.

70
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,909
Let's meet at the same place after we finish all our work.

71
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,909
Where is that?

72
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,690
Eh?

73
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,620
- Sia, you take these two to the bar.
- Okay, bro.

74
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,620
See you guys tonight. We will have a party to congratulate our interns!

75
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm so happy.

76
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,380
Kuea, can I go pick you up at your dorm?

77
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,580
There's no need to do that.

78
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,960
Just tell us where the place is. We can go there by ourselves.

79
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,860
Nuea and I want to stay here a bit longer to do our project.

80
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,820
We can meet each other at the bar.

81
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,530
But it's hard to find a parking space at the shop.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,970
It's hard to get there. Just let me pick you up.

83
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,820
Okay?

84
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,570
Is it the "Zab Za On" bar? The one that our team leader took everyone last Friday, right?

85
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,820
That place is big. There's also a parking lot. It's quite convenient.

86
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,420
That's great.

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,550
Well... If you finish your presentation, you can let me check it first.

88
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,860
And don't be late.

89
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,840
Let me know if you change your mind. I can go pick you up.

90
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,000
Sure.

91
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,400
Okay, bye.

92
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,400
Great job today.

93
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,820
Thanks.

94
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,480
Sia has done such a thing so many times already.

95
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,770
He's always trying to get closer to you.

96
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,659
Maybe he's just being nice.

97
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,080
Nothing more than that.

98
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
He's only nice to you.

99
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,310
Whatever.

100
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,570
Let's just forget about it.

101
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,310
Soon, we won't be seeing him anymore.

102
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,020
Guys, cheers!

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,750
Alright.

104
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,750
Cheers!

105
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,940
Gosh!

106
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,960
The interns this year are great.

107
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,920
Right?

108
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,050
Yes, you're right.

109
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,440
They did a good job.

110
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,420
But what a waste.

111
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,500
It's already their last day of internship.

112
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,720
Usually, they don't accept interns here.

113
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,140
I never asked you how you got an internship here.

114
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,650
Did you use connections?

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,130
I applied for it just like usual.

116
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,580
Nuer is the top student in my year.

117
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,490
Really?

118
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,340
He changed his major in his third year but still got the highest score.

119
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,870
It would be weird if they didn't take Nuer as an intern here.

120
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,850
What about you, Kuea?

121
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,620
I'm also a good student.

122
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,440
Hm.

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
Good at failing.

124
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

125
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,350
You're exaggerating.

126
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Why did you decide to apply for an internship here?

127
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,740
Um...

128
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,070
I like motorsport.

129
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,380
Oh!

130
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,940
I really like it.

131
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,730
I think that's why they accepted me.

132
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,730
Why don't you apply for a job here after finishing your internship?

133
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,110
We don't have enough people in my team at the moment.

134
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,260
Sia! You took the words right out of my mouth!

135
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,370
I was just about to ask them that.

136
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,350
I'm just here for an internship. I don't think I'll become an engineer.

137
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,490
Eh? Didn't you just say that you're into motorsport?

138
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,250
I do like it.

139
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,010
But...

140
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,050
I want to be an artist more.

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,070
Eh?

142
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,520
What the hell?

143
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,070
What about you, Nuer?

144
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,510
What's the matter?

145
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,620
Please excuse me. I need to take this call.

146
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,110
Sure.

147
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,480
Feel free to do whatever you like.

148
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,590
Great. Nobody wants to stay and work with me.

149
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,420
Nuer, what are you doing?

150
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,750
I'm eating dinner with my team.

151
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,420
Kuea is here too.

152
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,600
How's the last day of your internship?

153
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,440
I was extremely happy when I finished my internship last week.

154
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,550
Are you busy?

155
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,860
Should I call you later instead?

156
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,930
No, it's okay.

157
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,440
What time are you coming back tomorrow?

158
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,550
I'm not sure yet.

159
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,950
Is something wrong?

160
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,570
You don't want to talk to me?

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm talking to you now, aren't I?

162
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,310
Forget it. I don't think you want to talk to me right now.

163
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,680
No-

164
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,170
I'm sleepy now. Good night and sweet dreams.

165
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,550
Huh?

166
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,840
Kuea, why don't you try to work here first?

167
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,730
Nah.

168
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,800
I don't want to stay for too long.

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,060
It'll be fun. You won't get bored working with us.

170
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,440
I'll be overjoyed if you stay.

171
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,400
Sia!

172
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,860
You're being too happy.

173
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,260
Do you expect him to work instead of you?

174
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,570
Let's move on from Kuea.

175
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,150
Sia, why don't you ask Nuea? Maybe we'll have some luck.

176
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,090
I haven't decided yet.

177
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,870
Right. Great. These kids.

178
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,850
Whatever. You're still young. You have so much time to try.

179
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,290
Do whatever you want.

180
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,610
As for me, I want to drink. So let's drink. But why do none of you have alcohol in your glasses? Let's fill them up.

181
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,610
Fill up your glasses now. Come on.

182
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,470
Let me do it for you.

183
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,610
Come on. Let's drink some more.

184
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,600
Let's drink.

185
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,810
Cheers guys.

186
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,940
Let's drink.

187
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Cheers!

188
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,890
Cheers!

189
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
Cheers.

190
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,460
Are you okay?

191
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,020
I'm good.

192
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,440
Do you want some more?

193
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,190
You didn't drink much.

194
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,770
That's enough.

195
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,790
Just a bit.

196
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,080
Come on. Let's drink.

197
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,530
Hey!

198
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,660
What's wrong?

199
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,660
What did you just do?

200
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,080
Nothing.

201
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,370
How was that nothing?

202
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,020
I saw what you did. You touched my leg. You even squeezed it.

203
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,420
Hey.

204
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,570
Whatever. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

205
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,730
Your apology isn't sincere at all. That's not okay.

206
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,410
What the hell?

207
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,460
I just touched you a bit.

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,610
All this time, I never thought badly of you because you're nice to me.

209
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,290
But what you did just now... You did it on purpose.

210
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,610
Come on. It's not a big deal.

211
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,780
Well, we're brothers, right?

212
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,290
It's a normal thing to do.

213
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,910
Right? Look.

214
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,310
Oh.

215
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,850
Well...

216
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,220
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

217
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,380
And I thought we felt the same way.

218
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,890
It doesn't matter whether I have a boyfriend or not. You still can't do that to me.

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,090
So, do you have a boyfriend?

220
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,460
I do.

221
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,410
My boyfriend is freaking handsome.

222
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,020
He's freaking rich.

223
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,160
He's freaking good at...

224
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,840
Hm?

225
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,930
Pleasing me.

226
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,640
Are we clear?

227
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,220
I'll be right back.

228
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,080
Where are you going? Sia!

229
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,140
See you tomorrow, Nuer.

230
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,030
Okay.

231
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,690
Take a rest.

232
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,720
See you tomorrow.

233
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,350
Yeah.

234
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,620
Are you sure you don't want me to drop you off?

235
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
No need.

236
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,140
I'm not that drunk. I can go back by myself.

237
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,010
Easy-peasy.

238
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,360
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

239
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,340
I'm off.

240
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,250
See you.

241
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,240
Why is he smiling?

242
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,250
Anyway, I better go to the toilet first.

243
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,630
Nu Kuea.

244
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,690
Hia Lian, is that really you?

245
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,200
Hia!

246
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,270
Come here.

247
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,660
Are you drunk again?

248
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,790
Hm?

249
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,350
Naughty boy.

250
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,170
I'm not that drunk.

251
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,170
I can hold my liquor now.

252
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,680
If it was before, I wouldn't be conscious enough to be talking to you like this.

253
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,840
Really?

254
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,370
Hm?

255
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,950
Yeah.

256
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,680
How come you're here?

257
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,900
How did you know that I'm here?

258
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,170
And why didn't you tell me first that you'd come?

259
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,680
If I knew, I wouldn't have drank with them.

260
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,760
I wanted to surprise you.

261
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,920
How are you? Are you tired?

262
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,360
Yeah. I'm tired.

263
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,170
But it's fun.

264
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,600
That's to help you to get rid of your tiredness.

265
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,180
I miss you.

266
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,470
Do you miss me?

267
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,670
Of course, I do.

268
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,270
I miss you to death!

269
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,240
This is what you should do when you miss someone.

270
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,599
There's a zone for this here too?

271
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,880
Yes, Hia.

272
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,109
Is that...

273
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,440
what I think it is?

274
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,490
It's just a coincidence.

275
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,250
It's not like that.

276
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,690
I don't think it's a coincidence.

277
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,620
I don't know what you're talking about!

278
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,310
Hia!

279
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,510
You didn't tell me that you would come here to see me.

280
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,330
You make me feel shy.

281
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:54,840
I want to find out whether you miss me or not when we're not together.

282
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,280
How can you ask that?

283
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,810
Are you sure?

284
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,140
That you're not just having fun driving around

285
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,610
and forgetting to think about me.

286
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,100
Hia.

287
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,140
I miss you.

288
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,880
I miss you every day.

289
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,920
I miss you so much that I can no longer stand it.

290
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,510
I really miss you.

291
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,210
I want to tell you

292
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,000
that I...

293
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,740
like...

294
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,790
to do it.

295
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,400
I like to make you happy.

296
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,340
Aha.

297
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,330
Nu.

298
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,730
I think you're too drunk.

299
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,150
You should take a shower and go to bed.

300
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,060
Hia.

301
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,200
We're not going to...

302
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,800
Meow.

303
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,150
We're not going to do it?

304
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,380
No.

305
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,460
I want you to be more conscious.

306
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,410
I want you to be aware of my hugs, my kisses, and everything that I do to you.

307
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,240
So you'll remember it.

308
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,190
You're ruining the mood.

309
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,590
Fine.

310
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll go take a shower.

311
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,510
Hia.

312
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,400
Are you sure you don't want to do it?

313
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,950
Go take a shower now!

314
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,040
Come on.

315
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,400
I'll walk you to the bathroom.

316
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,820
You don't need to do that.

317
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,840
I can walk by myself.

318
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,780
You don't know where the bathroom is.

319
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,290
Calm down, Kilen Wang.

320
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,620
Hia Yi.

321
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,780
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming here?

322
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,870
By the way...

323
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,980
What are you doing here?

324
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,950
And... don't you have to be anywhere else?

325
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,330
I went to somewhere else already.

326
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,890
And now I'm back.

327
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,350
You went there already, and now you've come back.

328
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,800
It's the last day of your internship, so I want to take you to celebrate.

329
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,270
Let's go.

330
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,690
Why isn't this...

331
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,270
Where are we going?

332
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,040
Home.

333
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,530
Don't you miss Nong?

334
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,670
Nong...

335
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,330
You mean the little doggie?

336
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,730
You miss Nong?

337
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,180
You're the one who misses her.

338
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,910
I'm with her every day. So why would I miss her?

339
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,620
Is that so?

340
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,840
You are the one who misses her. If you miss her, just say so.

341
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,400
You want me to say it?

342
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,020
Yes.

343
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,020
I miss you, Nong Diao.

344
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,090
Hia.

345
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,210
Hia.

346
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,670
Where is he?

347
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,430
8 AM...

348
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,230
Shit!

349
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,320
It's 8 AM! I'm gonna be late!

350
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,010
8 AM!

351
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,450
Whoa.

352
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,030
Did you make congee for me?

353
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,670
I bought it. I've tried congee from many shops but this one is the best.

354
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,830
Do you have to do that much for me?

355
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,650
I can do everything. Do you want anything else?

356
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,630
You’re too sweet!

357
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,250
I have to go now.

358
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,690
Let me help you.

359
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,200
It's okay. I can do it myself.

360
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,750
I'm off.

361
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,980
Nu, keep working hard.

362
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,360
Hey.

363
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,850
Where did you get the congee from?

364
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,190
There are congee shops around here that I haven't heard of?

365
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,920
It's my special menu. Do you want some?

366
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,300
Oh, that's mine?

367
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,790
Of course! I'll definitely eat it.

368
00:27:51,790 --> 00:28:00,260
Those who've been here for many years should look up to these interns.

369
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,680
They should learn how to buy good food to treat the seniors. I'm just saying, no pressure.

370
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,680
You should buy delicious food and share it with others!

371
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,040
Isn't that right?

372
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,390
Right?

373
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,570
Hm?

374
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,150
Did anyone hear what I said?

375
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,660
Did you see Sia's reaction?

376
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,200
He didn't dare to look at us.

377
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,050
Really?

378
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,910
I didn't care about him at all.

379
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,940
That's good, Kuea.

380
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,890
Hello, Jay.

381
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,070
Kuea, do you remember the Korean agency I told you about?

382
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,690
They asked me to send them your profile again.

383
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,960
Yes. I remember.

384
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,070
I already sent it them, along with your e-mail.

385
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,140
If you're interested, don't forget to keep checking your e-mail.

386
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,270
Okay. Thank you.

387
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,710
I miss you, Jay. See you soon.

388
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,380
Are you okay?

389
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,090
Of course.

390
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,270
Let's go to present our work.

391
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,290
Are you ready?

392
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,230
I'm more than ready.

393
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,940
Let's go.

394
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,490
I'm on time.

395
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,890
Yes, you are. But normally you'll always come 15 minutes earlier.

396
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,310
It's because of me. That's why he's late.

397
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,710
It's okay, Kon Diao.

398
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,050
He didn't scold you, right?

399
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,340
Is there something wrong between you two?

400
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,170
I thought you said that you were leaving. Didn't you already meet Nu Kuea?

401
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,190
Yeah, I met him.

402
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,210
I'll go back after talking to you.

403
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,210
You're not going to stay here until the party tonight?

404
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,350
No, I don't want to bother Nu Kuea.

405
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,640
But the interns always have special shows every year.

406
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,260
What shows?

407
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,990
I don't know too.

408
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:04,060
I don't know what's the theme this year. But your Nu Kuea is very talented, so I think his show must be special.

409
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,970
To call....

410
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,590
Or not to call.

411
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,500
To call....

412
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,260
Or not to call.

413
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,040
To call...

414
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,840
Or not to call.

415
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,750
Or should I text him first?

416
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,960
Venerable Sir.

417
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,160
I'm in distress. Is this what you call suffering?

418
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:58,310
If that's so, a wise man should be able to find a way out by himself.

419
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:06,140
But what is suffering? What is the cause of it? What is the way out of it? And what is the path leading to the cessation of suffering?

420
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,760
I can't figure it out.

421
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:31,120
This is the performance report of the race car that we modified during the internship.

422
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,980
Thank you for giving us the opportunity and helping us throughout this internship.

423
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,310
To be frank, you guys are amazing.

424
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm sad that no one wants to continue working here.

425
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,180
Thank you.

426
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,400
But there are many more talented people out there.

427
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,090
You will forget about us soon after we leave.

428
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,600
How can I forget you guys?

429
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,850
You guys are the top students, aren't you?

430
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,580
There are more things I need to learn.

431
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,340
Good.

432
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,490
Always keep that in mind. You need that mindset in the future, no matter what you do.

433
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,540
Congratulations, Kuea and Nuer.

434
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

435
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,630
But your job as an intern does not end here. Did you forget about tonight?

436
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,760
Nuer and I have been ready since last night.

437
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,400
I hope you mean that! You can't fail us tonight, alright?

438
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,030
Kuea is here. You won't be disappointed.

439
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:39,510
Make sure you give us a big surprise. We'll buy lots of flowers for you.

440
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,050
Sure.

441
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,510
I'll go buy them now before they run out.

442
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,740
Alright.

443
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,490
See you!

444
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,380
I'll wait for you over there.

445
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,030
Okay.

446
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,340
Well...

447
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,050
Kuea, I...

448
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:21,190
I want to apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable during your internship.

449
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,380
And about last night...

450
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,880
If I crossed the line,

451
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,420
I'm so sorry.

452
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,090
It's okay.

453
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,580
I want to say sorry too.

454
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,380
Well then, see you tonight.

455
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,560
See you.

456
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,690
Let's go, Nuer.

457
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,110
Let's get preprared.

458
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,650
We will shine tonight!

459
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,080
Let's go!

460
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,680
About what we talked about--

461
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,740
I'm here, Mr. Lian!

462
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,670
I'm here as well, Mr. Yi.

463
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,840
But you work here, Ms. Kim.

464
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,260
Tonight, please call me Juliet.

465
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:31,530
Well then, you all should call me Romeo.

466
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,750
Where are my glasses? Oh, here. Can you help me put on the glasses?

467
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,080
Thanks, babe.

468
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,390
Here are your costumes.

469
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,810
My dear.

470
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,460
- I'm so sorry, darling.
- It doesn't hurt.

471
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,150
The costumes are tailor-made by Le Croque Paqui.

472
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,370
Le Croque Paqui.

473
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,700
I can assure you that you all will look absolutely ravishing forever!

474
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,950
And ever!

475
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,040
And ever.

476
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,960
I won't go home until I'm drunk.

477
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,100
You're drinking non-stop.

478
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,120
You'll be so wasted.

479
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,120
What a party.

480
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,200
It's for you.

481
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,270
Oh, Nuer.

482
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,140
Oh, Syn.

483
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,740
- I'm sorry, Nuer.
- I'm sorry, Syn.

484
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,580
I'm not mad at you.

485
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,980
Um.

486
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,980
What's the matter then?

487
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,650
I don’t know.

488
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,360
Miss me?

489
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,180
Do you miss me?

490
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,580
You'll break the precept if you lie.

491
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,540
I...

492
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,860
I miss you!

493
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,970
I miss you too.

494
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,100
Thank you for coming to see me.

495
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,840
Let's go inside.

496
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,900
I've prepared a costume for you, too.

497
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,820
Hm? Like this one?

498
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,620
Yes.

499
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,840
Let's go. The event will start soon.

500
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on. Let's go.

501
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,860
Oh, no.

502
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,700
Hello, everyone.

503
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,190
This is the moment everyone has been waiting for.

504
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,620
It's time for the show from the interns.

505
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:31,240
If you guys are ready, let's give them a round of applause.

Hia.

529
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,060
I thought you've already gone back. Didn't you say you've got work to do?

530
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:30,080
My Nu Kuea has a performance today. So I have to be here to cheer you on.

531
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,950
Thank you, Hia.

532
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,350
Nu Kuea.

533
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,260
Yes?

534
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,150
Can I kiss you right now?

535
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,060
Hia!

536
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,730
My Nu Kuea is incredibly hot.

537
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,440
It will be terrible if someone falls for you.

538
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,150
Can I?

539
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,750
Yes.

540
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,240
Hia, what are you doing?

541
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,460
Oh!

542
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,480
Diao!

543
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,260
Hello, Hia Yi.

544
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,440
Okay, I'm going to take a photo now.

545
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,260
Make sure we look nice. My mom is waiting to see.

546
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,170
One, two, three.

547
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,480
You’re always like this, man!

548
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,390
Kuea! Can I take a picture with you too?

549
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,860
Diao! Yes, let's take a picture together.

550
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,550
Let’s take a picture.

551
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,350
- Hello, Hia Yi.
- Hello.

552
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,150
- Let's take a picture together.
- Okay.

553
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,300
Hia, can you take a picture for me?

554
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,680
I look so fat!

555
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,080
One, two, three.

556
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,330
Hey, guys. Let's take a picture.

557
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,220
- Let's take a picture together.
- Of course!

558
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,280
Hello, Hia.

559
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,950
Hello.

560
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,700
Make sure I look handsome.

561
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,060
One, two, three! One more.

562
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,100
One, two, three.

563
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,860
Thank you!

564
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,040
Thank you, Hia.

565
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,790
Nu Kuea, is Lian not here yet?

566
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,640
Oh, he said he'll arrive soon.

567
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,950
I guess you won't have to wait any longer.

568
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,260
Hm?

569
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,820
Nu Kuea.

570
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,020
Hia.

571
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,100
Congratulations, Nu.

572
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Well done.

573
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,900
Thank you, Hia.

574
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,040
Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him!

575
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,460
Kiss him!

576
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,150
They're so sweet!

577
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:16,970
Nu Kuea.

578
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,730
Yes?

579
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,750
You finally graduated.

580
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,970
You also finished your internship program.

581
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,060
I think it's time.

582
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,240
Time...?

583
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,620
It's time for us to get married.

584
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,440
I've waited for a long time.

585
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,150
It's only been a year.

586
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,150
21 years, 4 months, 3 days, 6 hours, and 12 minutes.

587
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,730
Will you marry me?

588
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:13,240
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

589
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,770
Yes.

590
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,390
I will marry you.

591
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,350
Whoa~

592
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,240
Woo!

593
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,760
Cosmixo Entertainment! In Korea?!

594
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,360
Cosmixo Entertainment wants to talk to you?

595
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,030
Yeah.

596
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,320
What do you want to do after the wedding?

597
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,740
Yes! Thank you so much for the offer and the call.

598
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,340
Did I just talk to Cosmixo Entertainment for real?

599
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,960
Hia, I have something to tell you.

600
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,210
What is it?

601
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,960
I just want to be Kirin.
