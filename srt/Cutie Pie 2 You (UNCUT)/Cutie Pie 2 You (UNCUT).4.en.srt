1
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,600
Nuer, what's wrong?

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,800
Syn, call the ambulance.

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,590
Hi, hi~

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,500
You guys also came?

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,570
Of course!

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,430
Thank you so much guys.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,280
Even if you get married now, there won't be any rights for you regarding the law.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,250
Why do you still want to get married now?

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,240
Then how long will I have to wait for?

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,270
What are you doing out here alone?

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,350
I'm just thinking about some stuff while waiting for you.

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,100
Hia!

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,180
I want it to be the happiest day of our lives.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,730
I will wait for tomorrow.

15
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,590
Ooh!

16
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,490
Wow, this wedding is so worth it!

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,450
Are both couples going to get married at the same time?

18
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,630
I hope you guys are always happy, congratulations!

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,039
Congratulations!

20
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,340
I came on my own accord, since my friend is having his wedding.

21
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,300
I'm just tagging along.

22
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,490
Congratulations!

23
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,560
Congratulations, Hia!

24
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,040
You'll finally be able to settle down!

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,090
You're the first one in our group to get married.

26
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,260
I don't even have a boyfriend yet!

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,329
Congrats.

28
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,050
What is it, Nuer?

29
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,190
Syn, you like weddings?

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,000
I can feel love all around.

31
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,390
Do you want to get married too?

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,550
I haven't thought about that yet.

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
You're already thinking about marriage?

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,210
Hia!

35
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,460
There're so many people around.

36
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,910
Doesn't matter.

37
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,840
Calm down.

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,310
Mr. Foei, the chef is sick.

39
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,490
The chef is sick. The chef is sick. The chef is sick.

40
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,440
The chef is sick?

41
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,190
Please tell the chef --

42
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,150
Huh??

43
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,070
Where'd she go?

44
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,080
Are you afraid it's going to rain?

45
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,990
Even if it rains, Lian and Kuea will be fine.

46
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,310
But what if it's a downpour?

47
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,690
I'll deal with it then.

48
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,490
How?

49
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,200
Are you going to get into a fight with nature?

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,390
We'll never know if we don't try.

51
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,630
Let's go, Hia.

52
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,990
There's still a bit of time before they exchange their vows.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's get something to eat before you start a fight with the angels.

54
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,840
They're here.

55
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,730
Hello Mom, Dad.

56
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,630
Hello.

57
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,280
Hello.

58
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,590
Everything passed by in a flash.

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,300
That's right.

60
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,760
The both of you were just kids running around together not long ago.

61
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,020
Especially Nu Kuea, always begging me to cut his hair in the same style as Hia Lian for him.

62
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,220
Look at you guys now, getting married today.

63
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,370
Time really went by so fast.

64
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,800
Mom~

65
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:08,470
Like I said this morning, Nu Kuea will now have Hia Lian as a part of the family now.

66
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,940
So whatever happens, you guys must take good care of each other.

67
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,900
Lian.

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,960
I'll leave Kuea in your care.

69
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,010
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,150
Aww.

71
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,690
Be good, okay?

72
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,590
Don't be naughty towards Hia.

73
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,090
I'll leave him in your care.

74
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,030
I'll leave him in your care.

75
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,590
Mom, Dad, you don't have to worry.

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
I will surely take good care of him.

77
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,390
That's great.

78
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,430
Pardon me, but have you seen my parents?

79
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,700
I saw them over there.

80
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,450
They're happily receiving guests, smiling non-stop.

81
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,450
By the way, how are the preparations for the evening ceremony?

82
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,150
I was thinking of asking your parents to have dinner together as well, so we'll feel relaxed in the evening.

83
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,390
There's nothing to worry about, everything is nearly ready.

84
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,920
It'll be an easy and simple ceremony for our close friends and family.

85
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,860
That's great, sounds like it'll be a warm celebration.

86
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,580
You guys have a lot of friends.

87
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,840
Mr. Embassador! Madame!

88
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:40,909
Hello.

89
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,710
Hello, Madame Sanoko.

90
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,520
Hello.

91
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,070
You looks amazing!

92
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,830
Really?

93
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,670
Do I really look pretty?

94
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,700
Yes!

95
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,780
Very beautiful.

96
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,409
Of course I have to dress up for the kids' wedding!

97
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,440
Thank you so much for coming.

98
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,500
Congratulations.

99
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,900
This place looks very beautiful, and so many people are attending your wedding, congratulations again.

100
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

101
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,420
Look at them!

102
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,080
They look great together, they look amazing!

103
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,840
They're like a match made in heaven!

104
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,830
Seriously.

105
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,740
Mr. Kilen.

106
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,920
Mr. Kuea Keerati.

107
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,770
Congratulations to the both of you.

108
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,900
Please excuse me, Madame.

109
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,600
I need to go receive some presents.

110
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,170
Excuse me?

111
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,330
Oh, right, I'm not the host, I'm the guest.

112
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,630
I forgot.

113
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,970
I think of you both as my sons.

114
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,919
Sorry, I thought they were my sons.

115
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,750
Please, this way to the wedding.

116
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,429
Right.

117
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,159
Please, make yourself comfortable.

118
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,490
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,299
Thank you for coming, Madame.

120
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,390
I'm going to go catch some squid afterwards!

121
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,410
Having your friend here makes the wedding lively.

122
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,210
Mr. Foei!

123
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,790
Yes?

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,060
The situation is very bad!

125
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,570
Can there even be anything worse than this?

126
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,270
It seems like it's going to rain!

127
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,950
It's already starting to rain at nearby areas.

128
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,250
Please hold on to this!

129
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,140
This, too!

130
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,420
Good luck!

131
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,880
Do it properly! There are a lot of people here.

132
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm already doing this properly!

133
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,350
Hey-

134
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,450
It's your friend's wedding!

135
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,520
Ton, calm down.

136
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,290
- Okay.
- Thank you.

137
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,720
Don't you think the sky looks a bit weird today?

138
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,320
Hey! Don't say it! You're not supposed to say these things out loud.

139
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,450
But the sky seems very dark.

140
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,570
- If anything happens I will blame it on you.
- Aren't those rainclouds?

141
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,790
Come on, let's take a selfie.

142
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,650
Okay.

143
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,320
Wait, let's call Syn and Nuer too.

144
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,090
Syn! Nuer! Let's take a photo!

145
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,600
Come on!

146
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,550
Come on, hurry up!

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,950
Do we have to be this close?

148
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,380
Yeah. Why, do you mind?

149
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,150
Look, is this okay? Everyone's in the frame, right?

150
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,720
1, 2, 3!

151
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,100
Everyone.

152
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,590
It seems like it's going to rain.

153
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,780
Shit, it's raining!

154
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,860
I told you it was gonna rain! Why did it have to be today?!

155
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Come on, we need to take cover!

156
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,680
I need to curse at the rain first!

157
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,120
Why are you like this?! Come on!

158
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,980
Why did my words have to come true today out of all days?!

159
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,560
Hia, Kuea's wedding is ruined!

160
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,390
It's gonna be alright.

161
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,460
Stop!

162
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,150
Everything's ruined, stop right now!!

163
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,870
I told you to stop!!

164
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,490
Stop raining right now!!

165
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,380
Who's calling me at this time?!

166
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,050
Hello, Foei speaking!

167
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,690
What?

168
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,560
What did you say?!

169
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,440
The port is closed, the priest won't be able to make it?!

170
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,180
No!!!!!!

171
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,890
We're all wet.

172
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,110
Hia, what's the matter?

173
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,740
Wait for me here.

174
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,820
I'll be back.

175
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,450
Hia.

176
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,100
If something's the matter, tell me.

177
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,500
Lian left his ring with me, and now I can't find it.

178
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,060
Ring...

179
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,180
Kuea's ring is with me.

180
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,880
Can you recall...

181
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,390
When's the last time you saw it?

182
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,340
It was still in my pocket this morning.

183
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,470
Please calm down.

184
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,080
Mr. Lian.

185
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,630
I have something to report.

186
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:22,910
Um...

187
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,270
The priest cannot make it here.

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,700
Um...

189
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,480
Should we go inside?

190
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,390
Um...

191
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,080
Or maybe not...

192
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:41,890
Then...

193
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,930
I'll deal with it.

194
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,200
I promise.

195
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,520
Please excuse me.

196
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,000
Hia.

197
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,530
Our wedding...

198
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,230
It's all ruined.

199
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,880
No.

200
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,920
We'll make it through, like always.

201
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,010
Think of this as another trial for us.

202
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,070
But the most important thing...

203
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,720
Is the person in front of me.

204
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,390
Okay.

205
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,470
At least...

206
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,030
We still have each other.

207
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,830
I love you.

208
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,480
Maybe...

209
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,980
The ring is outside?

210
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,190
I'm not sure.

211
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,180
It's raining so hard...

212
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,670
I don't think it will stop any time soon.

213
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,510
Hey!

214
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,470
What's so hard about this?!

215
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,210
Hey!

216
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,860
Don't!!

217
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,270
I don't think you're pure enough to do this.

218
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,770
Are you looking down on me?

219
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,770
Let go!

220
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,760
Do you think it counts if I've already kissed and made out a bit?

221
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,060
I'm pretty sure it does.

222
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,790
Do you think it's here?

223
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,609
Help me find it.

224
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,420
Uh...

225
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,730
What are you doing in the rain?

226
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,740
Foei.

227
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,780
Help me find the ring.

228
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,930
What ring?

229
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,130
The wedding ring.

230
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,790
You lost it?!

231
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,330
Yes, we can't find the wedding ring.

232
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,040
Should we continue looking for it?

233
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,420
What are you guys trying to find?

234
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,020
The ring...

235
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,850
Is it this?

236
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,770
It's the ring!

237
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,930
The ring!

238
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,190
The priest!

239
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,160
We found everything!

240
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,230
Nu Kuea.

241
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,740
If our wedding...

242
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,130
Is not like what you dreamed of...

243
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,290
I...

244
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,630
Hia...

245
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,190
I'm sorry.

246
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,280
You don't have to say sorry.

247
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,670
No matter what happens today.

248
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,370
I will still treasure...

249
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,870
Everything that happened...

250
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,820
And will happen today.

251
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,980
Because it's our wedding.

252
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,820
Thank you.

253
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,130
Hia!

254
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,670
The rain stopped.

255
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,020
That's true.

256
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,280
Let's get married.

257
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,770
Yes.

258
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,310
Let's go.

259
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,940
Let's get ourselves ready for the ceremony.

260
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,310
Yes.

261
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,990
Mr. Kuea, you can apply this first to nourish your skin.

262
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,030
To have and to hold.

263
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,580
From this day forward.

264
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,990
For better, for worst.

265
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,300
For richer.

266
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,880
For poorer.

267
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,560
In sickness.

268
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,060
And health.

269
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,160
Until death do us part.

270
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,660
You may now exchange your rings.

271
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,700
I do.

272
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,610
You may now kiss.

273
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,820
Come on.

274
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,260
I'm going to throw the flower.

275
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,500
It's my turn now!

276
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,040
- I'm going to get it!
- It's mine!

277
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,440
Come on! Woo!

278
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,960
Throw it to me! Throw it over!

279
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,840
This way! Throw it this way!

280
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Over here!

281
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,530
The story of Kuea Keerati...

282
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,630
Continues.

283
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,190
It won't end here.

284
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,530
Lian Kilen Wang.

285
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,120
My fiance.

286
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,730
No.

287
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,450
My other half.

288
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,540
Will always be my love.

289
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,870
Even if we're temporarily walking different paths.

290
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,810
Doing what each of us want and have to do.

291
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,450
I chose to follow my dream.

292
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,840
There is no way to know...

293
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,240
That what I've chosen...

294
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,120
[Do your best today, Kirin.]
Is the correct choice.

295
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,690
[I'll be rooting for you.]

296
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,370
But this is life.
[I'll be rooting for you.]

297
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,410
There are things we'll have to try in order to find out.

298
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,610
We can keep trying.

299
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,310
[Thank you, Hia.]

300
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,890
[I'm trying my best and I wish you were here too.]

301
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,990
Some choices require a lot of logical thinking.
[I'm trying my best and I wish you were here too.]

302
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,890
[I love you so much, Hia.]
Some choices require a lot of logical thinking.

303
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,030
[I love you so much, Hia.]

304
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,620
Other times, we can do things we enjoy.

305
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,610
And other times, we'll need to use...

306
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,490
Our hearts.

307
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:25,840
Kirin.

308
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:27,890
Are you ready?

309
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,060
In about an hour, we will have a press conference.

310
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,350
Hello~

311
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,420
The moment you’ve all been waiting for is finally here.

312
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,660
It is such an amazing sight seeing both Thai and Korean fans show up.

313
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,150
Kirin from Thailand will be having his first stage and will officially debut as an artist in Korea.

314
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,730
Are you guys ready?

315
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,280
Ladies and gentlemen. Please welcome...

316
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:17,920
Kirin!

317
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,680
Mr. Kirin.

318
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,510
Yes?

319
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,070
Please wait here for a moment.

320
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,670
Your fans have prepared a project for you.

321
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,150
A fan project for me?

322
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,200
An event?

323
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,850
I've only just debuted...

324
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,050
Is it really for me?

325
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,490
Yes, it's for you!

326
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,510
Please wait here.

327
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,360
Yes.

328
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,100
A fan project?

329
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,670
Didn't I just only debut?

330
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,480
Is this a hidden camera?

331
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,730
Is this some kind of test?

332
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:31,600
Whatever.

333
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,410
Kirin.

334
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,580
Hia!

335
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,590
Nu Kuea.

336
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,930
Congratulations.

337
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,180
My Nu Kuea is the best.

338
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,670
You've succeeded in another goal.

339
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,080
I love you, Hia.

340
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,530
Come here.

341
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,940

343
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,540

The story of Kuea Keerati that has encountered many events...

352
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,430
Which has now reached Chapter 21, is going to end soon.

353
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,010
Hia Lian.

354
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,350
Has always been in every page of this book.

355
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,320
Up until now.

356
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,700
I don't know what the next chapters will hold.

357
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,600
But no matter what our love...

358
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,470
Our dreams...

359
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,940
And our future...

360
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,750
Will have in stall for us...

361
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,390
No matter how hard it will be...

362
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,970
Or how many times we'll have to start over...

363
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,120
I hope that love...

364
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,590
Will always be with us.

365
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,950
Thanks to everything

366
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,390
That created...

367
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,490
Us.

368
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,050
Kuea.

369
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:55,960
Keerati.

370
