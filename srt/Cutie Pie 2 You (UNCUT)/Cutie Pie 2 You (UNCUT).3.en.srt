1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,470
Cosmixo Entertainment?!

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,400
In Korea?!

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,129
Yes, it's Kirin speaking.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,560
Dude! Did I just talk to Cosmixo Entertainment just now?

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,620
You!

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,870
Me?

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,770
You just left without saying a word.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,970
I just want to be with you.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,320
Whether you can be mindful or not.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,330
I just want to be with you no matter what.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,570
Hia.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
I have something to tell you.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,800
I got an offer to become an artist...

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,260
at Cosmixo Entertainment in Korea.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,860
I want to go.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,860
What about our wedding?

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,550
It's okay.

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,820
It's okay?

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,490
Yeah.

20
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,900
It's okay.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,550
How can it be okay?

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,800
What do you want to do about it?

23
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:34,479
What about you, Nu Kuea.

24
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,550
Huh?

25
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,039
What about me?

26
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,560
What do you want to do about it?

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,020
Why are you asking me this?

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,320
You don't want to marry me anymore?

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,260
Nu.

30
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,010
I've never once thought about not marrying you.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,640
Then why did you ask me what I wanted to do about it?

32
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,400
Well, we have to talk about it, right?

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,010
Our marriage is about the two of us.

34
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,200
Of course I'd have to ask you.

35
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,770
Do you want to push it back or what do you want to do?

36
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,160
I don't want to push it back.

37
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,860
I don't want to cancel it.

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,140
I don't want to live without you.

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,620
I want to marry you, Hia.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,280
I also want to marry you.

41
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,670
But marriage...

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,260
is something we need to make decisions together.

43
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,740
Just like you told me before.

44
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,320
That's why.

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,770
You can tell me what you want to do.

46
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,520
I'll also tell you what I want to do.

47
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,940
No matter what you choose.

48
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,510
Or what I choose.

49
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,160
You'll always have me by your side.

50
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,690
I love you, Hia.

51
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,659
I love you too, Nu.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,710
I love you a lot.

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,150
Come on, give me a smile.

54
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,720
Okay.

55
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,350
Hia!

56
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,280
What are you doing?

57
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,300
I miss you.

58
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,290
I like this color.

59
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,320
Why are you smiling?

60
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,770
Hia, you're always staring at me.

61
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,650
If you don't want me to stare at you then who should I be looking at?

62
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,830
It's time to wake up.

63
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
I don't wanna~

64
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,920
You have to wake up.

65
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,380
We need to go check out the location for our wedding.

66
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,930
Can't you give me 10 more minutes?

67
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,760
No.

68
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,240
If you want 10 more minutes...

69
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,940
I'll do something else with you.

70
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,990
Hia!

71
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,210
So are you going to wake up now?

72
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,810
Ever since you started your internship...

73
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,150
You've never let me...

74
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,280
I want to save it for our special day.

75
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,280
I'll wait for it.

76
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,050
Hia!

77
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,490
Didn't you say we have to get going?

78
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,340
Hia.

79
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,390
I'm going to take a shower.

80
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,570
Hia!

81
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,430
I have to go!

82
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,200
I am coming.

83
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,440
Nong Diao.

84
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,920
Why today still have appointment of meeting?

85
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,060
I canceled all the meeting for this week already

86
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,470
Check for me again .

87
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,860
Who did Mr. Sudtra send?

88
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,400
No need, it is his business to send whoever he want.

89
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,250
Anyway he is Diao’s father .

90
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,020
I am not there, it is ok I will take care of it .

91
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,990
For my condo just keep it there.

92
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,260
I may need to move to my condo .

93
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,240
Diao?

94
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,550
He will still stay in my house .

95
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,940
You stay in hotel right ? ok I will come to meet you

96
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,380
Wait a moment Hia.

97
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,200
let me check the dog food.

98
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,080
Nong Diao, no rush.

99
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,530
I'm Ready.

100
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,430
The plant!

101
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,270
Now it is really settled Hia .

102
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,640
Forgot anything?

103
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,080
No, nothing .

104
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,670
Yes.

105
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,100
Until now you still not answer me about next step of our relationship .

106
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,540
Now , now we have to go .

107
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,150
It is late.

108
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,090
I told you that not hurry .

109
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,750
See, Hia?

110
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,880
We didn't have to hurry that much.

111
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,820
I hate being late.

112
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,240
But this is also not on time because we arrived here way too early.

113
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,260
Who was the one in a hurry today?

114
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,950
I wasn't in that much of a hurry.

115
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,050
That's because I was afraid you'd scold me.

116
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,860
Scold you for what?

117
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,910
You scold me on a daily basis.

118
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,760
All the time.

119
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,530
When did I ever scold you?

120
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,360
See?

121
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,740
Do you see?

122
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,440
You're doing it right now.

123
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,280
Nong Diao.

124
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,570
Yes?

125
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
About what we discussed earlier, what are your thoughts on that?

126
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,240
Aren't you thinking about it too?

127
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,980
Thinking about what?

128
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,200
Nong Diao.

129
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,930
Yes?

130
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,770
Actually, you and I...

131
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,480
Shouldn't we also be moving forward with our relationship?

132
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,590
If you still don't have an answer for me, that's fine.

133
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,550
But don't forget about it.

134
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,640
Give me an answer when you're ready.

135
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,310
Hello, Mr. Lian.

136
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,240
Hello, Young Master Kuea.

137
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:45,920
Hello.

138
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,840
Are you alright?

139
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,520
Oh.

140
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,290
I'm doing great, Mr. Lian.

141
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,780
But...

142
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,940
I think you don't look so good.

143
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,690
I'm 100% fine.

144
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,520
Not 15.

145
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,660
Not 50.

146
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,720
But definitely 100%.

147
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,680
Take a break if you're tired.

148
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,750
Yi will be here soon, you can let him help you out.

149
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,480
Mr. Yi and Mr. Kon Diao already arrived.

150
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,320
Hia Yi really never comes late.

151
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,340
How's the preparation progress right now?

152
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,250
Um... please come take a look inside.

153
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,600
This way, please.

154
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,080
This is... the location of the wedding.

155
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,880
I'm sorry.

156
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,940
Be more careful.

157
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm sorry.

158
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,450
Are you alright?

159
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,660
I'm fine.

160
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,100
Thank you.

161
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,250
So, what do you think?

162
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,530
Is this color alright for the table cloth?

163
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,210
Oh, yes.

164
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,100
Mr. Foei, the flowers are here, do you want them to bring it in right away?

165
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,700
Oh, sure.

166
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,130
Mr. Foei, Secretary Kim is looking for you.

167
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,680
Oh, please tell her I'll be right there.

168
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,200
Okay.

169
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,840
Er...

170
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,860
This is the area where we'll hold the traditional wedding ceremonies.

171
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,500
And there will be more flowers coming later for the flower display over there.

172
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
There will still be more flowers?

173
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,990
Oh, it's the location for when you exchange vows.

174
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,579
- The weather's nice.
- Mhm.

175
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,200
Kuea!

176
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,660
Oh! Diao!

177
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,850
Hello, Hia Yi.

178
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,560
Hi.

179
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,060
You came from that side?

180
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,410
How is it?

181
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
They're still preparing the location so I haven't seen it yet.

182
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,020
Then let's go check out things over there.

183
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,680
Sure.

184
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,920
I need to organize some things over there.

185
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,710
Please excuse me, Mr. Lian.

186
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,940
I should get back to work.

187
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,710
Seems like it'll be a little tiring.

188
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,330
What do you think of this color?

189
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,310
Do you like it?

190
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,250
It's so-so.

191
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,090
I vaguely remember that you're not really fond of this color.

192
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,190
Sorry, I just got here.

193
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,320
It's fine.

194
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,720
Come on, help me out.

195
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,860
Sure.

196
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,340
What do you think of this color?

197
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,780
So what are you going to do about it?

198
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,900
What can I do?

199
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,960
First, help me call the supplier for cloths.

200
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,830
This color seems...

201
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,210
What are your thoughts?

202
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,890
I'm not too sure about it.

203
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,490
But maybe it's fine?

204
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,600
Mr. Lian.

205
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,270
Young Master Kuea.

206
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,610
Right now, the situation...

207
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,210
It's 100% an SOS!

208
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,370
Right now, things aren't going according to plan at all.

209
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,850
Go on.

210
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,920
Um...

211
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,390
The formal colors that Mr. Lian wanted...

212
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,870
Became yellow...

213
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,450
And pink.

214
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,780
And the color that Young Master Kuea wanted...

215
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,540
The white and grey...

216
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,560
Became a mustard yellow.

217
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,000
The flowers... are also not enough.

218
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,700
And...

219
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,500
We're holding an outdoor wedding.

220
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,220
But it seems like...

221
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,170
The weather isn't suitable at all.

222
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,740
Um... Mr. Lian, Young Master Kuea.

223
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,580
What should we do now?

224
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,990
Is there still time to fix the situation?

225
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,850
There should still be some time left.

226
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,300
If you can't fix this...

227
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,550
You're fired.

228
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,020
Yes, sir.

229
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,840
I can fix it.

230
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,640
I must fix it.

231
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,850
What are you waiting for?

232
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,460
Oh.

233
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,030
You mean Young Master Kuea...

234
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,850
Mr. Khon Diao...

235
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,270
and Mr. Yi, right?

236
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,730
Get going already.

237
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,670
Oh, you mean me!

238
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,940
Yes, sir!

239
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:01,890
I got it!

240
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,710
Where did my staff go?

241
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,670
Everyone! Come on! Let's go!

242
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,650
I'll have to ask for you guys' help.

243
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,060
Syn

244
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,270
Hia.

245
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,650
Let's choose this one.

246
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,650
Are you tired?

247
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,270
What about you?

248
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,750
Are you feeling stressed out?

249
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,050
I'm not stressed at all.

250
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,920
Nuer, what's wrong?

251
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,300
I've got a stomache ache... it really hurts.

252
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,370
So suddenly?

253
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,950
Is it appendicitis?

254
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,710
I don't know.

255
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,440
Hang in there, okay?

256
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,850
Syn, call the ambulance.

257
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,700
What's wrong?!

258
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,500
Call 1669!

259
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,750
What the hell is wrong with you?

260
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,950
Help me take Nuer inside first.

261
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,450
Are you okay?

262
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,650
Wait and see.

263
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,980
They're engineers majoring in acting.

264
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,140
Why don't we go get some wine?

265
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,800
Where are you bringing Nuer? Is there even people around here?

266
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,440
Oh?

267
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,460
Ton.

268
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,820
Hi, hi~

269
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,230
Seems like I'm fine now.

270
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,440
I'm completely healthy.

271
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,790
Syn.

272
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,560
You also deceived me?

273
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,130
No way.

274
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,920
I didn't even say anything.

275
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
That doesn't mean you didn't lie to me.

276
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,370
Please forgive me.

277
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,770
Are you guys done arguing yet? Kuea.

278
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,690
Hey!

279
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,130
Kuea!

280
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,170
You guys also came?

281
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Of course!

282
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,550
You're the first one in our group to get married, how can we miss this?

283
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,460
Syn told us that we must come to your bachelor party no matter what!

284
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,330
Thank you so much guys.

285
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,150
Are you done being touching?

286
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,680
Do you see this, Kuea? We have a theme.

287
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,790
Quickly go get changed!

288
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,430
So we can get on with the party.

289
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,510
Party, party~ We'll wait for you here.

290
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,150
Congratulations, Lian.

291
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,370
Is this my bachelor party?

292
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,250
Yeah.

293
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,720
Others aren't free.

294
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,900
But they did request you hold another party later.

295
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,630
Thanks, man.

296
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,760
What?

297
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,450
What's wrong?

298
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,450
Feeling hurt?

299
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,140
Why would I feel hurt?

300
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
Just seeing the year on this wine bottle is already worth it.

301
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,950
And also...

302
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,550
I'm getting married tomorrow.

303
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,650
I think I might be the happiest man on earth tonight.

304
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,100
Yeah.

305
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,410
I know.

306
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,750
Even if you get married now...

307
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,110
There won't be any rights for you regarding the law.

308
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,840
Why do you still want to get married now?

309
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,300
How many times are you going to ask me this?

310
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,220
These rights should be ours from the beginning.

311
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,390
I didn't want the laws to be like how it is now.

312
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,860
I want to make everything official as much as possible for Nu Kuea.

313
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,280
And also for his family.

314
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,140
As much as I can.

315
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,650
Especially for both of Nu Kuea's grandfathers.

316
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,350
Then what about yourself?

317
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,140
What about me?

318
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,550
You're not getting anything out of this marriage.

319
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,450
Apart from binding yourself with someone else.

320
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,950
What else would I need?

321
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,950
Things that make you feel secure.

322
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,450
At least think about your own feelings.

323
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,260
You're talking as if you can control your own feelings.

324
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,190
I know.

325
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,750
Love is not enough.

326
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,450
No matter what beautiful words people say...

327
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,750
About how people can get married if they love each other...

328
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,290
But there are times...

329
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,380
When I'd yield for Nu Kuea.

330
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,650
And there are times when Nu Kuea is at a disadvantage in our relationship.

331
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,970
But Nu Kuea and I...

332
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,320
Both want each other in our lives.

333
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,790
For now and forever.

334
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,940
I don't know exactly what I have to do either.

335
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,010
But I want to spend my life with Nu Kuea.

336
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,480
You'll be able to do that, Lian.

337
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,310
Thanks man.

338
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:56,140
(Are you having fun?)

339
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,470
Hia.

340
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,460
Why did you come back so late?

341
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
Why haven't you gone to bed yet?

342
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,510
I'm about to.

343
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,350
Goodnight, Hia.

344
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,070
Goodnight, Nong Diao.

345
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,890
I'm done, Nuer.

346
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,070
Sa-Tu (Thai prayer.)

347
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,430
Goodnight, Syn.

348
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,840
Goodnight, Nuer.

349
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,200
Allow me...

350
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,440
Please allow me to sleep next to you.

351
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,880
Sorry, Nuer.

352
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,250
I'm not good at kissing yet.

353
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,920
It's okay.

354
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,770
Let's just get onto the next lesson.

355
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,970
Nuer, are you alright?!

356
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,540
I'm fine.

357
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,770
Do you want to get on with the lesson?

358
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:24,830
Ow!

359
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,960
Nuer, I'm so sorry!

360
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,710
Are you alright, Nuer?

361
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,420
You're okay, right?

362
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,220
I think maybe we should just sleep?

363
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,920
Yeah.

364
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,260
What are you doing out here alone?

365
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,580
I'm missing you.

366
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,700
Are you drunk?

367
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm just thinking about some stuff while waiting for you.

368
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,410
Nu Kuea.

369
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:02,880
Yes?

370
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,850
You really want to get married right now, right?

371
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,100
Are you starting to question our marriage after your bachelor party with Hia Yi?

372
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,640
No way.

373
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,150
I've never doubted anything when it comes to us.

374
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,850
I'm just worried about you.

375
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,670
I will marry you.

376
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,760
Let's get married.

377
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,910
How many times are you going to say this?

378
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,780
I can't help it.

379
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,720
Because I love you.

380
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,050
I love you too.

381
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,040
Hia!

382
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,390
What are you doing?!

383
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,920
Hia!

384
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,660
Put on your clothes right now!

385
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,560
I want to go for a swim.

386
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,900
Do you want to come with me?

387
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,750
Swimming at this hour?!

388
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,390
No thanks.

389
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,200
If you don't want me to swim...

390
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,900
Can I play with you instead?

391
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,900
Hia!

392
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,090
Hia.

393
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,470
Are you sure doing this here is a good idea?

394
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,210
Someone might come by…

395
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:05,970
No one will see us.

396
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,920
I made sure that this area is clear.

397
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,610
I think...

398
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,730
We should do it tomorrow.

399
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,520
Since our marriage is tomorrow...

400
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:39,980
I want it to be the happiest day of our lives.

401
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,670
Can you wait a bit more?

402
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,880
Then can I just marry you now?

403
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:09,320
Hia.

404
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,370
I will wait for tomorrow.

405
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,750
I will make you...

406
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,420
the happiest person in the world.

407
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,300
Let's get married.

408
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,440
I can't find Lian’s ring.

409
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,100
Mr. Foei, we have a situation!

410
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,500
It seems like it's going to rain.

411
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,300
The port is closed, the priest won’t be able to make it.

412
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,670
If our wedding is not like what you dreamed of...

413
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,420
I'm sorry.
