Lord Lu,

5
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,420
come with me.

6
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,900
Now?

7
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,840
What?

8
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,710
Do you want my master to wait for you?

9
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,290
This Yuming Lock

10
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,329
is well designed.

11
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
It can only be opened

12
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,880
with the ciphertext.

Beijing

15

doesn't have budget on military expenditure now.

16
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,930
The Prince of Yan has exhausted all resources to build up his military power.

17
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,350
Now he's like an arrow at the end of its flight.

18
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,590
This Yuming Lock

19
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,870
is possessed by Your Majesty now,

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,990
and it'll stop the Prince of Yan from thinking about it once and for all.

21
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,820
The ciphertext of the Yuming Lock

22
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,790
was written by

23
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,810

Song Heming.

25
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,710
Only Lu Zheng

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,230
can find a way to

27
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,060
solve the mystery of the ciphertext.

28
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,470
Both the father and son of the Song Family

29
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,850
are still loyal.

30
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,770
I will do my best

32
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,340
to unlock

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,330

34
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,530
Your Majesty,

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,810
I think

36
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,370
the case of rebels

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,580
should be mainly handled by Sergeant Li Dongfang

38
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,190
from the Brocade-clad Guards,

39
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,040
and let's ask Lu Zheng to assist him.

40
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,430
Proceed.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

Li Wu.

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,790
Sir.

45
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
Don't you make a prescription?

46
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,190
There's no medicine used for curing his disease.

47
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,030
This is a mental disease.

48
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,150
Sir,

49
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,150
is there any way to cure his mental disease?

50
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,270
A mental disease should be treated with mental therapy.

51
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,900
My Lord.

52
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,750
Do you know why it's called Yuming Lock?

53
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,880
Yu means fish,

54
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,940
and Yuming means guarding something all night without sleeping.

55
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,460
A fish keeps its eyes open

56
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,990
to protect the country

57
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,340
of Ming Dynasty for His Majesty.

58
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,180
During the Hongwu period,

59
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,810
your father Mu Jinggao

60
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,940
got a method

61
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,890
of manufacturing firearms in Annan.

62
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,800
He made a batch of

63
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,340
firearms for the emperor.

64
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,490
The emperor didn't want to see continuous wars

65
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,660
and turmoil again,

66
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,690
so he hid this batch of firearms

67
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,670
before he passed away.

68
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,410
The messenger between the emperor and Mu Jinggao

69
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,980
was Li Yan, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War.

70
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,280
Li Yan

71
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,370
was also the last person whom the emperor saw

72
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,930
before he passed away.

73
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,250
Some rebellious Brocade-clad Guards

74
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,900
framed Li Yan,

75
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,090
and murdered the emperor.

76
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
His whole family was put into the imperial prison.

77
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,820
Li Yan was tortured with the Lute Punishment and got 12 wounds,

78
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,060
but he didn't tell the secret of the firearms.

79
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,750
The Brocade-clad Guard Song Heming came up with an idea.

80
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,370
He replaced Li Yan's son with a little thief

81
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,870
who was born in an impoverished place

82
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,370
so that a descendant

83
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,770
of the Li Family could survive.

84
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,450
That thief who was born in an impoverished place

85
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,630
is Li Wu.

86
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,010
Li Yan’s son

87
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,820
is me.

88
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,930
You're right.

89
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,290
I insisted on getting the Yuming Lock

90
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,530
because of my selfish motive.

91
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,030
I've handed the Yuming Lock

92
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,080
to His Majesty

93
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,400
in order to protect my father's reputation as a loyal official.

94
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,500
You...

95
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,260
Your surname is Yuan.

96
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,170
You're from Jining...

97
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,990
Li Yan can't be your father.

98
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,900
After I was sent out of the imperial prison,

99
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,820
Lord Yuan adopted me.

100
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,180
My father admitted it

101
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,240
and saved my life,

102
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,049
but he became a sinner of Ming Dynasty.

103
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,039
Mu Jinggao and his family were also implicated.

104
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,059
In the 29th year of the Hongwu period,

105
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,510
I secretly investigated the case,

106
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,020
and saved you from the Court Entertainment Bureau

107
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,210
because I felt guilty.

108
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,040
It wasn't my father who made your father, Mu Jinggao, die.

109
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,020
It was me.

110
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,500
With this despicable life of mine,

111
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,460
I don't deserve to live.

112
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,780
The war

113
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,910
will be over soon.

Be loyal to the emperor and serve the country.

115
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,310
I did it.

116
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,680
A father's debt should be repaid by his son.

117
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,110
I also did it.

118
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,940
There is one more thing I should do.

119
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,020
I need to return my life to you

120

as compensation.

Back then,

122
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,630
I advised you to live a normal life.

123
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,530
I knew you wouldn't do that.

124
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,360
Because you're just like me,

living for an obsessive idea.

126

Then why did you give me the Yuming Lock?

225

I gave it to Song Tianyi.

226

He did all that he could.

227

He even gave up his life.

Besides,

230

and experienced so many things that showed the evilness of people.

236

Not only did he not hate the world,

237

he also had the courage

No.

How can I investigate the case without evidence?

267

If Lord Yuan said someone is a rebel,

then he is the rebel.

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,870
The late emperor has burned the torture tools used by the Brocade-clad Guards.

346
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,150
How dare you!

347
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,290
You talked too much.

348
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,520
Torture him first.

349
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,630
You...

350
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,660
My Lord. You guys...

351
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,320
Stop pretending.

352
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,990
Let me ask you again.

353
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,240
Ten thousand...

354
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,190
Ten thousand...

355
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,170
I forgot the exact number.

356
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,450
What's 10,000 plus a random number?

357
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,740
Whatever you say

358
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,100
will be the answer.

359
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,580
What's the answer?

360
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,230
Whatever you say will be the answer.

361
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,180
Whatever you say will be the answer.

362
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,880
Sir.

363
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,530
[To Chen Gongcheng]

364
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,800
This is His Lordship's handwriting.

365
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,340
Father.

366
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,180
Go to the dock of the canal.

367
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Find that Mr. Shen.

368
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,720
Withdraw all of

369
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,510
our family's money.

370
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,370
Yes.

371
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,650
Withdraw all the silver ingots

372
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,520
in my account.

373
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,750
-Be careful. -Hurry up!

374
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,490
Hurry up!

375
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,020
-Go, go, go! -Go!

376
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,720
Carry it away.

377
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,190
Get ready.

378
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,870
The officials will come to get the silver later.

379
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,900
By the way,

380
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,140
help me pack up.

381
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,650
I need to go to the Investigation Bureau to turn myself in.

382
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,750
Okay.

383
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,530
Got it, boss.

384
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,260
My Lord,

385
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,260
this is my master's visiting card.

386
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,170
Please have mercy

387
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,160
and spare him.

388
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,830
Come on. Hurry up.

389
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,400
Hurry up.

390
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,830
My Lord.

391
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,170
What's going on with these silver ingots?

392
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,940
You can't hear me?

393
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,930
Even if you can't hear me, I'll say it.

394
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,280
Totally five carriages came here last night.

395
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
There are so many trunks here.

396
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,710
There are tens of thousands of taels at least.

397
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,980
I've recorded them all in the log book.

398
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,050
During the Hongwu period,

399
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,610
two taels of silver ingots for bribery would make you get beheaded.

400
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,670
There is such a large sum of money here.

401
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,000
You've accepted such a large sum of money. You'll be beheaded...

402
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,680
You'll at least be beheaded for...

403
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,540
countless times.

404
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,020
98,000 taels of silver ingots.

405
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,390
Seal them on the spot.

406
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,730
Send them all to the palace.

407
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,270
Yes.

408
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:10,700
Yes.

409
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,300
Last night,

410
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,790
I fulfilled a wish.

411
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,050
How does it feel to sleep in a pile of money?

412
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,510
They're so stiff that my muscle aches.

413
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,680
My Lord,

414
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,820
you've recovered?

415
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,200
I have a mental disease.

416
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,890
The rebles' case is still unsolved.

417
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,670
I feel worried for His Majesty.

418
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,690
However,

419
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,110
when I saw the buddies

420
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,740
of the Investigation Bureau working so hard on the case

421
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,820
without having internal conflicts,

422
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,330
my mental disease

423
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,250
was cured.

424
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,930
We went to confiscate some officials' property several times before,

425
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,810
but we didn't find anything valuable.

426
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,650
I guessed

427
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,440
the money which the Prince of Yan had used to bribe the officials

428
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,130
must not be hidden at home.

429
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,230
So I schemed to

430
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,020
let them pay for the chances to survive.

431
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,560
To pay for the chances to survive,

432
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,850
of course they have to give

433
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,810
as much money as they have.

434
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,100
Therefore,

435
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,990
they confiscated

436
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,160
their own property by themselve,

437
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,410
and even sent the silver ingots

438
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,430
to my residence personally.

439
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,670
My Lord,  you're so brilliant and smart.

440
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,760
Tang Yu, Guo Di.

441
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,570
You two go catch the man

442
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,120
who hid money for the rebels.

443
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:21,930
My Lord.

444
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm stupid.

445
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,400
Who should we catch?

446
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,370
Ask Lord Lu.

447
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,830
Last night,

448
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,800
he was secretly investigating it all the time.

449
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,490
Five carriages, and 98,000 taels of silver ingots.

450
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,620
Are you going to record them all in the log book?

451
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,460
Don't record them.

452
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:50,930
You can't do that.

453
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:54,860
My Lord.

454
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,780
Something is wrong.

455
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,390
Why has this brat

456
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,480
already packed up by himself?

457
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:01,850
Search!

458
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,310
Lord Lu, no need to search.

459
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,690
The silver ingots are all in the water. Take your time to bring them up.

460
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,860
Count them carefully. Do it quickly.

461
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,970
Let all the officials of the imperial court see this.

462
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,020
I didn't know

463
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,370
the Ming Dynasty

464
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,540
is so rich.

465
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,170
My Lord.

466
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,800
Silver ingots have always been rare.

467
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,030
So many of them suddenly appeared for no reason.

468
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,300
That Mr. Shen must not be simple.

469
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,490
If we find a few more corrupt officials,

470
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,320
we won't

471
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,110
be able to fight the war anymore.

472
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:07,980
Do you want to eat it?

473
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,890
I can let you eat it.

474
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,420
But you have to do me a favor.

475
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:16,910
What favor is it?

476
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,200
I don't want to eat.

477
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:18,910
But

478
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,660
I might as well listen to it.

479
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,210
Today, Lord Yuan told me something

480
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,630
that I don’t understand.

481
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,200
Please explain it to me.

482
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,540
Repeat what he said.

483
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,910
He said

484
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,810
if we catch a few more corrupt officials,

485
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,970
we won't be able to fight the war anymore.

486
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,710
No.

487
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,330
You have to rehearse the scene again

488
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,100
so that I can figure it out in a better way.

489
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,650
He said it in this way.

490
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,410
I stood here.

491
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,010
He was here.

492
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,390
He told me

493
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,610
if we catch a few more corrupt officials...

494
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,550
How many corrupt officials are you going to catch?

495
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,790
What was his expression?

496
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,830
He looked very serious.

497
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,110
Is it delicious?

498
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,050
No, it isn't.

499
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,240
If it's not delicious, why did you eat over half a bowl of it?

500
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,230
This sentence has two completely different meanings.

501
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,890
One is asking you

502
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,500
not to arrest corrupt officials anymore.

503
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,210
The war has not ended and there will be no competent men in the imperial court.

504
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,540
The other is asking you

505
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,260
to catch all the rebels

506
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,590
and return all the confiscated silver ingots to the national treasury

507
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,500
so as to fill the boundless pit of military expenses.

508
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,300
Do you know that for the deployment of troops,

509
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,140
every step

510
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,280
costs money.

511
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,910
I see.

512
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,280
No matter what choice I make,

513
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,190
it'll be my responsibility if anything goes wrong.

514
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,820
Do what you know you can't do.

515
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,490
Understand?

516
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,790
No matter

517
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,620
whether you can do something or not,

518
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,130
just think about whether you should do it or not.

519
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,130
Who said that?

520
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,800
A saint.

521
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,700
Which saint?

522
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,850
Confucius.

523
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,550
Whichever saint said it, I don't agree with that.

524
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,280
I'll lose my life if I fail.

525
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,460
Why should we think about whether we should do it or not?

526
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,239
Only by working hard on finishing the tasks

527
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,650
can I survive to have the chance to do what I should do.

528
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,340
There are the right things and the wrong things.

529
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,530
The world is simple actually,

530
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,170
but everyone thinks like you,

531
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,870
and that's why it's getting worse.

532
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:20,940
Let me ask you.

533
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,860
If 10,000 mistakes add up together,

534
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,929
can they be equal to a right action?

535
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,940
Thank you, sister.

536
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,210
Miss.

537
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,340
Are you here to deliver goods?

538
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,520
Miss Zhang, are you alright?

539
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,250
I have an idea.

540
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,710
It can help you wash the bowls faster.

541
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,240
What is it?

542
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,700
Find a carriage

543
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,080
and put these bowls into the carriage.

544
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,380
Find a place where there is nobody around

545
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,530
and dig a big hole.

546
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,370
Bury these bowls

547
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,160
into it.

548
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,660
Tomorrow morning,

549
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,000
I'll buy some new bowls back.

550
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,770
You're amazing.

551
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,330
The youngest sergeant of the Investigation Bureau,

552
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,340
the son of the chief commander,

553
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,590
His Majesty's favorite Brocade-clad Guard,

554
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,190
and Confucius's star pupil.

555
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,090
Lord Lu.

556
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,500
You're stumped by washing bowls?

557
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,900
Lord Lu, you seldom do housework.

558
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,090
Do you know how much these bowls and dishes

559
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,000
are worth?

560
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,350
Do you know how much

561
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,850
a farmer earns a year?

562
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,050
As a commoner, you're quite good at making up stories.

563
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,970
I'm just complaining.

564
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,250
You don't have to say so much

565
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,010
to satirize me.

566
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,090
If you slack off again,

567
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
I have something worse to say.

568
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,360
And I'm telling the truth.

569
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,290
I want to hear

570
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,520
what else is worse.

571
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,900
You have a very interesting nickname.

572
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,270
You don't know it yourself,

573
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,130
but all the people of the Investigation Bureau

574
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,970
know about it.

575
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,360
What?

576
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,170
Among

577
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,930
all the people of the Investigation Bureau,

578
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,850
you're the only virgin.

579
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,440
Well,

580
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,420
don't be discouraged or have a sense of inferiority because of this.

581
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,090
It hurts!

582
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,410
The wound is cracked.

583
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,180
-Does it hurt? -It hurts!

584
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,130
It really hurts!

585
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,290
Let me see.

586
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,110
My Lord.

587
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,480
Something bad happened to Miss Zhang.

588
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,300
There's something urgent.

589
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,670
Did you ask two people to come here on purpose

590
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,820
so as to avoid washing the bowls?

591
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,610
Only you would do something like this.

592
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,890
Be careful.
