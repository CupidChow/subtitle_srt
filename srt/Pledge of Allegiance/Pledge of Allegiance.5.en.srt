15
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,460
You have been in the Imperial Prison?

16
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,740
Do you dare to take revenge?

17
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,110
What's your name?

18
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,050
Zhang Junqing.

19
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,400
The only sin in this world

20
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,310
is being weak.

21
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,850
The only kind of justice

22
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,029
is strength.

23
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,750
Take this sword

24
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,810
and wipe out evil.

25
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,380
It reeks of medicinal herbs.

26
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,200
Are you injured?

27
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,990
Where is the Yuming Lock?

28
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,360
Ma'am, spare my life!

29
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,860
Ma'am, spare my life.

30
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,990
Ma'am.

31
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,909
Ma'am, spare my life.

32
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,330
Congratulations, Detective Lu.

33
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,010
The case is closed.

34
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,270
After signing the documents,

35
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,720
I'll give you the main credit.

36
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,120
Lu Zheng of the Brocade-clad Guards found out

37
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,980
the deputy commander of the Jinan Brocade-clad Guards,

38
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,240
Wang Kegong, colluded with Yan.

39
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,050
Lu Zheng killed the rebel.

40
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,850
Wang Kegong is a rebel.

41
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,590
Detective Lu killed the rebel

42
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,270
and exposed his conspiracy.

43
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,620
You have made a great contribution.

44
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,790
Wang Kegong is a rebel?

45
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,930
We found the memorial tablet

46
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,320
of sinner Song Heming in Wang Kegong's mansion.

47
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,100
You are still young so you may not know.

48
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,950
On April 25, the 25th year of Hong Wu's reign.

49
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,159
The sinner, Song Heming,

50
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,210
colluded with the rebels

51
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,960
and released a death row prisoner in the imperial prison.

52
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,130
He was executed on the spot.

53
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
A slip of thought

54
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,990
ruined his family and his reputation.

55
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,220
Wang Kegong

56
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,409
hid Song Heming's memorial tablet.

57
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,040
That is an act of rebellion.

58
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,000
You're still young.

59
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,430
You have a bright future.

60
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,420
Don't

61
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,860
make the wrong choice.

62
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,640
I didn't kill Lord Wang.

63
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,980
He's not a rebel either.

64
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,260
Your Excellency.

65
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,680
Your Excellency.

66
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,040
How cruel.

67
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,780
He's obviously adopted

68
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,080
and not his biological son.

69
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,250
Have we

70
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,350
met before?

71
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,090
The fortune-teller said

72
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,260
you're my jinx.

73
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,110
Li Dongfang.

74
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,120
You've been in the imperial prison.

75
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,850
You want us to help you

76
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,010
destroy the files in the file storeroom.

77
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,070
Without the record,

78
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,790
you can run away.

79
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,320
Am I right, Li Wu?

80
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,850
I want the Night Scouts

81
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,350
to help me steal something from the file storeroom

82
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,440
of the Brocade-clad Guards.

83
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,420
What is it?

84
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,520
Can you do it?

85
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,800
Of course.

86
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,310
But I never make deals.

87
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,270
Do you know why I brought you here?

88
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,350
Yuming Lock?

89
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,490
It's in Mount Guanyin.

90
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,450
I'll take you there now.

91
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,680
No hurry.

92
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,180
We are destined to meet.

93
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,720
I should treat you to a meal.

94
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,360
My lord, your food.

95
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,860
Thank you.

96
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,480
Eat.

97
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,310
How can I eat without using hands?

98
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,800
Bend down.

99
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,980
Eat with your mouth.

100
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,490
Don't stop me.

101
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:16,940
I...

102
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,250
I'll kill this little bastard.

103
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,590
Uncle Wang.

104
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,040
Don't stop me.

105
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,810
Uncle Wang.

106
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,750
Uncle Wang.

107
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,870
Uncle Wang.

108
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,000
What are you doing, Uncle Wang?

109
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,820
I'll beat you to death!

110
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,060
My lord,

111
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,890
don't stop me.

112
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,360
Today,

113
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,640
I will punish you on behalf of heaven.

114
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,690
Uncle Wang.

115
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,220
Enough.

116
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,880
Sir.

117
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,660
Are you his father?

118
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,100
My lord.

119
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,780
I...

120
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,230
I'm his neighbor.

121
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,040
Could it be...

122
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,880
his neighbor is his father?

123
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,760
No.

124
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,170
He is also a poor kid.

125
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,990
He has no parents.

126
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,690
He grew up begging from different families.

127
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,170
How could he

128
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,000
not go down the wrong path?

129
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,110
My lord,

130
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,010
I can tell

131
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,840
you are a good person.

132
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,970
I beg you,

133
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
please be lenient.

134
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,480
Please be lenient

135
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,990
and spare him this time.

136
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,610
Get lost!

137
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,260
Get lost!

138
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,000
Get out!

139
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,140
Mind your own business.

140
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,300
-Go away! -What

141
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,380
are you doing?

142
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,350
Get lost!

143
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,590
Li Wu

144
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:28,920
did nothing wrong.

145
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,870
Not only that,

146
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,300
he also helped us

147
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,680
resolve a big case.

148
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,070
Really?

149
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,640
To reward him,

150
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,370
I'm treating him to dinner.

151
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,400
That's great.

152
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,190
I have a jar of sunset wine

153
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,900
which I stored for 40 years.

154
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,890
Let's open it today.

155
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:48,990
Meng.

156
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,710
Get the wine.

157
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,350
Okay.

158
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,680
Serve the dishes.

159
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,060
This sunset wine

160
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:57,740
is well-aged.

161
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,890
Li Wu.

162
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,020
You must keep your promise.

163
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,870
Otherwise, the neighbors who care about you

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,210
will be very sad.

165
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,160
That's right.

166
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,170
Come on.

167
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,360
Here.

168
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:28,850
Eat.

169
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,680
Eat.

170
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,230
Okay, let's eat.

171
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,100
Eat up.

172
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,430
Eat up.

173
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,360
Eat.

174
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,430
This Yuming Lock

175
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,810
is not something you ordinary people should touch.

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,950
Go to the Investigation Bureau.

350
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,300
Yes.

351
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:13,960
Let's go.

352
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:22,950
My lord.

353
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,240
My lord.

354
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,740
Report!

355
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,460
Officer Xie Kengran

356
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,160
asked me to deliver an urgent document.

357
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,660
Get lost!

358
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,100

Fire! Fire!

360
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,890
Lower your voice.

361
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,380
Fire!

362
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,100
Stop shouting!

363
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,880
Shut up!

364
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,400
The Deputy Commander is here.

365
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,020
What is it?

366
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,380
My, my,

367
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,830
what a good hand of cards.

368
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,920
Let's go.

369
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,590
Hurry up!

370
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,160
Hurry!

371
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,980
Your Excellency.

372
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,700
Xie Kengran sent an urgent document.

373
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:17,670
Where is it?

374
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,770
What did Xie Kengran say?

375
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,260
Officer Xie said

376
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,860
he found the suspect in Ji'e Alley and

377
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,870
to send reinforcements to Mount Guanyin.

378
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,290
Please send reinforcements.

379
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,490
As you can see,

380
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,330
all our men tonight

381
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,140
are all on the rebels' case.

382
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,940
We don't have extra personnel.

383
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,270
Don't say I'm unreasonable.

384
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,530
You have six hours.

385
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,570
Come back to me when you find Xie Kengran.

386
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,610
Do you hear me?

387
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,050
Thank you.

388
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,340
My lord, why did you do that?

389
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,070
Inform everyone

390
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,480
to work on a case.

391
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,910
Lu Zheng, Detective of the Brocade-clad Guards,

392
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,480
escaped from prison.

393
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,930
Use all manpower to arrest him,

394
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,440
no matter dead or alive.

395
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,800
Why did you stop?

396
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,290
I'm tired

397
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,690
and the horse is tired too.

398
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,930
I haven't asked your name.

399
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:28,920
Xie Kengran.

400
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,920
Who are you?

401
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,810
Who do you think I am?

402
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,350
You're not a Brocade-clad Guard.

403
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,090
It's a serious crime to rob official titles and deceive the nobility.

404
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,140
You'll be beheaded.

405
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,510
The law

406
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,430
is only made for good people.

407
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,720
Nonsense!

408
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,830
Is there no justice in this world?

409
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,470
When will you meet them?

410
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:50,770
At dawn.

411
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,390
You saw

412
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,040
Wang Kegong's murderer?

413
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,490
Yes.

414
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,210
They are Prince of Yan's men.

415
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,580
Transferred from Beijing.

416
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,210
They're the Night Scouts.

417
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,820
My hometown is also Beijing.

418
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,230
They are the ones who guard the borders of Ming.

419
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,070
Judging from what you said,

420
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,450
you admire them.

421
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm just like them.

422
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,720
I'm a soldier.

423
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,320
Soldiers should obey orders.

424
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,740
We are just serving different masters.

425
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,080
Xie Kengran.

426
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,140
To be honest,

427
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,550
I

428
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,990
am not Li Dongfang.

429
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,920
I was sent by the Jinan Investigation Bureau

430
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,080
to arrest Li Dongfang.

431
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,590
Li Dongfang is a Night Scout.

432
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,460
He caught a friend of mine

433
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,670
and forced me to hand over something very important.

434
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,500
This thing is of great importance.

435
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,580
Wang Kegong died because of it.

436
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,350
And this thing

437
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,320
is the only thing that can save Lu Zheng.

438
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,390
What is it?

439
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,400
The Yuming Lock.

440
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,230
I hid it on Mount Guanyin.

441
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,530
This trip

442
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,580
will be very dangerous.

443
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,940
So I advise you

444
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,410
not to get involved in this.

445
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,550
I'll get involved in this.

446
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,710
As long as I can save Lu Zheng,

447
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,560
I'll risk my life.

My lord.

450
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,990
This is the new draft of The Book of Meters

451
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,590
sent from the old rebel of Hong Wu's reign.

452
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,290
The new draft can be decrypted with a secret letter from the Hong Wu period.

453
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,210
It says,

454
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,340
"On April 25, the 25th year of Hong Wu's reign, before his death.

455

The Crown Prince met with Li Yan, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War.

Song Heming, a Sergeant of the Brocade-clad Guards

and Detective Wang Kegong,

458
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,730
was ordered by the King of Yan

459
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,880
to arrest Li Yan and throw him into the imperial prison.

460
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,480
They interrogated Li Yan

461
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,020
about what the Crown Prince said before his death.

462
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,230
Although Li Yan was tortured, he didn't reveal anything."

My lord,

464

do you think

465
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,300
my father Mu Jinggao is still alive?

466
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,610
-Could that old rebel be... -Mu Jinggao is dead.

467
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,880
You should go to Mount Guanyin.

468
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,110
Bring Li Dongfang's head

469

and Yuming Lock to see me.

470

Don't worry.

Found it.

gave you the ability to work

00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,610
The Yuming Lock.

522
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,280
I can tell you where it is.

523
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,380
No need.

524
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,420
I want your life.

525
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,580
If you die,

526
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,900
no one will know where the Yuming Lock is.

527
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,680
Come back to the Bureau with me.

528
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,120
Let's go.

529
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,890
Are you okay?

530
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,770
I won't die.

531
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,870
That Night Scout wanted to kill me.

532
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,620
Why did you block the blow for me?

533
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,340
For...

534
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,310
Lu Zheng.

535
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,050
Life is important.

536
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,880
What's so good about Lu Zheng?

537
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,070
Why are you risking your life?

538
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,090
You made such a big mistake.

539
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,650
You'll be beheaded soon.

540
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
None of the Brocade-clad Guards

541
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,430
of the Investigation Bureau showed up.

542
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,420
You're the only one doing everything.

543
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,260
The Brocade-clad Guards

544
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,010
are no different from

545
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,100
farmers, traders

546
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,990
and even bandits.

547
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,590
It's all for survival.

548
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,020
It doesn't matter if you are popular.

549
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,690
If you get used to those

550
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,950
corrupt Brocade-clad Guards,

551
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,720
you will know how valuable Lu Zheng is.

552
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,600
I can't let him

553
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,630
die unjustly.

554
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,670
The people of this world,

555
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,460
only want to get promoted and get rich.

556
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,550
Good people

557
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,720
may not be rewarded.

558
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,350
So, Xie Kengran,

559
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,110
good people like you

560
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,480
are few.

561
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,740
Bullshit!

562
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,220
Justice prevails evil.

563
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,940
Xie Kengran, get up.

564
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,070
Go to the Investigation Bureau.

565
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,700
Hang in there.

566
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,430
-I'll take you to the hospital. -Hurry.

567
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:45,880
Go.

568
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,030
Let's go.

569
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,540
Only you can prove Lu Zheng's innocence.

570
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,990
Promise me you'll save him.

571
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,660
In Lu Zheng's eyes,

572
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,410
the Night Scouts are traitors

573
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,760
and rebels.

574
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,820
I can't let him

575
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,870
know I'm a Night Scout.

576
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,470
I hope

577
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,380
in his eyes,

578
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,200
I'll always be Xie Kengran.

579
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,070
Okay.

580
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,990
I'm his best friend

581
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,670
but I deceived him.

582
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,490
The righteous Xie Kengran

583
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,020
is a liar.

584
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,220
Also,

585
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,270
I can't drink wine from Zuixian Tavern anymore.

586
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,790
And the fabric I bought for the child,

587
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,440
I won't be able to see it

588
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,720
made into clothing.

589
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,630
Xie Kengran.

590
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,570
Xie Kengran.

591
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,230
Xie Kengran.

592
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,400
Xie Kengran.

593
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,500
Xie Kengran.

594
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,350
Xie Kengran!

595
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,690
Xie Kengran.

596
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,710
Xie Kengran!

597
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,650
Xie Kengran!

598
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,150
Xie Kengran!

599
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,100
Xie Kengran!

600
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:13,950
Officer Xie

601
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,450
is dead?

602
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,220
Search carefully.

603
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,810
Yes.
