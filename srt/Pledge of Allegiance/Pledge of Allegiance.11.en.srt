Aren't we all working on our own?

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,829
Move.

Didn't you say there was no other clues?

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,890
What's this man hiding in the yard?

Lord Li,

I can't let you take any more risks.

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,670
Does it fit you?

Yes.

How do you know the size of my shoes?

Let me sing it for you.

Is your father Wang Kegong

a rebel or not?

63
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,230
Lord Li, if you say he is, then he is.

If you say he isn't, then he isn't.

70

for over a decade.

81

He is Ironsmith Zhou who forged iron for military families

This thief

Then he killed that Brocade-clad Guard

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,550
is a scapegoat.

177
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,150
He will definitely die.

178
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,750
Chief Commander

179
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,610
wants you to be this scapegoat for me.

180
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,320
Lu Zheng.

181
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,800
If someone like me wants to be rich,

182
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,980
he has to take risks.

183
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,960
What if it succeeds

184
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,250
after I fight for it?

185
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,860
You are a cloud,

186
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,120
I am mud.

187
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,490
We can't be friends.

188
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,440
Stop pretending.

189
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,140
There are many ways for you to level up.

190
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,960
Don't get in my way.

191
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,560
Do you have to take charge of the rebel case?

192
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,670
Yes.

193
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,120
What can you do?

194
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,130
Take this

195
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,940
delivery document for munitions.

196
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,760
Thank you.

197
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,160
Mr. Zhou.

198
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,420
My Lord.

199
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,130
Lord Lu! Lord Lu!

200
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:51,820
My Lord.

201
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,420
Please.

202
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,130
My Lord.

203
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,820
Li Dongfang.

204
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,830
You're finally here.

205
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,140
Where is Mrs. Li?

206
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,390
Something came up back at home.

207
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,810
She rushed back.

208
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,580
What a pity.

209
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,540
Her Ladyship asked about you

210
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,270
many times at home.

211
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,220
It seems that you two families are very close.

212
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,490
I'm flattered.

213
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,980
Did Lu Zheng give you

214
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,630
the delivery document for munitions?

215
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,670
What are you going to do?

216
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,490
My Lord, I'd like to ask you to leave first.

217
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,220
As long as you're here,

218
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,140
people from the Six Ministries won't relax their guard.

219
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,370
Where's Lu Zheng?

220
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,200
I don't know.

221
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,410
Okay.

222
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,620
Later,

223
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,900
I'll find a chance

224
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,690
to send Si Xiangnan away.

225
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,090
I’ve written a memorial

226
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,420
to ask His Majesty

227
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,190
to let you take charge of

228
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,910
this top priority case.

229
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,640
Lord Lu.

230
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,440
Coming.

231
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,820
Coming.

232
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:14,820
Have a seat.

233
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,000
Lord Lu, please take a seat.

234
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,690
Come on, Lord Lu. Have a seat.

235
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:18,570
Have some drinks.

236
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,310
Sergeant.

237
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,980
Sergeant.

238
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,590
Director Cao.

239
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,340
The first toast…

240
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:27,850
Please.

241
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,410
Please.

242
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,300
To our Ming Dynasty.

243
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:30,900
Cheers!

244
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,700
Thanks to every one of you,

245
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,820
our Investigation Bureau

246
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
has developed into what it is now.

247
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,810
Come on.

248
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,040
To all of you.

249
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,260
Careful.

250
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,140
My Lord.

251
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,260
My Lord.

252
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,380
No, here.

253
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,540
Here.

254
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,050
I'll take my leave.

255
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,710
Please wait.

256
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,280
Wen Zhi,

257
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,670
when did you

258
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,070
become Deputy Commander?

259
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,360
My Lord,

260
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,560
it was eight years ago.

261
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,710
Back then, my family was implicated in the blue case.

262
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,570
You supported me

263
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,360
so that I got promoted

264
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,440
to Deputy Commander.

265
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,790
Wen Zhi,

266
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,550
tonight,

267
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,630
no matter what happens,

268
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,660
please

269
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,240
don't take it to heart

270
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,480
for my sake.

271
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,330
Sergeant,

272
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,330
I heard you've acuquired a delivery document for munitions from the rebel

273
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,250
at the water transport wharf.

274
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,280
Is that true?

275
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,710
Why do you ask about it?

276
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,440
Can you show us?

277
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,740
Yes.

278
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,520
Yes. Show us.

279
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,420
His Majesty hasn't read it yet.

280
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,810
Lord Cao, do you want to read it first?

281
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,340
I dare not.

282
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,940
I'm just curious

283
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,290
if there are names of our colleagues

284
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,990
from the Six Ministries?

285
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,110
Lord Cao, do you want to ask

286
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,240
if your name is in it, right?

287
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,650
Well...

288
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,640
You're not even careful about pouring alcohol.

289
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,780
The rebel

290
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,960
con’t let you handle the arms case.

291
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,180
You are right.

292
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,560
I don't have the guts, either.

293
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,860
I'll drink this as a punishment.

294
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,910
Your Excellencies,

295
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,680
both of you get involved in the rebel case.

296
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,290
Please come with me.

297
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,430
Could you please

298
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,640
pull some strings…

299
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,700
Take care of

300
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,730
the drunk people.

301
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,630
If they choke on the alcohol,

302
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,410
it'll be a big issue.

303
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,840
We have to take a look at Sergeant.

304
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,100
Take them away.

305
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,210
What time is it?

306
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,640
A quarter to ten.

307
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,640
Let's go on night duty.

308
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,430
No need.

309
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,600
I've done my job tonight.

310
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,100
The three Ministries of War, Revenue and Industry.

311
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,710
A local official

312
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,810
and a water transport commissioner.

313
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
I interrogated them overnight

314
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,180
and they gave out a big shot.

315
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,690
Who?

316
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,890
Eunuch Wang Zhong from the General Office.

317
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,260
I was drunk.

318
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,490
I shouldn't have missed this good show.

319
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,840
The show

320
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,410
hasn't started yet.

321
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,200
A good show.

322
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,990
needs a good actor.

323
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,160
Li Dongfang,

324
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,900
it's your turn now.

325
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,210
Li Dongfang.

326
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,650
When did you join the Yan?

327
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,210
Who's behind you

328
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,420
in the Investigation Bureau?

329
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:37,760
What?

330
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,600
Lu Zheng, are you crazy?

331
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,650
He,

332
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,390
or he?

333
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,620
Tell the rebels

334
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,730
you have the delivery document for munitions.

335
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,300
I need your help.

336
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,260
Lord Cao, could you do me a favour?

337
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,650
Go ahead.

338
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,860
I have a delivery document for munitions

339
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,010
of the rebels.

340
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,740
There are

341
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,420
names of yours

342
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,620
and other lords' in the room

343
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,110
on the list.

344
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,980
Fortunately, the delivery document for munitions

345
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
is in my hands.

346
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,880
We are friends.

347
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,220
My Lord.

348
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,070
I'll listen to you.

349
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,500
You indicated that there are rebels among them,

350
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,920
then you covered your face with alcohol

351
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,850
and tricked them to steal it.

352
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,000
This is

353
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,380
a collusion with the Yan.

354
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,160
Here is a memorial

355
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,730
from Chief Commander

356
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,950
recommending Li Dongfang for replacing me

357
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,720
as the one in charge of the rebel case.

358
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,320
Is it he misjudged someone

359
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,740
or something else is hidden?

360
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,040
I will find out by myself.

361
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,660
Before that,

362
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,480
they

363
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,110
are nothing.

364
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,360
If anyone dares to pull strings,

365
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,130
I'll kill him.

366
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,180
If there's something else hidden,

367
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,970
I will be fair

368
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,770
and not take sides with anyone.

369
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,650
There is only one person

370
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,830
in charge of the rebel case.

371
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,840
That's me.

372
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,320
Deputy Commander,

373
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,550
I need your help

374
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,430
with everything in the government office.

375
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,980
After all,

376
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,230
you're so important

377
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,310
to the Investigation Bureau.

378
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,420
My Lord,

379
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,630
don't say so.

380
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,620
The Investigation Bureau

381
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,460
still counts on you.

382
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,430
My Lord,

383
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,980
I'd like to do

384
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,160
whatever I can for you.

385
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,700
[Zhang’s Silk Store]

386
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,350
Colonel,

387
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,110
many of our men in the officials

388
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,910
were caught by Brocade-clad Guards.

389
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,730
What's the message?

390
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,890
The Ministry of War received an urgent report from Shengyong.

391
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,340
The Prince of Yan won another battle.

392
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,310
They retreated and went back to Peking.

393
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,280
Got it.

394
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,030
You may leave.

395
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,760
Lu Zheng

396
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,170
and Li Wu

397
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,670
will help me find out the rebels in the court.

398
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,040
My Lord,

399
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,490
how can you trust Lu Zheng?

400
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,850
I used Lu Zheng

401
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,990
because of his cruelty.

402
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,940
His cruelty?

403
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,340
Not now.

404
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,350
It's not the time yet.

405
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,180
By then,

406
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,870
I'll make him show his cruelty.

407
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,320
[Wang Zhong]

408
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,600
[Eunuch shall not interfere with political affairs. Anyone who interferes will be executed.]

409
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:56,940
My Lord,

410
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,930
do you remember

411
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,980
when I gave you

412
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,530
the flying fish clothes?

413
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,550
I

414
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,060
just want to die quickly.

415
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,350
Hit him hard.

416
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,810
It's rotten!

417
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,050
The Ministry of War, Ministry of Revenue, Ministry of Industry,

418
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,850
and those local officials,

419
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,760
they received salaries from His Majesty

420
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:42,810
but secretly

421
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,900
helped the Prince of Yan.

422
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,500
And Wang Zhong.

423
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,020
The Prince of Yan

424
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,480
placed a spy so close to His Majesty.

425
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,620
My Lord, please calm down.

426
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,150
Wang Zhong confessed something before he died.

427
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,100
Say it.

428
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,520
Under the secret edict of the Prince of Yan,

429
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,120
Lord Cao, the head of the Ministry of War,

430
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
asked his colleagues to submit a memorial

431
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,850
proposing to transfer the Horse Administration

432
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,980
to a department under the Ministry of War.

433
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,090
Horse administration?

434
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,620
The Horse administration has always been charged by the Taipu Temple.

435
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,410
Why did they ask the Ministry of War to manage it?

436
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,370
If the Horse Administration is under the control of the Ministry of War,

437
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,980
the Prince of Yan can let

438
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,170
Lord Cao, the head of the Ministry of War,

439
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,800
collude with each other secretly.

440
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,000
Why do you think

441
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,310
they did this for?

442
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,880
I suppose

443
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,010
the Prince of Yan wants to

444
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,020
take a risk

445
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,690
to attack the capital.

446
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,450
Go on.

447
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,230
The Prince of Yan

448
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,820
is separated from the capital

449
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,480
by Shandong.

450
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,130
Shangdong is well guarded

451
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,170
and has strong soldiers.

452
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
It's also stationed by well-known generals.

453
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,940
The Prince of Yan has failed to capture it for a long time,

454
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,900
so he came up with

455
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,570
this plan.

456
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,340
The Prince of Yan knows

457
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,630
how much time values to a battle.

458
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,840
Transferring the Horse Administration

459
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,020
into a department under the Ministry of War

460
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,660
can help him

461
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,800
get rid of the pursuers

462
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,690
and head straight to the capital.

463
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,500
I just received a secret report

464
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,690
that the Prince of Yan

465
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,600
wrote a letter to Princess Qingcheng

466
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,100
to negotiate peace.

467
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,770
So it's all a show for His Majesty

468
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,070
to let us lower our guard

469
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,380
What a sneaky man.

470
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,160
Lord Yuan, you should report to His Majesty as soon as possible.

471
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,290
He has no emperor or father.

472
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,270
There's no need

473
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,260
to show him any mercy.

474
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,110
Sorry, I've crossed the line.

475
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,830
Wait.

476
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,280
I heard

477
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,570
you arrested Lu Yulin and Li Dongfang.

478
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,500
They are rebels too?

479
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,120
My Lord,

480
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,760
Li Dongfang and Chief Commander

481
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,090
are not rebels.

482
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,160
Li Dongfang and I worked together.

483
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,030
He deserves all the credit.

484
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,810
Making him a rebel

485
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,310
is a trick.

486
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,360
To make it look real,

487
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,090
Li Dongfang and Chief Commander

488
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,540
have to

489
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,140
do it for real.

490
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,240
If someone has something on them,

491
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,250
it won't end well.

492
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,540
My Lord, with you here,

493
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,810
I'm not scared.

494
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,530
I'm old.

495
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,980
I can't stay up.

496
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,739
If you didn't come back soon,

497
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,760
I would go to bed.

498
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,520
Greetings, Your Excellency.

499
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,889
Good.

500
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,330
There's a bowl of lotus seed soup

501
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,090
for you.

502
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,909
Drink it.

503
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,199
You didn't find

504
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,750
Song Heming's log book

505
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,820
or Li Wu's case files

506
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,949
in the file storeroom,

507
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,940
right?

508
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,929
You've seen

509
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,159
what happened today.

510
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,989
Li Dongfang

511
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,760
is a rebel.

512
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,700
He didn't investigate

513
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,150
Song Heming's death.

514
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,010
but the whereabouts of the Yuming Lock.

515
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,290
Actually, these two things

516
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,270
are one thing.

517
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,340
Haven't you always wanted to know

518
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,650
what happened in the year of Hongwu?

519
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,420
I'll tell you today.

520
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,420
In the 25th year of Hongwu,

521
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,630
Li Wu replaced the son of a prisoner

522
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,860
in the Imperial Prison.

523
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,740
That prisoner

524
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,590
confessed

525
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,170
what's hidden in the Yuming Lock.

526
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,070
Thank you.

527
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,990
This blacksmith shop

528
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,490
is specially for the military to forge arms.

529
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,150
The customers are all Brocade-clad Guards.

530
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,720
Who is your father?

531
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,510
How dare he buy you a gift here?

532
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,960
If I tell anyone,

533
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,060
do you still want to keep

534
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,020
your and your father's lives?

535
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,380
The Brocade-clad Guards are coming! Run!

536
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,400
Run!

537
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,600
Here! Hurry!

538
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,180
Father.

539
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,150
Greetings, Lord Song.

540
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,770
Where is my son, Song Zhen?

541
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,630
Over there.

542
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,520
Father.

543
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,720
He stole my dagger.

544
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,340
Your Excellency,

545
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,020
I'm a nobody.

546
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,230
Please let me go.

547
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,170
What's your name?

548
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,000
Li Wu.

549
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,810
Li?

550
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,660
Blame it for your surname.

551
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:22,170
[Investigation Bureau]

552
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:17,810
My Lord.

553
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,070
Take him back to the residence.

554
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,140
Yes.

555
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,080
Father.

556
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,120
He's a thief.

557
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,560
He deserves to be punished.

558
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:31,760
Father.

559
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,140
Please let him go.

560
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,300
Go.

561
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,300
This is

562
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,000
all I know.

563
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,780
You don't believe me?

564
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,900
Then follow Li Dongfang.

565
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,630
If you follow Li Dongfang,

566
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,460
you'll find the Yuming Lock.

567
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,210
There you go.

568
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,260
This is the last bowl of noodles today.

569
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,270
It's for you two.

570
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,620
Thank you, Meng.

571
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,760
Dig in.

572
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,350
Meidou.

573
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,090
Come back.

574
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,630
Don't bother.

575
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,770
I'll eat whatever you have.

576
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,020
My Lord,

577
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,300
we're closed.

578
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,600
There's really nothing left.

579
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,630
One bowl of noodles with scallion oil

580
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,440
and soup dumplings.

581
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,180
-Someone is giving out eggs. -Fire!

582
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,930
Someone is giving out eggs.

583
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,460
Someone is giving out eggs again.

584
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:42,970
It's for free.

585
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,250
It doesn't work.

586
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,140
It's only for girls.

587
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,930
Boys won't get it.

588
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,180
I'll go get my sister.

589
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,900
I'll go take a look.

590
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,620
Miss.

591
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,830
It's late. Why aren't you home?

592
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,480
Your hairpin

593
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,280
is quite unique.

594
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,350
Hurry up.

595
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,180
Did you find it?

596
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,840
Here.

597
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,040
Someone is coming.

598
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,800
Hurry up.
