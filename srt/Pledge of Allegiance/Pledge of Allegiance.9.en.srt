00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
Who is the one using the Book of Mottos

5
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,360
to keep in touch with the Night Scouts?

6
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,090
My lord,

7
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,789
this book was written

8
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,509
by the Imperial Prison guard, Sergeant Chen Jizhen,

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,750
[Book of Mottos]

10
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,850
to contact the Night Scouts during Hongwu's reign.

11
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,840
You mean the guy whose hand

12
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,259
was cut off by Song Heming during Hongwu's reign.

13
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,220
That Chen Jizhen?

14
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,020
The Investigation Bureau ordered Chen Jizhen

15
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,620
to guard that abandoned imperial prison.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,530
Although Chen Jizhen is on duty,

17
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,360
he's just like a prisoner.

18
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,920
That's why he hated Lu Yulin and his son who was in power.

19
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,550
Li Wu dared to replace Li Dongfang

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,420
and work at the Investigation Bureau.

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,380
Who does he work for?

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,140
Li Wu

23
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,510
is not working for Lu Yulin.

24
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,150
Otherwise, the Yuming Lock

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,829
should be in Lu Yulin's hands.

26
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,420
Li Wu was in the imperial prison during Hongwu's reign.

27
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,900
He took the risk in order to

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,230
destroy the files in the file storeroom.

29
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,329
Seems like he's not working for anyone.

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,530
Since Chen Jizhen

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,180
has gotten his case file,

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,430
I think

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,360
this person might be useful.

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,340
How?

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,110
There's a batch of goods that needs to be transported to Beijing at the water port.

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
The provisions stated on the document

37
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,300
are actually weapons for the King of Yan's army.

38
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,420
Director Cao of the Ministry of War is in charge.

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,240
We can find a chance

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,450
to let Chen Jizhen tell Li Wu about this.

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,780
Those hiding the truth

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,850
will be punished as an accomplice.

43
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,610
Do you know him?

44
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,200
I do.

45
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,160
Tell me.

46
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,110
Who is he?

He confessed.

If you told the truth earlier,

77
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,460
everything would be fine.

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:12,940
No.

am not the Li Wu you're looking for.

No.

is a token.

It's called Sparrow's Tongue.

174

The Deputy Commander prepared for you.

175

to use this jade pot and

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,830
The deputy commander is considerate.

179
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,030
Lord Lu

180
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,330
is appointed by His Majesty to be in charge of the rebels' case.

181
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,780
A stroke your golden brush

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,010
reached the Emperor

183
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,410
and ended these rebels.

184
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,290
Lord Lu personally led the army to escort the rebels.

185
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,970
The Deputy Commander was so happy when

186
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,950
he heard the news, that he forgot to wear his shoes.

187
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,260
As a common person,

188
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,180
one must recognize the trends.

189
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,270
A wise man

190
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,680
submits to circumstances.

191
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,640
A golden bowl and jade pot.

192
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,490
I'll let you have diarrhea tonight.

193
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,140
My lord, have some tea.

194
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,580
Wang,

195
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,400
how long have you been a Brocade-clad Guard?

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,450
My lord,

197
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,440
I've been a Detective for three years.

198
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,020
I've given a lot of money to the Deputy Commander.

199
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,400
But I can't get promoted.

200
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,380
If you give me a hand,

201
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,680
I will do my best.

202
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,450
Do you know why you can't get promoted?

203
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,860
My lord, please tell me.

204
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,350
Because the Deputy Commander

205
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,870
can't get promoted.

206
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,470
He is old

207
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,420
and does things timidly.

208
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,740
Once he becomes timid,

209
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,550
his subordinates will be at their wits' end.

210
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,320
I

211
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,150
have a bold idea.

212
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,230
I will do anything

213
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,460
at any cost.

214
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,270
Okay?

215
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,640
Let's go.

216
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,310
Yes.

217
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,690
My lord.

218
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,460
Follow the plan.

219
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes.

220
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,100
Let's go.

221
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,690
Hurry up.

222
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,000
Is there a rebel among them?

223
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,390
No.

224
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,390
Then why did you arrest them?

225
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,210
Li Dongfang.

226
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,600
What do they have to do with you?

227
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,040
Without my order,

228
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,520
the people of Ji'e Alley will be rebels

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,670
and sent to the frontline as coolies

230
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,040
until they die.

231
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,900
That's more painful than being beheaded.

232
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,380
As long as you plead guilty.

233
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,200
Who are you?

234
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,960
I'm not Li Dongfang.

235
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,670
I'm Li Wu.

236
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,829
A thief

237
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,200
who grew up in Ji'e Alley.

238
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,380
I even went to the imperial prison.

239
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,140
So I beg you,

240
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,180
please show mercy.

241
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,010
Let the people of Ji'e Alley go.

242
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,550
Robbing an official title and deceiving the nobility

243
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,260
is a capital crime.

244
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,700
The people in Ji'e Alley didn't report it

245
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,660
and kept it a secret.

246
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,010
They should be considered as accomplices.

247
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,820
Why did you pretend to be Sergeant Li Dongfang?

248
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,700
If you must arrest someone,

249
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,120
then arrest me.

250
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,480
What do you mean?

251
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,600
What a pity.

252
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,560
Do you remember

253
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,820
at Wang Kegong's Mansion, I once told you

254
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,800
my job from Jinan

255
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,890
is to protect Lord Wang Kegong.

256
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,620
Lord Wang ordered me

257
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,950
to secretly investigate an old case.

258
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,490
On April 25, the 25th year of Hongwu's reign,

259
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,510
there was a child

260
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,330
in the imperial prison.

261
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,680
He killed a Sergeant.

262
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,970
The name of this child

263
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,610
is Li Wu.

264
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,970
Over the past few years,

265
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,960
I've been investigating Li Wu's whereabouts.

266
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,740
I even suspect that

267
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,090
he has been hiding in Nanjing.

268
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,680
When I came to the capital,

269
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,120
I took the name of Li Wu,

270
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,460
to see

271
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,810
if he is still hiding in Ji'e Alley

272
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,130
among his relatives and friends.

273
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,100
And this

274
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,920
is the truth I want to tell you.

275
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,490
The people of Ji'e Alley

276
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,810
don't know Li Wu's whereabouts.

277
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,150
I told them

278
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,680
I am Li Wu

279
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,420
who escaped from the imperial prison ten years ago.

280
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,130
None of them reported me

281
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,730
to the Brocade-clad Guards.

282
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,730
They are all loyal and honest people.

283
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,410
Lu Zheng.

284
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,970
I thought

285
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,730
you would be different.

286
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,900
You're now in charge of the rebels' case.

287
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,550
The Guards will be different from back then.

288
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:28,810
In this world,

289
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,290
there'll be no more imperial prison,

290
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,340
sinners' offspring and

291
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,920
unjust cases in the file storeroom.

292
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,550
You once told me

293
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,610
if we do more good,

294
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,020
the world will become better.

295
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,380
But I saw you

296
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,030
arresting innocent people

297
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,380
to make me confess?

298
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,820
I don't care about the world.

299
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,340
I don't know what the world is.

300
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,100
But I know

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,780
you don't deserve

302
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,840
to say these two words.

303
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Meng,

304
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,160
Mei Dou

305
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,210
and Uncle Wang.

306
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,680
The people in Ji'e Alley

307
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,030
means the world in my heart.

308
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,290
There'll be no more imperial prison,

309
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,980
no more sinners' offspring

310
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,780
and no more

311
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,370
unjust cases.

312
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,600
Based on what you just said,

313
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,160
I'll keep you by my side.

314
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,670
I want you to see

315
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,110
how I accomplished it.

316
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,530
The Night Scouts are here.

317
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,650
Let them go

318
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,220
and we'll spare your lives.

319
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,200
Guards!

320
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,240
Capture them

321
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,540
and take them back for interrogation.

322
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:13,970
Yes.

323
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,130
My lord.

324
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,300
I'm Wang Chan.

325
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,610
Don't talk. I know.

326
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,460
On June 2, third year of Jianwen's reign,

327
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,530
Detective Wang Chan

328
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,870
claimed to be a Night Scout

329
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,620
and ended the case after

330
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
framing innocent people.

331
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,330
If anyone resisted,

332
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,620
they have to either pay a fine,

333
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,620
or worse, be beaten.

334
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,260
Ddetective Wang,

335
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,190
come with me to the Investigation Bureau and tell me

336
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,170
who else

337
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,240
are your accomplices?

338
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,130
I'm not asking

339
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,300
about Li Dongfang.

340
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,380
There's a Detective in the Investigation Bureau

341
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,090
named Wang Chan.

342
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,950
Does he often

343
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,290
come to Ji'e Alley to catch people?

344
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,260
Tell me everything about Wang Chan.

345
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,240
I'll clear your names.

346
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,910
Sorry for the trouble.

347
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,080
Untie them.

348
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,950
I want to thank you

349
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,620
for helping me arrest

350
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,190
these rotten apples of the Brocade-clad Guards.

351
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,440
I promise

352
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,450
from now on,

353
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,980
the Guards will never go to Ji'e Alley to harass you again.

354
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,890
I'm appointed by His Majesty to handle the rebels' case.

355
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
Before the rebels are purged,

356
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,950
I will make sure that these Guards who

357
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,270
wrongfully accused you

358
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,770
be brought to justice.

359
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,190
The Night Scouts ambushed the Guards

360
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,500
and you helped us

361
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,940
drive off the ambushers.

362
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,850
Next,

363
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,430
you can get revenge.

364
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,210
I'll kill you!

365
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,860
Beat him!

366
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,390
Wang Chan.

367
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,030
I...

368
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,630
I'll kill you!

369
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:10,940
Beat him!

370
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,540
Move!

371
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,780
Open the door!

372
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,190
Come out!

373
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,170
The one inside.

374
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,060
Come out.

375
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,100
Have you seen a man with beard?

376
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,010
No.

377
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,510
Let's go.

378
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:10,920
Let's go.

379
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,370
Anyone else inside?

380
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,470
No.

381
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,140
We received a tip-off

382
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,170
about a Night Scout with a beard.

383
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,330
He openly had fun

384
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,620
with prostitutes in the Court Entertainment Bureau.

385
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,320
He really had the guts!

386
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:34,960
Listen.

387
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,730
If you don't report it, you're covering up for the rebels

388
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,160
and will be punished for colluding with Yan.

389
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,080
Tell me.

390
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,480
Where is that moustached Night Scout?

391
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,320
His black suit is here.

392
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:49,920
Where is he?

393
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,780
Did he change into women's clothing

394
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,250
and hid among you?

395
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,890
Stop!

396
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,420
I...

397
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,490
am a Night Scout.

398
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,710
Get out!

399
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,650
Get out!

400
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,130
Yes.

401
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,490
Madam.

402
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,560
What are you doing?

403
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,200
I told you

404
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,410
I'm a Night Scout.

405
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,770
Come at me.

406
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,640
Don't bully them.

407
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,940
Do you think you're superior

408
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,920
if you wear this uniform?

409
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,340
I dare not say that.

410
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,290
I'll ask Sergeant to apologize to you.

411
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,780
You'd better go back to your residence first.

412
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,020
All couples fight.

413
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,220
But

414
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,370
no one would do this out of anger.

415
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,140
So what?

416
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,430
Are you looking down on those who do this?

417
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,400
Let me tell you.

418
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,660
I love doing this.

419
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,730
Does Lord Li know you are doing this?

420
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,810
He already knew.

421
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,600
You have such an open mind towards relationships,

422
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,650
I admire you.

423
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,830
I...

424
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,190
take my leave.

425
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,520
Actually, I'm also investigating that old case.

426
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,830
During Hongwu's reign, how old were you?

427
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,220
Why are you investigating the old case?

428
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,870
What else can I do by

429
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,060
investigating an old case?

430
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
We need further consideration.

431
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,340
It's better to think about

432
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,570
how to overthrow Si Xiangnan for me.

433
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,270
Please have a look.

434
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,480
This is a secret edict that Wang Chan and I

435
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,180
[To Song Heming]

436
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,370
stayed up all night to write.

437
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,310
Wang Kegong suddenly returned to the capital

438
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,970
and fearlessly hosted a banquet.

439
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,700
Who was backing this old rebel?

440
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,960
In the Southern and Northern Investigation Bureau,

441
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,830
who has this type of power?

442
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,250
You mean

443
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,530
Chief Commander Lu Yulin?

444
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,720
Who is it?

445
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,550
My lord.

446
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,540
I'm here to talk to you.

447
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,620
I shall take my leave.

448
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,420
Your Excellency, have some porridge.

449
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:29,900
I'll help myself.

450
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:35,880
Your Excellency.

451
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,620
The property and documents taken from Wan Kegong's Mansion

452
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,410
are all here.

453
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,230
I...

454
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,260
didn't find any evidence of him colluding with Yan.

455
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,600
How about his

456
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,740
property, gems,

457
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,860
antiques, calligraphy and paintings?

458
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,820
Nothing's found.

459
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,020
What's that?

460
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,980
It's a plate.

461
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,830
Plate.

462
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:01,940
Here.

463
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,590
Open your mouth.

464
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,670
Register it.

465
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,330
This is

466
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,060
evidence of Wang Kegong's collusion with Yan.

467
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,530
This is also information about his collusion, right?

468
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,020
My lord,

469
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,740
we've checked all of these.

470
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,000
It's just a letter.

471
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,660
I repeat,

472
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,150
Wang Kegong is a rebel determined by His Majesty.

473
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,080
Regarding the content of the documents we got from his house,

474
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,210
the Brocade-clad Guards have the final say.

475
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,140
Evidence is evidence.

476
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,960
Perjury is perjury.

477
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,090
That's right.

478
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,040
His Majesty appointed Lord Lu to handle

479
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,970
the rebels' case.

480
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,150
I'm glad you remember.

481
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,420
I can assure you there's no evidence

482
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,940
of him colluding with Yan in this letter.

483
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,740
Because I have found out

484
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,240
the rebels

485
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,860
are someone else.

486
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,000
Ma Han has pleaded guilty.

487
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,860
He said he was ordered by the deputy commander.

488
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,830
I led the team out of the city today

489
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,080
but I was ambushed by the Night Scouts.

490
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,200
On June 2, the third year of Jianwen's reign,

491
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,360
Detective Wang Chan admitted

492
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,520
he is a Night Scout.

493
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,110
These two are your right-hand men.

494
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,190
Do I have reason to suspect

495
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,550
that you

496
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,890
are also a rebel?

497
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,860
Guards!

498
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,840
Take Si Xiangnan.

499
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,730
Lord Lu.

500
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,520
You can suspect me,

501
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,900
but you forgot something.

502
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,990
The Investigation Bureau is a place with rules.

503
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,840
And I

504
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,080
am the rule.

505
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,550
Lu Zheng,

506
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,400
this is your mistake.

507
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,760
The deputy commander

508
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,200
manages the daily operation of the Investigation Bureau.

509
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,670
All the Guards in the Bureau

510
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,760
are related to the deputy commander.

511
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,420
You suspect that he colluded with Yan.

512
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,890
That means you also suspect the whole Investigation Bureau is involved.

513
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,530
Are you going to arrest all our men?

514
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,410
How are you going to arrest us?

515
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,570
I am a newcomer.

516
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,920
As an outsider, I think

517
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,170
the Investigation Bureau has a common goal,

518
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,020
which is to handle the rebel case.

519
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,090
It's just that

520
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,160
some people didn't use proper methods

521
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,720
when they worked.

522
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,610
Should we

523
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,100
fight our enemies as one

524
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,720
or fight amongst ourselves?

525
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,040
Since you

526
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,920
suspect me.

527
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,530
Guards!

528
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,650
Yes.

529
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,320
Hand over the seal.

530
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:53,970
Yes.

531
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,450
Lord Lu,

532
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,070
tear what you recorded on the log book.

533
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,150
Tear it.

534
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,190
Here.

535
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,340
My lord.

536
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,140
Si Xiangnan has handed over his power.

537
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,720
Why are you still unhappy?

538
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,640
Why did you do that?

539
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,810
What did I do?

540
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,630
If it weren't for you,

541
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:02,950
I...

542
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,690
I would've uprooted Si Xiangnan's gang.

543
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,660
He has

544
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,180
all of the Brocade-clad Guards

545
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,660
within his grasp.

546
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,380
If you really make a move against him,

547
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,430
no one will help you.

548
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,930
Will you

549
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,060
really arrest everyone?

550
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,040
Why not?

551
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,700
We must uproot all evil.

552
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,640
If necessary,

553
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,830
I'll catch him.

554
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,110
Someone will report that

555
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,490
Si Xiangnan and I are close.

556
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,540
I just arrived in the capital

557
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,940
but he treated me so well.

558
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,460
The residence he assigned to me

559
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,980
is much bigger than others.

560
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,680
What should we do then?

561
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,180
If you arrest me,

562
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,580
I'll become a rebel too.

563
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,860
Then what about you, Lu Zheng?

564
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,690
You'll be the second Si Xiangnan?

565
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,480
He is selfish.

566
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,410
I'm for justice.

567
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,100
We are enemies.

568
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,910
Lu Zheng.

569
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,150
Open your eyes and take a good look.

570
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,950
You

571
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,540
are the one with selfish desires.

572
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,940
Must you defeat him just because

573
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,780
he accused you of being a rebel?

574
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,140
Then you're just taking revenge.

575
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,890
If you are really working for the world,

576
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,000
for justice,

577
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,660
you should let go of your desires

578
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,930
and use their power

579
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,340
instead of destroying them.

580
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,030
Destroying them

581
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,940
is for justice.

582
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,060
And a good thing for the world.

583
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,040
If you really think so,

584
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,880
you should join the Night Scouts.

585
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,310
They

586
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,510
think the same as you.

587
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,830
Actually, I'm also investigating that old case.

588
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,830
How old were you during Hongwu's reign?

589
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,630
Why are you investigating the old case?

590
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,490
What else can I do by

591
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,640
investigating an old case?

592
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,060
My lord.

593
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,889
Tang Yu.

594
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,670
Have a seat.

595
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,260
Eat with me.

596
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,489
Drink with me.

597
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,620
Yes.

598
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:22,889
Here.

599
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:28,969
My lord.

600
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,260
-I want… -Stop talking. Let's drink.

601
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:34,960
Here.

602
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,070
-I... -Tang Yu.

603
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,090
Let me ask you something.

604
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,840
When did the Chief Commander

605
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,969
adopt Lu Zheng?

606
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,420
It was rumored that Lord Lu

607
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,290
was a beggar in Ji'e Alley.

608
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,690
Later, because he was smart,

609
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,679
the Chief Commander adopted him.

610
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,780
After that, the chief commander had a career boost

611
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,570
and kept being promoted until his current position.

612
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,500
He thinks it's good luck brought by his foster son.

613
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,930
So he adores Lord Lu.

614
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,600
A beggar from Ji'e Alley.

615
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,100
Why didn't I know?

616
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,160
My lord,

617
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,530
there's something you shouldn't hesitate to do.

618
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,940
I know you feel miserable

619
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,260
but it concerns Madam's reputation.

620
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,730
You can't hesitate anymore.

621
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,870
What are you talking about?

622
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,570
Madam, she...

623
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,910
She...

624
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,590
[Court Entertainment Bureau]

625
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,180
How do you know I'm here?

626
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,840
Officer Tang Yu told me

627
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,590
the story of a moustached Night Scout.

628
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,010
They didn't tell the Guards about me,

629
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,780
but I'm going to kill them.

630
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,640
Why?

631
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,900
Because they know my identity.

632
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,630
And...

633
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,450
I don't remember what I told them last night.

634
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,600
In the past,

635
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,930
I would have killed them without hesitation.

636
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,370
After drinking,

637
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,120
if you fall from here

638
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,560
and die,

639
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,860
no one will be suspicious.

640
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,110
And it'll be painless.

641
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,210
I don't even need a sword.

642
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,030
Killing is that simple.

643
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,870
But now I can't do it.

644
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,830
After I met you,

645
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,980
I changed.

646
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,360
You were drunk and talked nonsense to them.

647
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,590
Why must they die?

648
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,420
That's because they shouldn't have heard it.

649
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,190
Let me do it.

650
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,210
You can't do it anyway.

651
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,610
You?

652
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,470
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

653
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,280
We are in the same boat now.

654
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,450
If something happens to you, I'll also be involved.

655
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,330
How could you fall asleep like that?

656
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,540
Have you dealt with the women

657
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,220
in the Court Entertainment Bureau?

658
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,800
Yes.

659
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,570
How?

660
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,330
From now on,

661
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,670
they will report to me

662
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,060
about every single thing they hear.

663
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,780
Those girls are offsprings of sinners.

664
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,830
They won't report you.

665
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,120
Of course, no one listens to them.

666
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,260
How do you know?

667
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,820
You didn't tell them about the Night Scouts.

668
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,020
You only told them about

669
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,510
this.

670
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,510
That's why you couldn't kill them.

671
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,140
Is something bothering you?

672
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,270
People

673
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,380
can't escape from their past.

674
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,180
Do you still remember

675
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,750
on April 25,

676
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,470
that boy in the imperial prison?

677
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,100
I knew it.

678
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Open the door.

679
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,340
You can't open it

680
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,860
with brute strength.

681
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,400
Then...

682
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,010
How do I open it?

683
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,930
Why are you sleeping on the chair?

684
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,940
You've been like this for so many days.

685
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
I don't need to sleep.

686
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,760
Meditation can bring me back to my senses.

687
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:03,770
I admire you.

688
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,350
How about this?

689
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,710
Teach me.

690
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,690
You sleep on the bed tonight.

691
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,460
I'll try this chair meditation technique.

692
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:44,940
Shu Tang.

693
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,200
What are you doing?

694
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,350
I'm learning how to be a good wife.

695
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,960
No need.

696
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,620
A good husband

697
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,190
should let his wife stay away from the water.

698
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,280
It's okay.

699
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,010
Do you have any clothes to wash?

700
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,010
Can you look at me?

701
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,270
Your meditation pose was wrong.

702
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,450
You're suffering from a side effect.

703
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,740
Can my legs be saved?

704
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,320
It won't last forever, right?

705
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,960
You have to desire from the bottom of your heart

706
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,510
that you need these two legs

707
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,620
so that they can work for you.

708
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,870
I really need

709
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,060
to use my two legs

710
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,400
take me to pee.

711
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,250
Madam.

712
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,210
Morning, Lord Lu.

713
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,790
You're washing clothes so early.

714
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,480
Is Li Dongfang awake?

715
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,460
He...

716
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,150
He was just there.

717
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,240
I'll get him for you.

718
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,070
Morning.

719
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,250
Morning.

720
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,280
Here to apologize?

721
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,350
I'm here to help you move.

722
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,660
[Title Deed]

723
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,660
I bought this residence.

724
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,620
In such a hurry?

725
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,580
Where should I live?

726
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,020
You can still live here.

727
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,660
But

728
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,030
give me two taels per month.

729
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,140
How much?

730
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:46,880
Two taels.

731
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,370
I don't have that much money.

732
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,210
You can do housework to pay the rent.

733
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,070
You want my wife to be your nanny,

734
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,170
do the laundry and cook?

735
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,560
I want you to be my nanny.

736
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,540
Cook for us and do the laundry.

737
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:02,710
Madam,

738
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,130
what do you think?
