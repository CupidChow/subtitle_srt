00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,320
with a knife wound on his back.

179
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,440
Why are you looking for him?

180
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,210
The knife wound on his back

181
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,780
was caused by me.

182
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,000
It's been ten years...

183
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,860
I wonder what he's up to now.

184
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,280
I don't remember his face anymore.

185
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,740
But I can't seem to forget

186
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,820
the knife wound on his back.

187
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,260
I hired young beggars to act as my spies,

188
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,700
hoping that one day

189
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,680
I can meet him again.

190
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,500
But it's likely that he died ten years ago.

191
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,460
That night,

192
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,180
after he was indicted.

193
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,230
[April 25, the third year of Jianwen's reign]

Father.

195
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,110
You burn incense and drink here on your birthday every year.

196
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,260
Don't you think it's bad luck?

197
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,590
Who are you worshiping?

198
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,070
In the third year of Jianwen's reign,

199
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,650
April 25,

200
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,200
at 10.30 p.m.

201
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,440
Detective Lu Zheng,

202
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,460
got drunk and

203
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,360
missed night duty again.

204
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,530
It's not 10.30 p.m. yet.

205
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,890
I haven't recorded it yet.

206
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,050
Now that you're awake, you should leave.

207
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,920
Your father left some food for you.

208
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,800
You can work better after eating.

209
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,930
I don't like dumplings.

210
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,210
How did you know that?

211
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,660
The stains on your clothes.

212
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,470
White is the flour and black is vinegar.

213
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,720
Sticky fingers.

214
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,250
Did you peel garlic?

215
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,050
No wonder you don't have friends.

216
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,590
What did you say?

217
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,220
No wonder

218
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,190
you became a Detective at such a young age.

219
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,460
I also know

220
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,660
you ate the ones with leek fillings.

221
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,540
How did you know?

222
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,200
Teach me.

223
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:38,920
What?

224
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,410
Isn't April 25 your birthday?

225
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,300
I hate writing.

[Court Entertainment Bureau]

227
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,660
What should I say when your father asks?

228
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,590
Tell him we went to Mingshi Fang for work.

229
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,810
Last time it was Mingshi Fang.

230
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,390
He won't believe it, right?

231
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,220
Then tell the truth.

232
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,020
We hung out at the Court Entertainment Bureau.

233
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,920
I really hope that's true.

234
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,190
Where's Lei Zhen?

235
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,990
Detective Lei

236
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,530
is working inside.

237
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,530
Lord Lu,

238
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,780
you shouldn't bother him.

239
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,340
Detective Lei's father is the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War.

It's not too late for you to leave now.

What if we don't?

242
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,900
Then I'll show you the way.

243
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,150
Show you the way.

244
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,570
Help.

245
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,860
Help, my lord.

April 25,

Detective Lei Zhen from the Investigation Bureau

250
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,000
imprisoned three women from the Court Entertainment Bureau

in the name of handling cases,

252

and abused them.

253

254
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,240
another woman

255

the son of Lord Lei Xianming of the Ministry of War

you should learn more from Lei Zheng.

received a secret edict

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,370
and entered the capital.

325

He's called Li Dongfang.

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
He's been taking care of everything

329
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,380
and insisted on keeping his original title in the capital.

330
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,220
At this critical moment,

331
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:52,900
he has...

332
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,660
Detective Lu.

333
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,180
I'm sorry.

The position of Sergeant that you desired

335
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,310
is mine.

336
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,870
An adoptive father

337
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,050
is not as good

338
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,040
as a real father.

339
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,850
And Detective Lu,

340
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,500
I must compensate you

341
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,170
with a new log book.

342
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,470
No matter how much you recorded,

343
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,990
you still have to tear it up.

344
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,590
Sergeant,

345
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,310
I

346
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,660
dare not record on it anymore.

347
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,670
That's right.

348
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,490
If you like

349
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
those women,

350
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,270
you can keep them.

351
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,340
I'll get new ones from the Bureau tomorrow.

352
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,890
The log book

353
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,820
is not meant for this type of person.

354
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,450
Sergeant,

355
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,220
where are we going?

356
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,080
Back to the Court Entertainment Bureau.

357
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,850
I haven't had enough fun.

358
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,790
Arrange some ladies

359
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,140
for me to enjoy too.

360
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,750
Sergeant.

361
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,190
Sergeant?

362
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,660
Lu,

363
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,070
it's over for you.

364
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,150
You and your father are doomed.

365
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,090
Wait until I tell my father.

366
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,890
What?

367
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,560
Wait until I tell my father.

368
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,690
Why do you think you can still see your father?

369
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,140
Detective Lu.

370
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,030
Stop...

371
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,140
Stop joking.

372
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,750
We are colleagues.

373
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,010
Both of us want to be the Sergeant

374
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,980
but there is only one position.

375
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,840
An adoptive father is not as useful as a real father.

376
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,710
Right?

377
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,040
Lu... Lu Zheng.

378
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,500
Are you crazy?

379
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,750
Is the position of a Sergeant

380
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,420
that important?

381
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,260
Yes.

Please forgive me.

From now on,

your surname is Cao.

386
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,350
You're an exiled soldier assigned to the North.

387

For the rest of your life,

388
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,630
you will dig stones in the North.

389

No one can find you.

I'll give it up, okay?

402

It's been ten years.

You still won't call me father.

415
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,340
Forget it.

416
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,180
Just burn incense and kowtow to your father.

417
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,440
Ten years ago,

418
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,790
I released a child

419
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,220
who killed my father.

420
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,080
Ten years later, I swear

421
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,410
I will not spare a single person

422
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,520
who commited evil.

423
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,340
No matter if they are from the court

424
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,820
or just a small thief,

425
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,270
even if they're just a child,

426
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,870
I will catch them.

In this world,

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,600
people are not entirely innocent.

If you want to have a clear conscience,

430
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,390
you have to live a different life.

431

Raise a child

432
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,230
and protect the child.

433
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,620

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,940
Done.

Actually, you are still young.

You can get married again.

at 10.30 p.m.

461
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,780
Detective Lu got drunk again

462
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,850
and missed the night shift.

463
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,060
Is it 10.30 p.m.

464
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,590
yet?

465
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,010
No.

466
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,850
Drinking is more interesting.

467
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,550
Night duty is so tedious.

468
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,570
Is it more tedious than tellinig on me

469
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,450
to the Chief Commander?

470
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,350

I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,750
means Colonel Li.

526
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,110
Xiu and Ce stands for

527
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,230
Major Shu and my subordinate respectively.

528
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
This secret letter

529
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,510
indicates that we arrived in the capital.

530
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,400
The Brocade-clad Guards

531
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,520
are aware of our names.

532
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,070
Send a message to Colonel Li.

533
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,610
Tell him that Shu Tang met our allies at Ji'e Alley.

534
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,550
Ask him if he's following the plan

535
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,260
to meet at Wang Kegong's Mansion.

536
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,430
Enjoy your meal.

537
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,780
I’m leaving.

538
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,190
That porter is definitely fishy.

539
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,120
How did you know that?

540
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,500
Intuition.

541
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,720
I hate your intuition.

542
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,430
Just now, at the stall,

543
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,480
I knew that

544
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,680
he wasn't a local

545
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,920
nor a porter.

546
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,280
Locals refer to Yingtian as 'Yingtian Fu'

547
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,960
and never as the 'capital city.'

548
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,060
Yingtian is only mentioned as the capital city in official documents.

549
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,540
What if what you mentioned

550
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,910
is just a coincidence?

551
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,260
As an official, you should know that

552
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,100
there are no coincidences in this world.

553
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,600
Sir, please come in.

554
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,140
Sir, this way.

555
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,630
This way.

556
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,850
Sir, you must be tired.

557
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,660
Lord Wang Kegong's guests

558
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,480
live here?

559
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,210
They all live here.

560
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,200
Sir, are you here to rest or stay the night?

561
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,570
To wait for someone.

562
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,110
Thank you, sir.

563
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,470
Sir, this way.

564
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,510
Enjoy.

565
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,540
Master Li, what would you like to eat?

566
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,750
Just let me know if you need anything.

567
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,510
Lord Xie has already informed me in advance.

568
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,010
Master Li, let me serve you more dishes.

569
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,500
Master Li,

570
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,220
please keep the invitation

571
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,640
to the mansion well.

572
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,949
[Luck and Prosperity]

573
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,710
Steward Wang of the mansion

574
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,110
only acknowledges the invitation.

575
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:12,690
Keep it well.

576
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,770
Thank you, Master Li.

577
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,070
Surname Li?

578
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,230
Bad luck for you.
