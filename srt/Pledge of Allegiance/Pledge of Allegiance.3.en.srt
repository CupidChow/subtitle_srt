4
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,270
If you could live for a few more years,

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,160
you would definitely get more gorgeous.

6
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,670
Then you can go to the Court Entertainment Bureau.

7
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,810
What a pity.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,190
Let me out!

9
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,430
I don't want to die.

10
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,530
If I let you go,

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
I'll be doomed.

12
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,140
Stop it.

13
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,700
They'll beat you if they see this.

14
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,530
Give me the hairpin.

15
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,960
No.

16
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,770
My dad gave it to me.

17
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,050
After I get out of here and learn something,

18
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,920
there'll be no lock that I can't open.

19
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,760
Can we

20
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,810
get out of here?

21
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,610
Heroine, spare my life.

22
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,400
It's you.

23
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,640
Weren't you locked in the box?

24
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,910
How did you get out?

25
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,160
I came here to help you.

26
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,670
Go.

27
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,330
Where did you get it?

28
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,900
From my family.

29
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,970
This jade

30
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,100
was cut from a whole piece of ancient jade.

31
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,860
The emperor of the previous dynasty

32
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,600
gave each of his brothers and sisters a piece.

33
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,840
Who are you?

34
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,530
This jade

35
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,560
belongs to you.

36
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,030
This jade

37
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,000
must be worth

38
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,660
ten mansions like this.

39
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,700
Do me a favour.

40
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,530
This jade will still be yours.

41
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,720
Okay.

42
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,480
Guard the door for me.

43
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,880
I need to take a break.

44
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:25,870
No problem.

45
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,659
We caught the thief.

46
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,670
With all due respect,

47
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,530
this man has well-developed martial arts skills.

48
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm afraid

49
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,520
it's not simple.

50
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Detective Lu, you don't want it to be simple, right?

51
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,500
I've seen many Brocade-clad Guards

52
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,820
like you.

53
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,000
Detective Lu,

54
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,600
we just found a maid

55
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,210
sleeping naked in the storeroom

56
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,110
because she was drunk

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,690
after drinking alcohol secretly.

58
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,210
Detective Lu,

59
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,650
you can check there

60
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,780
and see what happened.

61
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,660
Where are

62
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,850
the maid's clothes?

63
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,880
I thought you could be helpful.

64
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,590
Now,

65
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,260
you're just a dead body to me.

66
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,820
It's a misunderstanding.

67
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,400
What are you looking at?

68
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,020
I'm looking for a place to hide your body.

69
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,710
I promise

70
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,000
I won’t play any tricks again.

71
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,310
Heroine.

72
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,450
Heroine.

73
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,650
The Wang Kegong's Mansion is well guarded by Brocade-clad Guards,

74
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,210
not to mention you're injured.

75
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,820
If we don't collaborate,

76
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,130
none of us can get out of here.

77
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,080
Why do you want to get out of here?

78
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:51,780
I...

79
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,690
I...

80
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,010
I'm a thief.

81
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,190
Look.

82
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,170
As long as we collaborate,

83
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,380
we can definitely get out of here.

84
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,150
We can also take some treasures away.

85
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,200
Once we succeed,

86
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,030
you can get 30%.

87
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,130
How about 70%?

88
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,500
This place looks good.

89
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,220
No, no, no.

90
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,060
You can get all of them

91
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,850
as long as you don't kill me.

92
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,690
If I die,

93
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,140
you can't get

94
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,380
what you want either.

95
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,710
It hurts.

96
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,429
Who are you?

97
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,260
I'm really a thief.

98
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,240
I can help you.

99
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,580
How did you know I'm looking for something?

100
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,299
It hurts.

101
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,870
It hurts.

102
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,420
See if you've still got the hairpin on your head?

103
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,540
It hurts.

104
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,810
Look.

105
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,850
Your wound is cracked open again.

106
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,060
Why don't you take treatments since you're badly injured?

107
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,870
I should have died ten years ago.

108
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,060
I'm lucky enough to live until now.

109
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,240
You've been to the Imperial prison?

110
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,130
Those who have been to the Imperial prison

111
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,600
have scars on the back of their necks.

112
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,470
I'll get you some medicine

113
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,050
tomorrow morning.

114
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,670
If you dare to play tricks with me,

115
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,770
I'll...

116
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:41,730
You'll kill me.

117
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,700
You're so badly injured.

118
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,740
You can only choose to trust me.

119
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,530
I can still kill you

120
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,520
even if I'm badly injured.

121
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,470
But

122
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,570
I trust you

123
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,900
because I have your inherited jade

124
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,430
with me.

125
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,870
Your Highness.

126
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,960
Let me try the hairpin.

127
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,050
No.

128
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,900
My dad gave it to me.

129
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,050
Blood was found in the corridor.

130
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,620
I'll go back to the Investigation Bureau

131
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,210
to ask the officer to deploy troops.

132
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,810
Wait here.

133
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,640
Be careful.

134
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,700
There's an assassin in Wang Kegong’s Mansion.

135
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,330
Come with me.

136
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,570
Without the order from Deputy Commander,

137
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,040
who dares to leave?

138
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,540
Right.

139
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,540
Exactly.

140
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,900
Deputy Commander.

141
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,030
Deputy Commander.

142
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,440
Deputy Commander.

143
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,350
Lord Lu.

144
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,430
We're working

145
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,550
for the emporer.

146
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,420
We receive the imperial order

147
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,080
to protect Wang Kegong.

148
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,390
Guards!

149
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,680
Get ready to go.

150
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,060
Yes.

151
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,020
Thank you, my lord.

152
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,740
Wait.

153
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,220
I always follow the rules.

154
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,710
There's no need to say thanks.

155
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,310
There are rules

156
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,410
in the Investigation Bureau.

157
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,080
We have to make it clear

158
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,900
in case others think

159
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,360
I am pulling strings for you.

160
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,650
You're right.

161
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,490
Good.

162
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,590
Guys, stay alert outside Wang Kegong’s Mansion.

163
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,510
Don't enter the mansion rashly.

164
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,400
I'll report this to the Imperial Office.

165
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,230
Then, the Imperial Officer

166
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,120
will report to Lord Yuan.

167
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,190
After Lord Yuan reports to His Majesty,

168
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,150
you'll hear back in around two days.

169
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,300
If His Majesty is too busy

170
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,650
to inform the Security Bureau

171
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,120
to cooperate with the investigation,

172
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,900
you need to wait for three more days at most

173
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,530
before you can enter Wang Kegong’s Mansion

174
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,560
and arrest the assassin.

175
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,540
My lord,

176
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,740
there is no time to lose.

177
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,020
I've said it just now.

178
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,440
Lord Lu.

179
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,550
Greetings, Commander.

180
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:04,910
My lord.

181
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,790
Wang Kegong's family issues

182
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,590
have nothing to do with the Investigation Bureau.

183
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,560
Anyone who meddles

184
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,800
will be punished as going against the order.

185
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,960
You still went to the Wang Kegong's Mansion.

186
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,420
Then Xie Kengran…

187
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,210
It has nothing to do with him.

188
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,230
I wanted to go there.

189
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,820
My lord,

190
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,590
I have figured it out.

191
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,970
Li Dongfang who was transferred from the north

192
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,990
colluded with Night Scout secretly.

193
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,200
He doesn't deserve to be a sergeant.

194
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,510
Even if

195
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,830
he's not the sergeant,

196
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,520
someone else will take it.

197
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,100
No matter who takes it,

198
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,050
it can't be you.

199
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,780
You don't want to be a sergeant.

200
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,510
You want to get the key

201
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,360
to the file storeroom

202
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,590
after you become the sergeant,

203
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,420
so that you can investigate Hong Wunian's case files.

204
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,380
You've been investigating the case.

205
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,990
Do you think I don't know?

206
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,170
My father's log book

207
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,510
is in the file storeroom.

208
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,310
I have the right to investigate.

209
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,040
Right?

210
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,060
I am Commander of the Investigation Bureau.

211
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,740
Without my permission,

212
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,610
even if you are promoted to Deputy Commander,

213
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,070
you won't be allowed to enter the file storageroom.

214
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,010
Just give up.

215
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,860
If I can't find anything when I'm promoted to Deputy Commander,

216
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,240
I'll try to get promoted to Commander.

217
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,540
If I still can't make it,

218
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,590
I can even give up my job

219
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,930
and break in there.

220
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,910
As long as I'm alive,

221
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,060
I must find out the truth.

222
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:58,910
My lord,

223
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,520
my father is not a rebel.

224
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,270
He died for me.

225
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,590
Zheng.

226
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,840
Whether you

227
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
call me father or not,

228
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,360
I'll protect you

229
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,820
in this life.

230
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,740
There's no turning point

231
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,930
in Song Heming's case.

232
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,270
Detach yourself

233
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,710
from Wang Kegong's case.

234
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,220
If you go, you're disobeying the order.

235
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,490
It's Military Law…

236
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,640
You musn't go against Military Law, kid.

237
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,890
Detective Lu.

238
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,400
Commander ordered me to follow you.

239
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,190
If you insist on entering the Wang Kegong's Mansion,

240
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,280
I've prepared the horse for you.

241
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,400
You're disobeying the order.

242
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,170
Is it worth

243
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:12,890
disobeying the order for you?

244
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,020
No.

245
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,950
Of course not.

246
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,620
Here are the buns.

247
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,590
Meidou, come here.

248
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,910
[Meng's Eatery]

249
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,140
Pay the money back!

250
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:43,910
Go.

251
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,180
Meidou.

252
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,280
Get me another one.

253
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,860
Yangzhou is a good place.

254
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,140
See you, Li Dongfang.

255
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,420
No.

256
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,340
I'll never see you again.

257
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,090
Your wound is cracked open again.

258
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,350
I'll get you some medicine

259
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,040
tomorrow morning.

260
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,370
You're a thief.

261
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,570
No one will believe you.

262
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,170
You did it for money.

263
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,810
Yes.

264
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,400
For money.

265
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,100
You did it for money.

266
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,890
Yes.

267
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,250
You did it for money.

268
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,940
For money! For money! For money!

269
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,150
So annoying.

270
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,330
Li Dongfang.

271
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,950
Are you sure?

272
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,670
Aren't you friends with him?

273
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,150
You scared me! Are you a ghost!

274
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,410
If you have a ghost in your mind,

275
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,270
you'll see everyone like a ghost.

276
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,290
Why does the burnet have such a strong smell of pseudo-ginseng?

277
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,600
How much blood has Sergeant lost?

278
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,960
Why did you use so strong medicine?

279
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,570
To be honest,

280
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,370
it's hard to say.

281
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,140
The symbol of Night Scout.

282
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,980
Hiding assassins

283
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,660
is a capital crime.

284
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,040
There's a long way ahead of you.

285
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,180
Don't ruin your future.

286
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,090
Not only can I

287
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,350
let bygones be bygones,

288
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,760
but also give the first credit

289
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,550
to you.

290
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:14,950
Lord Lu,

291
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,290
watch your mouth.

292
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,060
Do you have the evidence

293
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,070
of me hiding an assassin?

294
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,630
I have many ways

295
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,390
to let you tell me in person.

296
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,950
If I want to,

297
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,810
I can even make you sing for me.

298
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,170
I give up.

299
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,370
I give up.

300
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,660
Who locked the door?

301
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,540
Open the door.

302
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
Let me help you.

303
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,220
Maybe

304
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,670
the cat will open the door for you.

305
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,330
Xie Kengran!

306
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,440
Where is he?

307
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,090
Where is the thief?

308
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,130
Where is the thief?

309
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,130
Where is the thief I hid?

310
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,930
Tell me.

311
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,700
Don't ruin my name.

312
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,160
Why are you here?

313
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,480
I...

314
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,820
I need to find a place with no one

315
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,000
to

316
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,850
apply medicine.

317
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,100
Can't I?

318
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,790
You're cooking.

319
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm hungry.

320
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,130
Good for you.

321
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,840
Lord Lu.

322
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,600
Would you like to have some?

323
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm not hungry.

324
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,210
Wang Kegong is an imperial official.

325
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,520
The assassin is outside,

326
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,590
but you don't care at all.

327
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,940
It's a dog-eat-dog.

328
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,000
None of my business.

329
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,200
As a Brocade-clad Guard,

330
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,050
this is your duty.

331
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,970
My duty is

332
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,040
to sneak away when this is over.

333
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,580
Don't you care about

334
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,120
your relationship with Wang Kegong?

335
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,160
I'd better hide in the granary for a few days.

336
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,640
There are food and drinks after all.

337
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,200
Li Dongfang,

338
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,230
how come

339
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,020
you can become a Brocade-clad Guard?

340
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,620
It's a disgrace to the Ming Dynasty.

341
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,610
The flour will explode if it is on fire.

342
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,580
You know how to open the lock?

343
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,750
Lord Lu,

344
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,040
don't you Imperial Brocade-clad Guards

345
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,940
know how to open a lock?

346
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,520
If you want to catch a thief,

347
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,950
you must learn what they can do first.

348
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,620
In my opinion,

349
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,320
you must be a thief.

350
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,500
On April 28,

351
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,280
the third year of Jianwen,

352
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,930
Sergeant Li Dongfang

353
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,300
stole from the royal mansion

354
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,530
and was suspected of

355
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,750
colluding with an assassin.

356
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,250
Am I

357
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,690
telling the truth?

358
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,010
When I catch the assassin,

359
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,280
I'll ask you to

360
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,360
come to the Investigation Bureau to figure it out.

361
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,270
Take this opportunity

362
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,350
to reflect on yourself.

363
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,430
Tell the Brocade-clad Guards to go away.

364
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,580
I want to ask Wang Kegong

365
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,980
where the Yuming Lock is.

366
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,630
Lord Wang.

367
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,920
The study…

368
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,670
My lord.

369
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,080
My lord, how are you feeling?

370
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,410
I won't die.

371
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:21,930
I won't die.

372
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,960
I'll go after the assassin.

373
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,220
Where did you go?

374
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,800
I was delayed.

375
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,480
Go after them!

376
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,560
Sit here.

377
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,100
They are Night Scouts.

378
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,670
The Prine of Yan sent them from the front line.

379
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,480
We can't protect Lord Wang

380
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,150
only by a few of us.

381
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,700
Go back to the government office

382
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,170
and beg Commander.

383
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,170
I'll stay here.

384
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,270
No, you go.

385
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,060
-No. -I’ll stay.

386
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:49,740
You go.

387
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,250
Officer Xie.

388
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,030
Only if I stay,

389
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,920
they'll send someone here.

390
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,830
Go.

391
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,220
Lu Zheng.

392
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,950
You must stay alive and wait for me.

393
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,760
I spared your life,

394
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,020
but I didn't expect you to bring Brocade-clad Guards back to arrest me.

395
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,610
I'll get you some medicine

396
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,420
tomorrow morning.

397
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,700
Heroine.

398
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,500
Well...

399
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:22,690
Hey.

400
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,699
Are you crazy?

401
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,330
What's wrong?

402
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,940
Didn't your parents teach you

403
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,370
not to undress in front of a male stranger?

404
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,340
I have no parents.

405
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,219
How did you grow up then?

406
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,850
I grew up with Li Qianzong from Night Scout.

407
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,139
Didn't he tell you

408
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,679
not to take off your clothes in front of a male stranger?

409
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,510
He told me

410
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,050
as long as a woman takes off her clothes,

411
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,480
men will listen to her.

412
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:28,960
You...

413
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,800
How old are you?

414
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,980
22.

415
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,040
22?

416
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,520
Someone at your age could have raised a kid.

417
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,280
How come you are a Night Scout?

418
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,520
How old are you?

419
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:45,920
I'm 22 too.

420
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,810
Someone at your age could have won the first place in the civil examination.

421
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,310
Why are you still a thief?

422
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,920
I got the thing

423
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,600
you want.

424
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,050
You?

425
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,460
Yes.

426
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,950
The one who was supposed to meet me didn't show up.

427
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,300
Help me find the Yuming Lock.

428
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,520
Yuming Lock?

429
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,430
My lord.

430
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,460
Are you hurt?

431
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,250
I'm fine.

432
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,550
Detective Lu,

433
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,310
do you remember the old acquaintance

434
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,450
I mentioned to you?

435
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,010
He was also a Brocade-clad Guard.

436
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,490
He once lost his family

437
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,260
because of a case.

438
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,690
He was even convicted after his death.

439
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,740
I have his memorial tablet at home,

440
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,580
but I can only put it

441
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,650
in a secret place.

442
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,130
There's a crucial thing

443
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,060
in that case.

444
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,670
Yuming Lock.

445
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,300
Night Scout was here to find the Yuming Lock?

446
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,340
I can't tell you too much

447
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,890
about the secrets in the Yuming Lock.

448
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,380
Otherwise, we'll be doomed

449
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,090
and all the people will be in misery.

450
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,220
My lord,

451
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,120
why didn't you give the Yuming Lock to His Majesty?

452
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,630
I came to the capital this time

453
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,530
to hand the Yuming Lock to His Majesty.

454
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,030
You risked your life to save me this time.

455
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,450
I was right.

456
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,660
You

457
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,600
are reliable.

458
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,760
The Yuming Lock

459
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,920
has been hidden by me for ten years.

460
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,880
I want to trade it for my son's life.

461
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,720
Please try to understand the love of a father.

462
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,310
My lord.

463
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,080
Detective Lu.

464
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,320
The life of my family

465
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,600
is in your hands.

466
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,410
Well…

467
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,570
The Yuming Lock

468
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,370
is hidden under the memorial tablet of my old friend.

469
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,290
The memorial tablet.

470
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,170
Yuming Lock.

471
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,710
So this is it.

472
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,220
I thought it was worthless.

473
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,060
I almost threw it away.

474
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,700
Do you know how hard it is

475
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,950
to find it?

476
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,140
That's because you didn't meet me earlier.

477
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,250
You can't open it without the code.

478
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,610
If you open it forcibly,

479
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,230
the acid will flow out

480
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,730
and the thing stored in it will be destroyed.

481
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,290
How do you know that?

482
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,750
I'm a thief.

483
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,710
There you go.

484
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,420
You gave me back the jade.

485
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,240
Then it means

486
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,410
the thing in the Yuming Lock

487
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,370
is far more valuable than this jade.

488
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,580
I can't help but think

489
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,850
now the war between the South and the North is going on,

490
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,860
Wang Kegong took such a great risk

491
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,850
to bring it back from the North,

492
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,570
who is he going to give it to?

493
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,280
What about you?

494
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,410
Who did you steal the Yuming Lock for?

495
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,780
I can help you find the Yuming Lock.

496
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:55,730
Likewise,

497
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,440
I can also

498
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,510
help you find the code.

499
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,600
How about this?

500
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,760
Do you want to

501
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,270
make a deal?

502
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,680
Aren't you afraid you'll die for the money?

503
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,600
I don't want money.

504
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,250
I want you Night Scout

505
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,610
to steal something from the Brocade-clad Guard's file storageroom

506
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:25,860
for me.

507
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,960
What is it?

508
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,570
I'll tell you when I find the code.

509
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,870
As long as you help us find the code,

510
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,400
we'll reward you.

511
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,220
I need to borrow something from you

512
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,220
if you want me to find the code.

513
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,650
I don't know

514
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,560
if you dare to lend it.

515
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:21,340
[Memorial Tablet of Brother Song Heming]
