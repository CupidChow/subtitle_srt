[Yi Gate]

5
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,780
My lord, please go and have a look.

6
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,500
Deputy Commander interrogated those rebels.

7
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,770
They revealed the identities of more than a hundred rebels

8
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,080
from the six ministries, the palace,

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,130
and even local officials.

10
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,530
The evidence is solid.

11
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,920
They are trying to

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
randomly accuse people.

13
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,230
They want to get out of it by using this method

14
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,310
because it's difficult to punish so many offenders at once.

15
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,930
I'm afraid what they have said

16
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,940
are true.

17
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,080
What?

18
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:05,930
Well,

19
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,530
let's go in first

20
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,820
and ask Si Xiangnan.

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,490
You two go to the market

22
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,540
to see if there's a farmer selling antiques.

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,260
If you see him, come back and report it.

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,490
Don't alert him.

25
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,380
Yes.

26
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,140
They don't eat or drink.

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,820
What should we do?

28
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,700
You losers!

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,640
Can't you even do this well?

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,930
Continue.

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,120
Open your mouth.

32
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,860
Their bodies are clean and didn't receive any punishment.

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,670
I guess they didn't confess by torture.

34
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,920
This is a very important case.

35
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,050
Si Xiangnan doesn't dare to do anything stupid.

36
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,250
Why aren't they afraid

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,950
of offending the Emperor?

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,180
Why are you working on the drill ground?

39
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,530
My lord.

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,570
This case is very important.

41
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,190
The trial must be open.

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,180
Where are their statements?

43
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,940
My lord, please make a decision.

44
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,490
Last night, I searched the house of

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,890
the grain transport commissioner of the Capital Grain Transport Bureau.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,670
The amount of silver we confiscated

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,180
are the same as their statements.

48
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,760
Besides,

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,240
we found a letter of him colluding with Yan.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,240
[Zhu Hang, Grain Transport Commissioner of the Capital City]

51
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,450
Please take a good look.

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,940
There are not many loyal officials.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,380
No wonder they are so fearless.

54
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,630
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.

55
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,940
Lord Lu,

56
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,040
we should report this to Lord Yuan as soon as possible.

57
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,180
He must have a verdict.

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,210
That makes sense.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
Sergeant Lu Zheng

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,100
wants to meet Lord Yuan for something important.

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,420
Lord Yuan already informed us.

62
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,640
Please come in, Lord Lu.

63
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,090
Your Excellency.

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,470
The Longevity Lantern

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,870
was only hung during the Spring Festival.

66
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,620
In order to express his grief

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,899
for Hongwu Emperor,

68
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,220
His Majesty decided to hang lanterns during the Ghost Festival.

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,800
Your Excellency.

70
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,040
What do you think

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,440
we should do about this?

72
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,470
Catch.

73
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,610
Who?

74
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,510
All of them.

75
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,600
There's still a war.

76
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,950
Arrest them all.

77
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,220
Who can His Majesty use?

78
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,900
Once this batch of people are caught,

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,060
there will be new people.

80
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,570
Let me

81
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,110
think about it.

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,010
Your Excellency.

83
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,470
Your Excellency.

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,350
You can't strike it.

85
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,230
Your Excellency,

86
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,640
may I have a word with you?

87
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,900
Sergeant,

88
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,440
let's just talk here.

89
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,080
I heard

90
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,250
you were kneeling here since sunset.

91
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,300
You are loyal to the country.

92
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,450
But all of you

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,440
should take care of your health.

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,770
If His Majesty really summons you

95
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,750
and Your Excellencies are too tired to speak

96
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,750
or sick,

97
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,710
it would be disadvantageous.

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Your Excellency.

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,210
You are quite different

100
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,010
from other Brocade-clad Guards.

101
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,440
We are both officials.

102
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,130
Business is business.

103
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,580
Relationships are relationships.

104
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,500
Actually,

105
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,190
this matter

106
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,460
belongs to the internal affairs

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,450
of the Investigation Bureau.

108
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,460
Just that the villagers of Zhao Village

109
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,540
wrote a blood letter of appeal

110
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,820
for Wang Kegong.

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,970
Take a look.

112
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,410
Your Excellency.

113
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,260
Since this matter

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,490
is an internal affair of the Investigation Bureau.

115
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,280
Could you please

116
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,660
not strike the Dengwen Drum?

117
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,700
After I report it to my superior,

118
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,390
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

119
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,380
Be smart.

120
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,950
Take good care of them.

121
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,560
If something goes wrong,

122
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,760
we'll be in big trouble.

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,290
Yes.

124
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,159
Your Excellency.

125
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,130
As things have come to this,

126
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,430
you should be aware.

127
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,840
The one in charge of the rebels' case

128
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,080
will meet a tragic end.

129
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,840
I asked you to be the one in charge

130
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,940
to save Lu Zheng.

131
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,550
Unfortunately,

132
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,190
that child's temper...

133
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,370
All parents

134
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,030
are like this.

135
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,900
Please understand

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
my reasons for doing that.

137
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,590
I already know

138
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,670
what you did in the palace.

139
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,850
You're very capable.

140
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,750
You have the ability to make big issues insignificant.

141
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,210
Your Excellency.

142
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,020
I know

143
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,809
I don't have that ability.

144
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,169
They want to use

145
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,800
the blood letter

146
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,950
against Lu Zheng.

147
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,590
They might even protest

148
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,040
in front of His Majesty.

149
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,840
With Lu Zheng's temper,

150
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,130
he is

151
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,450
going to be destroyed.

152
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,990
He wants to prove

153
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,850
Wang Kegong's innocence.

154
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,420
Wang Kegong.

155
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,180
If he wasn't a rebel,

156
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,980
he shouldn't have died.

157
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,810
His Majesty

158
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,780
also shouldn't have pardoned Lu Zheng.

159
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,910
But His Majesty

160
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,610
can't be the one in the wrong, right?

161
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm afraid

162
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,350
no one can save Lu Zheng anymore.

163
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,410
Your Excellency.

164
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,440
I have something to ask you.

165
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,850
Go ahead.

166
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,090
If I

167
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,940
still want to be in charge of the rebels' case,

168
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,490
what should I do?

169
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,870
Don't worry.

170
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,490
I have my reasons for doing this.

171
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,380
I won't let anything happen to Lu Zheng.

172
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,740
Without fingers,

173
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,020
how can there be a blood letter?

174
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,130
You mean...

175
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,590
I heard something happened in the palace.

176
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,610
What happened?

177
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,100
I don't know.

178
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,580
If you don't tell me,

179
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,460
come with me to see the Chief Commander

180
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,170
and ask him.

181
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,340
No.

182
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,990
I have

183
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,500
already reported to the Chief Commander about this.

184
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,660
To be honest,

185
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,360
this matter is really troublesome.

186
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,900
What is it?

187
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,560
Some officials went

188
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,720
to the Dengwen Drum in the palace to make trouble.

189
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,890
Saying the imperial court

190
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,070
owe them two years of salary.

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,380
I also felt sorry for them.

192
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,620
At Zuixian Tavern,

193
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,490
some officials have been owing them money for a year.

194
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,030
If this war continues,

195
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,570
the treasury will be empty.

196
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,550
Did the Chief Commander teach you what to do?

197
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,290
Yes.

198
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,230
Some officials

199
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,810
are aristocrats of the local area.

200
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,580
His Excellency asked me to discuss with their patriarch

201
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,310
and persuade them not to make a scene.

202
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
He informed the higher-ups

203
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,180
and ask them when they can

204
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,270
pay off their debts.

205
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,290
Don't worry.

206
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,700
I'll take care of everything.

207
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,510
You are hiding something

208
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,390
from me?

209
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,180
Yes.

210
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,610
I do

211
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,530
need to ask you for a favor.

212
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,320
Go ahead.

213
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,600
I want you to teach me

214
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,310
how to write "In the same boat."

215
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,210
In the same boat.

216
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,980
Loyal to each other.

217
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,440
Loyal to each other.

218
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,060
If you forget these words,

219
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,240
I'll stick them on your face.

220
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,590
How many people in total?

221
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,500
39.

222
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,040
How many people are there in the Zhao family?

223
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,850
Well...

224
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,110
I don't know.

225
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,130
I have to ask the patriarch.

226
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,860
I'll go find him.

227
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,400
This matter

228
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,820
must be suppressed no matter what.

229
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,880
If it's suppressed,

230
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,470
then those people will seem unreasonable.

231
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,350
Go.

232
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,350
We must

233
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,420
not let Lu Zheng

234
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,670
reopen Wang Kegong's case.

235
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,740
During Hongwu's reign,

236
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
Lord Wang Kegong

237
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,280
saved me from the imperial prison

238
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,240
and the entire Zhao family.

239
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,540
I know.

240
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,430
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,910
Old man.

242
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,430
Go.

243
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,220
Hurry up.

244
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,520
Where is the blood letter from Zhao Village?

245
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,870
You stole the letter.

246
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,800
Only you have read it.

247
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,520
What letter?

248
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,030
It's useless to play dumb.

249
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,620
Even if you stole one blood letter,

250
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,360
the people will write 100 more.

251
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,140
Where is the blood letter?

252
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,010
Give it to me!

253
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,510
You...

254
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,180
You...

255
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,930
Without fingers,

256
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,060
can you still write 100 blood letters?

257
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,180
Let's go.

258
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,600
Hurry up.

259
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,100
I'll go first.

260
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,530
9:45 p.m.

261
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,670
I ran faster than you.

262
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,120
I ran faster than you.

263
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,150
No, I'll go first.

264
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,390
Me first.

265
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,450
It must be me first.

266
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,690
Luckily, the rain stopped today.

267
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,590
Otherwise, the Ghost Festival Lantern Show would be ruined.

268
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,579
Look who's here.

269
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,000
Lord Li,

270
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,829
what do you want to eat today?

271
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,940
Give me a bottle of wine.

272
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,890
The bowl is over there. Help yourself.

273
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:57,990
Wait.

274
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,440
I won't give it to you for free.

275
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,150
Let me ask you three questions.

276
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,530
Answer me honestly.

277
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,210
If I'm right,

278
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,030
you drink a bowl of wine.

279
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,870
You want to use this Yuming Lock

280
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,320
to save someone very important to you.

281
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,460
The perfume sachet on you

282
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,970
is related to a woman.

283
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,420
This woman

284
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,240
wants to give the Yuming Lock

285
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,720
to the Grand Secretariat of Wenhua Hall,

286
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,390
Yuan Zhongdao.

287
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,570
You have someone important to you.

288
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,870
I want to save someone very important to me.

289
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,010
Only Yuan Zhongdao can save him.

290
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,910
If I help you,

291
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,060
can you help me?

292
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,240
The more you do for her,

293
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,250
the less she will care.

294
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,220
I'll give you this for free.

295
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,410
My lord,

296
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,350
we've found the farmer.

297
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,900
Two of our men are watching him.

298
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,330
Let's go.

299
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,610
Lord Yuan.

300
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,940
Don't hurt him.

301
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,880
If Lu Zheng comes too,

302
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,560
then everyone will be here.

303
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,490
This moment,

304
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,920
he should've arrived at Zhang's Silk Store.

305
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,560
Come.

306
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,890
Please come in.

307
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,240
The Brocade-clad Guards are here.

308
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,300
Lu Zheng found you through Song Tianyi's perfume sachet.

309
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,510
It's all because of Li Wu.

310
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,430
How did he know I'm a fake?

311
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,730
How did he know I'm Li Wu?

312
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,360
Li Wu.

313
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,450
I originally liked you a lot.

314
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,140
Someone from the Zhao family submitted a blood letter

315
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,540
with their fingerprints.

316
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,050
Then you went

317
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,770
and cut off the fingers of the whole clan.

318
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,470
What a genius!

319
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,200
You turned a big issue insignificant.

320
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,840
But Li Wu,

321
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,940
Song Tianyi already decided to die for Zhang Junqing.

322
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,880
Why did you have to tamper

323
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,950
with his perfume sachet?

324
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,810
How did you know?

325
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,060
All the spies in the 13 provinces of Ming

326
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,580
are within my grasp.

327
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,670
You came to beg me to save Lu Zheng.

328
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,180
Don't you believe I have that capability?

329
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,050
If Song Tianyi was killed by Lu Zheng

330
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,610
as the Ghost-masked Night Scout.

331
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,680
Everything

332
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,140
would've ended successfully.

333
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,940
Song Tianyi would've saved the beauty.

334
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,960
Lu Zheng would've avenged Xie Kengran.

335
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,570
My trusted subordinate Zhang Junqing

336
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,720
would've escaped.

337
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,430
And I...

338
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,840
would've gotten the Yuming Lock.

339
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,710
All of this

340
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,700
not only would've had a happy ending,

341
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,570
but also

342
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,800
the beauty of reaping the harvest.

343
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,190
Now,

344
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,060
because of you,

345
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,720
everything is ruined.

346
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I didn't want Lu Zheng to die.

347
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,150
But now,

348
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,090
he will die for sure.

349
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,900
Lord Yuan,

350
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,990
please save Lu Zheng.

351
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,030
My lord.

352
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,450
From now on,

353
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm your dog.

354
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,140
You have to remove

355
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,390
Lu Zheng's suspicion of Zhang Junqing.

356
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,540
Take Lu Zheng to kill Song Tianyi.

357
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,190
I was the one who let them

358
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,590
submit Zhao family's blood letter.

359
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,740
Those officials also

360
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,220
went to the palace under my orders.

361
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,090
I can make Lu Zheng die

362
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,190
whenever I want.

363
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,730
Remember,

364
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,030
in this play,

365
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,240
Lu Zheng is Yue Fei.

366
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,760
And you...

367
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,870
are Qin Hui.

368
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,920
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

369
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,620
My lord.

370
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,480
Ms. Zhang just measured my sizes.

371
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,300
I want to make a winter coat.

372
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
What brings you here?

373
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,740
Your wife should be back soon.

374
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,530
Why don't you make one for her?

375
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,820
What do you mean?

376
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,070
Ms. Zhang,

377
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,410
a case involves your store.

378
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,790
A Night Scout wearing a ghost mask

379
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,310
has this with him.

380
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Please take a look.

381
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,710
I did grow these flowers

382
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,320
and I'm the only who has them in the city.

383
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,770
Do you mean

384
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,140
this?

385
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,830
You can buy it here for 15 mace per bag.

386
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,480
A flower can be made into rouge

387
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,620
and dye.

388
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,850
It can also be sold as dry flowers.

389
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,550
Ms. Zhang really knows how to make full use

390
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,770
of a flower.

391
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,990
In this world,

392
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,480
if I can't calculate well,

393
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,050
I might as well quit doing business.

394
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:07,940
Okay.

395
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,130
I'll continue to enjoy the Lantern Show.

396
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,470
I misunderstood.

397
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,910
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,930
Wait, my lord.

399
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,920
You left some money here

400
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,970
when you bought fabric last time.

401
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,790
I decided to

402
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,300
use it to make a garment for you.

403
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,320
Please come in.

404
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:22,760
What's wrong?

405
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,060
I'm hungry too.

406
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,410
Boss.

407
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,590
I want the same.

408
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,670
Coming.

409
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,030
Enjoy.

410
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,470
You eat first.

411
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,610
A man named Song Tianyi

412
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,770
has been in the capital for more than five years.

413
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,950
He has been working as a porter

414
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,600
and often delivers goods to the silk store.

415
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,310
He has a house in the southwest corner of Ji'e Alley

416
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,170
and there's a Night Scout logo on the door.

417
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,180
Did you memorize it?

418
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,570
Say it again.

419
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,620
There is a man called Song Tianyi

420
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,530
who is stubborn.

421
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,590
He didn't have to stay in Ji'e Alley.

422
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,560
If he leaves the capital,

423
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,670
no one can find him.

424
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,380
But he insisted on getting himself killed.

425
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,370
Thanks, bro.

426
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,360
[Zhang's Silk Store]

427
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,800
Good for you.

428
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,900
Did you find the Ghost-masked

429
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,650
Night Scout?

430
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
You still have the mood to make clothes at the silk store

431
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,710
and wander around here?

432
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,560
There is a man called Song Tianyi

433
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,840
who has been in the capital for more than five years.

434
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,800
He works as a porter

435
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,070
and often delivers goods to the silk store.

436
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,500
He has a house in the southwest corner of Ji'e Alley.

437
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,020
On the door,

438
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,370
there is a logo of the Night Scouts.

439
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,820
They're floating river lanterns.

440
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,230
Let's take a look.

441
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,469
Sir, do you want to buy a lantern?

442
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,010
Let me see.

443
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,570
When I was young, during the Hungry Ghost Festival,

444
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,409
I went to the river with other young beggars

445
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,469
to earn money from scooping river lanterns.

446
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,650
People would float lanterns upstream

447
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,889
and we'd scoop them out downstream.

448
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,409
Then we'd erase the words

449
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:33,900
and exchanged it for money.

450
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,080
We earned money without cost.

451
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,940
At that time,

452
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,389
there was a boy who could read.

453
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,370
He read people's wishes to me.

454
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,659
I decided whether to erase it or not.

455
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,270

You killed Deputy Commander

520
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,320
Wang Kegong,

521
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,230
and Xie Kengran.

522
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,390
I've killed countless Brocade-clad Guards.

523
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,280
I don't remember Xie Kengran.

524
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,840
Don't sleep!

525
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,730
Don't sleep!

526
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,040
Don't die.

527
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,260
Don't sleep!

528
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,480
Do you know

529
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,370
what wish I made?

530
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:41,940
I know.

531
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,980
In the same boat.

532
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,510
Loyal to each other.

533
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,190
Colonel.

534
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,990
We've informed the higher-ups.

535
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,100
The red lantern.

536
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,560
Whose death tonight

537
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,930
warrants a city notice?

538
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,700
Colonel,

539
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,190
the one who died today

540
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,530
was the traitor who wanted to harm you.

541
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,930
Song Tianyi.

542
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,900
We're waiting here

543
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,840
for your order.

544
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,260
Should we investigate this matter.

545
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,140
The traitor is dead.

546
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,950
No need.

547
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,360
Retreat.

548
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,010
My lord.

549
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,080
Please.

550
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,450
Colonel Zhang saved me.
