in the file storeroom of the Investigation Bureau.

It’s clearly stated in the case files

that Li Yan, Minister of the Ministry of War,

Lord Yuan,

159
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,630
I think you should

160
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,700
know these things

161
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,550
better than me.

162
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,900
I heard you were hit twelve times

163
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,030
before I came here.

164
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,900
How can you hobble

165
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
into the Hall of Golden Chimes like this?

166
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,730
They are afraid of Chief Commander.

167
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,240
They didn't hit hard.

168

We haven't settled the score between us yet.

After tonight,

I'll do whatever you want.

171
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,640
My Lord.

172
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,250
My Lord.

173
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,130
Why didn't you let Lu Zheng know

174
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
you saved him?

175
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,320
If

176
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
he must hate someone,

177
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,870
let he hate me.

178

I'm Lu Zheng, Detective of the Brocade-clad Guard.

180
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

181
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,240
Lord Yuan.

182
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,710
Have you read it?

183
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,910
Sorry, I've crossed the line.

184
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,830
Is your father's surname

185
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,110
Lu

186
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,500
or Song?

187
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,560
My biological father's surname is Song.

188
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,250
My adoptive father's surname is Lu.

189
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,840
I won't forget them

190
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,910
for giving me life and raising me up.

191
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,160
At the night of April 25,

192
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,070
the 25th year of Hong Wu,

193
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,650
you were also in the Imperial Prison?

194
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,420
I was young and ignorant.

195
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,660
I broke into the Imperial Prison, stole the key,

196
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,000
and released the condemned prisoners.

197
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,200
My father

198
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,660
committed the crime

199
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,740
to make up

200
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,920
for my mistake.

201
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,760
This was

202
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,850
all because of me.

203
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,140
Well, I think

204
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,980
the Song's family

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,540
are kind-hearted

206
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,890
and saved innocent children.

207
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,300
There's an imperial edict.

208
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,240
On April 25,

209
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,820
the 25th year of Hong Wu,

210
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,210
Emporer Xiaokang, Xingzong

211
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,930
passed away.

212
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,110
If you and your father's grievance

213
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,860
could be redressed,

214
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,220
I

215
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,650
could also comfort my late father

216
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,280
in heaven.

217
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,270
I'm truly

218
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,100
grateful,

219
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,020
Your Majesty.

220
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,620
I will

221
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,760
try my best to find out the truth

222
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,080
and clear my father's name.

223
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,900
His Majesty has a verbal instruction.

224
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,630
His Majesty granted you flying fish clothes

225
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,460
and spring embroidery knife.

226
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,250
His Majesty

227
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,820
also granted you the bronze palace pass

228
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,230
for your convenience.

229
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,060
Congratulations on your promotion to Sergeant.

230
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,800
His Majesty ordered you to take charge of the rebel case

231
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,310
and to supervise the execution of the Wang Kegong's family.

232
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,090
My Lord,

233
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,700
don't let His Majesty down.

234
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,630
Eunuch Wang,

235
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,260
could you please let me know

236
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,470
why do I need to supervise the execution of the Wang Kegong's family?

237
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,550
Wang Kegong is a rebel convicted by His Majesty.

238
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,490
Wang Kegong is a rebel?

239
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,510
His Majesty pardoned you and put you in an important position.

240
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,700
The Wang Kegong you killed

241
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,230
must be a rebel.

242
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,660
The rebel case

243
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,840
is the most important case nowadays.

244
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,080
It's not an easy task for you

245
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,430
to be in charge of it.

246
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,960
Congratulations on your promotion to Sergeant as you wish.

247
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,280
What about Xie Kengran's funeral?

248
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,300
His funeral

249
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,580
hasn't been settled.

250
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,740
Chief Commander has approved the budget for the arrangement fee.

251
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,380
But Si Xiangnan said

252
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,050
if Xie Xiaoqi died,

253
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,630
according to the rules, the government will pay for the funeral and the arrangement expenses.

254
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,030
If it relates to rebels,

255
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,060
the government won't pay for anything.

256
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,650
What is he?

257
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,110
It hasn't been decided yet.

258
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,210
Where is

259
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,480
Xie Kengran?

260
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,840
Deputy Commander

261
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,140
put him in the main hall.

262
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,410
One.

263
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,280
Two.

264
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,950
Three.

265
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,870
Lord Li,

266
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,980
you even know

267
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
which store has the best paper money in Yingtian.

268
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,340
You are more like

269
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,590
a native growing up here.

270
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,280
It's nothing.

271
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,340
How did Xie Kengran die?

272
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,600
He went to Mount Guanyin with you.

273
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,760
Why did he die when you were fine?

274
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,920
A Night Scout with a ghost mask tried to kill me.

275
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,910
He protected me.

276
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,340
Why?

277
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,550
He said I can only save you if I'm alive.

278
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
I promised him

279
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,490
to come back to save you.

280
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,260
You were supposed to die

281
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,200
that day at Mount Guanyin.

282
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:38,980
Yes.

283
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,100
My life

284
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,680
was given by Xie Kengran.

285
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,550
Then I'll take his life back.

286
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,240
You saved my life.

287
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,250
I'll spare yours.

288
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,470
We

289
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,410
are even.

290
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,580
I want to buy some cloth.

291
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,280
The shop is closed.

292
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,390
I just want some cloth.

293
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,650
Please.

294
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,500
I just want cloth. It'll be quick.

295
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,170
Mr. Zhang.

296
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,010
Sir,

297
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,850
please come in.

298
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,550
I've been running this silk store for so many years.

299
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,500
It's really eyeopening today.

300
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,990
I only heard that there is an urgent check in the clinic,

301
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,890
but I've never heard that there's an urgent buy in any silk store.

302
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,880
I want

303
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,940
a piece of mixed-coloured cloth and a piece of green cloth.

304
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,160
Get a piece of mixed-coloured cloth and a piece of green cloth.

305
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,800
I won't use this much.

306
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,490
Please take the extra as my apology.

307
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,200
How about this?

308
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,900
If there's extra cloth,

309
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,570
I'll make you clothes.

310
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,620
I'll feel

311
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,140
really sorry

312
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,110
if you don't agree.

313
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,080
Take care.

314
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,350
Why are you here?

315
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,830
Wake up.

316
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,770
We still have business to do.

317
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,060
What business?

318
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,050
The funeral.

319
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,050
I've been feeling uneasy

320
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,840
[Xie Kengran’s Residence]

321
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,780
these days.

322
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,780
I felt something was going to happen.

323
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,630
It turned out

324
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,410
something really happened.

325
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,840
Xie liked eggs.

326
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,750
I cooked some for him.

327
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,650
It's been for a few days.

328
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,600
The eggs are about to go bad.

329
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,870
We eat.

330
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,460
Mrs. Xie,

331
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,710
Xie's death is my fault.

332
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,660
Don't say that, Lord Lu.

333
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,410
Xie Kengran always said

334
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,730
there should be more Brocade-clad Guards

335
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,740
like you.

336
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,170
Xie Kengran

337
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,720
died for saving me.

338
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,190
In my eyes,

339
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,280
he is a great man.

340
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,660
My Lord, don't do this.

341
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,480
My Lord.

342
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,850
Anyone

343
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,950
would do the same.

344
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,880
Xie

345
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,110
was just one of them.

346
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,210
Xie Kengran

347
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,290
was indeed a fool.

348
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,610
Me too.

349
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,330
But I believe

350
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,760
the world will be better

I had a deal with Xie Kengran

353
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,530
to have a good drink at Zuixian Tavern.

354
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,140
I should be the one to die

that day.

356
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,030

You too.

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,360
I gave you a hard time

because I couldn't get over it.

from Zuixian Tavern.

Aren't you going to supervise the execution of the Wang Kegong's family today?

Wang Kegong is not a rebel.

His family

What if he doesn't accept it?

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,590
He will take it.

He can't wait

Why?

it can be something really big.

has granted you convenience to work.

524
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,240
Yes.

525
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,220
Lord Yuan.

526
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,520
Lord Yuan.

527
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,380
Greetings,

528
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,010
Mrs. Li.

529
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,890
Greetings, Lord Lu.

530
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,450
This is the map, the document,

531
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,820
and a letter from Chief Commander at Jinan

532
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,610
referring my husband, Li Dongfang.

533
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,260
I can't take

534
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,450
this letter.

535
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,840
Lord Li should give this

536
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,500
to Chief Commander himself.

537
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,170
You must be tired

538
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,820
all the way here.

539
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,620
How's everything going?

540
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,180
It's good.

541
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,690
Li Dongfang has known me

542
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,990
since he arrived at Yingtian Prefecture.

543
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,900
I know he comes from a poor family.

544
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,270
You must come from

545
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,970
a rich family.

546
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,620
Not really.

547
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,960
My father just has some friends

548
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,570
in the North.

549
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,440
By the way,

550
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,350
where does Li Dongfang

551
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,710
originally come from?

552
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,300
Su'an, Linyi.

553
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,410
Our colleague Lord Li

554
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,580
is also from Su'an.

555
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,280
What's the specialty of their hometown?

556
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,420
It's nothing.

557
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,040
They are just ordinary things

558
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,490
to locals.

559
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,110
Why don't you bring

560
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,750
some servants

561
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,160
with you?

562
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,680
I came from a remote village.

563
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,000
There's no such thing.

564
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,240
Even if it's in a remote village,

565
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,880
it's a big family.

566
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,200
Li Dongfang is in Zuixian Tavern.

567
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,350
Let me

568
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,480
take you there.

569
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:21,710
Okay.

570
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,890
It's here.

571
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:36,990
Honey.

572
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,220
Lord Lu.

573
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,150
Mrs. Li has been waiting for you here for a long time.

574
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,700
The Investigation Bureau

575
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,820
has arranged accomodations for you.

576
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,550
I'll take you there now.

577
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,840
Don't bother.

578
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,020
We can go there

579
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,100
by ourselves.

580
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,130
It's nothing.

581
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,920
We're colleagues after all.

582
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,420
You're new here and unfamiliar with the place.

583
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,100
It's my pleasure.

584
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,640
Please.

585
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,570
Isn't this Wang Kegong's mansion?

586
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,540
This is the property confiscated in the year of Hongwu.

587
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,500
Deputy Commander made this Wang Kegong's home.

588
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,830
After Wang Kegong died,

589
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,430
he gave this to you.

590
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,270
It seems that he values you very much.

591
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,370
Which room is ours?

592
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,280
The whole mansion is yours.

593
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,920
I'm flattered.

594
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,350
Please.

595
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,940
Lord Lu,

596
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,870
my wife and I

597
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,060
haven't seen each other for a long time.

598
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,540
We have something to talk about.

599
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,250
You can get back to work.

600
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,460
Let's go.

601
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,420
This luggage…

602
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,980
We'll take care of it.

603
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,840
Why are you here?

604
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,750
I was supposed to pretend to be your wife

605
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,950
and come here with Colonel Li.

606
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,550
Besides,

607
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,060
I don't trust you.

608
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,370
What instructions does Colonel Li have?

609
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:52,810
Who?

610
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,060
Li Dongfang.

611
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,420
What are you doing?

612
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,930
These windows were broken

613
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,640
when they confiscated this mansion.

614
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,960
I came here

615
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,750
to repair it.

616
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,350
Is it fixed now?

617
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,510
Or, do you have

618
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,600
anything else to tell me?

619
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,390
Yes.

620
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,630
Chief Commander ordered us

621
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,620
to go back to the Investigation Bureau immediately.

622
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm afraid you're not familiar with

623
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,000
the way to the office.

624
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,400
I'll walk you there.

625
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,020
I know how to get there.

626
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,540
I went there by myself

627
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,150
when I went to the government office to save you last time.

628
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,020
Please.

629
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,540
Lord Li.

630
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,450
What is the specialty

631
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,750
of your hometown?

632
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,230
There's really nothing in Su'an.

633
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,880
The winter date

634
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,700
is quite famous.

635
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,130
We've prepared some

636
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,760
for you and the other guys.
