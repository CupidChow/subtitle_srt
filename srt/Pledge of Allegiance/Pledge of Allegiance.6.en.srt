at this moment,

147
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,010
is the most trustworthy.

148
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,600
Why should I trust you?

149
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,200
Do you have any evidence?

150

or not

152
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,000
depends on your choice.

153
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,810
If you choose to believe that he's dead,

154
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,020
he would be

155
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,700
lying in the withered leaves of Mount Guanyin,

156

rotting and stinking there.

157
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,970
If you believe that he's alive,

158
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,450
then he's hiding in the dark

159
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,660
and looking for the traitor who plotted against him.

160
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,110
If one wants to live,

161
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,770
he has to choose to believe in something.

162

who died on Mount Guanyin that day.

169
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,840
Why did the Brocade-clad Guard Xie Kengran

170

protect me from being stabbed?

and got seven piculs of grain every month.

176
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,579
And these two stacks of cloth

177
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,869
equal to his monthly salary.

178
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,460
Why was he working so hard?

179
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,880
His body is now

180
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,880
lying in the office of the Investigation Bureau, and is stinking there.

181
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,380
None of his colleagues

182
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,950
helps to arrange his funeral.

183
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,720
Why did he save me?

184
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
Because I can save Lu Zheng?

185
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,970
But I'm a fraud.

186
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm a thief.

187
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,820
Why did he believe me?

188
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,350
I've never seen anyone like him.

189
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,170
So,

190
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,680
I really want to know why.

191
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,350
I promised him that

192
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,220
I would go to the office of Investigation Bureau to save Lu Zheng.

193
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,930
I've been making a living in the society for so many years,

194
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,140
and I've never owed anyone anything.

195
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,910
To him,

196
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,490
I have to keep my promise.

197
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,420
My Lord.

198
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,580
My Lord.

199
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,890
My Lord.

200
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,660
My Lord.

201
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm Detective Wang Chan. Greetings, Sergeant.

202
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,750
How have you been, Detective Wang?

203
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,730
Li Wu.

204
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,810
Do you want to die?

205
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,730
How dare you fool me?

206
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,430
Do you know that you'll be beheaded if you pretend to be an official and lie to an official?

207
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,190
Well,

208
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,060
please show mercy, My Lord.

209
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,210
Tell me.

210
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,080
How do we put an end to this?

211
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,220
Plus the money you owed me last time.

212
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,750
100 taels.

213
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,840
Your price is so high.

214
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Fine.

215
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,770
I have something here, too.

216
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,350
Just see whether you want to buy it.

217
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,260
What is it?

218
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,530
Your ear!

219
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,520
Bastard!

220
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:41,900
Li Wu.

221
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,630
How dare you!

222
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,530
You want to rebel?

223
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,710
You dare to hurt a Brocade-clad Guard?

224
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,540
Killing a detective is nothing.

225
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,440
We've even killed a deputy commander.

226
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,470
You are really a rebel?

227
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,790
Don't you have evidence?

228
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,480
Lord Li,

229
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,210
I have a big family to support.

230
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,710
Please spare my life.

231
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,120
How much are you going to pay for your ear?

232
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,180
100 taels. 100 taels.

233
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,860
100 taels?

234
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,410
Then we are even.

235
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,940
We are even now.

236
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,740
Lord Li,

237
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,320
I’m leaving now.

238
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,200
I won't disturb you.

239
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,840
Stop.

240
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,830
How much are you going to pay

241
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,290
to buy your ear?

242
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,790
There's another ear.

243
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,040
[Investigation Bureau]

244
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,950
Lord Li, you're so kind.

245
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,220
They are not here yet,

246
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,930
and the gift is given first.

247
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,030
This is not a gift.

248
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,460
It's etiquette.

249
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,350
Greetings, Chief Commander.

250
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,720
So this is Li Dongfang?

251
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,250
The sergeant transferred from the north?

252
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:41,890
Okay.

253
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,540
Li Dongfang has just come to the bureau's office to report duty today,

254
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,220
and you've already known each other?

255
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,790
Yes.

256
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,330
Li Dongfang.

257
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
It's been a long journey.

258
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,260
You must be tired.

259
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,820
Are you hurt?

260
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,840
My Lord,

261
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,340
it's

262
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,490
Officer Xie Kengran's blood.

263
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,680
On my way here,

264
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,880
I came across the Prince of Yan's spies, the Night Scouts.

265
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,730
It was hard for me to fight with them alone.

266
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,220
Luckily, Detective Xie helped me,

267
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,930
and I managed to escape unscathed.

268
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,200
However,

269
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Detective Xie was killed by the Night Scouts,

270
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,150
and died for fulfilling his duty.

271
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,870
I have a question.

272
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,210
Li Dongfang.

273
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,080
You mean

274
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,430
Xie Kengran was killed by the Night Scouts?

275
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,470
I saw it with my own eyes.

276
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,640
You've just arrived in the capital,

277
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,450
and you may not know some things.

278
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,530
Lu Zheng, the detective of the Investigation Bureau,

279
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
has already signed the statement of confession,

280
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,090
and admitted that he killed Xie Kengran and Wang Kegong.

281
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,500
Wang Kegong

282
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,540
was also killed by the Night Scouts.

283
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,390
The Night Scouts took Detective Lu's sword

284
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,810
and killed Wang Kegong.

285
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,120
I also saw it with my own eyes.

286
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,870
You've just been transferred to the capital from the north.

287
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,350
You haven't reported for duty yet.

288
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,900
Then why did you go to

289
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,650
Wang Kegong's mansion?

290
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,200
I got a secret order

291
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,450
to protect Lord Wang Kegong,

292
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,640
as well as chase and arrest the Night Scouts.

293
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,290
In Wang Kegong's mansion,

294
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,360
Lu Zheng saw me fighting with the Night Scouts,

295
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,300
so he took out his sword to help me.

296
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,260
We made acquaintance with each other because of it.

297
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,230
Since I've decided to step forward,

298
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,380
I've never thought of leaving unscathed.

299
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,820
I'm willing to

300
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,250
testify for Lu Zheng

301
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,820
and clear his name.

302
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,790
As for why Lu Zheng

303
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,700
admitted the crime he didn't commit,

304
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,410
and whether there were

305
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,410
torturing and beating during the interrogation to make him admit it,

306
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,470
I'll

307
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,750
report to His Majesty to make a verdict on it.

308
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,130
If anyone wants to make a big fuss

309
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,550
with the affair of rebels

310
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,960
to repeat the same plot as that in the period of Hongwu,

311
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,890
I don't think His Majesty will agree.

312
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:09,960
Nor will the people

313
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,430
of the whole country agree.

314
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,180
I've just come from the north.

315
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,840
I don't know how to beat around the bush.

316
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,910
Please forgive me

317
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,850
if I've offended you.

318
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:27,970
It doesn't matter.

319
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,800
You've just said

320
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,340
someone wants to repeat the same plot as that in the period of Hongwu.

321
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,020
Chief Commander.

322
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,650
Please analyze

323
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,340
what kind of

324
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,290
plot is it?

325
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,940
His Majesty has made

326
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,840
a verdict on Lu Zheng's case.

327
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,480
Lu Zheng is my adopted son.

328
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,730
I'm guilty of disciplining him inappropriately.

329
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,370
I'll go to the palace and ask for punishment later.

330
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,010
His Majesty is very kind,

331
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,780
and granted Lu Zheng a 
bowstring.

332
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,010
At 9:45 tonight,

333
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,690
Lu Zheng will be executed at the office of the Investigation Bureau.

334
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,310
Xie Kengran,

335
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,280
I did everything I could.

336
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,000
Even Lu Zheng's father doesn't help him.

337
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,870
There's nothing I can do now.

338
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,880
Give some peace to my son

339
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,130
and me. Okay?

340
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,400
Chief Commander, you're wise.

341
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,600
Li Dongfang.

342
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,480
Step forward and let's talk.

343
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,080
You helped my son so sincerely.

344
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,590
I should thank you.

345
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,330
Don't say that, My Lord.

346
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,280
Tell me what you want.

347
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,440
Tell me.

348
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,680
To be honest,

349
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,290
I

350
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,540
was entrusted by Xie Kengran.

351
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,990
I promised him that

352
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,990
I would save his best friend,

353
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,420
Lu Zheng.

354
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,780
His Majesty wants to kill Lu Zheng.

355
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,720
Only Lord Yuan from the Wenhua Hall

356
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,910
can save him.

357
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,290
I'll go to the palace at once

358
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,830
and find Lord Yuan to intercede for Lu Zheng.

359
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,540
But I'm afraid there is not much time left.

360
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,820
How much time do you need?

361
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,690
At least four hours.

362
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,500
Thank you, My Lord.

363
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,290
I should thank you.

364
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:49,810
[Wenhua Hall]

365
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,460
9:30 p.m.

366
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,870
9:30 p.m.

367
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,600
9:30 p.m.

368
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,450
Who will do it later?

369
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,520
Ma Han, you do it.

370
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,150
My Lord, we all know that

371
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,500
whoever does it

372
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,440
will have a grudge with the chief commander.

373
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,450
Please spare me.

374
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,360
Li Dongfang.

375
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,560
What are you doing here again?

376
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,030
I've found out that

377
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,450
Lu Zheng did collude with the rebels.

378
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,060
He told a big lie to me.

379
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,130
In just a few hours,

380
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,160
you found out about the truth

381
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,220
we had been seeking for a long time.

382
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,590
That's amazing.

383
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,440
It's all thanks to Detective Wang Chan.

384
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,740
I've just come to the capital.

385
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,930
I'm not used to the new environment and I'm a little dizzy.

386
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,870
Please forgive me, My Lord.

387
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,120
My Lord.

388
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,620
I've told the sergeant

389
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,600
about the whole story of Lu Zheng's case.

390
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,330
Lord Li used to be muddled as an insider,

391
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,410
but now he's clear about it as a bystander.

392
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,610
I'd like to

393
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,460
execute Lu Zheng off personally.

394
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:52,780
My Lord,

395
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,790
please give me a chance

396
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,490
so that I can

397
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,990
show my loyalty.

398
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,230
This is a nice move.

399
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,640
Finish this for me.

400
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,060
For your career path in the future,

401
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,700
I'll lead you.

402
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,470
Thank you, My Lord.

403
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,090
9:45 p.m.

404
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,840
Do it.

405
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,460
My Lord.

406
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,350
It's not 9:45 p.m. yet.

407
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,580
Please let

408
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,140
Lu Zheng have his last meal.

409
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,460
As the saying goes, one can be executed in a better way after he gets full.

410
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,090
Anyhow,

411
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,630
he used to be our buddy.

412
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,200
My Lord.

413
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,640
Chief Commander.

414
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,380
Please go back.

415
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,260
His Majesty has made it clear.

416
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,000
Eunuch Wang,

417
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,570
for the sake of our previous friendship,

418
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,380
please

419
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,610
inform His Majesty again.

420
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,550
Congratulations, Lord Lu.

421
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,090
Your case is closed.

422
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,580
It's you.

423
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,240
Look at you.

424
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,440
You can only escape

425
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,040
by listening to me.

426
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,800
Eat.

427
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,920
Eat slowly.

428
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,630
If you choke to death,

429
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
I can't afford to be blamed by the superior.

430
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:46,940
My Lord,

431
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,720
please go back.

432
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,280
It's not that I don't want to help you.

433
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,140
There's nothing I can do about it.

434
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,960
Then inform His Majesty again.

435
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,470
Just say that Lu Yulin

436
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,860
has something important to report.

437
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,040
It concerns

438
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,980
an old case which happened

439
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,250
on April 25 in the 25th year of  the Hongwu period.

440
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,120
Lu Yulin,

441
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,389
do you admit your crime?

442
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,239
Yes.

443
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,760
If I know

444
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,150
the old case which happened

445
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,610
on April 25 in the 25th year of  the Hongwu period

446
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,330
it's the crime of deceiving the emperor.

447
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,840
If I intercede for my son with this excuse,

448
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,199
it's the crime of offending the emperor.

449
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,210
Which one did you commit?

450
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,639
I know what happened

451
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,830
in the past,

452
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,360
and I also want to intercede for my son.

453
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,690
You want to trade the old case of the previous dynasty

454
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,420
for your son's life?

455
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,310
You want to make a deal with His Majesty?

456
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,280
I dare not.

457
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,840
9:30 p.m.

458
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,910
9:30 p.m.

459
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,490
Hasn't he just announced that it was 9:30 p.m.?

460
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,240
Why is it still 9:30 p.m.?

461
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,500
What kind of time reporting is this?

462
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,190
I know what is the right thing to do

463
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,070
between an emperor and a minister, and a father and son.

464
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,650
Lu Zheng can die for Your Majesty.

465
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,220
It's the honor of our family.

466
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,290
However,

467
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,970
if Lu Zheng's death

468
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,730
is harmful for Your Majesty,

469
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,130
I can hardly

470
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,750
absolve myself from the blame even if I die.

471
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,690
During the period of Hongwu,

472
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,310
you were not the only one who worked

473
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,030
in the imperial prison.

474
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,960
Wang Kegong

475
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,400
is an example of warning for you.

476
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,050
Come on.

477
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,880
Tell His Majesty

478
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,440
what else you want to say.

479
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,880
I know

480
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,520
where the secret edict of the Yuming Lock is.

481
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,400
Lu Zheng

482
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,340
is the son of the guilty official, Song Heming.

483
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,860
His original name is Song Zhen.

484
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,100
That night ten years ago,

485
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,470
Lu Zheng

486
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,630
was also in the imperial prison.

487
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,840
I couldn't bear to see him die,

488
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,860
so I saved this child.

489
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,710
But later, I was afraid that it would implicate myself,

490
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,590
so for these ten years,

491
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,400
I've kept this secret and didn't dare to tell anyone.

492
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,270
Your Majesty.

493
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,460
You didn't report it

494
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,680
and hid the family of a guilty official.

495
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,430
Of course you dare.

496
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,610
You really had the guts!

497
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,150
If you reported it then,

498
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,360
His Majesty wouldn't have waited for ten years

499
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
before he knew where the Yuming Lock was.

500
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,470
I deserve to die.

501
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,060
The insiders of the case which happened ten years ago,

502
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,250
Song Heming and Wang Kegong,

503
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,230
are no longer alive.

504
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,440
Lu Zheng is the only clue.

505
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,590
Lu Zheng knows the secret edict of the Yuming Lock?

506
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,720
May I ask Your Majesty

507
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,520
to summon Lu Zheng to the palace?

508
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,780
As long as the Yuming Lock is still there,

509
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,550
that child

510
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,480
will be useful for Your Majesty.

511
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,450
Please have mercy.

512
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,110
Please spare his life.

513
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,630
Let him serve His Majesty.

514
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,210
Give him a chance.

515
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,130
Kill him.

516
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,870
As for me,

517
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,930
I deserve to die.

518
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,660
Please kill me, Your Majesty.

519
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,330
There's an order from His Majesty.
