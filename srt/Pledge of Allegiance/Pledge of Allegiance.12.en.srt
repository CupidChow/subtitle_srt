4
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,320
Thank you.

5
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:26,770
Wait.

6
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,829
I'll go and eat at home.

7
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,640
Eat here now.

8
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,100
I can't eat now.

9
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,400
Then give it back to me.

10
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,550
You're all the same.

11
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,700
If you can't eat,

12
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,670
put it back in the basket.

13
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,390
My mother asked me to take the eggs home.

14
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,040
How many brothers do you have?

15
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,760
Four.

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,210
If you take this home,

17
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,210
your mother will give the eggs to your brothers.

18
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,630
You won't be able to eat anything.

19
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,250
She told you to be sensible

20
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,770
not because you're the elder sister who needs to take care of little brothers,

21
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,570
but because you're a girl.

22
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,160
Either you'll starve to death,

23
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,100
or be sold like an animal.

24
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,180
If you don't fight for yourself,

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,090
you won't get anything.

26
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,830
Only when you're full,

27
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,800
you'll have the power to fight.

28
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
Eat slowly.

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
There's more. Don't choke.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,810
Mr. Zhang.

31
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,470
It’s late.

32
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,130
Why are you in the Ji'e Alley?

33
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,060
Since you want to see it,

34
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,880
why don't you do so openly?

35
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,550
Excuse me.

36
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,079
I'm just

37
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,950
a little surprised.

38
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,380
Mr. Zhang,

39
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,700
why did you only give eggs to girls?

40
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,750
Ten years ago,

41
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,190
I got separated from my sister.

42
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,260
I'll never know

43
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,740
whether she is full or hungry

44
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,300
or if she can have an egg.

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,260
Every time I think about it,

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,760
I feel very sad.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,110
I've been looking for her for ten years.

48
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,210
I couldn't find her.

49
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,190
So I secretly thought

50
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,130
if I could find her by doing things like this.

51
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,340
Maybe there's a chance that when I look up,

52
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
the girl who comes for the egg is my sister.

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,650
But I was scared.

54
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,450
Ten years have passed.

55
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,010
Can I still recognize her?

56
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,410
Also,

57
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,850
I gave an egg to a boy before.

58
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,970
But he became an Brocade-clad Guard.

59
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,050
Mr Zhang doesn't like the Brocade-clad Guard?

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,870
How can I like someone

61
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,740
once killed my relatives

62
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,740
and my whole family,

63
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,760
then put me into the Court Entertainment Bureau.

64
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,320
You must be saved

65
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,400
by the nobleman.

66
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,390
You must think that

67
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,930
he saved me

68
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,480
and make me be his concubine.

69
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,390
When I was young, my father raised me as a boy

70
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,370
and let me learning.

71
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,460
I was ambitious in the court.

72
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,400
But I realized when I grew up,

73
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,380
it's hard for women to be in court.

74
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,860
Don't mention that

75
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,860
I've been in the Court Entertainment Bureau.

76
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,280
I thought my life would never change.

77
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,050
Until I met him.

78
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,000
He gave me a choice

79
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,050
and made me live again.

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,860
Lord Lu, do you know the feeling of

81
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,400
being saved

82
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,120
when your heart has already died?

83
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,630
I'm just like you.

84
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm the descendant of a sinful official, too.

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm someone

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,990
who is supposed to die.

87
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,340
Maybe God pitied me, too.

88
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,720
He arranged a few noblemen for me.

89
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,180
One

90
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,520
saved me

91
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,090
and raised me.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,480
One was my colleague and my best friend.

93
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,450
And one

94
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,550
who gave me hope

95
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,810
and let me justify for my father's crime.

96
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,950
You shouldn't have told me this.

97
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,460
Then who should I tell?

98
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,020
We just met by chance.

99
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,440
We may never meet again.

100
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,530
We just comfort each other

101
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,480
by telling secrets.

102
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,650
I met Mr. Zhang

103
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,720
because my colleague,  who is also my best friend

104
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,370
went to your store to buy cloth.

105
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,080
It's because of him.

106
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,980
Your friend

107
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,190
had a son.

108
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,450
Yes.

109
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,350
But,

110
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,310
he can’t see his child.

111
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
He was killed by rebels

112
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,290
when solving cases in Mount Guanyin.

113

with a gost-faced mask.

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,050
I will kill him

117

for Xie Kengran,

118
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,220
and

119
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,030
for those innocent people.

120
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,050
I don't believe you.

121
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,620
I just want to get promoted.

122
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,380
You're not that kind of person.

123
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,690
What kind of person am I?

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,860
The Li Dongfang, who talk about the world with me

125
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,620
is you.

126
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,110
I don't know what your motive is.

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,790
I don't want to know either.

128
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,340
Your selfish motive will definitely affect you.

129
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:47,950
Therefore,

130
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,630
you must avoid arousing suspicion.

131
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,020
For the sake of the world,

132
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,650
only Lu Zheng can do this.

133
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,420
You talked about

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,350
so many great principles.

135
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,810
To put it bluntly,

136
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,920
you just want to find out the old rebel case

137
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,590
of the year of Hong Wu.

138
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,040
Isn't that your selfish motive?

139
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,510
I've never wronged a good man

140
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,930
or let go of a bad guy

141
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,890
because of investigating old cases.

142
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,390
You help the rebels

143
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,730
for the officials.

144
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,590
The arms are transported to Beijing secretly.

145
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,470
Then the war starts.

146
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,610
These lives

147
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,880
will be your fault.

148
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,870
I did something wrong

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,970
I was threatened.

150
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,620
I had no choice but to work for the rebels.

151
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,850
This is my selfish motive.

152
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,700
This is a resignation letter.

153
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,010
It's not that the court can't tolerate you.

154
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,950
It's me who can't tolerate you anymore.

155
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,520
You don't deserve

156
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,150
this flying fish clothes.

157
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,630
Leave your uniform and leave.

158
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,840
If you are wanted

159
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,180
or threatened,

160
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,030
you deserve it.

161
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,720
I thought about starting over.

162
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,380
But every time I set out,

163
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,130
I go back to the same start point.

164
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,710
That past is weighing me down forever.

165
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,810
I want to get rid of the past.

166
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,230
I want to be free from guilt.

167
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,310
Don't think about it.

168
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,970
If I see you again, I'll arrest you.

169
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,200
But I thought we were friends.

170
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,180
You said that for a person like you,

171
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,180
nothing ventured,

172
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,210
nothing gained.

173
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,510
No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation is,

174
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,970
you only care about yourself.

175
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,330
You're the one who has no right to talk about the world.

176
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,970
Xie Kengran has every right to keep you away from the dragger.

177
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,640
But you,

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,320
you are not the one.

179
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,100
How can you

180
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,320
wear this flying fish clothes?

181
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,620
I was born

182
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,110
not to be friends with people like you.

183
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,690
I despise you from the bottom of my heart.

184
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,810
How is it?

185
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,140
Colonel.

186
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,980
Drink the medicine first.

187
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,190
This is the new draft of the word Za Zi.

188
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,640
Send it to the Fang Gu Hall.

189
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,950
Colone.

190
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,660
Zhang Junqing almost killed you.

191
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,960
Why are you still believe her?

192
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,480
If Zhang Junqing didn't stab me wrong on purpose,

193
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,860
I would have been in hell now.

194
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,950
Since the thirtieth year of Hong Wu,

195
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,530
Song Tianyi

196
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,810
has followed me for battles in Beijing.

197
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,090
His stab

198
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,090
was much more painful

199
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,500
than Zhang Junqing's.

200
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,020
[Zhang’s Silk Store]

201
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,980
After this embroidery,

202
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,740
the moment will come.

203
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,490
Most people embroidery dragon, phoenix

204
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,750
and mandarin ducks.

205
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,640
What are you embroidering?

206
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,810
The sky of Qin city's pavilions are filled with fireworks.

207
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,060
The Han Dynasty's mountains and rivers are embroidered.

208
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,480
I embroidered the landscape of Ming.

209
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,960
When I took over Nanjing,

210
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,280
the last Colonel of Night Scout left with me this.

211
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,290
He is my father.

212
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,830
Actually, my last name was Mu.

213
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,370
I've never heard you mention it.

214
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,550
My father is Mo Jinggao, he was a Night Scout.

215
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,400
When I was young,

216
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,580
I thought he was working for the Eastern Palace.

217
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,860
To be honest,

218
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,050
I still don't know

219
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,230
who he followed.

220
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,570
Hong Wunian.

221
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,770
Li Yan, the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of War.

222
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
He used to be a messenger between my father and the Eastern Palace.

223
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,280
Later, Li Yan was arrested by the Imperial Guards

224
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,190
and confessed my father.

225
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,560
My sister and I were imprisoned.

226
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,470
I was sent to the Court Entertainment Bureau.

227
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,290
Fortunately, I was saved by a scholar

228
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,200
and escaped from the Court Entertainment Bureau.

229
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,030
That scholar

230
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,010
is the Grand Secretariat of Wenhua Hall, Yuan Zhongdao.

231
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,090
Lord Yuan arranged me in a secret room.

232
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,990
He advised me to change my name

233
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,480
and live a normal life.

234
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,630
But I insisted on staying with him.

235
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,140
First, I wanted to repay him.

236
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,310
But there was another reason.

237
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,050
The Grand Secretariat of Wenhua Hall

238
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,870
has all the information and spies

239
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,560
of the 13 Ming provinces.

240
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,470
His Majesty just ascended the throne.

241
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,640
His foundation was unstable.

242
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,490
Mr. Yuan sent me to Beijing to join the Night Scout.

243
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
I’ve worked hard for five years.

244
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,110
I didn't expect to take over my father's position

245
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,760
and become the Colonel of the Night Scout in Nanjing.

246
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,160
At the same time,

247
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,490
I’ve shown every secret letter of the Night Scout

248
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,040
to Mr. Yuan.

249
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,430
I killed many of my Night Scout comrades.

250
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,050
But I had no choice.

251
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,020
I can only figure out

252
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,620
why my father died

253
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,940
and stay with my sister

254
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,820
by staying with Mr. Yuan.

255
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,460
Mr. Yuan has promised me that

256
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,170
as long as I find the Yuming Lock,

257
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,810
he'll tell me the truth of everything.

258
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,190
I don't care whether you work for Prince Yan

259
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,110
or Yuan Zhongdao.

260
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,780
I don’t care

261
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,960
how many compatriots you have killed.

262
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,740
I only care about you.

263
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,480
We came to Nanjing together.

264
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,760
In the war between the South and the North,

265
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,510
no matter who wins,

266
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,400
I will die.

267
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,440
I just live for an obsession.

268
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,230
Colonel.

269
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,710
I have a presumptuous request.

270
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,300
Please retire from the Colonel of the Night Scout of Nanjing.

271
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,700
Let me do this job.

272
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,310
If you agree,

273
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,930
I will return the favor

274
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,650
and bring you the Yuming Lock.

275
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,910
Uncle Wang, go back to sleep.

276
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,660
Uncle Wang, go home.

277
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,180
It's too late now. Stop drinking.

278
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,480
I'm closing.

279
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,810
I have a big deal.

280
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,990
I promise it'll make money.

281
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,320
Uncle Wang.

282
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,960
I'm leaving. Take care.

283
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,620
You're not young anymore.

284
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,870
Stop fooling around.

285
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,460
You owe me a favor

286
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,200
of the Wang Kegong’s Mansion's map thing.

287
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,580
This is the last time.

288
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,750
If you are really leaving,

289
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,190
you'll need money, won't you?

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,850
This is the last time.

291
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,080
I'm eating.

292
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,190
We're here.

293
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,250
I have nothing to talk about

294
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
with a porter?

295
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,420
Don't go.

296
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,140
I heard

297
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,730
there's nothing you can't steal.

298
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,060
I want this.

299
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,530
I haven't done this for a long time.

300
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,020
You...

301
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,690
Let me talk to him.

302
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:43,850
My lord.

303
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,010
Please let us in.

304
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,640
Go. Go in.

305
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,780
Let me check.

306
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,900
You can't enter without a guide.

307
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,340
What about you?

308
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,480
Sir, please.

309
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,260
-Let us in. We need food. -Go.

310
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,530
My lord.

311
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,010
No!

312
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,630
My lord.

313
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,200
Come on.

314
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,190
What do you want?

315
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:55,960
Do you want to die?

316
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,940
There're things more painful than death, you know?

317
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,530
Stop!

318
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,790
Don't come over.

319
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,540
If you come any closer,

320
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,810
I'll kill myself.

321
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,370
Why are you doing this?

322
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,600
You want the Yuming Lock?

323
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,230
You...

324
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,790
You don' have to tortur me.

325
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,940
I know I'm dead

326
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,700
whether I give it to you or not.

327
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,460
I am worth nothing.

328
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,980
I have no family or friends.

329
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,030
I have a lot of lawsuits.

330
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,040
I'm tired of living.

331
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,460
Let me die quickly.

332
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
I'll be born into a good family in my next life.

333
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,480
So many people want this Yuming lock.

334
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,900
It must be valuable.

335
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,730
I'll die with it.

336
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,750
Wait, wait.

337
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,700
Is there any room for discussion?

338
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,900
Why are you

339
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,980
in a shabby mask?

340
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,100
I know

341
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,230
you're not the ghost-faced Night Scout.

342
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,940
It's someone else.

343
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,790
What's your relationship?

344
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,710
Who are you talking about?

345
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm the ghost-faced Night Scout.

346
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,050
What are you doing?

347
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,940
What are you doing?

348
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,010
Don't bother. I'll kill myself.

349
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,880
No, no, wait, madam.

350
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,380
Brother.

351
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,780
Mr. Li.

352
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,610
You are my blood brother, okay?

353
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
That Yuming lock

354
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,480
won't go with you anyway.

355
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,000
How about

356
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,730
you give it to me?

357
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,950
What you said is quite pleasant to hear.

358
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,530
Fine, let's see.

359
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,700
You come to be my servant for a day.

360
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,290
If you make me feel comfortable,

361
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,060
I'll give you the Yuming Lock.

362
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,810
How?

363
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,530
Here, brother.

364
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,200
Here.

365
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,660
Are you really giving it to me?

366
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,220
I'm dying.

367
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,070
Why would I lie to you?

368
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,460
Raise your foot.

369
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,640
This one.

370
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,900
Anything else?

371
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,720
This is the last day of my life.

372
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,760
Then in this day,

373
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,090
I want to live happily.

374
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,230
Take the bag.

375
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,620
You said it yourself.

376
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,680
You want to live your last dat happily.

377
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,740
You came here.

378
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,280
This is my friend's wine collection place.

379
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,680
He can't pass the  imperial examinations。

380
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,970
Then he sold wine to examinees

381
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,400
and made a fortune.

382
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,910
But last year,

383
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,660
he got caught.

384
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,200
Usually people drink

385
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,350
in the restaurant,

386
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,330
or Court Entertainment Bureau.

387
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,780
Otherwise...

388
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,370
We can't go back.

389
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,440
Lei Gui?

390
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,030
Lei Gui.

391
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,570
It means "upset".

392
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,930
You know a lot.

393
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,480
I can't read at all.

394
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,950
I heard from others...

395
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,500
I feel so happy

396
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,900
for saying that.

397
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,810
Three mountains and rivers.

398
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,790
All evil spirits.

399
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,370
Heavenly King!

400
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,180
Listen.

401
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,410
My name is Li Wu.

402
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,080
I can't read.

403
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,630
I'm a thief.

404
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,810
I even killed people.

405
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,650
I admire you.

406
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:49,880
I admire you.

407
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,870
You try it too.

408
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,260
What are you afraid of?

409
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,580
No one can hear you in the mountains.

410
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:56,760
Come on.

411
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,380
I...

412
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,260
My name is...

413
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,890
Louder!

414
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,330
My name is Song Tianyi.

415
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,510
I am a Night Scout.

416
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,350
I killed many people.

417
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,590
Great.

418
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,810
Yes.

419
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,110
Actually,

420
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,690
I know you're cheating.

421
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,950
You don't want to die.

422
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,940
How did you know?

423
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,160
You're risking your life.

424
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,580
You couldn't still care about shoes.

425
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,740
Have you ever seen anyone who wants to die

426
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,640
left his shoes on the shore?

427
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,070
Tell me.

428
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,140
You must have another reason

429
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,610
coming here.

430
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,240
Last time,

431
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,600
I was here with a girl.

432
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,690
What kind of girl?

433
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,120
Tell me.

434
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,270
I saved her.

435
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,280
But if I had to choose again,

436
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,510
I won't lie to her.

437
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,750
I will tie her up

438
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,010
and take her to the end of the world.

439
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,620
No one can find her

440
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,880
And I'll marry her.

441
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,230
Will she agree?

442
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:05,870
I don't know.

443
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,540
I missed her.

444
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,850
Will you die for her?

445
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,260
She won't die with me.

446
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,410
What if only your death

447
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,100
can protect her?

448
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm very happy

449
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,700
with you today.

450
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,720
I haven't been so happy for years.

451
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,040
Thank you.

452
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,420
Where are you going?

453
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,570
I'm afraid he'll find this place soon.

454
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,450
Who?

455
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,000
The Imperial Guards.

456
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,390
I found this on your sole.

457
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,650
Every few miles you walk,

458
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,060
it will leave some marks.

459
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,020
Come on.

460
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,510
Don't kill him.

461
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,020
I'll give you the Yuming Lock.

462
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,630
He's an imperial guard.

463
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,940
You're no match for him.

464
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,040
I'm a thief.

465
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,170
I can't do it openly.

466
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,590
Just wait and see.

467
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,410
Li Dongfang.

468
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,470
What are you doing?

469
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:02,980
Li Dongfang!

470
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:14,890
Li Dongfang.

471
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,420
You...

472
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,480
What do you want?

473
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,180
Are you going to give him the Yuming Lock?

474
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,330
Don't worry.

475
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,960
I'll give you what I promised.

476
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,470
He's a good Imperial Guard.

477
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,670
Unfortunately,

478
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,930
there are too few Imperial Guards

479
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,670
like him.

480
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,540
It's too late.

481
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,790
Yuming Lock will only bring him death.

482
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,060
Drink some.

483
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,860
Drink some.

484
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,070
If you get it out,

485
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,350
I have to clean it up for you.

486
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,739
Give me the Yuming Lock.

487
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,900
I found it.

488
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,739
I can give it to whoever I want.

489
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,929
Do you know what's in the Yuming Lock?

490
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,550
Do you know how many people died for it?

491
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,929
If we hand them over to Prince Yan,

492
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,260
the world will be in misery.

493
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:40,909
The people...

494
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,139
- will… -I don’t know.

495
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,320
I don't want to know.

496
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,239
It's none of my business.

497
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,719
Lu Zheng.

498
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:51,610
Let me ask you.

499
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,360
Have you ever

500
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,699
cared about me?

501
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,870
Why do things become like this?

502
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,100
Let me tell you.

503
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,250
Just because of what he said.

504
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,180
He said that's because my surename is Li.

505
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,200
I don't understand.

506
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,190
It's been ten years.

507
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,320
I still don't understand.

508
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,530
Although I'm wearing an official robe,

509
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,400
I still hate

510
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,740
your Flying Fish clothes and Xiuchun Dagger.

511
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,840
Do you remember the old case of the Hong Wu Year?

512
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,290
Do you remember the Song Heming killed by Li Wu?

513
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,520
He is my biological father,

514
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,720
and an imperial guard.

515
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,420
Ten years ago, he worked in the imperial prison

516
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,360
and caught Li Wu.

517
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I pitied him,

518
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,060
so I wanted to let him go.

519
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,220
I begged my father.

520
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,930
My father refused.

521
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,080
I broke into the imperial prison and let him go.

522
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,130
That day,

523
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,160
I saw

524
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,560
the child I just let go

525
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,900
killed my father.

526
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,040
Good boy.

527
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,150
The dagger.

528
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,110
I'll give it to you.

529
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,620
Don't you always want it?

530
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,300
Since

531
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,990
you take my things,

532
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,110
you need to

533
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,110
do me a favor.

534
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,270
My hand

535
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,800
is broken.

536
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,710
Take this

537
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,080
and

538
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,640
kill me, please.

539
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,150
Only with my death,

540
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,880
my son

541
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,500
can live.

542
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,650
Help him.

543
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,320
Help me.

544
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,720
Yes.

545
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,680
Hold it tight.

546
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,330
Point it at me.

547
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,400
Thank you.

548
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,730
From that day on, I swear

549
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,270
I won't let any evil person go.

550
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,070
Whether it's above the court,

551
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,290
or a little thief,

552
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,950
even if he's just a child,

553
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,640
I won't let him go.

554
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,450
Kill me.

555
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,060
Didn't you

556
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,910
won't let any evil person go?

557
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,440
Kill me.

558
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,280
Kill me!

559
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,930
Kill me!

560
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,280
Kill me!

561
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,650
Why are you so soft?

562
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,980
Give me the Yuming Lock.

563
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,550
I can let it go.

564
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,570
You must hide it under the tree.

565
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,400
Which tree?

566
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,590
That tree.

567
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,890
The scar on your back

568
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,770
was left by Li Wu.

569
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:22,880
Go.

570
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,370
Who are you?

571
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,340
Excuse me, Miss.

572
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,300
Here’s the thing.

573
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,150
We were on the way to Mount Guanyin.

574
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,900
We lost

575
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,560
a bronze ball on our way.

576
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,620
Of course, it's not valuable.

577
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,650
It's a memory left by my mother.

578
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,720
I wonder

579
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,330
if someone found it.

580
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Every month,

581
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,380
we can dig a lot of things on the mountain.

582
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,620
If there are antiques or good craftsmanship,

583
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,460
they will be sold in the market.

584
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,270
Tomorrow is the big selling day of Zhongyuan.

585
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,300
My son has set off now.

586
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,420
Go after him.

587
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,350
Maybe you can catch up.

588
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,550
Thank you.

589
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,380
No need.

590
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,180
Take it.

591
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,980
No, thanks.

592
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,610
Why did you stop?

593
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,060
Come up.

594
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,320
Go ahead. I can catch up.

595
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,210
Let's go.

596
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,340
Let's ride the horse together.

597
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:04,860
Let's be with each other no matter what.

598
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,500
You're saying it wrong.

599
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,830
You've studied for so many years.

600
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,010
You're not as good as me.

601
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,520
I should really

602
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,390
note this expression on my...

603
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,400
I forgot.

604
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,290
I'm an Imperial Guard who was expelled by you.

605
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,470
There's no Log Book anymore.

606
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,540
Besides, I can't write.

607
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,190
I'll teach you.

608
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,620
Go back to the Investigation Bureau first.

609
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,480
Get the reinstatement.

610
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,820
You actually helped me a lot.

611
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,510
Since Xie Kengran is gone.

612
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,610
No one would help me

613
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,650
in the Investigation Bureau.

614
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,980
To be frank, being a Brocade-clad Guard is no different from being a farmer,

615
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,030
a trader,

616
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,060
or a theif.

617
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,840
There is no difference.

618
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,090
We all have to live.

619
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,780
It does not matter if you are popular or not.

620
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,860
Have seen so many Brocade-clad Guards in corruption.

621
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,280
I finally realize

622
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:07,840
how precious you are.

623
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,980
Who taught you this?

624
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:13,960
He.

625
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:17,890
Lu Zheng.

626
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,460
From now on,

627
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,960
I'll help you in the name of Xie Kengran.

628
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:26,800
We'll be with each other no matter what.

629
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,050
I'll add another sentence.

630
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,070
We'll be with each other no matter what.

631
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:00,650
We'll trust each other and won't let each other down.

632
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:06,960
I'll teach you how to write later.
