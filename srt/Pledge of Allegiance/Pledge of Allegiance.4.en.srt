4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,380
Take the family members of Mu Jinggao

5
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,940
all back to Investigation Bureau.

6
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:43,780
Yes.

7
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,350
Get up. Let's go.

8
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,490
Let's go.

9
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:47,870
Wait.

10
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,220
How old are you?

11
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,900
I'm 12.

12
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,800
What about her?

13
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,380
She is my older sister, 15.

14
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,780
Take younger one

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,640
to the imperial prison.

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,560
Take the older one

to the Court Entertainment Bureau.

18
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,580
Yes.

Let's go.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,360
No!

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,970
Let go of my sister!

22
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,620
Sister.

23

25
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,700
Where is Lord Wang?

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,320
My father has gone to the Epiphyllum Banquet tonight.

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,220
Night Scout injured several people in a row.

28
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,880
How could this banquet be held?

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,980
He wants to use tonight's epiphyllum banquet

30
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,480
to get a marriage for me.

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,290
He wants me to marry the daughter of a concubine of the Xu family.

32
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,710
It's good that the Xu family has two princes.

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,920
But if you ask me to marry a concubine's daughter...

34
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,510
Detective Lu,

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,690
can you talk to my father

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,850
and help me find a perfect solution for it?

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
It's not difficult.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,600
Don't worry, Young Master.

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,630
I'll definitly

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,270
solve this problem.

41
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,210
Really?

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,610
You can do it?

43
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,330
I'll

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,190
make you satisfy.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,270
Thank you.

46
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,290
How did you escape?

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,430
The thing in the memorial tablet is gone, right?

48
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,079
How did you know?

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,420
This is not a place for talking.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,910
Where should we go?

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,040
How about this?

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,920
Let's make a bet and compete with each other.

53
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,420
Whoever goes to the roof of the main hall first will win.

54
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,420
If you win, I'll tell you everything I know.

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,690
If I win,

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,630
you'll listen to me.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,410
Boring.

58
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,950
You're good.

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,450
You won.

60
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,350
No matter who wins,

61
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,430
I will tell you everything.

62
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,909
Keeping secrets from you before

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
is because I have a secret order.

64
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,220
I have to be careful

65
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,950
when it's hard to distinguish friends and enemies.

66
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,540
This is the Yuming Lock

67
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,250
from the Night Scout.

68
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,710
Why did you give it to me?

69
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,400
To be honest,

70
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,660
my secret order from Jinan

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,830
is to protect Lord Wang Ke Gong.

72
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,770
And Lord Wang told me

73
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,220
he would entrust this to you.

74
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,800
I trust Lord Wang.

75
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,650
So, Detective Lu,

76
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,020
you must keep it well.

77
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,770
Don't

78
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,130
lose it again.

79
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,510

The things between Song Heming

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,170
and Lord Wang Ke Gong,

82
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,360
what do you know?

83
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,740
Song Heming.

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,180
You have to ask Lord Wang.

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,930
To be honest,

86
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,880
I like you.

87
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,140
I think

88
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,640
we can be friends someday.

89
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,340
You're just a human backpack.

90
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,970
Yuming Lock, carry it for me first.

91
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,870
I'll ask for it when I need it.

92
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,820
You would never guess that I stole it.

93
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,750
Fine.

94
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,520
From now on,

95
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,740
I'm willing to follow your orders.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,130
I heard that they will take action tonight

97
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,640
at the Epiphyllum Banquet.

98
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,280
How about you and me

99
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,300
go to that banquet

100
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,320
right now?

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,020
Mr. Wang is a good drinker.

102
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,730
Please.

105
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,659
Lord Wang.

106
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,570
Marquis Xu! Lord Wang! Marquis Xu!

107
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,180
Lord Wang.

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,330
You're a good drinker.

109
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,420
My lord, please.

110
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,460
The epiphyllum originally came from an exotic land.

111
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,080
It appeared in the Tang Dynasty.

112
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,430
But now it has vanished.

113
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,010
The epiphyllum always blooms

114
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,110
in the moonlight when no one notices.

115
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,360
It's not outstanding among all kinds of flowers,

116
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,880
but there's always a moonlight that belongs to it.

117
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,420
Oh...

118
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,440
Lord Lu.

119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,680
What is the meaning of Lord Wang's writing?

120
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,640
The flower blossoms at night and tells the past destiny.

121
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,520
Dreams and souls are tied tightly together to empty pity.

122
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,050
Lord Li.

123
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,240
Have you heard about epiphyllum?

124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,060
In the tale,

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,620
Flora Goddess liked the earth.

126
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,120
She fell in love with a scholar.

127
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,140
Then she was demoted to epiphyllum

128
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,100
by the Jade Emperor.

129
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,140
Forget the past. Go through the years.

130
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,970
The scholar

131
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,060
forgot the Epiphyllum.

132
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,120
But Epiphyllum

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,420
still remains in love with him.

134
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,110
One time, the scholar went down the mountain to collect morning dew.

135
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,280
The Epiphyllum

136
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,070
used all her cultivation

137
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,650
for an instant bloom.

138
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,010
She hoped he can

139
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,400
look back for just one second.

140
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,470
Unfortunately,

141
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,950
time had changed.

142
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,840
The scholar couldn't remember Epiphyllum.

143
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,450
He just asked her

144
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,610
why she was mourning.

145
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,380
The Epiphyllum said,

146
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,400
"I'm the one who lost the past destiny.

147
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,260
That's why I'm sad."

148
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,730
When the sun came out,

149
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,030
the Epiphyllum had withered.

150
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,800
The scholar became a Buddha.

151
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,090
They met in Buddha

152
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,350
and finally reunited.

153
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,100
Unfortunately,

154
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,650
the Rpiphyllum passed away.

155
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,130
She was punished for speaking.

156
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,340
She had been wandering for her whole life.

157
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,320
She had nowhere to go.

158
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,169
The Epiphyllum was so stupid.

159
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,419
She didn't have to speak.

160
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,110
Everything could be understandable

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:39,940
with people who understood her.

162
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,120
You're right.

163
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,970
It's useless to talk too much

164
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,490
with people who couldn't understand.

165
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,020
Look.

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,570
The epiphyllum is blooming.

167
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,000
It's so sour.

168
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,410
Lord.

169
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,830
Please wait a moment.

170
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,840
Master went to see Marquis Xu and his guests off.

171
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,600
It seems that Night Scout won't show up tonight.

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,620
Don't let your guard down.

173
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,740
When do you plan

174
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,430
to give the Yumin Lock to His Majesty?

175
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,470
After meeting Lord Wang.

176
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,470
You did the right thing.

177
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,350
Without the code,

178
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,300
Yuming Lock is useless.

179
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,780
Doesn't Lord Wang know the secret code of the Yuming Lock?

180
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,460
My lord,

181
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
please go to the garden.

182
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
Do you want to go with me?

183
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,330
No.

184
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,320
I want to drink two more bowls of Immortals Drunk Wine.

185
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,520
Why are your clothes messy?

186
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,170
Let me sort it for you.

187
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,370
You can go now.

188
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,610
It seems that

189
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,860
you don't hate the Brocade-clad Guard.

190
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,860
Nonsense!

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,960
I hate the Brocade-clad Guard the most.

192
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,420
If he dies in front of me,

193
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,580
I won't even blink.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,430
That's great.

195
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,350
He will die tonight.

196
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,690
I'm Song Heming's son.

197
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,180
Aren't you Lu Yulin's son?

198
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,090
After my biological father, Song Heming died,

199
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,760
Lord Lu secretly adopted me.

200
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,030
He told the public that

201
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,330
I'm a homeless beggar.

202
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,910
He asked me to change my name

203
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,960
and not to mention my biological father to anyone.

204
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,470
He was afraid

205
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,200
that he would lose his life

206
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,350
if anyone knew he had a relation with the guilty official.

207
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,360
I didn't expect

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
Lu Yulin

209
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,880
raised Song Heming's son.

210
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,220
Song Zhen.

211
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,200
Song Zhen.

212
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,050
Here.

213
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,730
Let me take a good look at you.

214
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,420
Lord.

215
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,350
Hong Wunian.

216
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,920
You worked with my biological father?

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,490
Hong Wunian.

218
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,990
Your father Song Heming

219
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,630
was my officer.

220
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,960
We worked together to solve cases

221
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,850
until the 25th year of Hong Wu.

222
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,510
It was 25th April.

223
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,820
I was sent back to Beijing.

224
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,530
25th April?

225
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,470
Song Zhen.

226
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,500
The way to open the Yuming Lock

227
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,800
is in your father's log book.

228
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,540
Be careful.

229
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,170
Lord!

230
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,380
Lord!

231

Give me the Yu Minglock.

234
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,060
Or he'll die.

235
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,900
Run!

236

Wang Ke Gong is dead.

239
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,910
I failed to protect Lord Wang.

240
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,550
Night Scout killed him.

241
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,700
What's behind you?

242
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:51,960
Take it out.

243
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,820
Your sword?

244
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,380
Yes.

245
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,030
Whose blood is on the knife?

246
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,920
Mr. Wang Ke Gong's

247

Ma Han, write it down.

248

Yes.

249

Today is the third year of Jianwen,

Lu Zheng, the detective of the Investigation Bureau,

252
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,220
killed Wang Ke Gong, the deputy commander of Jinan.

253

My lord.

254
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,490
My lord, Night Scout used this sword

255
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,790
to kill Lord Wang.

256
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,260
This sword

257
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,690
is the weapon that Lu Zheng killed Wang Ke Gong.

258
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,650
Take him away.

259
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,240
Yes.

260
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,470
Let's go.

261
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,320

What's the matter? Take your time.

268

Lu Zheng

269
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,470
was caught by Si Xiangnan.

270
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:04,839
Night Scout

271
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,109
killed Wang Ke Gong with Lu Zheng's sword.

272
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,040
My lord, what should we do now?

273
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,050
If the higher-ups know about this,

274
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,680
what would happen to Lu Zheng?

275
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,869
He'll die?

276
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,740
My Lord.

277
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,310
It's all my fault.

278

What else can we do to save Lu Zheng?

279
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,130
Whatever it is,

280

you can ask me to do it.

281

I'll do it.

282

It's your fault.

Do it yourselves.

284

The detective of the Investigation Bureau

285
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,580
killed Wang Ke Gong, the deputy commander of Jinan.

286
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,340
I beg you to report to higher-ups

287

to investigate it thoroughly.

288

This secret letter

will make people die.

290
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,150
Lu Zheng is still young.

[Wenhua Hall]

Thank you, Your Majesty.

301
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,350
There is a saying in Mencius, Wan Zhang,

302
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,380
Such was the concern

303
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,450
of the sage Shun

304
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,560
hat he appointed Xie to be the minister of instruction,

305

to teach interpersonal relationships and the corresponding norms.

306

Fu Wang

307
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,970
behaves himself before teaching others.

308
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,360
So people know what is right to learn.

309

He rules by morality

310

and becomes the model of people.

311

It's been seven days.

314
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,050
When did His Majesty give him a secret edict?

315
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,510
Prince Yan

316
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,020
calls his army Jing Nan Army.

317
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,330
But he didn't use the year of Jian Wen when petitioned.

318
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,920
He used the 32nd year of Hong Wu.

319
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,210
This is disloyal.

320
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,850
This is his wild and evident ambition.

321
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,680
This is

322

327

we should ask Si Xiangnan

328
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,870
we should ask Si Xiangnan

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,660
the chief commander.

350
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,450
Lu Zheng was arrested

351
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,130
Lu Yulin's arm was broken.

352
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,040
For His Majesty,

353
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,690
the rebels are like tinea.

354
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,870
He said it was fine.

355
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,040
But it's itchy and intolerable.

356
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,180
He said it was important,

357
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,390
But it's not as important as another thing.

358
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
What do you mean?

359
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,650
The court?

360
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,640
His Majesty

361
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,770
used Lu Yulin again

362
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,960
is because

363
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,430
he could

364
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,790
use the investigation of rebels

365
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,070
to suppress the court.

366
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,740
There was no evidence

367
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,010
of whether Wang Ke Gong was a rebel.

368
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,930
But then,

369
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,580
they found

370
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,090
guilty official Song Heming's memorial tablet.

371
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,830
That was rebellion.

372
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,350
This was a great opportunity.

373
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,060
Make good use of it,

374
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,650
the game would be on again.

375
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,720
Let our men burn the fire up.

376
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,580
The night will be cold.

377
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,690
Yes.

378
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,330
You didn't get the Yuming Lock.

379
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,310
[Secret Room of the bell tower]

380
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,680
There's a thief called Li Wu

381
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,430
He used Li Dongfang's name to steal from Wang Kegong's Mansion.

382
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,160
He stole the Yuming Lock.

383
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,450
I've checked.

384
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Li Dongfang is missing.

385
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,400
His men are looking for him.

386
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,460
Li Wu

387
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,860
is from Ji'e Alley.

388
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,340
He's got theif accomplice in the Greenwood.

389
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,550
He is indeed a thief.

390
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,460
Where is

391
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,020
this Li Wu now?

392
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,210
If you understand me, say something back.

393
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,920
Do you remember

394
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,790
what you promised me

395
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,170
when we were in Guanmei Pavilion?

396
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,680
Raise your head.

397
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,430
I saved you

398
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,920
from the Court Entertainment Bureau.

399
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,930
You had

400
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,520
many choices.

401
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,430
But you insisted on this one.

402
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,570
Can you tell me

403
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,980
why?

404
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,130
25th April of the year of Hong Wu.

405
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,950
My father, Mu Jinggao died.

406
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,700
Since then, my sister and I have been separated from each other.

407
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,670
After becoming a sinner,

408
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,780
Lord Yuan thought I had many choices.

409
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,820
But I think there's only one way all the time.

410
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,460
That is to find out

411
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,590
who destroyed my family.

412
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,430
I can do anything for you.

413
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,740
Please help me.

414
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,590
You're not afraid of death,

415
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,320
but you're afraid of cold.

416
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm not.

417
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,380
It's cold.

418
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,700
I promised you to find out the truth.

419
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,240
I've found out.

420
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,530
Do you think I would tell you

421
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,410
about Mu Jinggao so easily?

422
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,110
This is a secret letter

423
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,660
I received from the Brocade-clad Guard in today's court.

424
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,460
It said that the chief commander of Brocade-clad Guard,

425
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Lu Yulin's adopted son,

426
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:48,990
Lu Zheng

427
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,820
killed Wang Ke Gong.

428
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,210
Is that so?

429
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,850
I killed Wang Ke Gong.

430
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,220
I used Lu Zheng's sword

431
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,360
to silence Wang Ke Gong.

432
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,240
In this way,

433
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,340
you can negotiate with me.

434
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,010
Let me exchange the secret of  Mu Jinggao

435
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,450
for the Yuming Lock.

436
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,220
I dare not.

437
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,260
You dare already.

438
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,340
You are mine.

439
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,930
You are a fake rebel.

440
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,280
A fake Night Scout.

441
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,070
Prince Yan doesn't know

442
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,930
that his Colonel of Night Scout in the capital city

443
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,290
works for me.

444
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,650
I want you

445
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,490
to kill Li Dongfang with your own hands.

446
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,530
Then I'll believe

447
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,800
you didn't forget the kindness  I offered you in Guanmei Pavilion.

448
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,240
I'll also believe

449
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,680
your heart is loyal.

450
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,690
Brother Golden Tooth.

451
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,590
Officer Xie.

452
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,990
It's so hot today.

453
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,810
Yeah.

454
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,550
It's a strange hot.

455
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,010
Take it.

456
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:53,980
This...

457
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,520
I can't take it.

458
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,540
Do you know what this is?

459
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,310
Taixi Bai wine.

460
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,560
Is this

461
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,230
the wine

462
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,280
Genghis Khan gave to his subordinates?

463
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,260
Smell it.

464
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,020
Then...

465
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,260
I can only give you time of a burning joss stick.

466
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,780
Don't make it difficult for me.

467
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,070
Thank you, bro.

468
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,170
I want some too.

469
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,530
Taixi Bai wine.

470
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
You want to die?

471
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,490
Just thinking about it makes me feel good.

472
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,540
Take care of the chief commander for me.

473
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,420
and introduce him to some women.

474
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,190
Find him someone

475
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,850
who is his age but still charming?

476
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,150
Let him married again.

477
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,130
Don't worry.

478
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,170
When my son is born,

479
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,180
I'll let him burn incense at your grave during festivals.

480
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,670
So that you can see

481
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,600
how good I am.

482
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,440
Let's see if you'll be jealous

483
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,340
or feeling regret or not.

484
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,550
You still want a son.

485
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,710
You even told your wife

486
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,930
it didn't matter if it was a boy or a girl.

487
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,810
Go to hell!

488
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,220
Officer Xie.

489
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,860
I need to go to the toilet.

490
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,420
Watch them for me.

491
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,380
Okay, don't worry.

492
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,260
Commissioner Lu, I'll keep an eye on him.

493
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,740
Okay.

494
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,010
If you want to live, listen to me.

495
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,930
Officer Xie.

496
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,230
What are you doing?

497
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,250
Si Xiangnan will try his best to torture you.

498
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,750
I've prepared the guide for you.

499
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,790
You go from Qinhuai River

500
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,100
to Yangzhou and hide there for a while.

501
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,980
Hide there until Wang Kegong's case is solved.

502
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,710
Leave.

503
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,950
Go back.

504
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,480
If I go,

505
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,770
you'll be the one who's tied up here.

506
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,230
Lu Zheng.

507
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,510
We Brocade-clad Guard have no friends.

508
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,600
They think I've done all the bad things.

509
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,840
They resented me.

510
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,090
They refused to befriend me.

511
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,430
In the Investigation Bureau,

512
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,570
there are always those people who fight for power and scheme.

513
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,060
Lu Zheng.

514
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,370
I've been a Brocade-clad Guard for four years.

515
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,940
Since I met you,

516
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,670
I finally have a confidant.

517
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,390
I don't suffer so much when I work.

518
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,830
I can't watch you die.

519
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,430
I can't watch you die, either.

520
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,910
Xie Kengran.

521
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,990
I will live well.

522
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,540
Besides,

523
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,380
I'll live faire and square

524
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,290
in the Investigation Bureau.

525
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,590
There's someone

526
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,040
can prove my innocence.

527
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:47,940
Who?

528
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,860
The sergeant from the north.

529
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,570
Li Dongfang.

530
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,600
He was also there

531
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,880
when Night Scout killed Wang Kegong.

532
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,820
Why didn't you tell that yesterday?

533
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,060
Si Xiangnan wanted to prove that I killed someone.

534
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,590
If I told him, it would backfire.

535
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,920
Besides, Li Dongfang

536
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,610
has a long story.

537
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,020
This person is sinister and cunning.

538
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,930
He may not testify for me.

539
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,660
If we can find Night Scout athrough him,

540
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,580
my innocence can be proved.

541
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,700
I don't care who he is.

542
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,480
As long as he can prove your innocence,

543
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,110
I'll find him for you

544
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,570
no matter what.

545
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,210
Here.

546
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,200
Here.

547
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,840
When you find Li Dongfang,

548
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,770
you may need more people there.

549
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,800
Night Scout are good at martial arts.

550
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,560
Don't go alone.

551
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,040
Don't worry.

552
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,390
I'll go now.

553
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,600
You are

554
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,430
honest and kind.

555
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,730
Don't trust anyone.

556
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,590
Be careful.

557
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,670
Don't worry.

558
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,340
I've written

559
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,240
the future log book.

560
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,450
Detective Lu Zheng,

561
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,510
Officer Xie Kengran,

562
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,690
they neglected their duty and missed the night duty.

563
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,260
They went to Zuixian Tavern to have a good drink.

564
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,850
Bye.

565
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:26,980
[Zuixian Tavern]

566
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,960
Sir, take it.

567
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,810
Thank you.

568
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,640
Let's go.

569
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,300
Lord Xie.

570
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,490
Have you seen him?

571
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,040
Does he live here?

572
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,360
This sir

573
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,690
came on the same day as Li Dongfang.

574
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,650
He rode a horse

575
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,650
from the Ji'e Alley courier station.

576
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,060
Have you seen him?

577
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,790
No.

578
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,199
Stop!

579
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,080
The Brocade-clad Guard are investigating a case.

580
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:23,870
Check it out.

581
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:25,760
Let's go.

582
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:27,380
You...

583
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,100
The behind one...

584
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,400
Take it out.

585
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:38,290
Let's go.

586
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,889
Excuse me.

587
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,389
What are you doing?

588
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,120
Get up.

589
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,940
Get up.

590
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,590
What happened?

591
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,850
Get up. What are you doing?

592
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,370
Get up.

593
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:49,940
What happened?

594
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,820
Get up.

595
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,460
Get up.

596
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:52,650
Get up.

597
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,870
Hurry up.

598
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:56,580
Get up.

599
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,460
Don't obstruct justice here.

600
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:57,980
Get up.

601
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:58,980
Go.

602
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,580
Hurry up.

603
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,440
Get up.

604
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,030
Hurry up.

605
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,480
Let's go.

606
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,180
Go!

607
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,730
Take your stuff and go. Go.

608
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:07,880
Go.

609
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,640
Hurry up.

610
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,000
The behind one.

611
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,300
A person who has been in the Imperial prison.

612
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,760
How can you still have so many valuable things at home?

613
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,300
This is not mine.

614
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,270
Please don't say that.

615
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,060
This is for you.

616
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,310
I'll peel an orange for you.

617
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,260
It's not much.

618
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,080
Do I look like a beggar?

619
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,320
By the way,

620
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,130
I have something good.

621
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,770
Do you want to buy it?

622
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,870
I have an idea.

623
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,660
Listen.

624
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,180
We're old friends.

625
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,570
I know

626
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,480
you're just a fugitive.

627
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,130
You're useless.

628
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,150
Wang Ke Gong is dead.

629
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,250
Now the rebels

630
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,470
made such a big fuss out there.

631
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,330
If the higher-ups ask,

632
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,280
we have to catch one or two people.

633
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,590
You've been in the Imperial prison.

634
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,370
I'll buy it. Name your price.

635
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,790
Li Wu.

636
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,180
You have to give me money for the rest of my life

637
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,880
for keeping your secret.

638
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,230
I'm leaving.
