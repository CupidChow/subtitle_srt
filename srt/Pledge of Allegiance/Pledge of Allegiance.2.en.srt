[Episode 2]

4
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,220
The deputy commander Wang Kegong,

5
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,180
who was transferred from Jinan,

6
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,600
came back with a secret edict.

7
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,060
His Majesty ordered us to protect him all the way.

8
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,860
I guess he must be hiding

9
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,380
a secret.

10
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,180
There are also others who care

11
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,020
about this secret.

12
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,340
Something is wrong with the soldiers from the North indeed.

13
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,940
If you find out about the truth of this matter,

14
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,700
you can take credit for it in front of His Majesty, right?

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,190
Is the position of sergeant very important?

16
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,460
The most important thing in the world

17
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,640
is your own life.

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,000
Xie Kengran.

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,850
How long have we been partners?

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,880
Three years.

21
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,510
It's been three years.

22
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,110
You...

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,060
You still don't know me well.

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,440
You said I don't know you well.

25
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,470
You don't tell me anything.

26
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,420
How can I know you well?

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,560
This matter involves

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,450
an old case that happened during the Hongwu period.

29
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,410
I'm the culprit of this case.

30
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,780
My biological father was killed because of me.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,470
After he died,

32
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,980
he was even considered as a guilty minister.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,030
I investigated Wang Kegong,

34
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,940
and competed for the position of sergeant

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,960
in order to investigate this old case.

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,180
Without Lei Zhen,

37
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,520
I thought the position of sergeant

38
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,560
would definitely belong to me.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,590
I didn't expect

40
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,450
a sergeant would be transferred from the North.

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,700
Li Dongfang?

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,300
How come you know this name?

43
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,530
Your hometown is also from the North.

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,150
Do you want to

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,460
fawn on him?

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,870
He's coming.

47
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,579
You shouldn't have come in directly.

48
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,840
Go through the back door if you're delivering goods.

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,130
There is a man called Mr. Li Dongfang here.

50
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,150
Give this to him.

51
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,980
Li Dongfang?

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,040
Is he the sergeant transferred to the capital?

53
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,710
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,950
It hurts.

55
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,460
What are you doing?

56
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:14,910
What?

57
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,630
Here you are.

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,500
Do it quickly next time.

59
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,760
If you are not caught by others,

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,220
that's considered as your true ability.

61
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,470
What are you doing?

62
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,580
Looking for Li Dongfang.

63
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,659
Why are you looking for him?

64
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,690
The vacancy of sergeant

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,370
has been filled by the man transferred here.

66
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,810
Are you going to ask him to go back home?

67
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,220
You and I only heard that the porter said he was looking for Li Dongfang.

68
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,150
But he didn't say that the one inside there

69
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,750
was the very Li Dongfang transferred from the North.

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,790
Before he came,

71
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,930
he wrote to me.

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,290
I just want this Li Dongfang to return home.

73
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,090
I'm the only one who can

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,220
be the sergeant.

75
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,190
Why is he still following me?

76
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,460
He even walks more lightly than a thief.

77
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,880
Oh no.

78
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,050
He won't let me off easily.

79
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,159
A dead end?

80
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,380
A Brocade-clad Guard?

81
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,800
Why did he leave?

82
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,930
I can't continue.

83
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,490
I can't continue.

84
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,430
The traces of dragging stop here.

85
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,820
I heard from the clerk at Zuixian Tavern that

86
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,670
Li Dongfang is a guest of Wang Kegong's Mansion.

87
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,410
He will definitely go to Wang Kegong's Mansion.

88
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,190
Didn’t you promise the chief commander that

89
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,020
you would keep an eye on me

90
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,540
and wouldn't let me go to Wang Kegong's Mansion?

91
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,300
I have said yes to you.

92
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,960
No matter what risk we'll face,

93
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,740
I'll go with you.

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,480

95
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,420
Fortune-teller. Come here.

96
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,440
Is your divination accurate?

97
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,650
If it's not accurate,

98
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,580
I won't charge you any money.

99
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,620
Look at my name,

100
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,240
and predict how my destiny will be.

101
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,830
For your destiny,

102
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,070
you're a very lucky man.

103
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,950
Read my name out loud.

104
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,990
Look up, and there are gods in the sky.

105
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,360
A fortune-teller should speak articulately.

106
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,410
Are you a liar?

107
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,550
Sir.

108
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,250
Your surname is Li.

109
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,210
Your first name

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:37,970
is Dongfang.

111
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,590
You were born in Jiulongtai, Jinling.

112
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,170
You'll remain single in the end and feel sad about it.

113
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,100
You have very high aspirations,

114
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,460
and you'll keep scheming all your life.

115
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,750
However,

116
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,050
you'll fail

117
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,940
because of one person.

118
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,540
Dongfang,

119
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,620
you can't

120
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,560
blame me on this.

121
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,930
The fortune teller said

122
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,900
I'm your jinx.

123
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,030

get some money.

125
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,440
So, I'll

126
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,010
use your identity for just one day.

127
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,280
When this deal is done,

128
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,190
I'll let you go.

129
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,030
If you don't say anything,

130
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,340
I'll take that as a yes.

Quiet!

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,460
I've told you

135

without an invitation letter,

136
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,830
you can't go inside.

137

I only

138
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,140
recognize invitation letters

139
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,920
instead of people.

140
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,580
You can't enter without an invitation.

141
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,050
All of you,

142
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,380
don't surround here.

143
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,670
Everything has its own rules.

144
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,340
Right?

145
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,510
What are they doing?

146
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,060
This...

147
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,370
Who's sitting in the sedan chair?

148
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,270
-I don't know. -I don't know.

149
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,150
I've never seen him before.

150
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,300
He has an invitation letter.

151
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,580
I guess he's an official.

152

Honorable guest.

153
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,890
Please come with me.

154
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,010
Enter the mansion from the small door.

155
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,530
Thank you, My Lord.

156
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,430
This way, please.

157
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,950
Mr. Lu.

158
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,150
Wait.

159
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,450
Li Dongfang.

160
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,830
I'm Lu Zheng.

161
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,880
I've heard a lot about you.

162
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,020
As I see you you today,

163
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,420
you're indeed extraordinary.

164
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,850
Nice to meet you.

165
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,110
I would like to invite you to have a long talk.

166
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,760
I wonder

167
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,930
if you would agree.

168
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,650
It was a long journey.

169
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,850
Thanks for travelling so long, Li.

170
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,860
You're welcome, Lord Lu.

171
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,500
It seems he didn't mention he's a Brocade-clad Guard.

172
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,660
Then why did I call him Lord Lu?

173
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,170
I didn't say that

174
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,940
I work in the government office, right?

175
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,630
This bastard is so cunning.

176
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,340
I need to find a way soon.

177
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,580
You're very particular.

178
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Official boots.

179
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,940
Lord Lu, you're keeping a low profile.

180
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,010
But that pair of official boots

181
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,430
shows your identity.

182
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,810
There were too many people just now.

183
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,970
I didn’t reveal my identity.

184
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,200
I’m sorry, Li.

185
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,310
It's convenient now.

186
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,460
I'm Detective Lu Zheng.

187
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,620
Greetings, sergeant.

188
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,540
It turns out that Li Dongfang is also a Brocade-clad Guard,

189
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,670
and his rank is higher than this brat's.

190
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,790
No need to stand on ceremony.

191
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,620
This isn't the Investigation Bureau.

192
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,620
Have a seat.

193
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,120
Thank you, My Lord.

194
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,050
Orange.

195
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,070
Give it to me.

196
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,400
Peel it.

197
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,090
Sergeant, didn't you peel

198
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,640
oranges by yourself in the north?

199
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,300
Yes, I did.

200
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,970
I peeled oranges for the deputy commander

201
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,020
and the chief commander.

202
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,410
The detective

203
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,410
should peel it for me.

204
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,730
This is our ritual in the north.

205
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,910
Lord Lu, you should also follow this ritual.

206
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,030
Well said, My Lord.

207
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,530
Then I will

208
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,960
I'll follow this ritual.

209
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,970
You're so smart.

210
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,160
You peeled oranges for the chief commander.

211
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,880
You must be close with him.

212
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,060
The chief commander surely doesn’t remember me.

213
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,860
What a coincidence.

214
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,880
I once peeled oranges for the chief commander, too.

215
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,990
You?

216
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,490
A detective?

217
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,300
Your rank is low.

218
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,690
I greet the chief commander every night.

219
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,400
The chief commander of our office

220
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,010
is my father.

221
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,470
Why is the tea cold?

222
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,650
Don't bother.

223
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,280
Please have a seat, My Lord.

224
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,270
I have a few questions for you.

225
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,940
I'll just stand here.

226
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,860
Why did you insist on being transferred here from the North?

227
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,950
It's just a token of my appreciation.

228
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,810
I know

229
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,079
this small sum of money can't satisfy you.

230
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,690
How about this?

231
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,980
Give me some advice.

232
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,260
I'll do it right away.

233
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,430
Tell me.

234
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,569
Why did you insist on being transferred from the North?

235
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,390
Because of money.

236
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,339
After you arrived in Yingtian Fu,

237
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,300
why didn't you report to our office

238
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,770
and why did you go to find Wang Kegong first instead?

239
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,940
Because of money, too.

240
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,950
Let me give you a piece of good advice.

241
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,609
Go back

242
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,079
to the North at once.

243
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,190
I'm the only one who can

244
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,420
be the sergeant.

245
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,170
Got it.

246
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,320
I'll leave at once.

247
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,590
[Investigation Bureau]

248
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,180
My Lord.

249
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,990
I'm back.

250
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,840
My Lord.

251
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,610
His Majesty has passed away.

252
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,510
Originally,

253
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,660
those who knew these secrets all died.

254
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,300
Now only you and I

255
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,620
know it.

256
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,200
Don't let the Prince of Yan

257
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,200
know this secret.

258
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,230
My Lord,

259
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,270
we work for the imperial family.

260
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,720
If we don't report it,

261
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,540
you will be beheaded.

262
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,860
Why did His Majesty hide this secret

263
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,690
by turning it into a riddle before he died?

264
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,030
His Majesty has passed away.

265
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,480
There must be some people fighting for the throne.

266
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,220
Whoever gets this thing will become the emperor.

267
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,570
Once this secret comes out,

268
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,540
there will be continuous wars and turmoil, and many people will die.

269
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,020
This blood debt

270
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,330
would be on both of us.

271
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,070
I chose a simple task

272
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,560
for myself.

273
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,010
I chose

274
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,240
a difficult task for you.

275
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,920
This thing

276
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,950
is called Yuming Lock.

277
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,360
The meaning of it

278
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,360
is to guard a place day and night without sleeping.

279
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,520
Guard the Ming Dynasty.

280
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,500
My Lord, you...

281
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,620
I've been keeping the secret of the Yuming Lock

282
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,520
for ten years.

283
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,780
Now,

284
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,290
I must hand the Yuming Lock to His Majesty

285
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,940
to end this war.

286
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,980
Isn't this Lu Yulin, the guard of the imperial prison?

287
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,780
You're wearing this uniform,

288
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,090
and I almost didn't recognize you.

289
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,150
It's been ten years.

290
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,450
You've been promoted to chief commander.

291
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,280
Deputy commander.

292
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,240
If you have anything to say,

293
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,890
just say it.

294
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,050
I asked you to come here

295
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,870
just for one thing.

296
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,430
Please say it.

297
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,040
Where did Song Heming's only son,

298
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,140
Song Zhen go?

299
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,180
The guilty official Song Heming's case files

300
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,580
can be found in the file storeroom of the imperial prison.

301
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,370
If you want them,

302
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,190
I can give them to you anytime.

303
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,530

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,970

is a guilty official.

306
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,130
Song Zhen

307
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,740
is the descendant of a guilty official.

308
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,060
If you can't find that child,

309
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,780
maybe he can

310
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,070
escape the disaster.

311
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,140
Now you are

312
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,570
already a dead person.

313

Give me the Yuming Lock.

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,240

315
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,740
How did you know about it?

316
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,580
I'm not the only one who wants to

317
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,530
get the Yuming Lock.

318
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,520

Because of money?

347
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,790
Yes.

348
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,150
It was not easy for me to come to Yingtian Fu.

349
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,150
It costed a lot of money to arrange everything.

350
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,930
Lu, give me a chance

351
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,420
and let me earn some money back.

352
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
I’ll play a few rounds with you.

353
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,020
If I offended you just now,

354
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,310
just take it as an apology.

355
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,180
No need.

356
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,260
Excuse me, gentlemen.

357
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,620
Go on. Go on.

358
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,910
I'm Wang Chongxi.

359
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,300
My father is Wang Kegong.

360
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,710
If you're here to gamble,

361
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,740
we welcome you

362
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,470
to join us.

363
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,700
If you're here to talk about work,

364
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,620
please leave.

365
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,660
Don't worry, Young Master.

366
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,340
We came here

367
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,590
just to have fun with the gambling.

368
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,620
To have fun with the gambling.

369
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,660
Sure.

370
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,480
Come on, sir.

371
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,870
Place your bets.

372
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,390
Welcome.

373
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,310
Place your bets.

374
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,980
Come on. What are you waiting for?

375
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,280
Come on.

376
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,980
-Place your bets. -Place your bets.

377
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,340
Place your bets.

378
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,120
Come on.

379
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,020
Han.

380
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,980
Shake it.

381
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:18,940
Let me do it.

382
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,270
Give it to me. Let me shake it.

383
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,220
Done?

384
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,910
Yes.

385
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,900
Remove your hands after placing your bets.

386
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,500
OK.

387
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,240
OK. Remove our hands after placing our bets.

388
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,820
This...

389
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm so unlucky.

390
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,420
Why did I lose the first round?

391
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,990
Lu,

392
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,060
you're lucky.

393
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,880
Congratulations.

394
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,120
Sorry, everyone.

395
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,900
It's okay.

396
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,740
Come on. Again.

397
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,540
It's the first round.

398
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,180
-Again. Again. -Again.

399
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,530
Come on.

400
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,120
Continue to place your bets. Come on.

401
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,580
Come on.

402
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,580
I don't believe that I can't win.

403
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,180
Lu.

404
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,660
Come on.

405
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,850
-Sir. -Place your bets.

406
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,490
I lost again.

407
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,430
I won again.

408
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,300
Sorry.

409
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,420
It's okay.

410
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,260
It's okay.

411
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,720
It's okay.

412
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,220
Continue to place your bets.

413
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,340
Come on. Continue to place your bets.

414
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,790
Let's enjoy the gambling.

415
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,060
Place more bets.

416
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,020
Lu.

417
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,020
Come on.

418
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,030
Gosh!

419
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,330
Congratulations.

420
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,570
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,360
Today,

422
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,340
I, Wang Chongxi, am the host.

423
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,280
I lost on purpose.

424
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,430
However...

425
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,610
Mr. Lu.

426
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,850
Mr. Li.

427
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,450
One of you shook the dice,

428
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,560
and the other won continuously.

429
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,320
How did you do that?

430
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,830
Young Master,

431
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,780
you seem to imply that

432
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,860
we cheated.

433
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,580
Exactly.

434
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,380
How about this?

435
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,100
How about you ask someone else to shake the dice for this round?

436
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,740
Yes, ask someone else to do it.

437
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,650
Yes.

438
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,740
Ask someone else to shake the dice.

439
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,620
Yes.

440
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,080
Okay.

441
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,250
Continue to place your bets.

442
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,290
Come on.

443
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,700
Come on. Put a bet.

444
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,490
This is my bet.

445
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:42,950
This is my bet.

446
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,810
It's ancestral?

447
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:45,670
It's mine.

448
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,710
Gentlemen, hurry up.

449
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,650
Let's place more bets.

450
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,530
Come on.

451
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,910
Place your bets.

452
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,610
Put more bets here.

453
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,110
Mr. Chen.

454
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,620
Place your bets.

455
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,110
Place your bets.

456
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,660
Yeah.

457
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,600
Come on.

458
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,660
Shake it.

459
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:57,940
Come on.

460
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,320
Place your bets.

461
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,410
Wait.

462
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,760
We can't

463
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,990
be framed for cheating without any compensation.

464
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,700
Young Master.

465
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,720
Do you dare to

466
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,290
place more bets?

467
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,660
If I lose again,

468
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,790
I'll run naked in this garden.

469
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,540
You, too.

470
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,370
Do you have the guts?

471
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,290
We won't lose.

472
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,270
Deal.

473
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,410
Those who lose should run naked.

474
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,690
Deal.

475
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,750
Come on.

476
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:29,820
Come on.

477
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,240
Don't worry.

478
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,620
We won't lose.

479
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,420
That's right.

480
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,590
We won't lose.

481
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,420
Look.

482
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,330
Open it. Whose number is bigger?

483
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,100
Wait.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,480
There are no bets for us to place here.

485
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,260
There are only five dice inside.

486
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,580
How is that possible?

487
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,940
Five dice.

488
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,050
Five dice.

489
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,410
Just five.

490
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,980
Do you dare to make a bet?

491
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,640
Sure.

492
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,430
Sure.

493
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,500
Those who don't dare to make a bet

494
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,370
are losers.

495
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,590
This...

496
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,740
There are only five dice indeed.

497
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
Where is the sixth die?

498
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,350
Okay.

499
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,350
Where is the die?

500
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,410
Where is that die?

501
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,740
Why are there only five dice?

502
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,220
How come there are only five dice?

503
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,060
What are you waiting for?

504
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,970
Look for it.

505
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,670
Look for the die.

506
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,740
Where is the sixth die?

507
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,540
Check under the table.

508
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,000
Go away.

509
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,940
It's not there.

510
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,980
Where is the sixth die?

511
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,730
Where is it?

512
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,660
Search the floor.

513
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:26,980
There.

514
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,020
It's not down there, either.

515
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,940
Why are there only five dice?

516
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,870
That's strange.

517
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,700
Young Master, will you take off all your clothes indoors and then come out,

518
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,630
or take off your clothes here and run naked directly?

519
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,840
I'm afraid that

520
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,280
even though I dare to take off my clothes,

521
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,550
you won't dare to look at me.

522
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,130

I don't want to see that.

Mr. Li.

I'm here to deliver night snacks.

I'm sorry.

Ma'am, spare my life.

Why is she sitting there?

Doesn't it taste good?

545
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,300
This wine

doesn't smell like alcohol.

547
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,190
It smells like the fragrance of flowers.

550
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,140
It doesn't taste

spicy.

552
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,470

It seems you want to drink it very much.

remind me of an old friend.

582
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,660
Is the old friend you mentioned

583
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,950
a Brocade-clad Guard?

584
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,860
When we fought at war in the North,

585
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,180
the Night Scouts we sent to the front line for reconnaissance

586
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,610
would set up a trap like this.

587

00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,120
The Prince of Yan

589
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,680
thinks highly of them.

590
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,100
Their job is to spy on the military information,

591
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,110
assassinate the enemy's generals

592
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,370
and transport emergency documents.

593
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,410
Thus, they can't stop working at night.

594
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,050
So they're named

595
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,400
Night Scouts.

596
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,290

the Prince of Yan's Night Scouts have entered the mansion?

598

My son did this.

599

Your temper

600
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,590
is also like my old friend's.

601
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Is your father

602
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,600
also a Brocade-clad Guard?

603
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,690
My father,

Lu Yulin,

605
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,100
is also a Brocade-clad Guard.

606
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,650
Our Wang Family's temple is small,

607
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,420
and it can't accommodate a distinguished guest like you, Mr. Lu.

608
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,550
Bye.

609
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,050
She will wake up in three days.

610
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,140
After she wakes up,

611
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,340
you'll be dead already.

612
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,000
Wait, Ma'am.

613
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,420
How about you kill me in another way?

614
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,350
If I don't die in three days,

615
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,600
I'll ruin your plan.

616
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,810
You will die.

617
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,060
Are you so sure?

618
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,450
I have experience.

619
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:12,930
Ma'am.

620
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,860
Ma'am.

621
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,590
Ma'am. Ma'am.

622
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,800
Ma'am.

623
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,830
There is a gap left by me

624
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,250
on the wall of the western yard.

625
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,700
After you finish,

626
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,970
go out from that gap.

627
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,140
No wonder you are good at gambling.

628
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,860
Have you learned acrobatics

629
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,430
or been a thief before?

630
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,420
Detective Lu.

631
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,150
I've been looking for you.

632
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,970
I have to tell you something.

633
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,980
What is it?

634
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,340
There's an assassin.

635
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,790
Lord Li, don't let her escape.

636
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,580
Her martial arts skills are good.

637
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,880
Catch her! Don't let her escape!

638
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,090
How come they fell out of my clothes?

639
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,110
I lost the chance of the trade.

640
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,950
But luckily,

641
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,430
beautiful jade, you're still here.

642
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,440
Are you okay?

643
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,750
The assassin hurt her shoulder.

644
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,850
Search carefully.

645
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,260
Okay.

646
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,760
Let’s go.

647
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:42,910
Li.

648
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,620
Did you hear anything?

649
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,520
Here's the thing.

650
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,600
Just now, I told Lu Zheng

651
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,450
not to wander around at midnight.

652
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,760
Something is lost in this mansion.

653
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,620
It's hard to explain clearly.

654
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,570
Is there a thief?

655
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,410
I don't know.

656
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,290
As soon as this man entered the mansion,

657
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,360
his whereabouts have been mysterious.

658
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,530
He even went to my father's study.

659
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,420
I suspect Lu Zheng

660
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:09,950
is a thief.

661
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,670
Wang,

662
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,200
if you need my help,

663
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,590
just say it.

664
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,190
Li,

665
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,510
I've offended you before.

666
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,080
I thought you and Lu Zheng

667
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,200
colluded with each other.

668
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,420
Guards.

669
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,620
Escort Mr. Li

670
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,400
back to his room.

671
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,560
Let me do it.

672
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,760
This way, please.

673
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,750
Li,

674
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,840
the jade in your hand

675
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:44,990
looks familiar.

676
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,080
My father also confiscated a similar one

677
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,570
from the royal family of Northern Yuan.

678
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,230
I wonder yours...

679
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,360
Mine is...

680
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,610
Sir.

681
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:54,820
Well...

682
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,140
Lu Zheng from the Brocade-clad Guards

683
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,470
is sneaking around in the garden.

684
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,200
Really?

685
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:00,930
Yes.

686
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:01,750
Li,

687
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:02,650
excuse me for my leaving.

688
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,670
I really wronged you.

689
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:19,500
Otherwise...

690
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:29,960
Don't shout.

691
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,810
Ma'am, spare my life.

692
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,530
It's you.
