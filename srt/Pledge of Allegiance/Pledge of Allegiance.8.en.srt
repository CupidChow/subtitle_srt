Got it. Don't worry.

What did he say?

109
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,350
Show some respect to the leader.

110
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,680
Otherwise,

111
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,690
wait for me to get it out and see for yourself.

112

Something is wrong.

113

What's wrong?

114

everything is fine.

120

But I'm the wrong one.

122

126
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,040
he saw that

127
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,890
you came with me when I took up my assingment.

128
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,710
He was not satisfied

129
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,160
with your performance.

130
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,390
What's wrong with me?

131
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,390
You didn't even sit on the sedan chair.

132
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,780
You walked to the courthouse with your own feet.

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,840
You're the wife of the Sergent.

134
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,170
You're not a countryside girl who came to the city to get married.

135
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,390
The courthouse has read the document.

136
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,620
They know I can't fake it.

137
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,750
Don't talk back.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,410
Why don't you hire servants in our house?

139
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,740
Maids, cooks, and charwomen...

140
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,370
Where are they?

141
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,060
You let the Sergent

142
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,680
sweep the floor, wash the clothes and cook all by himeself?

143
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
How can a Sergent live such a poor life?

144
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,340
We need to spend money hiring these people?

145
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,000
These small points are the easiest parts to see through.

146
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,550
Those Brocade-clad Guards are all smart.

147
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,210
I have no money.

148
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,600
No money?

149
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,420
I'm so sorry.

150
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Maid, cook, and charwomen...

151
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,580
You need to do their jobs all by yourself.

152
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,420
You want me to be your charwoman?

153
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,160
Calm down.

154
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,570
Li Dongfang asked you to do this.

155
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,150
Also,

156
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,540
And...

157
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,750
And...

158
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,360
Li Dongfang

159
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,170
think you look unhappy all day

160
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,200
as if everyone owes you money.

161
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,280
You have to change.

162
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,660
With this expression on your face,

163
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,340
you'll be caught on the street by Brocade-clad Guards.

164
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,930
Not to mention pretend to be the wife of Sergent.

165
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,980
You look like there are words on your face saying

166
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,350
"I'm a traitor and I'm going to rebel."

167
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,080
Did Li Dongfang

168
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,260
really tell you these?

169
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,860
What he said is

170
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,060
worse than this.

171
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,350
I've made it very easy for you.

172
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,340
And I think he's right.

173
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,880
How can a Sergent's wife be like you?

174
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,950
I've never seen the wife of Sergent before.

175
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,560
I can teach you.

176
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,950
This is my strength.

177
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,450
So we are

178
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,640
a team.

179
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,010
Wu Tang team.

180
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,060
Wu Tang team?

181
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,360
Sounds like a team working in a bathhouse.

182
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,020
It's decided then.

183
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,740
I'll teach you how to work in a bathhouse.

184
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,060
No.

185
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,960
I'll teach you how to become a wife of Sergent.

186
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:38,860
High five and that's an agreement.

187
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,500
Do you want me

188
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,110
to hire some servants for you?

189
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,230
I've thought about it. No need.

190
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,350
Do you want me to be your charwoman?

191
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,720
I'll do everything.

192
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,470
Do you want me to smile at you?

193
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,980
I suddenly feel that as the wife of Sergent,

194
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,570
you're more dignified if you don't smile.

195
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,270
Cases of Li Dongfang as the Sergent of Brocade-clad Guard,

196
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,130
are detailed documents

197
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,700
saving in the lieutenant.

198
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,620
So,

199
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,210
you must remember all of those.

200
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,230
In the 25th year of Hong Wu,

201
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,300
The Mus rebelled.

202
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,700
The daughter of Mu Jinggao

203
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,520
carried the method of making An Nan firearms,

204
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,130
fled from the Imperial prison to Ying Chang Road and turned to Northern Yuan.

205
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,710
The case was handed over to the Northern Investigation Bureau by Nanjing.

206
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,510
Sergent Li Dongfang

207
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,390
was ordered to kill the daughter of Mu Jinggao.

208
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,910
Got it?

209
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,910
To be honest,

210
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,220
based on my experience of deceiving people,

211
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,930
all of these are not enough.

212
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,040
I need to summarize Li Dongfang's personality.

213
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,420
Knowing him from his inside to his outside,

214
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,180
and then becoming the real Li Dongfang from my head to toe.

215
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,750
Of course.

216
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,260
I'm not only

217
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
need a good memory,

218
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,070
but also my excellent acting skills.

219
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,580
Remember what I'm going to say.

220
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,480
Li Dongfang's good friends in Jinan Office are

221
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,050
Sergent Gao Tiejun,

222
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,880
Sergent Hu Jingyi,

223
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,780
Detective Wang Zhijian.

224
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,070
Gao Tiejun,

225
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,320
Hu Jingyi

226
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,550
What are you looking at?

227
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,410
The way Sergent hides silver

228
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,000
is really special.

229
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,970
Aren't you afraid of hurting your feet?

230
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,850
This is for you.

231
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,980
You need to learn how to walk like a Sergent's wife.

232
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,910
You have to do this.

233
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,430
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

234
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,910
You think the Yingtian Prefecture only has flat and smooth stone roads?

235
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,290
I racked my brains to come up with this.

236
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,070
This is the only way to make it quick.

237
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,400
I quit.

238
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,030
Learning artial arts is easier than this.

239
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,580
You just want me to walking strangely

240
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,600
and faking a smile.

241
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,650
Sure.

242
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,790
If Mr. Li asks,

243
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,020
don't say I didn't teach you.

244
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,710
You're wasting things.

245
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,610
It seems that Lord Sergent

246
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,630
is really good at sewing.

247
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,040
Whoever marries Lord Sergent and becoming his wife

248
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,940
must be blessed in the past and future.

249
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,510
I'm flattered.

250
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,140
But I just analyzed,

251
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,870
Sergent of the north cold place

252
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,370
is really an official.

253
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,660
But after coming to the capital,

254
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,250
it's nothing.

255
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,290
You're right.

256
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,920
There are too many dignitaries in the capital.

257
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,450
So, the most important quality of Li Dongfang

258
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,160
is

259
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,560
his integrity.

260
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,780
His wife Shutang

261
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,960
has some power

262
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,320
in the official of north.

263
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,030
So the second feature of him

264
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,300
is that he was afraid of his wife.

265
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,570
I'm thinking...

266
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,960
Sewing things

267
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,000
like this,

268
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,460
I'll do from now on.

269
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,300
It's my pleasure to serve you.

270
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,050
But at ordinary times,

271
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,390
I have to act as a Brocade-clad Guard in the courthouse.

272
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,349
So the sweeping and washing work...

273
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,880
Don't look at me like that.

274
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm just discussing with you.

275
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,500
If Mr. Li’s mission is delayed

276
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,579
because of these chores,

277
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,500
that would be the worst.

278
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,190
What do you mean?

279
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,860
We're a fake couple.

280
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,760
Indeed we're fake,

281
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,270
but our life together

282
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,340
has to be real.

283
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:47,990
How about this?

284
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,050
Let's do this:

285
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,250
we use single-day and even-day to arrange those things.

286
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,120
Single-days, you do those chore.

287
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,330
Even-days will be my turn.

288
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Then today...

289
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,430
Today is a single-day.

290
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,530
Tomorrow?

291
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,780
Tomorrow is the first day of next month,

292
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,020
it is also a single-day.

293
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,440
Thank you.

294
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,560
You...

295
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,910
You only know sleeping.

296
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,970
What's going on?

297
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,620
It's not hard.

298
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,270
I did all these.

299
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:57,990
Let's go.

300
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,540
Please show mercy.

301
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,100
Let's go.

302
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,910
Take our clothes back.

303
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,650
Okay.

304
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,610
I'll cook for you later.

305
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,530
Eat.

306
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,050
I'm really good at cooking.

307
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:29,900
Eat.

308
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,680
What are you thinking?

309
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,150
How much did you pay those two charwomen?

310
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,260
One tael...

311
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,510
There were no charwomen.

312
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,410
You are really good at cooking.

313
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,410
How much did you pay them?

314
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,430
One tael.

315
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,900
Didn't you say you have no money?

316
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,780
I...

317
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,310
Don't move.

318
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,090
Someone is watching us.

319
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,370
Li Dongfang's experience

320
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,820
and the name of your colleague,

321
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,670
do you remember them all?

322
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,270
No.

323
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,710
Are you worried about me?

324
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,480
People in the Investigation Bureau of the capital

325
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,200
really like to fight with sects.

326
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,300
Lu Yulin and Si Xiangnan

327
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,070
will try their best to win you over.

328
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,010
They will also try to find everything about you.

329
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,450
Because

330
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,090
you came from the north.

331
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,570
And remember,

332
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,560
After pushing your hands as the salute,

333
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,780
remember to fold your hands in the lower abdomen.

334
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,100
Why?

335
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,970
It's a secret code used by Night Scouts to meet secretly with each other.

336
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,680
It means heart-to-heart.

337
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,830
This is the snacks

338
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,230
charwoman prepared for you to eat on the way.

339
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:16,980
Okay.

340
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,030
Li Wu.

341
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,750
Who?

342
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm investigating a man called Li Wu.

343
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,050
Have you heard of this name?

344
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
[Investigation Bureau]

345
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,850
Greetings, Sergent.

346
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,870
Please wait.

347
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,470
Let's go.

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,910
These are the rebels we just caught.

349
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,220
They have criminal records in the Imperial prison.

350
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,840
My indicators for this month have been completed.

351
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,630
Would you like to take two with you

352
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,690
to make up the numbers.

353
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,910
Lord Li.

354
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,790
Greetings, Lord Li.

355
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,220
Lord Li.

356
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,020
It's getting late.

357
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,400
Please.

358
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,170
Lord, this way please.

359
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,350
Lord Li.

360
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,280
Lord Li.

361
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,760
I heard that when you were in the north,

362
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,860
you solved plenty of mysteries.

363
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,150
For example, the Nine-head Corpse case.

364
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,080
Tell us about it.

365
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,630
The Nine-head Corpse case.

366
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,470
You can guess first.

367
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,360
Where were these nine heads?

368
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,630
I heard they were on the ship of the water transport wharf.

369
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,540
Wrong.

370
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,000
The nine heads

371
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,610
were in the deck.

372
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,590
It is said the water transport envoy had a dream about the boat being flooded by water.

373
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,760
So he ordered a search.

374
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,110
That's how he found the heads.

375
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,180
Wrong again.

376
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,000
The boat building

377
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,410
was too haste.

378
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,420
Besides, the quality of an official's boat

379
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,540
had poor quality.

380
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,000
I think this person

381
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,450
can only enter or leave.

382
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,480
What's the name of this report?

383
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,690
Report?

384
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,890
On the first day of every month,

385
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,760
all the officials in the courthouse

386
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,990
have to make their reports to the deputy commander

387
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,580
about what they've seen or heard

388
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,990
and what they've been thinking in a month.

389
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,250
It is

390
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,930
snitching

391
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,540
to the deputy commander

392
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,150
Your Lord is wise.

393
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,690
My lord.

394
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,490
This way, please.

395
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,250
Your Lord.

396
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,200
Li Dongfang.

397
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,150
Yes.

398
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,970
Get this done.

399
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:37,970
Yes.

400
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,240
Let's talk somewhere else.

401
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,100
I

402
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,810
have yet to ask your name.

403
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,090
Si Xiangnan.

404
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,340
You are so kind.

405
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,470
Like a compass always pointing to the capital in the south.

406
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,640
Wonderful.

407
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,720
According to my family book, my surname was Sima.

408
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,640
Later, my father followed the late emperor.

409
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,010
The late emperor thought Sima was hard to pronounce.

410
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,230
So he gave the last name Si to our family.

411
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,450
The pharse "loyal to the country"

412
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,260
is engraved on your family book.

413
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,810
What happened

414
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,560
to that one was always "loyal to the country"?

415
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,410
I...

416
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,740
should slap myself.

417
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,240
You should.

418
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,570
Get up.

419
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,680
You don't even know how to flatter me.

420
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,240
Let's go.

421
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,630
Sorry.

422
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,330
One.

423
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,080
Two.

424
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,440
Three.

425
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,090
Four.

426
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,940
Five.

427
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,580
Six.

428
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,230
Seven.

429
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,270
Eight.

430
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,300
Bad comes from the mouth.

431
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,780
Nine.

432
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,840
Lord. Ji is a lesson.

433
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,340
He forgot he had only one head.

434
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,490
How dare he mentioned the Nine-head.

435
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,940
I heard that when you were in the North,

436
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,760
you solved plenty of mysteries.

437
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,060
For example, the Nine-head Corpse case.

438
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,150
So, from now on,

439
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,410
you must be careful with your words and actions.

440
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,100
Don't gossip about the six ministries.

441
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,590
Sit down.

442
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,450
Didn't you say

443
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,530
the ships made by the Industry Ministry couldn't work?

444
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,170
I've never mentioned it.

445
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,370
If you never told me,

446
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,900
how would I know?

447
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,630
The ship building

448
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,130
was too haste.

449
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,070
Besides, the quality of an official's boat

450
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,340
had poor quality.

451
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,480
The officials' ships

452
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,380
were made by the Industry Ministry.

453
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,090
If you question the boats,

454
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,150
you're questioning the Ministry of Industry.

455
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,100
And you're questioning His Majaesty's decisions.

456
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,560
Careless talk leads to trouble.

457
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,690
You can say,

458
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,190
people can listen, too.

459
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,920
Please forgive me.

460
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,610
[Log]

461
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,850
Me, myself

462
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,670
enjoy giving people more choices.

463
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,720
I really hope

464
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,800
someday,

465
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,170
there will be someone giving me more choices.

466
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,860
Thank you a lot, my lord.

467
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,150
I understood.

468
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,810
I wanted you to adjust for a few more days.

469
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,120
But the rebels' case

470
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,410
is a rare opportunity.

471
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,930
I want you

472
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,060
to get into your position in advance.

473
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,000
I

474
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,320
will be at your disposal.

475
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,140
The rule of the Brocade-clad Guards working is

476
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,380
two people in a group to work together.

477
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,770
In this way,

478
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,810
they can take care of each other.

479
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,460
Who do you want me to team up with?

480
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,530
Lu Zheng.

481
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:05,880
My lord.

482
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,570
Li Dongfang, look.

483
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,060
This pot of red maple

484
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,130
is

485
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
safe when it only cares about itself?

486
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,200
Or,

487
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,760
it is safer when it cares about the big picture?

488
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,280
I don't know about plants.

489
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,100
Xie Tanran is gone.

490
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,750
From now on,

491
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,960
you and Lu Zheng are partners.

492
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,000
I asked you to keep an eye on him.

493
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,380
Tell me what he did

494
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,340
every day.

495
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,870
Si Xiangnan wants me to work with Lu Zheng.

496
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,970
It's dangerous.

497
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,240
I have to find an excuse to refuse.

498
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,320
If you agree,

499
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,090
I have another thank you gift.

500
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,190
No matter what Lu Zheng will find out,

501
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,590
you'll always be Li Dongfang

502
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,710
when people ask me.

503
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,790
This old man knows everything.

504
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,470
How did he know?

505
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,190
Everyone has their own difficulties.

506
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,350
If everyone like to dig to the bottom

507
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
and find out the truth,

508
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,430
nobody can survive.

509
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,500
Yes.

510
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,060
Take this flower out.

512
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,160
Yes.

513
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,030
Left!

514
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,020
Don't let them get away!

515
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,380
Yes.

516
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,020
Catch him!

517
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:10,960
What are you praying for?

518
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,000
According to the official document from the courthouse,

519
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,120
from now on,

520
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,470
we two work together.

521
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,160
This is the Tiger Head Gate of the Imperial prison.

522
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,870
The late emperor of Hong Wu year burned the execution tools.

523
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,390
Then the Imperial prison stayed closed.

524
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,010
There is no one

525
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,450
in here right now.

526
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,060
Only ghosts wander around.

527
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,590
Really?

528
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,020
I'm just kidding.

529
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,220
Although the imperial prison is closed.

530
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,950
The file storeroom is still under use.

531
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,240
Inside are guarded

532
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,860
day and night.

533
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,860
The file storeroom

534
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,910
is a place storing log books and papers.

535
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,370
Log books are always be with Brocade-clad Guards.

536
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,030
If someone dies,

537
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,930
the body goes inito coffin,

538
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,720
the log book goes in here.

539
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,510
People whose log books store in here

540
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,510
try to sneak in all the time.

541
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,560
They want to steal the papers.

542
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,700
They want to destroy the evidence.

543
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,300
If he succeed,

544
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,880
his sins

545
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,850
will all be gone.

546
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,730
I want you to help me get into the file storeroom

547
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,470
to investigate someone

548
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,540
called Li Wu.

549
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,220
The papers relate to the year of Hong Wu...

550
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,830
[File Storeroom]

551
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,230
[Ten years ago]

552
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,000
Run!

553
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,530
Where

554
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,850
are you going?

555
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:34,900
Excuse me.

556
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,610
There's no Li Wu.

557
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,080
What?

558
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,080
There's no Li Wu's case file.

559
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,860
Search carefully.

560
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,700
There's no record of the case of Li Wu in the Hong Wu year.

561
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,820
If you don't believe,

562
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,910
find it yourself.

563
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,020
Let's go, Lord Lu.

564
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,460
If we lose any important document,

565
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,190
the Commander

566
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,100
will punish me.

567
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:36,350
Lord Lu.

568
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,220
We've checked the file storageroom and the case files.

569
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,670
I don't know

570
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,120
why are you still suspect of me?

571
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,480
I

572
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,290
have no reason

573
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,380
to suspect you anymore.

574
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:00,990
From now on,

575
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,620
you and I

576
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,740
can trust each other.
