00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,680
I want you to be my housekeeper

5
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,810
to cook and do the laundry for us.

6
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:43,810
Madam,

7
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,240
what do you think?

8
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,520
Go away.

9
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,120
You should thank me.

10
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,990
For what?

11
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,540
That day,

12
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,970
you were drunk at the Zuixian Tavern.

13
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,440
You woke up at the dock.

14
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,560
Coincidentally,

15
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,770
there was a cargo ship going back and forth between the north and here.

16
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,070
So I put you into a container,

17
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,190
and was going to ship you off.

18
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,760
Then why didn't you

19
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,710
banish me to Jinan?

20
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,340
Because I saw two stacks of cloth in your arms.

21
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000
One of them was green and the other was with patterns of flowers.

22
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Anyway,

23
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,510
you owe me a favor.

24
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,160
You really know how to blackmail others.

25
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,030
Tell me.

26
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,790
What do you want?

27
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,710
I want you to help me enter the file storeroom

28
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,000

It's faster in this way.

32
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,850
Do you know how to spell the two words of Song Heming?

33
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm illiterate.

34

You're illiterate?

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,790
How did you investigate that old case?

36
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,180
I...

37
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,610
was born in a remote place.

38
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,220
My family was poor.

39
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,529
It would be something uncommon if you were literate in our place.

40
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,040
That's why Lord Wang asked me to do this.

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,100

Have you found the log book?

No.

These are the spears of Ghost-faced Night Scouts.

The owner of this log book is Chen Jizhen.

In the imperial prison of the Hongwu period,

he was a sergeant on guard.

This is the autopsy document for Xie Kengran.

62

in the 25th year of the Hongwu period.

64

In the first month of the 25th year of the Hongwu period,

Cai Bocheng, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of War, died at home.

66

There was only this wound left on his body,

67
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,760
and it was caused by this spear.

68
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,460
The people who found his body

69
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,820
were Director Cao of the Ministry of War

70

and Li Yan, the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of War.

arriving at the dock of the canal.

93
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,990
I have to transport them to the north as soon as possible.

94

If this is delayed,

95
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,659
I will be beheaded.

96
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,840
If you don't delay it,

97
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,620
won't it also make you beheaded?

98
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,540
Keep your voice down.

99
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,100
What?

100
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,020
Is there

101
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,020
a Brocade-clad Guard eavesdropping on us around here?

102
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,030
Those idiots

103
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,990
can't find any clues about me.

104
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,470
If someone is really eavesdropping on us,

105
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,370
I'll be so embarrassed.

106
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,450
You Brocade-clad Guards in the capital

107
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,380
are too slow.

108
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,410
You're quite unique.

109
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,740
To pry into information,

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,790
you don't have to lean against a window to eavesdrop.

111
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,140
Use your imagination.

112
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,620
I just want to see what you've found out.

113
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,490
Whether you recorded it or made it up,

114
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,820
I'll know as soon as I read it.

115
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,380
I've figured out

116
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,030
what Director Cao has been doing lately.

117
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,580
He has a batch of goods

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,110
which have arrived at the dock of the canal.

119
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,830
And the goods will be delivered

120
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,360
to the north.

121
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,799
What did they say?

122
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,789
The officials who manage the dock of the canal

123
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,190
are also at the Court Entertainment Bureau tonight.

124
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,690
I've also heard that

125
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,640
the goods will be shipped the day after tomorrow.

126
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,100
What is written on the document

127
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,430
is grain transported to the capital by water.

128
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,600
This is the way we northerners do.

129
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,100
It's getting late.

130
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,420
I'm going to the dock of the canal.

131
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,180
Here,

132
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,430
I wish that you could complete your task as soon as possible.

133
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,650
Just see if I'm right.

134
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,150
Besides,

135
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,880
in the future when you go up to the roof and remove a tile, be careful.

136
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,020
Don't hurt your waist.

137
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,180
Hurry up!

138
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:34,890
The Brocade-clad Guards are here!

139
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,130
Stop!

140
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,190
Stop!

141
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,250
They're all here.

142
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,390
This is a secret report which Lu Zheng has just sent here.

143
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,740
At the dock of the canal,

144
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,920
he intercepted the munitions which Director Cao of the Ministry of War

145
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,470
was going to send to the Prince of Yan secretly.

146
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,630
The Night Scouts have just received the news, too.

147
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:57,850
Congratulations, My Lord.

148
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,250
This is all your idea.

149
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,540
Your contributions can't be ignored.

150
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,030
It's my pleasure

151
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,330
to work for you, My Lord.

152
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,370
Not for me,

153
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,730
but for the emperor

154
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,280
and the country.

155
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,540
Recently,

156
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,000
I've been using the fragrant reseda oil

157
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,120
and bamboo oil on my hair.

158
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,980
They are very useful.

159
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,160
There is no wrinkle

160
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,780
on your face at all.

161
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,450
What kind of lotion do you use?

162
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,910
It's not lotion.

163
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,540
I use hosta plantaginea powder

164
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,850
and the peach blossom powder sold by the Siqing Store.

165
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,340
And...

166
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,990
And...

167
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,840
Look.

168
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,700
I know you're a fake noble lady once I look at you.

169
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,610
And safflower powder,

170
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,410
mustache-dyeing powder

171
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,120
and pomegranate flower juice.

172
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,830
Pomegranate flower juice...

173
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,430
What else?

174
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,250
Can I become an official's wife if I memorize these?

175
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,180
Officials' wives

176
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,350
all like to compare with each other.

177
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,460
If you always talk about these things,

178
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,060
they will think that you are one of them,

179
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,880
and then they'll naturally be close to you.

180
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,850
Besides,

181
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,350
the way you clamp things with chopsticks is wrong.

182
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,370
Do it like this.

183
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,320
No, no.

184
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,300
It's okay.

185
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,610
You can throw hidden weapons so well.

186
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,040
It's not a problem for you to clamp something with chopsticks.

187
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,570
Let me teach you.

188
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,240
Come on. Let me teach you.

189
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,380
Come on.

190
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,690
Yes.

191
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,020
Hold them steadily. Do it like this.

192
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,390
Coming.

193
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,200
What's the rush?

194
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,600
Let's go.

195
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,530
Go to work.

196
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,180
Even chickens haven't got up yet at this time.

197
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,870
I've found that

198
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,890
there are rebels around the Ji'e Alley.

199
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,570
I want to see what other tricks

200
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,850
these rebels can use.

201
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,750
Hurry up.

202
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm not dressed properly yet.

203
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,560
Don't chase the swallow.

204
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,490
If you chase the swallow, it will fly high day by day.

205
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,170
If it flies high, it'll ascend the throne.

206
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,930
Who taught you this ballad?

207
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,560
He was wearing a bamboo hat.

208
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,490
I didn't see him clearly.

209
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,950
Take the money to buy some food.

210
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,770
Shut your mouth,

211
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,420
and tell your buddies

212
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,960
not to sing this ballad anymore.

213
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,100
If anyone sings it again,

214
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,020
the Brocade-clad Guards will catch him.

215
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,270
Don't chase the swallow.

216
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,100
It means no diminishing the power of imperial military governors.

217
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,820
If you chase the swallow, it will fly high day by day.

218
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
If it flies high, it'll ascend the throne.

219
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,930
It means that

220
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,860
if you diminish the power of imperial military governors

221
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,480
I will rebel and become the emperor.

222
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,030
You've changed.

223
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,130
Not only did you release him,

224
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,090
but also gave him money.

225
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,410
A kid like him

226
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,930
probably has no choice.

227
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,100
They were not born

228
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,070
in an official's family like me.

229
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,680
It was not money which I gave them,

230
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,260
but a choice.

231
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,770
Philanthropist Lu,

232
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,400
with that small sum of money you gave him,

233
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,980
he would probably just choose to eat steamed sponge cakes or jujube cakes.

234
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,900
[Yi Gate]

235
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Do you know what happened these days?

236
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,310
If no one had testified for me,

237
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,450
and His Majesty had not pardoned me from the capital crime,

238
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,350
would you really have

239
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,940
kept avoiding me like this

240
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,040
until I die?

241
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,590
Are you really

242
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
that afraid of being implicated by me

243
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,280
and losing your position?

244
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,590
Tonight,

245
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,910
I treated the head of the secretariat to a drink.

246
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,620
I've worked hard for ten years.

247
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,550
Every step I took

248
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,370
was like walking on thin ice.

249
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,530
I finally got this position today.

250
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,740
After I got this position,

251
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,660
I realized

252
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,480
what I got

253
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,770
was no more than the one tenth of what I had lost.

254
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,690
But all I have

255
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,930
is this position.

256
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,180
The relationship between officials is not reliable.

257
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,880
There are no brothers

258
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,550
or friends in the official circles.

259
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,750
There are no fathers or sons in the official circles.

260
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,720
Everyone is

261
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,230
fighting for

262
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,750
for his own life.

263
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,820
I've finally got this position.

264
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,310
I won't let myself throw it away because of anyone.

265
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,470
This mansion

266
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,160
is actually a haunted house.

267
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,180
Don't talk nonsense.

268
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,230
It sounds so horrible.

269
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,900
A haunted house?

270
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,130
No wonder.

271
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,660
The food in the kitchen

272
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,830
are always missing.

273
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,930
It's not haunted.

274
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,220
Lord Lu came out to look for food in the middle of the night as he was hungry.

275
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,060
It wasn't me.

276
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,000
You know it very clearly whether this house is haunted.

277
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,580
During the Hongwu period,

278
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,080
the property of the Shen Family's magnate was confiscated by the Brocade-clad Guards.

279
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,580
Except for his youngest son,

280
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,280
everyone else

281
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,250
was hung to death in this mansion.

282
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,790
It is said that

283
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,140
the Shen Family ended up miserably

284
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,400
because of the bad geomancy of this mansion.

285
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,030
Tell me

286
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,230
how bad the geomancy is here.

287
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,790
In the past,

288
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,160
there was only a parasol tree in this mansion.

289
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,580
There's the Chinese character of kou,

290
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,810
and there's the Chinese character of mu inside it.

291
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,310
They constitute the character kun.

292
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,590
It means being sleepy?

293
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,180
I'm sleepy now indeed.

294
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,330
It means being stranded.

295
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,630
So the descendants

296
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,510
planted a few trees in this mansion

297
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,160
and the problem was solved.

298
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,670
Madam, you're really smart.

299
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,140
What task did you two do today?

300
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,970
We were looking for a composer who created a ballad.

301
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,620
There's a ballad that has been spread widely lately.

302
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,370
What ballad is it?

303
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,870
Sing a ballad for me first.

304
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,100
I can only sing one ballad.

305
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:52,980
And

306
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,660
I can't remember it clearly.

307
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Don't chase the swallow.

308
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,450
If you chase the swallow, it will fly high day by day.

309
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,070
If it flies high, it'll ascend the throne.

310
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,500
This is not a song.

311
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,820
It should be called

312
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,660
a doggerel, and that's more suitable.

313
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,670
Madam,

314
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,750
it's not your first time to hear it?

315
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,830
It's my first time to hear it.

316
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,560
It's a little cold.

317
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll go in first.

318
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,270
You guys go on with the talk.

319
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,590
Colonel Li taught me

320
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,120
about that ballad.

321
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,270
Superficially, that ballad was created to build up the momentum for the Prince of Yan.

322
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,550
Actually,

323
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,610
it's a secret code for the Night  Scouts to meet each other secretly

324
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,660
so as to contact the people of the lower level.

325
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,640
However,

326
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,710
at least it proves that

327
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,970
you didn't lie to me.

328
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,390
I hate it the most when people lie to me.

329
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,380
These days,

330
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,720
Colonel Li hasn't contacted me.

331
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,260
I was worried that

332
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,940
something bad might have happened to him.

333
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,420
It can't be Li Dongfang

334
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,630
unless we've met a ghost.

335
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,140
Li Dongfang

336
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,520
is still buried in Mount Guanyin now.

337
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,810
If you want to listen to it,

338
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,280
why don't you go to our room to listen to it?

339
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,490
It's a nice day.

340
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,900
I came out for a walk.

341
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,120
I ate too much just now.

342
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:19,900
I...

343
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,630
Do you think

344
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,910
it's not enough to listen to it in the room,

345
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,370
and you prefer watching it here?

346
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,430
Why don't you wear a robe?

347
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,990
Put it on now!

348
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,060
Dear,

349
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,840
let's go back to our room and continue.

350
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,950
If he wants to listen here,

351
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,010
just let him listen here.

352
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,560
If he wants to watch it here,

353
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,690
just let him watch it here.

354
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,320
Goodbye.

355
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,300
If Lu Zheng finds out about it,

356
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,790
it'll be troublesome.

357
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,040
I'll sleep on the bed.

358
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,900
I can't sleep.

359
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,460
This won't do.

360
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,640
Lu Zheng doesn't think we're a real couple as he sees us.

361
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,300
We'll be exposed in front of the outsiders.

362
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,070
What should we do?

363
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,130
Let's sleep with each other.

364
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,560
I...

365
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,050
Don't.

366
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:33,980
No.

367
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,920
That's not good.

368
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,630
Didn't you want to sleep with me?

369
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,700
That's not what I meant.

370
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,650
You don't understand men.

371
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,700
Can I borrow your clothes?

372
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,600
Did you have a fight?

373
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,970
You've just bought a mansion

374
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,260
and you can't even afford a wardrobe now?

375
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,000
What's the difference between storing the clothes in a wardrobe

376
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:53,950
and in a room?

377
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,310
Get a wife as soon as possible.

378
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:00,880
Thanks.

379
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,750
It looks like Director Cao didn’t deal with the aftermath properly.

380
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,710
He left the delivery document for munitions on the cargo ship.

381
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,990
Lu Zheng will definitely follow the clues of confiscating

382
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,190
the munitions at the dock of the canal

383
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,240
to invesitage the officials who are connected with us.

384
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,420
Do you want me to kill Director Cao?

385
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,170
He has been exposed.

386
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,370
Lu Zheng will make a big fuss about him.

387
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,310
Go.

388
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,810
Find a scapegoat.

389
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,710
Wang Chongxi.

390
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
Okay. Let's do it in this way.

391
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,490
My Lord.

392
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,560
Lord Li.

393
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,010
My Lord.

394
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,630
I've come

395
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,130
to have a heart-to-heart talk with you again.

396
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,570
If you have anything to say, just say it.

397
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,030
Don't try to fawn on me.

398
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,020
If I only burn incense when I need help,

399
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,250
immortals

400
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
wouldn't bless me, right?

401
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,540
I should show

402
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,390
my sincerity at ordinary times.

403
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:10,940
Okay.

404
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,450
I accept your gift.

405
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,130
Thank you, My Lord.

406
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,770
You and Lu Zheng have been doing well lately.

407
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,910
I heard that you confiscated the rebels' munitions

408
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,880
at the dock of the canal.

409
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,080
His Majesty gave you three rewards in a row.

410
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,430
Many buddies

411
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,590
are willing to work with you.

412
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,300
How are you going to use that delivery document

413
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,930
for munitions which you've confiscated?

414
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,190
I have no idea,

415
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,080
so I've come to discuss with you.

416
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,830
Bring it here.

417
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,530
Let's do it together.

418
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,460
Do you have

419
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,640
a big card?

420
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,220
Whether it's big or not,

421
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,480
you'll know after you see it.

422
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,720
Lu Zheng has the delivery document for munitions.

423
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,960
Be patient, my lord.

424
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,170
I'll try to bring it to you.

425
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,330
[File Storeroom]

426
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:36,750
My Lord.

427
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,880
Ten years ago,

428
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,400
I failed to eliminate him.

429
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,800
I just want to see

430
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,630
what he looks like now.

431
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,270
My Lord,

432
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,630
I already went to look for Si Xiangnan

433
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,120
according to your request.

434
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,940
He must have some important evidence.

435
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,240
Listen.

436
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,200
What Si Xiangnan has

437
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,260
is definitely not physical evidence.

438
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,740
The stuff are lifeless,

439
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,610
but the people are alive.

440
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,120
Only those who are alive can tell on others.

441
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,560
I remember it now.

442
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,580
It's him.

443
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,430
Only when he comes out to tell on others

444
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,310
can this delivery document for munitions

445
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,460
cause bigger turbulence.

446
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,410
I had a few more drinks with the deputy minister yesterday.

447
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm late for the drinking today.

448
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,920
It's okay.

449
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,480
Don't drink too much.

450
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,390
If you die on the table,

451
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,510
your post will be occupied by someone else.

452
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,130
Tomorrow,

453
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,250
the Investigation Bureau will hold a banquet

454
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,500
to celebrate that

455
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,550
you solved the case of rebels smuggling munitions.

456
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,020
The officials who are above the rank of sergeant

457
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,110
can attend the banquet with their family.

458
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,000
It's not the time to drink.

459
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,200
I've also invited Lord Cao from the Ministry of War.

460
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,330
Don't worry.

461
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,200
This time,

462
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,020
I won't let you tear off the log book.

463
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,810
I've also invited some

464
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,060
officials from the Six Ministries.

465
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,340
You can use the delivery document for munitions in your hands

466
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,900
to investigate their background

467
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,600
and find the real rebels.

468
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,270
By the way,

469
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,350
ask Li Dongfang

470
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,040
to attend the banquet with his wife, too

471
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,420
Li Dongfang has contributed a lot.

472
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,070
I want to hand this case

473
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,160
over to him.

474
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,740
What do you mean?

475
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,110
You were once in charge of

476
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,840
the most important case.

477
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,960
That's enough.

478
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,540
Let him

479
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,260
deal with the rest of it.

480
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,120
Why?

481
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,270
No matter

482
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,820
what the result of the case is,

483
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,440
the one who is in charge of this case

484
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,010
will definitely die.

485
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,120
What did you say?

486
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,290
Since the first day he came,

487
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,670
I've helped him

488
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,490
so that he can

489
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,420
die for you.

490
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,510
On what ground can you make a decision for me?

491
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,320
I've made up my mind.

492
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,080
This is the affair of the Investigation Bureau.

493
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,960
You can't decide.

494
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,410
I'll

495
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,250
take my leave.

496
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,910
Li Dongfang has found out

497
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,680
where Wang Chongxi, the son of Wang Kegong, is.

498
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,760
He is hiding in the official dormitory of you and Li Dongfang.

499
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:36,980
What?

500
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,490
He didn't tell you?

501
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,510
Are you so reluctant

502
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,750
to stay with me alone?

503
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,560
No, don't say that.

504
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,710
Lu Zheng will be back soon.

505
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,570
What's wrong with you?

506
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,350
Lord Lu.

507
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,630
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,660
I apologize to you.

509
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,950
I'm late because of the chief commander.

510
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,480
Madam, you should eat first.

511
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,140
There's no need to wait for me.

512
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,980
I'm the guest.

513
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:37,800
It's okay.

514
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,790
This house belongs to the Lus.

515
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,130
We are the guests.

516
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,540
Besides, it's such a big mansion.

517
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,390
It's so good.

518
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,630
I’ll buy one when I’m rich.

519
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,560
Then I wish that you could

520
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,070
get promoted and rich.

521
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,810
The Investigation Bureau
will hold a banquet tomorrow

522
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,460
to celebrate that

523
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,260
we solved the case of rebels smuggling munitions.

524
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,050
The officials who are above the rank of sergeant can attend it with their family.

525
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,980
The invitation letters have been sent out.

526
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,890
If it requires a rank above sergeant,

527
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,000
it has nothing to do with me.

528
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,610
The chief commander specially asked me to

529
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,630
invite you and your wife to the banquet.

530
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,840
Thanks for the chief commander's invitation.

531
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,120
My wife has just said

532
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,060
she wants to play mahjong with other officials' wives.

533
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,470
This time, some officials from the Six Ministries will attend, too.

534
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,900
We can use the delivery document for munitions

535
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,040
to catch

536
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,260
all the rebels.

537
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,750
Then...

538
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,810
this is a good thing.

539
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,650
If

540
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,810
you have other news,

541
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,489
we can refuse to attend it.

542
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,020
If we want to catch the rebels,

543
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,469
this is not the only way.

544
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,469
Actually, I don't want to attend

545
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,400
this banquet which might put me in danger.

546
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,210
But there is no other good way now, right?

547
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,440
Lord Lu,

548
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,280
are you not feeling well?

549
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,710
I drank too fast.

550
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:14,870
Madam,

551
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,540
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,710
Sergeant.

553
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,310
What's wrong?

554
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,590
The wife of the deputy commander wants to invite your wife

555
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,190
to go around the Danfeng Street together.

556
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,700
Tell Her Ladyship to wait for a moment.

557
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,550
I'll be right there.

558
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,460
I'll take my leave.

559
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,870
It's late.

560
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm afraid the shops are closed.

561
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,290
Don't worry, Madam.

562
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,260
I

563
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,480
have arranged everything.

564
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,220
Look.

565
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,500
Welcome, Lady of Deputy Commander

566
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,060
and all other ladies.

567
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,420
[Zhang's Silk Store]

568
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,760
Ladies, please.

569
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,920
Lady of Deputy Commander. Lady of Sergeant.

570
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,560
Please.

571
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,770
Sir, do you have any new fabric? Take me to see it.

572
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,710
Madam, this way please.

573
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,600
Ladies, do you like any fabric?

574
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,740
I have a batch of new goods transferred through waterways.

575
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I don't know if they'll be good enough for you.

576
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,610
Mr. Hua, take the ladies there to take a look.

577
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,420
Yes.

578
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,510
Ladies, please.

579
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,530
Mr. Zhang.

580
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,010
Has the fabric I ordered arrived?

581
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,610
Orangey-red or purplish-red.

582
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,570
Choose it for me.

583
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:17,600
Major.

584
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,040
Colonel Zhang.

585
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,730
When Li Dongfang and I first came to Nanjing,

586
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,940
someone tried to assassinate us.

587
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,560
The one who tried to assassinate us

588
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,230
is a member of the Night Scouts.

589
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
You mean

590
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,270
there is a traitor among the Night Scouts

591
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,490
of Yingtian Prefecture?

592
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,430
Whether there is a traitor

593
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,850
among the Night Scouts of Yingtian Prefecture,

594
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,360
you should know that very well.

595
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,300
You're the head of all the Night Scouts of Yingtian Prefecture.

596
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,670
You suspect me?

597
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,870
I dare not.

598
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,660
Where is Li Dongfang now?

599
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,200
I don't know.

600
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,810
Go back and tell Li Dongfang

601
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,620
if there really is a traitor among the Night Scouts

602
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,790
of Yingtian Prefecture,

603
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,490
I will give his head to Colonel Li.

604
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,490
By the way,

605
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,290
you are Colonel Li's beloved subordinate.

606
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,450
I can't give you orders.

607
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,800
But there is something now,

608
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,420
and I don't have a suitable candidate.

609
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,130
Hearing what you said,

610
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,530
I should investigate

611
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,310
the people who work for me.

612
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,740
I wonder whether

613
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,610
I can ask you to do the task.

614
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,010
I'm willing to listen to your orders.

615
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,950
You want me to catch Wang Chongxi

616
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,550
before the Brocade-clad Guards do so?

617
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,780
Wang Chongxi is the most likely suspect to have colluded with Yan.

618
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,990
The Investigation Bureau

619
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,570
is going to use him to tell on other officials.

620
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,290
Kill him,

621
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,810
and put the delivery document for munitions on him.

622
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,490
Then our people will be able to escape.

623
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,410
We don't know who is the traitor that has hurt Li Dongfang.

624
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,590
I don't think we should act rashly.

625
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,810
I have to ask Li Dongfang first.

626
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,590
Don't let other Night Scouts know that

627
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,310
you've taken up the post in place of Li Dongfang.

628
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,600
Otherwise, they will kill you.

629
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,620
So,

630
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,730
I have to kill Wang Chongxi first.

631
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,610
You care about me?

632
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:32,480
Yes.

633
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,420
If I catch Wang Chongxi,

634
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,580
and hand him over to the Investigation Bureau,

635
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,930
I will be rewarded.

636
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,320
What are the benefits for me if I hand him over to you?

637
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,620
This is the most valuable

638
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,890
and the most precious thing I have.

639
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,060
Take it.

640
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,400
Not enough?

641
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,430
I'll think of other ways tomorrow.

642
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,810
As a man,

643
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,610
why should I take a woman's hairpin?

644
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,940
To give it to my future wife?

645
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,160
Forget it.

646
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,870
I'll reluctantly

647
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,240
accept it.

648
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,340
You must be safe.

649
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,600
I will protect you.
