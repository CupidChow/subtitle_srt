1
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,570
"Latex"

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,148
What a timing!

3
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,518
Is that cosplay make-up?

4
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,507
Don't you dare call it cosplay make-up!

5
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,210
Jeong-su!

6
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:08,918
Turn off the music!

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,625
My clients worship me
after holding my hands once.

8
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:15,875
Funny how those who pay me believe in me

9
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,870
and those who work for me
don't believe in me!

10
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:20,171
You know what?

11
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,906
I am the crazy one here

12
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,679
because I've been helping you
run this place with my college degree.

13
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,000
Never mind, let's just have breakfast.

14
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,289
This one looks better.

15
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,390
- Zip it.
- Okay.

16
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,820
We've got thirty minutes left.

17
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:41,910
Got to ventilate this place after eating.

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,646
Gosh, what's with this hectic schedule?

19
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:49,351
I've just realized Naver makes managing
appointments so much easier in every way.

20
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:53,413
If I change the vacancy status to full,
people will think we’re full of clients!

21
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,851
Isn't too much IT rather bad
for our business?

22
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:06,632
Don't you think shaman's house
should give more of an analog vibe?

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,880
And what about those shamans
on youtube making stacks of money?

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,312
This is business.

25
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,664
Yeah? You have a point.

26
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,390
Ever since high school,

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,429
my shops went out of business
because clients said-

28
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:27,146
I was too young
or another shop opened right next to us.

29
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,106
These shaman bitches don't know
a thing about business ethics.

30
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:34,529
Remember the one who claimed
he had General McArthur in him and spoke in English?

31
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,067
I was no match for that guy!

32
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,104
That's why I am here.

33
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,804
This is how things are done nowadays, okay?

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,757
Okay, darling.

35
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:51,504
Hey, clear this off.

36
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,506
- You said thirty minutes!
- Well, clean this up!

37
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm still hungry!

38
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,386
- Wait, your make-up!
- Make-up, make-up, make-up.

39
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,810
- All set?
- Yeah, all set, all set, all set.

40
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,771
All set, all set!

41
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,899
- Do I look cute?
- You do.

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,901
- Jeong-su!
- Buddha's words!

43
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,942
- Hello.
- Come on in.

44
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,836
Welcome.

45
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,575
Mr. Jeong-su is doing his morning prayer.
Give him just a moment.

46
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,122
Hello.

47
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,513
Sit.

48
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,199
The bag!

49
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,055
Huh?

50
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,427
Give me your bag.

51
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,062
Okay.

52
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,593
How can you do this to me?

53
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,349
Honey, you're mistaken.
It was just a hiking.

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,708
He's cheating on you.

55
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,747
Oh my god, how did you know?

56
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,052
You bothered to come see me
cause I can see things, right?

57
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,997
What should I do?

58
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:24,115
Oh, please… tell me what I should do.

59
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:29,177
Don't even let your husband
near a mountain. You get it?

60
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:38,216
His stamina only strengthens
climbing up a mountain.

61
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,145
Mr. Jeong-su…

62
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,310
So…

63
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,880
You want me to eliminate his power?

64
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:01,098
Yes…

65
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,036
Since when?

66
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,505
What?

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,567
I have to know when he gained that power.

68
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,020
Sometime during high school he said…

69
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,200
All of a sudden?

70
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:29,802
Without being possessed or a shaman ritual?

71
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:43,653
I see. You may go now.

72
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,927
I'll give you a call.

73
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,317
Okay...

74
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,818
Bye now.

75
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,091
Wait!

76
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,715
What is your name?

77
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,536
Ryu Su-hyun.

78
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,895
Ryu?

79
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,614
Which Chinese character?

80
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,864
It's willow-ryu.

81
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:15,895
Alright. Go on.

82
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:48,372
What's up?

83
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,778
What do you think? I'm counting money.

84
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,747
Let me count with you.

85
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:58,020
Done.

86
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:03,402
I got you an extra bill since the number of
bills came out to be an odd number.

87
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,466
I told you thirty percent is enough.

88
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,403
A celebrity should always be grateful
for his publicist.

89
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,325
Jeo… Jeong-su.

90
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,668
Huh?

91
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,310
Do you want to go grab something
to drink tonight?

92
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,685
I'm good.

93
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,208
Going out again?

94
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:35,786
I got to relieve my stress.
With this money.

95
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:39,029
We can go drinking… next week.

96
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,208
See you later.

97
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,562
Master!

98
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,122
This is from the person next to you.

99
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,442
- You just went through a break-up.
- Excuse me?

100
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,450
You must be going through a break-up.

101
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,786
You look sad.

102
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,903
Yeah… you're right.

103
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,967
May I?

104
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,708
Hey, can I have your number?

105
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,067
Nice to meet you.

106
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,421
- Did you get it yet?
- Did you catch COVID?

107
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,589
- In June.
- You?

108
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,388
I'm already super immune.

109
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:38,054
- I think I had it once.
- Why the fuck do you not get it?

110
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,122
I went out every night,
and I just don't catch it.

111
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,227
The answer!
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.

112
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:49,005
- AIDS? That's not…
- That's something you don't want to catch.

113
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,282
My spiritual power is getting weaker.

114
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,833
If I could just steal his power…

115
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,172
I have to have sex with him...

116
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,458
with our bare skin touching each other.

117
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,989
- You.
- What?

118
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,192
Are you going to live like that forever?

119
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,372
Like what?

120
00:12:52,396 --> 00:13:01,992
I'm talking about you screwing guy after guy.
You think that is an ideal life?

121
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,994
Damn it, you made me lose my appetite.

122
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,927
Is there a right way to live as a gay man?

123
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,752
You think people will accept us if two men
stick together for ten, twenty years,

124
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,646
saying, "Wow, we're so happy,"
and living like that?

125
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,535
If you're not brave enough to go to a home owner's
association meeting holding your boyfriend's hand,

126
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,812
don't give me that crap.

127
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,810
I'm not telling you to go to a home
owner's association meeting with your boyfriend.

128
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,052
You never fully opened your heart.

129
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,458
Not once have you ever done that.

130
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,474
And you only give your heart away,
not your body.

131
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,528
You're emotionally a slut,
but physically a virgin.

132
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,255
How many guys did you sleep with after me?

133
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,739
It's gotta be three or four!

134
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:58,350
Yup, exactly.

135
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:03,310
We slept together four years ago,
and one guy per year is sad.

136
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,286
Your social distancing is over the top.

137
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:19,217
Regardless of corona, you should keep
the distance at less than an inch.

138
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,284
I haven't been out on the gay scene
that long in the first place.

139
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:33,325
I could have been just as slutty as you
if I came out earlier!

140
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:39,802
And God knows you use your
wicked power to get guys!

141
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,880
I would've been just fine without my power.

142
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,935
You see, guys are crazy
about my looks not my power.

143
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:52,771
Don't complain about
coming out later in life.

144
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:55,958
If you're hot, guys won't leave you alone.

145
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,880
My power is just… an bonus?

146
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:08,067
I wonder… were you a top
or bottom your first time?

147
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,974
Why is that important now?

148
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,415
- You were a bottom.
- Nah, I topped.

149
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,331
- You're being funny.
- No, you were a bottom.

150
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,253
No! Have a drink.

151
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:26,050
You're misunderstanding me a big time.
I…

152
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,927
What do you know?

153
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,349
Stop lying! You're a liar!

154
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,997
Mrs. Kim, Jeong-su is telling me
a strange story.

155
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,239
It's probably too hard with gloves on.

156
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:58,669
I'll pay you for today,
but you don't have to come back tomorrow.

157
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,569
(Yeonhwa-dang Master Park:
Are you in or not?)

158
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:44,903
What's wrong with you?

159
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,153
We have no morning appointments today.

160
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:49,169
Just cause.

161
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,356
You're too cute.

162
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,222
Whatever.

163
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,271
Why are you drinking alone?

164
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:55,661
Pour me a drink, I want some too.

165
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,451
Pour it all for me.

166
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:00,013
Must be nice to be so popular.

167
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,091
Nah, I've got you, right?

168
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:09,685
So, when was the last time?

169
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,134
I don't know.

170
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,435
Last week, maybe?

171
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,239
My phone's been acting weird lately.

172
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,257
Is it because of the cold?

173
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,348
Hello.

174
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,393
Here's the menu. What can I get you?

175
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,272
- I'll have an iced americano.
- One iced americano.

176
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,614
- I'll have a vanilla latte.
- One vanilla latte.

177
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:04,739
- Is it ready?
- Yea, it's ready.

178
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,467
A little softer, please.

179
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,260
I'm going softer.

180
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,053
More gently.

181
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,846
I'm doing it really gently.

182
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,973
Got it.

183
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,059
I still don't get it.

184
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,426
How could he just go back to the U.S.
the very next day?

185
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,270
He still hasn't contacted you, right?

186
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:50,379
Yeah...

187
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,325
- Didn't he say that'd be his last visit?
- But still…

188
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,263
Wasn't that a weird timing?

189
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,669
But you ended up taking off
your gloves and dating me too.

190
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,088
Hmm...

191
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,130
I miss those days.

192
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,583
Hey!

193
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:14,317
HAHey, we're late.

194
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,309
You wish that he loses his power?

195
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,356
Since when?

196
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:36,981
But, why?

197
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:44,419
I want him to stay with me.

198
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,950
I can't live without him.

199
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,698
I figured out a way.

200
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,145
Can you do as I tell you?

201
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,466
Yes, anything.

202
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,880
Jeez.

203
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:41,848
Did you seriously keep your gloves on
until your hands got this bad?

204
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,223
I told you, it's because of my job.

205
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:46,794
Well, what do you do?

206
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:49,247
A chef? You own a fish restaurant?

207
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:51,809
What in the world do you do?

208
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,473
I, I'm a shaman.
