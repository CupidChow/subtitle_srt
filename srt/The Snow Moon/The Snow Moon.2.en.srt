[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 2]

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,860
Behave, or I will eat you now.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,420
(Now that you've forgotten me,)

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,060
(don't blame me for teasing you.)

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,460
It's you!

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,340
Ah!

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,780
Ah!

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,260
Buddy, please excuse me for a quick hide.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,340
Remember to tell me
when the pursuers are gone.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,180
Can't you recognize me?

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,180
Lord Fox Demon,

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
it's my fault.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,100
Did you smell something?

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,020
Your Lordship,

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,180
it's the stench coming from me.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,020
No.

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,860
It seems to be

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,980
the stinky fox odor.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,820
Why are they after you?

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,340
They want to offer me
to the Fox Demon Emperor.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,980
What's wrong with it?

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,780
I heard that this Fox Demon
eats people every day.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
He has a strong, foul fox odor

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,500
and is infested with swarms of lice.

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,220
Also, he weighs over 500 jin now

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,540
and has to roll around to move,

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,260
covered in mud.

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,420
I'll kill this Fox Demon sooner or later
to bring peace to the world.

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,100
No, it's absolutely not.

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,340
All I can smell
is a refreshing scent of hair.

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,820
Your Lordship,

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,860
is this your natural body scent?

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,940
It smells quite pleasant,

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,900
completely different from my body stench.

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,060
Come over here.

36
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,140
Yes.

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,020
Now, help me catch

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,380
all the swarms of lice on my body.

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,780
If you miss one louse,

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,420
I'll eat you right now.

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,180
Your Lordship.

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,420
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

43
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,460
Where is your swagger in killing me
in the blink of an eye?

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,260
The rebellious me of yesterday

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,460
has already been smoothed out by time.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,340
After meeting you today,

47
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
I've realized that there's

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,500
always someone better, Your Lordship.

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,980
I don't like this side of you.

50
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,540
If you're not the same one as yesterday,

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,860
I would eat you here and now.

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,900
Your Lordship, please don't.

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,740
I'll say it.

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,260
I'll kill this Fox Demon sooner or later

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
to bring peace to the world.

56
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,220
How ambitious.

57
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,500
I was just young and foolish.

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,420
The world needs you, Lord Fox Demon.

59
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,980
Wish you a life for generations
for the sake of our world.

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,340
I like the obedient you.

61
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,220
You did well today.

62
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,220
I'll keep you alive till tomorrow.

63
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,820
Remember!

64
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,420
You can't go anywhere but your bedchamber.

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,820
Clean yourself up.

66
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,420
Don't get muddy all over like me.

67
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,820
Yes, Your Lordship.

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
I'll go wash up now.

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,220
(You can't go anywhere in this life.)

70
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,380
I believe there must be one

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,860
that will work.

72
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,020
Ah!

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Lord... Lord Fox Demon.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,220
Since I laid eyes on your peerless beauty,

75
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,620
I can't get your voice and charm
out of my head, so...

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,460
Seems that things are going pretty well.

77
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,060
One can be killed but not humiliated.

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
Lord Qiansui, please stop acting.

79
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,620
I already know you're in cahoots
with this smelly fox.

80
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,740
Miss Su, you've got me wrong.

81
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,380
I didn't tell you the truth

82
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,860
as I was afraid of putting you in danger.

83
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,420
Danger?

84
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,700
Even if I may die,
I'd like to at least know why.

85
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,180
Actually,

86
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,580
I'm the former Crown Prince.

87
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,140
I've been enduring under this Fox Demon

88
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,820
in order to take back my throne

89
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,340
and save our people.

90
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,140
The key to killing the Fox Demon

91
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,220
is to find his tail hair.

92
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,740
Tail hair...

93
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,620
But so many maids had been eaten by him.

94
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,860
How could I possibly find it?

95
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,980
I'll always protect you covertly.

96
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,260
If there's danger,

97
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll ensure your safety
even if I have to mobilize all my forces

98
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,860
to slay the Fox Demon.

99
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,100
Your Highness, please rest assured.

100
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,980
I'll certainly fulfill your trust.

101
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,740
Such a cunning villain.

102
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,900
Protection? I don't buy it.

103
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,940
It's indeed that you're spying on me.

104
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,580
I'm now stuck between two fires.

105
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,380
I can only rely on myself.

106
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,060
What foxes fear the most is the urine

107
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,740
of stronger tigers and lions.

108
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,060
[Lion urine, Tiger urine]

109
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,580
The garlic also smells pungent.

110
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,380
I bet this smelly fox won't like it.

111
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,260
Realgar wine?

112
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,860
It scares all the demons. I'll have some.

113
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,740
Wait.

114
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,860
I have to immerse myself in this flavor.

115
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,100
Where's the hair?

116
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,980
It shouldn't be like this.

117
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,500
Don't foxes shed any hair?

118
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,860
Or maybe he also has seasonal shedding.

119
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,660
Demon.

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,300
Lord Fox Demon.

121
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,860
You seem quite interested in my bed.

122
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,820
No, I'm not.

123
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,180
I was wondering how this bed

124
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,060
could be comfortable for sleeping.

125
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,580
Would you like to try it out?

126
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,380
No need.

127
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,740
Your Lordship.

128
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,900
I'm in the middle of tidying up.

129
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,060
I like to do things meticulously

130
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,140
and immaculately sweep up every hair.

131
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,980
How about

132
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,140
showing you a demon-hunting spell?

133
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,820
Interesting. Go ahead.

134
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,660
This is a demon-killing pot.

135
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,300
This is a demon-revealing mirror.

136
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,100
And this is a demon-slaying sword.

137
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,100
I feel these items are unfriendly to me.

138
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,740
As expected, you've washed yourself.

139
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,420
You smell tasty.

140
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,180
Your Lordship, did you smell

141
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,140
any special odor?

142
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,340
Only a sweet smell greets me.

143
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,940
Do you eat garlic, Your Lordship?

144
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,260
It's okay.

145
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,700
Your Lordship.

146
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm smelling really bad now.

147
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,500
You'd better stay away from me
to avoid the stench.

148
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,620
There's no doubt I like you most.

149
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,540
You know I favor a well-seasoned dish,

150
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,700
