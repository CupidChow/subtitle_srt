[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 4]

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,500
Tonight, you'll be responsible
for warming my bed.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,540
Lord Fox Demon,
your hobbies are truly unique.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,500
Not only do you love sleeping

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,540
on this icy bed, but you also want me
to help you keep it warm.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,140
I can't figure it out
even if I scratch my head over.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,860
Then don't try.

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,100
Your Lordship.

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,140
Would you mind
if the three of us sleep together?

10
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,380
You...

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,980
When did you bring it here?

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,580
It named Liangkun.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,380
It's my good friend
and we're always together.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,700
I can't sleep without it.

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,300
(When he's asleep,
I'll take his tail hair.)

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,620
Do you always sleep with your eyes open?

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,820
I never sleep.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,420
Why?

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,260
Once I close my eyes,

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,940
I'll be reminded of the dream I least want

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,340
to see for thousands of years.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,540
(He must have killed too many people,)

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,540
(so he's afraid of those haunted souls
seeking revenge in his dreams.)

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,820
Lord Fox Demon.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,780
In fact, I've always had the same dream

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
since I was a child.

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,740
There was a little girl in my dream

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,980
and her whole family died in front of her.

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,460
That scene

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,460
was too tragic.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,540
The little girl was crying

32
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,860
and begging them not to kill.

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
But they...

34
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,340
Didn't you say you never sleep?

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,420
I'll pull out your tail hair.

36
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,420
(I can't reach it with my hand.
What should I do?)

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,220
(Here's my chance.)

38
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,860
(Your Lordship, I'm going to die.)

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,900
Everyone has to die!

40
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,500
(He even kills people in his dreams.
It's horrifying.)

41
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,660
Bad fox!

42
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,740
He's obviously playing with me.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,380
How can I get his tail hair?

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,420
Before Lord Qiansui could do anything,

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,420
I'll be tortured to death by him.

46
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,260
I'm burying a flower like a fool today.

47
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,740
Who will bury me in the future?

48
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,100
Little Flower.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,260
I'm still kind enough to bury you.

50
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,140
Once I get eaten by that bad fox,

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,140
I won't even know where my bones are.

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,620
What's wrong?

53
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,980
What's gotten into you?

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,180
You won't understand, Your Lordship.

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Since you won't tell me,

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,220
I'll eat you now.

57
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,100
Fine, Your Lordship.

58
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,340
Stir-fried, fried, stewed, steamed.

59
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,460
How do you want to eat me?

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,780
I like it raw.

61
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,380
Go ahead.

62
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,860
Forget it.

63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,540
I won't tease you anymore.

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,420
Your Lordship, you call this teasing?

65
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,060
I can be killed but not humiliated.

66
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,820
Just eat me if you want.

67
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,180
Remember to start with my head
and make it quick.

68
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,940
Forget it.

69
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,020
You've been a good girl today.

70
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,020
I'll grant you a wish.

71
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,540
Can you give me a hair?

72
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,100
Except for it.

73
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,460
Alright.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,140
Do you have no other wishes?

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,740
Then, can you grant me a full meal?

76
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,140
Even in death,
I want to die with a full stomach.

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,060
Fine.

78
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,540
I'll grant you one last meal.

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,340
Little Flower.

80
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,060
I'm going to die.

81
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,180
Although this meal is delicious,

82
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm not worth it.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,220
Su Xiaohuan.

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,300
Don't chicken out.

85
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,740
You'll be a good girl again in 18 years.

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,580
He didn't even
prepare my last meal properly.

87
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,460
How come there is a hair?

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,180
Hair?

89
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,740
It's even glowing.

90
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,820
Is this the tail hair of Lord Fox Demon?

91
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,820
Su Xiaohuan,
I knew you're not meant to end here.

92
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,900
[Imperial Governor Office]

93
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,660
Liangkun.

94
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,860
Tell me,
if I give the tail hair to Lord Qiansui,

95
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,260
will the Lord Fox Demon be captured?

96
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,780
What?

97
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,500
You think he is a good guy?

98
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,620
[Mastery Comes from Diligence]
Listen, it's dangerous to think that way.

99
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,100
Are you under his mind control?

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,700
Although Lord Qiansui
is not a good person either,

101
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,980
he knows about my origins after all,

102
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,620
I'd better give him this stuff.

103
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,420
The fox demon is powerful.

104
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,420
He should be able
to protect himself, right?

105
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,260
Your Excellency.

106
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,500
Well done.

107
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,020
Can you tell me who I am now?

108
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,660
Before that,

109
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,700
I need you to do one last thing.

110
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,020
(Indeed, Lord Qiansui is not a good guy.)

111
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,380
Okay.

112
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,900
Lead the fox demon
into the Qimen Formation.

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,180
No, I can't do that.

114
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,580
If I go back, that fox will eat me.

115
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,220
You'll be fine with me around.

116
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,700
(Hmph, I don't believe you at all.)

117
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,500
After tonight, there will be
no more fox demon in the world.

118
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,060
After this,

119
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,180
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

120
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,500
Where did you go?

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
(I hope I wasn't caught.)

122
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,180
I didn't go anywhere.

123
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,820
Today, you rewarded me with a fine meal

124
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,620
and I drank too much.

125
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,660
Then I fell asleep in the toilet

126
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,700
and woke up just now.

127
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,500
Come and grind it.

128
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,460
Okay.

129
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,220
Lord Fox Demon.

130
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,340
There's a big fox
behind the pretty girl you drew.

So, is this painting called
"Fox Eats Beauty"?

132
