Miss Su…

3
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,660
There's no escape from destiny.

4
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm afraid demons are teetering
on the verge of extermination.

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,500
Who did this?

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,740
No more fighting.

7
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,220
You two had a hard job
getting back together.

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,580
Live on and live well…

00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,380
Elder!

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,100

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,620
Elder!

14
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,860
It was him…

15
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,100
Don't go!

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,340
I want to find out

17
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,140
how callous he is exactly.

18
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,740
What difference can we make?

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,340
It'll serve only to deepen the enmity
between our races.

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,940
Be it one day

21
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,900
or two days,

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,620
I want all the time I have left
to be spent with you.

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,860
In no circumstance will I
let you come to any harm.

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,180
But what about them?

25
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,100
They were innocent.

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,180
It was my fault.

27
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,260
It was all my fault.

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,780
It wasn't.

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,140
It wasn't.

30
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Have you guys heard?

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,940
The woman we saw the other day

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,940
is named Su Xiaohuan.

33
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,420
She's a descendant of Bigan.

34
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,620
Her heart
is a Seven-Apertured Dainty Heart.

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,300
If we rip out her heart,

36
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
we'll be able to subjugate the demons,

37
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,460
and then everybody will get enough food

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,100
and a good life.

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,220
But she's a kind person.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,020
If we take her heart,

41
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,700
she'll die.

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,140
You haven't the faintest idea

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,300
how to tell good people from bad ones.

44
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,700
Listen to me, guys.

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,260
She's a descendant of a loyalist.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,300
If she gives up her life

47
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,700
and saves us all,

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,100
then she'll be deemed a good person.

49
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,540
If she refuses to do that,

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,900
all of us

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,420
will either starve or freeze to death.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,020
It'll cost more people's lives.

53
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,380
That'll prove she's a bad person.

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,140
Shut up!

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,420

everybody's been talking about it.

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,020
Are you still unaware?

65
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,260
Please, Your Majesty.

66
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,100
To save all others in our country,

67
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,580
please sacrifice her.

[Thick Clouds Sifting the Moonlight]

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,780
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,260
rumor has it
that whoever gets the heart first,

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,700
the human race or the demon race,

80
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,300
will achieve hegemony.

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,060
If the demons get the heart,

82
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,540
they'll definitely wipe us out
for revenge.

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,100
When that happens,

84
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,260
countless lives will be lost.

85
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,580
We must make our move immediately,

86
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,220

87
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,380

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,500
all the public are worried about this.

89
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,780
If we don't take action,

90
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,860

91
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,820

why are you still dithering?

94
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,620

95
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,660

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,220

Love

164
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,780
does not last a lifetime.

165
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,820
