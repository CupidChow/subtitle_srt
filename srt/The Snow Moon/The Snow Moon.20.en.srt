[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 20]

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,380
Scared me to death.

3
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,660
Of course, demons are scary.

4
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,340
It's you, Little Elder.

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,460
Watch your tongue.

6
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,140
I'm over 10,000 years older than you.

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,180
Where are you going?

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,780
To the ends of the earth.

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,420
Form a team to crusade
against the damn Fox Demon

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,660
and uphold justice and peace.

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,340
Bo Qiu has been so good to you.

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,660
Why do you hate him so much?

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,740
Being nice to me?

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,300
I'm used to being alone and don't need it.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,340
He knows everything.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,980
But he kept me in the dark
and made me look like a fool.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,300
He must have his reasons.

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,300
It seems you really know nothing
about his past.

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,220
Then, did the eight or nine girls
he brought back before

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,820
also try to kill him like me?

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,700
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,340
They were all your past lives.

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,380
My past lives?

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,380
A thousand years ago,

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,300
you saved a little white fox
who was injured by a hunter.

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,060
(The little white fox wanted
to play with you.)

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,060
(But it was just a little white fox.)

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,380
(So it found me.)

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,780
Hoping I could turn it into a human.

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,220
Whatever it takes.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,220
But I refused.

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,580
It begged for days and nights.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,540
I knew that if I couldn't turn it
into a human

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,620
and give it a chance to be with you,

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,300
it would rather die here.

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,900
So you turned it into a Fox Demon.

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,460
It's not that simple.

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,220
Because its cultivation was not enough,

39
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,620
it had to endure the pain
of breaking bones and tendons,

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,900
and suffer an eternal curse as a price.

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,940
What curse?

42
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,020
In every life, it would meet you
and fall in love with you.

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,460
(Then you would soon die a tragic death.)

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,180
(While it experienced long loneliness)

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,260
(and endless pain of losing its wife.)

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,260
(He has lived for a thousand years,
but his heart died long ago.)

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Why has he never told me about all this?

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,980
For the past thousand years,

49
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,980
I watched Bo Qiu gradually grow

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,740
and become mature until his heart broke.

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,500
I can feel his pain.

52
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,060
If you want to know the story
of this thousand years,

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,060
Just ask him.

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,820
Elder.

55
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,540
Didn't we agree to keep it a secret?

56
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,620
He asked me to tell you.

57
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,860
You guys talk, I'm leaving.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,940
Finally, I can face you
without pretending.

59
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,900
For thousands of years,

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,380
we were destined to meet and fall in love

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,220
in every lifetime.

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,060
But after a brief love,

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,660
you would die tragically due
to various possibilities.

64
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,060
This has become an endless curse
and punishment.

65
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,100
I didn't tell you about the past

66
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,060
because I was afraid
you would fall in love with me.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,740
But I couldn't help it.

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,300
I wanted to be with you,

69
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,660
even if it was just for one day.

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,620
You're too confident.

71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,380
I won't fall in love with you.

72
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,780
After all, you killed my father.
Quite confident, huh?

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,820
We were destined
for a bad ending in every life,

74
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,780
destined to not be together.

75
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,540
In every lifetime,

76
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,300
I hoped to change things,

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,180
to kill the villains
who would cause your tragic death.

78
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,620
I imprisoned the emperor

79
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,020
and threatened important officials,

80
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,460
all in the hope
of creating a world without villains,

81
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,980
to protect you completely.

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,700
But

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,820
fate still couldn't be changed, right?

84
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,020
The only way to change it

85
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,540
is to seal myself

86
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,460
before you fall in love with me

87
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,740
to stop reincarnating.

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,980
That way,

89
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,660
you won't die from the curse anymore.

90
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,740
So,

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,180
you purposely activated
the sealing formation.

92
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,340
But I never expected

93
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,820
to be stopped by you each time.

94
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,180
Perhaps, this is fate, isn't it?

95
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,140
If you were sealed away,

96
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,060
where would you go?

97
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,260
I would go to a void,

98
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,020
living there for eternity.

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,500
Would it be cold there?

101

A world without you

102
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,940
is hell.

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,460
For thousands of years,

104
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,100
I've lived and yearned

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,340
for the brief moments I had with you.

106
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,540
But every time you died tragically,

107
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,140
and I suffered
for a hundred years in grief.

108
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,900
I truly can't bear
another separation from you.

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,380
I'd rather

110
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,220
you forget about me forever.

111
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,180
Idiot!

112
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,980
There must be a way to change fate.

113
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,340
I won't allow you to seal yourself away.

114
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,300
Besides, I'm lucky.

115
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,660

you haven't slept so peacefully, have you?

132
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,900
Enjoy your sleep.

133
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,540
I'll make you breakfast.

134
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,820
Xiaohuan.

135
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,580
Lord Qingchuan.

136
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,500
While the Fox Demon is away,

137
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,300
come with me quickly.

138
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,900
I can't leave with you.

139
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,380
Why?

140
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,580
You're not really falling in love
with your enemy, are you?

141
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,540
I've let go of all that.

142
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,700
I want to stay here.

143
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,140
Xiaohuan.

144
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,260
You're a human, and he's a demon.

145
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,980
He killed your parents.

146
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,740
You can never be together.

147
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
He has already retreated from the world,

148
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,300
no longer causing any bloodshed.

149
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,780
Lord Qingchuan.

150
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,700
You should go back.

151
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,860
I believe you'll be a good emperor.

152
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
But to me,

153
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,060
you're more important.

154
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,140
Bo Qiu.

155
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,100
Don't kill him.

156
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,660
If I spare him now,

157
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,780
he might harm you in the future.

158
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,620
No.

159
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,100
He won't harm me.

160
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,900
Lord Qingchuan.

161
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,220
Only you can stop the ongoing conflict
between the two races now.

162
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,260
Even if it's for the sake of the people,

163
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,220
please go back.

164
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,500
I believe you'll be a good emperor.

165
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Let's go, Bo Qiu.

166
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,300
Your Majesty.

167
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,060
Why are you here?

168
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,260
I'm worried about your safety,
so I followed you here.

169
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,460
Su Xiaohuan has betrayed the human race.

170
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,540
Do you still need
to worry about her safety?

171
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,700
The Fox Demon is not
in the Seclusion Village now.

172
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,420
It's the perfect time to attack.

173
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Don't attack without my order!

174
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,260
Your Majesty.

175
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,340
Is it because of Su Xiaohuan?

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
The demons are causing turmoil,
and people are suffering.

177
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,660
How can you be so hesitant?

178
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,100
Your Majesty.

179
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,940
If it weren't for Su Xiaohuan,

180
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
the Fox Demon would
have been eliminated long ago.

181
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,420
I've followed you for many years.

182
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,340
Don't you know my feelings?

183
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
The people are suffering.

184
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,500
How dare I hope for affection?

185
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,900
Not about affection.

186
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,420
But today, where is the emperor
that you used to be?

187
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,540
You think you like Su Xiaohuan.

188
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
But actually, you just can't let go
of the past obsession.

189
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,980
You don't even dare to face your feelings.

190
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,740
You're not the emperor
that I know anymore.

191
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,500
Enough!

192
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,780
I have my own plans.

193
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,460
Why didn't I realize
how beautiful this place was before?

194
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,460
That's because
you've always wanted to kill me

195
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,140
and overlooked the people around you.

196
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,620
But I didn't succeed either.

197
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,700
Can you stop bringing up the past?

198
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,020
From now on,

199
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,980
you'll live a simple life with demons

200
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,620
in this ordinary place.

201
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,420
Fine.

202
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,860
Then I can teach them how to cook,

203
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,580
and we can hold
a lantern festival party together.

204
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
I'm very confident
in my Da'e Flies To the Moon.

205
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,180
I'm looking forward to it.

206
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,980
Why do I feel like you're mocking me?

207
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,580
You're overthinking it.

208
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,660
