[Episode 16]

00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,500
(Check this out.)

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,780
That fire-breathing guy just now
was so amazing.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,380
He actually breathed
out Da'e Flies To the Moon.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,740
Sir, Miss.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,500
I can tell that, Sir,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,980
your frontal bone betokens
an elevated status,

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,580
and your eyes herald great wealth,

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,660
while you, Miss,
have a full-moon-shaped face

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,180
and eyes radiant with propitiousness.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,100
You two are definitely fated
to be together for ten lifetimes.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,420
But your destinies are entangled.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,820
The Red-Lotus Karmic Flames

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,540
will inflict a spate of misfortunes
upon you.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,300
Do you have a way to rid us
of the misfortunes, magister?

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,740
This is a scam.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,740
You know the answer very well.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,980
Please enlighten me.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,980
You two are preordained
to suffer those misfortunes.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,260
Even immortals cannot change

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,460
the cycle of karma.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,100
Fine.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,740
I have a divine artifact.

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,700
It is imbued with supreme ancient powers

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,300
and can change people's destinies
against the divine will.

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,620
But…

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,300
But what?

28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,780
But it costs five coins each.

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,220
To change both your destinies,

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,860
you'll have to buy two.

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,660
It's foolproof.

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,620
Since fate has brought us together,

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,300
I'll give you a two-for-one offer.

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,540
Hesitate no more.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,340
My lantern contains great powers,

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,460
and it can keep misfortunes at bay

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
and liven things up.

38
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,700
I can tell that, Sir,

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,100
your frontal bone betokens
an elevated status,

40
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,620
and your eyes herald great wealth,

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,380
while you, Miss,

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,620
and eyes radiant with propitiousness.

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,540
You two are definitely fated
to be together for ten lifetimes.

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,300
What's your wish?

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,740
What's yours?

46
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,900
I asked you first.

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,140
I wish

48
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,580
all your wishes would come true.

49
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,340
What kind of wish is that?

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,180
You're so shiftless.

51
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,500
What's yours?

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,060
It's a secret.

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,020
My friends who bought lanterns from me,
listen up.

54
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,940
As they say, "Flowers bloom
with like beauty every year,

55
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,140
but their beholders
can never stay unchanged."

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,220
The auspicious hour
for releasing the lanterns has come.

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,660
Let's do the countdown
from three to one together

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,620
and then let go all at once!

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,540
Three!

60
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,620
Two!

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,820
One!

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,100
Let go!

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,060
Let go!

64
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,100
It's stunning.

65
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,860
Pity…

66
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,860
What's wrong?

67
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,340
It's so transient.

68
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,220
All good things are transient,
aren't they?

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,340
Yeah.

70

I'm so happy today.

74
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,940
My only regret is that I missed
Da'e Flies To the Moon.

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,140
I've seen the best Da'e Flies To the Moon
in the world.

76
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,100

77

Okay.

to the lantern festival party tonight?

86
