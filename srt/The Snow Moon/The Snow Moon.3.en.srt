[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 3]

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,420
As expected of my favorite maid.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,580
You know I enjoy marinated dishes.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,580
It happens to whet my appetite.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,180
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,340
I have something important to report.

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,540
[Thick Clouds Sifting The Moonlight]

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,940
All those traitors and demon hunters

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,900
involved with the magical seal

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,220
have been executed by me.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,100
(Oh no! I'm also a demon hunter.)

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,420
You've done a good job, Imperial Governor.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,780
You're the only one I trust

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,660
among the entire court.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,780
But you must find out
what happened to the seal...

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,460
(What should I do?)

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,540
to prevent me from being framed.

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,620
Yes.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,260
What's going on?

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,980
Nothing.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,180
I just felt a bit cold.

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,700
Aren't you a demon hunter?

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,460
How come you don't even have the power
to protect yourself from the cold?

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,300
No, it's not like that.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,220
I'm just a fake demon hunter,
not a professional one.

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,260
More like those street storytellers.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,420
Besides,

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,820
I have a grudge against demon hunters.

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,940
Joining their ranks

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,980
to dismantle them from the inside...

31
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,220
You have a grudge against them?

32
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,780
Let's hear it.

33
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,340
Here's what happened.

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,700
I had a dog named Lucky
since I was little.

35
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,260
It was intelligent and cute,

36
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,140
almost like a dog demon.

37
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,620
I lived alone with Lucky.

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,780
But then those monster hunters

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,900
killed it while I was off guard.

40
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,420
Do you think I should be upset about that?

41
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,620
Hmm.

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,060
That makes sense.

43
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,540
Do you think so?

44
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,700
Those demon hunters are really bad.

45
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,820
Find out what happened to the seal

46
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,740
within three days.

47
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,420
I'll live up to your trust, Your Majesty.

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm leaving.

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,420
-Your Lordship.
-Yes?

50
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,980
I broke out in a cold sweat,

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,500
and now I'm stinking all over.

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,780
Can I go wash up?

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,740
Your Excellency.

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,580
That fox almost ate me.

55
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,220
Don't worry.
I've been secretly protecting you.

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,260
That's why I showed up just now.

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,500
Really?

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,500
Miss Su.

59
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,340
I said I'd protect you.

60
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,940
It was not an empty promise.

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,860
I've been meaning to ask you
a question for ages.

62
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,220
Feel free to ask me.

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,060
Your Excellency,
since you know I'm a fake demon hunter,

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,340
why do you entrust
such an important task to me?

65
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,380
Because I trust you.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,260
Why do you have
the same jade pendant as mine?

67
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,900
They were originally a pair.

68
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,420
Now, you and I both hold half of it.

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,900
I've been searching
for my birth parents for ten years.

70
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,460
My adoptive mother said
this jade pendant was the only thing on me

71
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,660
when she found me.

72
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,460
Do you know about my past?

73
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,580
It's very important to me.

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,340
Just trust me.

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,740
Right now,
there's something more important.

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,340
Once you find the tail hair,

77
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,220
I'll be sure to tell you that.

78
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,860
(I must complete the mission quickly)

79
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,580
(to find out my origins.)

80
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,700
(He'll take a bath)

81
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,580
(as long as I make his clothes dirty.)

82
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,380
(Then I'll have a chance
to pluck his hair.)

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,220
Your Lordship, what are you drawing?

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,020
My beloved.

85
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,220
Drawing it

86
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,580
so that I won't forget what she looks like

87
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,900
and she won't forget mine.

88
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,060
Maybe she'll even come to kill me.

89
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,100
You're so loyal, Your Lordship.

90
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,060
I wonder which female fox

91
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,820
is so fortunate to be favored by you.

92
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,180
Why would she be so mean to kill you?

93
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,340
Does she look familiar?

94
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,420
(Here's my chance.)

95
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,940
(I don't believe I can't handle you.)

96
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,300
Abracadabra!

97
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,700
Fire!

98
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,540
Your Lordship.

99
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,580
This is the new Gongtian Dessert
from the vassal state.

100
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,020
Don't judge it by its appearance.
It tastes great.

101
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,660
Please try it.

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,740
You can have it.

103
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,180
Why does it smell like shit?

104
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
You're so dirty and smelly,

105
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,900
which makes me very uncomfortable.

106
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
Go get my clean clothes. I need to bathe.

107
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,900
Yes, right away.

108
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,340
What's funny?

109
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,620
It's my first time
to serve you in bathing.

110
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,140
I'm expecting it and nervous.

111
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,780
Oh?

112
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,340
What are you expecting?

113
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,420
One of your tail hair.

114
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,900
I mean,

115
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,500
even a hair on your tail
arouses great anticipation from me.

116
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,460
Keep going since you know how to talk.

117
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,180
Actually, I'm not very good at talking.

118
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,220
It's mostly about sincerity.

119
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,260
I say whatever comes to mind.

120
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,020
Your Lordship,
you've made so many petals again.

121
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,340
I remember

122
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,340
it was your favorite.

123
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,380
You're joking, Your Lordship.

124
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,060
You just met me.

125
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,660
How do you know what my favorite is?

126
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,900
You're right.

127
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,980
But it feels like I've known you
for a long time.

128
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,300
Oh, we've only known
each other for one day.

129
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,540
No.

130
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,460
It feels like a thousand years.

131
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh, yeah!

132
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,820
I'm skilled in body scrubbing.

133
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,180
Would you like to have a try?

134
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,580
Okay.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,420
(Where's the hair?)

136
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,540
Can you stop focusing on just one spot?

137
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Sorry for scrubbing your skin off.

138
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,380
Your skin is so delicate and soft.

139
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,660
(Where's the hair?)

140
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,140
Can I ask you a question, Your Lordship?

141
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,860
Don't foxes have thick body hair?

142
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,300
Why don't you have any hair?

143
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,740
Oh no, you have.

144
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,740
(His hair must be on the tail.)

145
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,860
(What should I do?)

146
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,460
(I'll go for it.)

147
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,260
Your Lordship.

148
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,580
Your hands are not behaving.

149
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,740
No, I'm not.

150
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,740
I can't help but clean your body

151
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,700
when I'm watching you.

152
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,740
Alright, forget about washing.

153
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,180
Get ready to serve me in bed.

154
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,700
Okay.

155
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,180
