00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,580
Lord Qingchuan.

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,620
Who is he?

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,380
We call him Gui.

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,100
They are numerous.

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,700
Neither human

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,820
nor demon.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,980
They hold deep resentment in their hearts

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,540
and inflict harm upon both races.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,780
Then why did he kill me?

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,300
Perhaps to protect the Fox Demon.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,140
What happened to your head?

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,780
I accidentally got cut by a knife.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,060
Don't move.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Why are you so careless?

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,740
Thank you.

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,540
Did you make a move on the Fox Demon?

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,660
No, I didn't.

19
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,460
I'm no match for him at all.

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,660
How could I act recklessly?

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,420
Why did you lie to me?

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,980
Don't take any more risks like that.

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,980
Just find the key to the Earth Scroll.

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,460
Then, I'll go back first.

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,180
Otherwise,
that bad fox will suspect me again.

26
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,700
Where have you been?

27
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,180
Lord Fox Demon.

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,500
I went to rinse my mouth.

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,620
It took so long.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,060
Did you secretly meet

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,380
with someone outside?

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,140
How could I?
Secret meetings take a long time.

33
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,420
It takes me a long time to rinse my mouth.

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,220
I deeply reflected on my own actions

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,060
while rinsing my mouth just now.

36
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,500
I think you've misunderstood me.

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,340
I'm just a lowly nobody.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,980
How could I dare to kill you?

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,260
Besides,
I don't have the power to do that, do I?

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,380
Mainly, I wanted to test your strength.

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,780
But I found
that you're really unpredictable.

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,460
I admire you even more.

43
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,220
Your Lordship, don't kill me!

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
What have you done to me?

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,540
Nothing.

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,380
Just infused some bugs on you.

47
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,100
If they don't smell my scent,

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,020
they'll have a fit
and bite you in the gut.

49
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,540
If you don't behave and run around,

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,260
even deities can't save you.

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:09,980
You!

52
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,180
Me?

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,020
Lord Fox Demon.

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,100
How could you show me such care

55
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,660
without my consent?

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,580
Are you the Lord Fox Demon I admired?

57
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,900
It depends on your behavior.

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,420
Your Lordship.

59
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,700
Can you lend me your cloak for a moment?

60
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,940
I want to sleep while smelling your scent.

61
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,020
Otherwise, I can't fall asleep.

62
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,580
(Fine.)

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,980
You d*mn fox.

64
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,380
Gentle bugs.

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,460
This is the attire of Lord Fox Demon.

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,460
It's full of a strong fox scent.

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,260
Now you can enjoy smelling it.

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,540
But please, don't bite me anymore,

69
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,220
and don't bite my organs either.

70
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,100
Where do you think the Earth Scroll is?

71
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,540
Su Xiaohuan has been
in the Emperor's bedchamber for many days.

72
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,740
How come she's still alive?

73
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,660
I guess,

74
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,260
she must have been bedded by the Emperor.

75
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:12,780
That's right.

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,460
I believe Su Xiaohuan is a vixen.

77
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,900
She knows how to seduce the Emperor.

78
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,260
I think so, too.

79
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,740
What are you gossiping about?

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,900
There is nothing between me
and the Lord Fox Demon.

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,780
You're alone in a room together,

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,020
like a spark in dry firewood.

83
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,580
If nothing happened,

84
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,780
unless you're a barren woman.

85
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
Nonsense!

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,340
You call me a barren woman?

87
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,580
Why don't you say he's impotent?

88
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,500
No need to kneel.

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,580
Alright. I know you're wrong.
You may rise.

90
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,020
You said I'm impotent?

91
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,660
Lord Fox Demon.

92
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,540
My stomach hurts.

93
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,660
Help me!

94
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,260
Lord Fox Demon.

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,620
Put me down!

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,820
Lord Fox Demon.

97
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,220
What are you doing?

98
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,260
Lord Fox Demon, what are you doing?

99
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,420
Nothing.

100
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,300
I just want to prove myself

101
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,420
to avoid being gossiped about.

102
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,380
No!

103
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,140
You don't need to prove yourself.

104
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,700
You're so strong and powerful.

105
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,380
How can you be impotent?

106
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,100
I was talking nonsense.

107
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,260
Everyone should take responsibility
for their words and actions.

108
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,380
You mustn't lower your taste
because of me, Your Lordship.

109
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,660
Besides, how can a maid become a royal?

110
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,020
Yes, you should be matched with a royal.

111
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,260
I, a humble maid like a chicken,
am not good enough for you.

112
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,660
Foxes have a natural affinity
for chickens.

113
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,580
I love little girls like you.

114
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,540
Hold on!

115
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,100
Lord Fox Demon is so mighty!

116
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,060
Lord Fox Demon is so powerful!

117
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,060
Lord Fox Demon is amazing!

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,180
Lord Fox Demon is formidable!

119
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,060
Lord Fox Demon is great!

120
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,540
Lord Fox Demon is really amazing!

121
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,300
Lord Fox Demon is fantastic!

122
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,900
Get out!

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,420
Okay.

124
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,580
Lord Fox Demon is so powerful!

125
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,860
What's going on?

126
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,100
Have you become possessed
by the Fox Demon?

127
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,180
Why are you wearing the clothes and cut

128
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,820
of the Fox Demon?

129
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,100
If it weren't for the d*mn bugs.

130
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,420
Who would want to wear his clothes?

131
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,940
Oh, I mean,

132
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm afraid of the cold lately.

133
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,620
That's why I borrowed his clothes.

134
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,660
Oh, no.

135
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,380
I'm already warm enough in this.

136
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,180
Thank you.

137
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,220
Oh, by the way.

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,460
I've searched his bedchamber thoroughly.

139
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,940
but I didn't find the secret scroll.

140
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,780
Could it be the Fox Demon has...

141
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,940
It can't be wrong.

142
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,980
You must have missed something.

143
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,500
We're here

144
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,180
to prepare for the operation
on the night of tomorrow's lunar eclipse.

145
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,540
Operation?

146
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,700
What operation?

147
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,100
On the night of the lunar eclipse,
the Fox Demon is at his weakest,

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,980
and it's our best chance to kill him.

149
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,580
Every lunar eclipse, he hides away.

150
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,580
If we can find his hiding place,

151
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,300
we'll have a chance to kill him.

152
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,220
I understand.

153
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,300
Xiaohuan.

154
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,740
Don't do anything rash.

155
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,820
Send me a signal immediately

156
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,620
once you find his hideout.

157
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,340
Alright.

158
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,860
Lord Fox Demon.

159
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,940
Lord Fox Demon?

160
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,700
Your Lordship?

161
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,740
He's so vicious usually.

162
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,540
He knew he'd lose his power
during the lunar eclipse,

163
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,060
so he's hiding so early.

164
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
What a coward!

165
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,860
Where is he hiding?

166
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,820
(The lunar eclipse has begun.)

167
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,940
