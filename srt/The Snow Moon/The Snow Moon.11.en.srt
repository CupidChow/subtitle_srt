00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 11]

2
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,900
I have figured it out.

3
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,780
Su Xiaohuan is my lost fiancee.

4
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,460
(What's going on with Lord Fox Demon?)

5
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,740
Since Su Xiaohuan is my family,

6
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,060
it would be inappropriate for her
to serve you as a maid.

7
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,060
Your Majesty, please allow me

8
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,580
to take her out of the palace now.

9
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,420
What if I don't?

10
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,700
Then please forgive me, Your Majesty.

11
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,380
I would sacrifice my life to protect her.

12
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,140
(You will suffer eternal damnation.)

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,700
(The blood of your lover)

14
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,180
(is an irresistible temptation for you.)

15
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,620
You may leave now.

16
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,780
Lord Qingchuan.

18
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,020
Lord Qingchuan. I can't go back with you.

19
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,820
It's too dangerous for you
to stay with the fox demon.

20
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
I can't let you risk your life again.

21
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,140
But I managed
to find the location of the Earth Scroll.

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,860
Only I know how to
lure out the fox demon and let you enter.

23
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,180
You've been waiting for ten years.

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,220
Why are you hesitating now?

25
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,140
If I had been late today,

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,620
the consequences would have been dire.

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,620
Even if it's not for the sake of hatred,

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,540
it's still for the millions of people
outside the city.

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,220
Do you have a better solution?

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,860
I will find a way.

31
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,100
Come with me.

32

[Imperial Governor Office]

33
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,420
Open the door!

34
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,020
(Lord Qingchuan.)

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,420
Lord Qingchuan.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,380
Let me out!

37
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,780
Hey!

38
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,700
(To take human form,)

39
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,900
(not only do you have to suffer the pain
of being turned into ashes,)

40
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,140
(but also you'll be cursed for eternity.)

41
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,300
(The one you love)

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,380
(will have a brief love with you)

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,260
(and die tragically because of you.)

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,980
(Do you really want)

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,340
(this brief and selfish love?)

46
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,260
(I heard he eats people every day.)

47
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,540
(He has a strong, foul fox odor)

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,500
(and is infested with swarms of lice.)

49
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,620
(He weighs over 500 jin and can't walk.)

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,340
(He even rolls around in mud
on a daily basis.)

But why didn't the fox demon keep me?

No way.

or covets my beauty

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,380

Yes, he must covet my beauty.
