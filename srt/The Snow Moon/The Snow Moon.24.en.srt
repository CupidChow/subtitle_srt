00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 24]

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,220
It's true, no one is here.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,940
Is Yu Li truly going
to eliminate all living beings?

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,060
Bo Qiu,

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,460
we need to stop her.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,180
She has absorbed the powers
of both demons and demon hunters.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,020
Now, no one can defeat her.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,180
There's only one way.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,100
The Seven-Apertured Dainty Heart?

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,300
That's right.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,620
Are you willing to sacrifice yourself?

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,380
Let me think about it.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,220
It's hard to say.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,340
If so, will you consume my heart
if an emergency occurs?

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,300
It's hard to say.

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,020
However, from a taste perspective,

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,460
the fresher it is, the nicer it tastes.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,580
Are you actually being serious?

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,260
Whether the living beings in the world
live or die has nothing to do with me.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,660
Naturally, I won't sacrifice myself
for the people unrelated to me.

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,300
In my eyes,

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,540
the sum of all living beings

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,580
cannot even compare
to a strand of your hair.

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,380
However, if someone dares to hurt you,

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,580
I will eradicate them.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,980
I know you've experienced
the world many times.

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,420
And, humans are devious beings.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,340
However, in this lifetime,

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,740
someone did provide me
with a bowl of congee

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,700
when I was starving.

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,940
Someone provided me with a shelter

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,140
when I was taking shelter in a temple.

33
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,900
And, someone
still provided me with money

34
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,220
to sustain my livelihood

35
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,540
even though he knew

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,100
I was deceiving him.

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,500
Bo Qiu,

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,700
I know you're disappointed with humans.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,700
But I've felt the warmth
they provided to me.

40
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,180
I wish to protect them.

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,740
I wish to protect those
who had provided me with warmth.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
If only this moment could last forever.

43
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,180
Wouldn't it be great if this moment
could be frozen in time?

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,340
This moment alone

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,140
makes the suffering
I endured for a millennium worth it.

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,020
What else can you do

47
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,540
if you wake up and don't see me around?

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,700
Where's Su Xiaohuan?

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,700
Your opponent

50
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,460
is me.

51
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,100
You're too full of yourself.

52
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,900
How will I know

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,780
if I don't give it a try?

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,860
Are you betraying me?

55
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,260
Yu Li,

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,580
I was the reason you ended up like this.

57
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,540
I was only bent on seeking vengeance
all these years.

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,260
I have never paid attention to you.

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,300
Now, I realize

60
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,700
that I was surrounded
by wonderful things all along.

61
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,820
I don't want you to end up like me

62
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,220
and fail to protect
the people beside you.

63
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,540
Put down your grudge.

64
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,620
Let's start anew.

65
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,540
Qingchuan,

66
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,220
it's too late.

67
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,140
Not all the demons and demon hunters
were eliminated by me.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,580
You've already fallen for
the trap I set up.

69
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,220
Yu Li,

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,100
I don't wish to fight you.

71
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,660
You're overestimating yourself.

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,460
I mustn't allow the world to fall into
the hands of hypocrites like you all!

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,780
I can't afford to die here.

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,580
I will eliminate all selfish desires
from the world

75
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,780
and establish a new world!

76
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,820
Bo Qiu!

77
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,100
Xiaohuan?

78
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,260
What are you doing here...

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,100
Bo Qiu,

80
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,020
you've been protecting me
for the past millennium.

81
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,700
It's my turn to protect you

82
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,260

so now, I'll be the end of everything.

112

I shall bear all the consequences alone.

113
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,580
Bo Qiu!

114
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,220
Do you think you can seal me away
just with your powers?

115
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,740
I will seal myself away in
the Land of Infinity.

116
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,260
However, I will take you with me.

117
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,620
Not only do you
not hate this unfair world,

118
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,340
but you're also sealing yourself away
forever because of those hypocrites?

119
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,940
I just wish to return
a good world to her.

waiting to be done.

I want you to stay here and assist me.

I need to go.

I will look for him.

158
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,620
I believe that he'll definitely return.

159
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,260
You will be a good emperor, right?

160
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,100
I promise.

manage to find him in the end?

About that...
