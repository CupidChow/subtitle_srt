[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 19]

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,140
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,100
Why is this place full of demonic energy?

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,180
All the people here are demons.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,500
Of course it's full of demonic energy.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,620
This is already the place for demons.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,940
If you don't stick close to me,

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,340
don't blame me if you get eaten.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,220
He's just trying to scare you.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,100
Do you demons always scare people?

11
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,060
Why are there more women and children

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,260
among the demons here?

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,860
Most male demons were killed
by demon hunters

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,900
in order to protect their families.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,860
It's because they eat humans.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,300
Have you ever seen demons eating humans?

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,460
No.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,940
In fact, most demons are kind-hearted.

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,300
There are no good or bad races.

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,100
It's the desire
that corrupts those who do evil.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,820
What do you mean?

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,420
The fear and hostility
of the human race towards demons

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,460
have been magnified by demon hunters.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,020
Which prominent demon hunter

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,780
isn't dependent
on high officials in the palace?

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,300
They offer millions to them every year.

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,740
Have you ever wondered

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,740
where the money comes from?

29
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,420
Demons are victims, too.

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,220
Even if they don't eat humans,

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,300
who silently condones

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,500
the act of demon hunting as human justice?

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,980
But my mother was a diligent demon hunter,

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,180
and she would never do such things.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,940
For ordinary demon hunters,

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,820
it's just a means to make a living,

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,900
just like hunting.

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,020
How would she know the truth?

39
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,940
But if demons aren't bad,

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,020
where did the rumor come from?

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,620
Because someone was deliberately trying

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,700
to stir up disputes between the two races.

43
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,500
Why?

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,340
What can't be killed

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,420
is someone's desire.

46
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Who?

47
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,300
I can't tell you.

48
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:41,980
Let's go.

49
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,180
I'll take you to eat something nice.

50
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,100
Why aren't you happy?

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,500
No, I'm not.

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,420
I'm happy.

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,660
It looks ugly.

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,660
Eat it.

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,420
It's delicious.

56
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,300
What kind of noodles is this?

57
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,700
This is the most popular
human liver noodles in the village.

58
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,620
Didn't you say demons don't eat people?

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Alright.

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,460
I'm just kidding.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,820
Demons won't eat something
like human livers.

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,380
These are plants from the mountains.

63
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,660
Really?

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,140
Go ahead and eat.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,300
No, wait.

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,420
Why aren't you eating?

67
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,740
Is there something else in it?

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
I like watching you eat.

69
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,620
What's so interesting about me?

70
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,020
You've seen the world.

71
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,180
Just let go of the past.

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,060
I've already let it go.

73
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,340
Can't you?

74
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,740
What are you talking about, Your Majesty?

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,420
What a cute little girl.

76
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,020
Don't be rude to my great-grandma.

77
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,900
She's so young.

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,300
How could she be your great-grandma?

79
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,460
All right, little girl.

80
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,020
Don't argue with our guests.

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,180
Okay.

82
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,140
Greetings, Elder.

83
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Good boy, Bo Qiu.

84
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,020
You've brought another girl back.

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Another girl?

86
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,220
Has Fox Demon Emperor
brought other girls before?

87
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,860
Yes.

88
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,420
Probably eight or nine by now.

89
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,700
What's wrong with that?

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,700
Where are the eight or nine girls?

91
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,940
Later on,

92
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,420
they all died.

93
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,060
Don't worry. It's not that soon.

94
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,620
Let's eat.

95
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,620
Your Majesty.

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,500
Have you found Su Xiaohuan?

97
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,420
Your Majesty, as you ascend the throne,
countless things are awaiting improvement.

98
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,300
How can you let yourself
be troubled over a woman?

99
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,580
I'm asking if you've found Su Xiaohuan.

100
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,340
Yes, I have.

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,580
I didn't expect our Fox Demon Emperor

102
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,420
to cook personally.

103
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,220
Of course.

104
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
After all, I've lived
for over a thousand years.

105
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,780
Cooking

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,380
is just a piece of cake.

107
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,740
Wow,

108
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,500
this is the first poisonous dish

109
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,740
made by the Fox Demon Emperor
with a thousand years of experience.

110
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,940
Seems like it has nothing to do
with delicious food.

111
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,500
It's not as good as it looks.

112
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,140
But it sure tastes good.

113
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,300
I didn't skimp
on any seasonings as a cook.

114
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,660
Let me try it first.

115
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Not bad.

116
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,980
Now, you try it.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,420
Wait a moment.

118
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,660
What's wrong?

119
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,060
You don't believe me?

120
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,260
I'll try it.

121
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,500
How is it?

122
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,100
I haven't eaten it yet.

123
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,900
What do you mean?

124
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,300
I mean,

125
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,540
if every day in the future

126
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,940
is like it is now,

127
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,820
would you let it go?

128
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,740
Excuse me.

129
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
(Slow down.)

130
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,100
(Don't fall.)

131
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,180
(Okay.)

132
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,100
(Be careful.)

133
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,660
Because someone was deliberately trying

134
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,580
to stir up disputes between the two races.

135
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Who?

136
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
I can't tell you.

137
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,300
Your Majesty.

138
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,780
May I ask you a question?

139
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,020
Is the mastermind behind the panic
of both humans and demons

140
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,380
related to me?

141
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,660
Yes.

142
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,140
It was your biological father,

143
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,140
the Prime Minister
of the previous dynasty.

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,820
How could that be possible?

145
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,500
How could my father be such a man?

146
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,980
Lord Qingchuan said
my father was a loyalist.

147
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,420
He sacrificed my brother's life
to secure Lord Qingchuan's throne.

148
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,340
How could he do such a thing?

149
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,180
For the royal family,

150
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,500
indeed, he was loyal and virtuous.

151
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,540
But for the innocent humans and demons

152
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,940
who lost their lives in the wars

153
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,020
and for the countless
hunger-stricken people,

154
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,940
how can he be considered

155
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,900
patriotic and virtuous?

156
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,620
So you killed him, right?

157
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,540
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,540
It's truly ridiculous.

159
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,980
You've killed so many
of your so-called corrupt officials.

160
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,340
Has this world become better?

161
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,820
No.

162
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,900
I didn't do it for this world.

163
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,740
I know as long as humans have desires,

164
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,980
this world will never be good.

165
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,620
That's why you killed my parents.

166
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,100
I don't know
where you'll be in this lifetime.

167
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,620
I killed many corrupt officials
and bad guys

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,660
just to protect you from the grip of fate.

169
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,260
Protect me?

170
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,100
Making me an orphan, homeless,
and wandering around.

171
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,980
Depriving me of the family affection
that everyone deserves.

172
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,740
You said you did all this to protect me?

173
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,180
You're truly insane.

174
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,180
I'll never forgive you.

175
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,780
And I'll never let go of this.
