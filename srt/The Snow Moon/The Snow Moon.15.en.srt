00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,220
why did you save me?

(His Majesty suffered severe injuries
trying to save me.)

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,340
(I owe him my life.)

53
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,540
(I'd be requiting good with harm
if I worked against him again.)

54
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,060
(But the blood debt must be collected.)

55
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,660

to the Lord Qingchuan's deadline.)

I petition
Your Majesty not to dig me out.

The show you staged the other day

65
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,140
strikes me as pretty interesting.

66

Does your repertoire
include anything else?

67

What's this about, Your Majesty?

68

Yesterday you treated my wound,

71
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,460
so today I'll grant you a wish.

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,500
But fulfilling my wish

73
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
is beyond Your Majesty's capabilities.

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,500
How do you know I can't fulfill it

75
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,380
when you haven't even told me
what it is yet?

76
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,460
Forget it.

77
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,740
I don't have a wish anymore.

78

Let my world descend into desolation.

79
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,980
Didn't you say

80
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,260
you loved the lantern festival?

81
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,820

we go and see
Da'e Flies to the Moon tonight?

85
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,180
Your Majesty…

86
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,300
Say no more.

87
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,700
My decision's final.

88
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,700
He's found out?

89
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,140
Why didn't he say anything about it?

90
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,060
Forget it.

91
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,140

Aren't we going to see
a lantern festival?

95
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
This will improve the ambiance a little.

96
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,260
Are you not afraid this lantern

97
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,580
might draw burglars to this palace
while we're away?

98
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,860
What kind of burglar would dare do that?

99
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,300
Didn't a burglar sneak in the other day?

100
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,860
No.

101
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,940
Your Majesty misremembered it.

102

Let's go, or we'll miss it.

the lantern festival.

116
