(Wait, no.)

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,340
(His Lordship?)

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,260
(Why am I back again?)

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,740
(And he's applying ointment for me.)

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,020
(He's so like my mom.)

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,660
(Gee, what am I thinking now?)

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,900
(I almost got him killed.)

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,180
(He must be thinking of eating me.)

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,820
(I'd better play dead.)

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,700
Get up when you're awake.

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,700
Your tears are coming out.

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,340
Stop pretending.

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,620
It hurts!

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,820
Your Lordship.

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,340
I'm not dead?

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,980
You were just struck by lightning.
You won't die.

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,620
Your Lordship,

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,540
why are you okay, too?

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,020
Wait, no.

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,620
Why do you have two heads?

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,580
What do you wanna say?

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,660
Say it.

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,940
Sorry, Your Lordship.

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,300
I didn't mean to hurt you.

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,380
I was threatened by someone
and had no alternative.

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,340
Who threatened you?

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,420
I can't tell you.

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,180
Then you don't.

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,500
Your Lordship,
may I ask you something else?

48
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,460
Go ahead.

49
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,260
Where's Lucky?

50
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,140
I told them to send it
to the imperial hospital.

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,180
Your Lordship,

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,460
you're such a nice fox.

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,620
Sleep now.

54
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,140
Liangkun, protect me.

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,260
Liangkun!

56
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,420
Liangkun!

57
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,100
Your Lordship.

58
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,620
Your Lordship, did we do anything?

59
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,140
What thing?

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,180
Nothing happened, right?

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,340
No.

62
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,460
That's good.

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,460
You look disappointed.

64
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm not.

65
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,700
Your Lordship, how's your injury?

66
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,380
It's pretty bad.

67
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,100
How about

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,700
you let me drink your blood
as compensation?

69
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,820
No.

70
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,420
I gotta preserve my body to serve you.

71
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,940
Fine.

72
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,700
I'll give you a chance to convince me.

73
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,220
Your Lordship,

74
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,820
you should play the long game.

75
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,580
How can you be interested

76
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,220
in a plain girl like me?

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,380
Besides, I already have a lover.

78
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,180
Tell me. Who is he?

79
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,340
He...

80
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,660
He is...

81
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,860
First of all, he's got to be a person.

82
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,220
A most ordinary person.

83
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,260
Ordinary eyes, ordinary nose,

84
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,300
ordinary mouth,

85
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,860
with a mole on it.

86
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,060
He's so ordinary that you can't even
recognize him in a crowd.

87
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,580
I can't even remember his looks till now.

88
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,020
(He was so gentle last night.
Now he's changed back.)

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,340
Seems like

90
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,900
your taste is truly poor.

91
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,060
Mm.

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,380
I need to get changed.

93
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,740
At your service, Your Lordship.

94
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,660
[Imperial Governor Office]

95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,620
Yu Li,

96
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,140
how's your injury?

97
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,860
Nothing serious.

98
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,420
We've been preparing
for sealing Fox Demon for a decade.

99
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,700
But a girl ruined everything.

100
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,500
Master,

101
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,620
we can't let her go.

102
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,300
(His Lordship may eat me
for tonic any minute.)

103
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,860
(Lord Qiansui must hate me so much now.)

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,460
(My life is in peril.)

105
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,460
(I gotta go now.)

106
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,740
The teacup is full.

107
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,820
Why were you absent-minded?

108
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,220
I wasn't.

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,300
It's because you're so charming.

110
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm attracted to you all the time.

111
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,940
I wanna charge to the imperial garden
to pluck a flower for you right now.

112
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,300
No need.

113
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,020
Pick one.

114
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,380
Now we have flowers. All we need is...

115
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,620
Mm, all we need is a poem.

116
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,900
If you can compose a poem
within seven steps,

117
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,500
I won't eat you today.

118
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,060
Your Lordship, I...

119
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,140
Or I'll eat you now.

120
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm very good at composing poems.

121
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,220
(I will walk zero step.)

122
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,580
One step.

123
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,180
Your Lordship.

124
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,060
Two steps.

125
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,780
I'll do it.

126
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:21,860
Flower...

127
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,420
A flower blooms on the branch.

128
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,380
Three steps.

129
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,380
Branch...

130
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,300
Suddenly a bee comes for lunch.

131
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,180
Four steps.

132
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,180
Uplift...

133
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,860
Gathering honey while uplifting its butt.

134
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
Five steps.

135
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,820
Last line.

136
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,340
Six steps.

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,380
Wait, here it comes.

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,780
- Seven steps.
- Just tell me if it's cute or not.

139
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,820
This poem of yours

140
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,220
is quite realistic.

141
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,340
I'm curious about gathering honey
while uplifting the butt.

142
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,420
Go catch a few bees
from the imperial garden.

143
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm on it.

144
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,860
Hold on.

145
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,860
It seems that...
you dislike staying by my side?

146
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,660
I don't think so.

147
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,420
Is that so obvious?

148
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,220
Make it quick.

149
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,460
Yes.

150
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,580
Don't go yet.

151
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,300
(I'm doomed.)

152
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,420
- Your Majesty.
- (Lord Qiansui is coming for me.)

153
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm here to investigate
last night's assassination.

154
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,740
I need to take Su Xiaohuan away
for interrogation.

155
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,820
Please give me permission.

156
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,900
(He's really here for me.)

157
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
(Lord Qiansui's staring at me
with murderous eyes.)
