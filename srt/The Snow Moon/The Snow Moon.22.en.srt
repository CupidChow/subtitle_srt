[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 22]

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,820
How do I lift the curse?

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,780
How I wish you came here for me.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,900
If you have no way to break the curse,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,900
I'll go back.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,380
Have you ever heard
of the Seven-Apertured Dainty Heart?

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,900
Only by taking your heart

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,980
can I save my people.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,580
My heart?

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,700
Are you insane?

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,380
When you said killing the Fox Demon
would save everybody,

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,500
I fell for it.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,540
And now you're telling me
my heart can save them.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,020
Don't you think you're so ridiculous?

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,860
It's the only way to quell the unrest.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,740
Bo Qiu was right.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,140
People of elevated status like you
are the biggest hypocrites.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,100
You keep saying everything you do
is for the people,

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,700
but none of you really cares.

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,620
You're always spouting off
about virtue and morality,

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,300
but actually even a Fox Demon
is better than you.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,220
Xiaohuan,

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,420
you can never understand
that I have my own reasons.

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,860
Yeah.

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,860
Of course I can't.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,660
You lied to me again and again.

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,900
You said I was a descendant of a hero.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,660
But my father was clearly responsible
for the slaughter of demons.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,660
He treated the two races like dirt

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,020
for his own gain.

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,500
And yet you call him a hero?

32
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,180
Shut up!

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,660
I can guarantee you he's not
that kind of person.

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,540
That Fox Demon
must've distorted the truth.

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,820
And what about you?

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,540
Those demons of Seclusion Village
had never hurt anybody.

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,220
Why did you slaughter them all?

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,060
What?

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,420
I never gave an order like that.

40
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,860
Then what are these?

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,260
Where did you find them?

42
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,820
This pair of jade pendants

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,340
used to make me feel
I have some good memories.

44
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,340
But now they only
make me feel disgusted.

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,780
Your Majesty.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,700
Let me rip her heart out.

47
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,780
If Your Majesty doesn't dare do it,

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,180
I'll do it.

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,220
If Your Majesty gets angry afterwards,

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,900
you may just kill me.

51
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,460
Yu Li!

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,660
I'll do it.

53
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
How ridiculous!

54
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,300
Are you really
the kind Lord Qingchuan I knew?

55
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,660
That throne is so terrible.

56
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,140
It can turn a man

57
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,700
into a monster.

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,740
Xiaohuan,

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,860
my feeling for you

60
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,220
has never changed since our childhood.

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,060
But sacrificing your life
can save millions of other people's.

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,260
I have no choice.

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,700
Forgive me.

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,900
Even you fell for that?

65
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,100
How I wish it was me
who had my heart ripped out.

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,460
Bo Qiu.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,740
[Efficiency Comes from Diligence]

68
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,340
Step aside!

69
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,260
You shall not pass.

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,260
Nobody can stop me,

71
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,300
not even break the sky!

72
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,500
I will find her,

73
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,140
even if I have to give up my life

74
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,620
or turn Hell upside down.

75
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,460
Report!

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,020
Your Majesty,

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,300
the Fox Demon forced entry.

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,780
The Palace Guards
suffered heavy casualties.

79
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,060
Hold him back.

80
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,340
Yes.

81
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,020
Report!

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,620
Your Majesty,

83
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,100
all Palace Guards are down!

84
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,940
The Imperial Guards
might not last long!

85
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,140
Hold him back!

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,380
Report!

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,060
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,460
all Palace Guards are down!

89
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,140
The Imperial Guards
might not last long!

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,940
Hold him back!

91
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,980
General Yu Li says

92
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,340
Your Majesty needn't worry!

93
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,500
Report!

94
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,460
Your Majesty,

95
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,220
most of the troops are dead.

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,940
General Yu Li is grievously wounded.

97
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,740
Your Majesty, please do it!

98
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,340
Aargh!

99
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,580
I won't kill you.

100
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,140
But I'll challenge that Fox Demon

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,940
to a duel to the death.

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,460
Your Majesty,

103
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,220
my mission is accomplished.

104
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,500
I've come.

105
