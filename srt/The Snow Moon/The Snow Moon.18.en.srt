Since you've been so good lately,

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,460
and you saved my life.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,300
I'll give you a reward.

Your Majesty.

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,460
In fact,
I've admired you for a long time.

7
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,100
Your Majesty, did you see anything?

8
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,540
Nothing.

9
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,540
You're not telling me.

10
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,780
I'll just see for myself.

11
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,020
What are you doing, Your Majesty?

12
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,260
It's no longer necessary to exist.

13
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,980
Will you never sleep again, Your Majesty?

14
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:43,940
No.

15
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,540
The Human Scroll is gone.

16
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,700
How can I save Lord Qingchuan?

17
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,260
Did you find the secret
of the Human Scroll?

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,740
Lord Black Robe.

19
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,260
I've been comprehending the Human Scroll

20
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,380
for the past few days.

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,460
But that bad Fox Demon
has been spying on me.

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,500
I finally caught a chance.

23
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,740
Guess what?

24
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,620
Get to the point.

25
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,420
He caught me while I was trying
to comprehend the secret.

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,060
He interrogated me
for a whole day and night.

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,300
When I fainted,
he even poured the chili water on me.

28
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,060
He forced me
to reveal who was behind it all.

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,220
But don't worry.

30
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,780

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,220
Cut the crap.

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,100
Where's the secret of the Human Scroll?

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,020
The Human Scroll is here.

34
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,700
This is the Human Scroll?

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,100
That's right.

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,700
The Fox Demon turned
the Human Scroll into an icy bed.

37
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,580
It's hard to carry.

38
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
Now it's turned into water.

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,700
It's perfect to bring it out.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,980
Are you playing with me?

41
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,780
Wait a minute.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,140
Let me tell you.

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,820
The secret of the Human Scroll is

44
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,220
that to kill the Fox Demon, you must...

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,020
What?

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
The secret is all in this bucket.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,020
It's true. I'm not lying.

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,780
I comprehended
the first part of the secret.

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,700
But then the Fox Demon turned it
into water.

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,780
Lord Black Robe.

51
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,980
I don't have to risk my life
to lie to you.

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
Besides, we all want
to kill the Fox Demon.
