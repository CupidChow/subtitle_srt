Your Majesty!

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,300
Your Majesty, don't do this.

4
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,700
Do what?

5
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,620
It's my turn to take a dump.

(This resembles the runes
of the Earth Scroll greatly.)

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,860

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,100
Do you know what this is?

16
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,660
How would I know?

17
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,260
You clean my bedchamber every day.

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm sure you'll know
if there's an extra pass

19
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,180
in the room.

20
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,740
I have no idea.

21
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,820
Your Majesty,

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,460
my tummy hurts so much.

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,420
I have to use the loo.

24
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,180
Does this belong to the adulterer?

25
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,420
Your Majesty, please don't spout nonsense.

26
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,740
There's no adulterer.

27
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,260
You're still denying it?

28
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,300
You stalled me on purpose today.

29
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm sure there's an adulterer
hiding in the bedchamber.

30
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,580
Isn't this just an ordinary palace pass?

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,900
I wonder who lost it?

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,900
Your Majesty, could it be
that a burglar had snuck into the bedchamber?

33
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,700
I have to check on my belongings!

34
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,820
Qingchuan,

35
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,020
how's it going? Your practice.

36
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,580
Almost there.

37
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
Do you like him?

38
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,780
Did you fall for the fox demon?

39
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,180
How could I fall for him?

40
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,140
He's my enemy.

41
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,340
Your Majesty!

42
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,180
What are you doing?

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,620
I wish to know if I'm closer to you

44
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,740
compared to him.

45
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,820
Lord Qingchuan, what's wrong with you?

46
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,420
Are you still the benevolent man I know?

47
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm just worried that you had no idea

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,460
that you'd already betrayed your belief.

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,540
I know what I need to do.

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,860
You don't need to worry.

51
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,740
All right then.

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,380
If so, lure the fox demon out again
tomorrow.

53
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,140
We'll seal him once and for all.

54
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,900
However, Fox Demon Emperor has already...

55
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,060
You're still
calling him Fox Demon Emperor?

56
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,940
That darned fox.

57
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,500
I was just used to it.

58
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,300
Remember, tomorrow.

59
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,100
Say,

60
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,060
that darned fox already saw through me.

61
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,380
Why didn't he expose me?

62
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,220
Is he trying to catch me red-handed

63
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,180
when I do it again?

64
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,020
Is he trying to break the debauchery...

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,740
But Lord Qingchuan

66
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,660
was unconvinced.

67
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,060
Does he think
that I have already betrayed him?

68
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm caught in a dilemma.

69
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,540
What should I do tomorrow?

70
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,380
Fox Demon Emperor.

71
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,900
Is your face made of ice?

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,940
Why do you never smile?

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,380
You already saw through me.

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Why didn't you expose me?

75
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,500
Are you trying to catch me red-handed?

76
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,380
How dare you speak to me like this

77
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,100
after getting drunk?

78
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Why can't I speak to you like this?

79
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,420
This is how I'm going to speak to you.

80
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,620
At most, I'll just get beheaded.

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,460
Are you guys trying to kill me here?

82
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,420
Are you guys trying to kill me here?

83
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,860
You guys are killing me.

84
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,860
Don't touch me.

85
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,020
Why do you look like
that darned fox so much?

86
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,060
Your Majesty!

87
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,900
I'm going to slay you
on the heavens' behalf!

88
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,380
Supreme Lord, heed my call!

89
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,980
It's not working.

Hocus-pocus, abracadabra!

91
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,260
I can't defeat him.

92
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,180
I'm dead now.

93
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,860
I'll make you some porridge.
