[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 8]

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,540
You're back.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,860
I'm back, Lord Fox Demon!

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,980
Lord Qiansui interrogated me
for a long time,

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,900
from the direction
my ancestors' graves face

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,820
to the life plans
for my future descendants.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,380
He was extremely thorough and detailed,

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,780
praising me for having no problems at all.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,180
He even said my background is clean

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,500
and I have no bad habits.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,900
That is great.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,220
(He murdered my whole family,)

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,940
(making me an orphan.)

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,740
(He is starving the people!)

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,020
Seems like there's something on your mind.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,580
Yes.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,620
Oh, yes. I have something on my mind.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,180
Although I've only been away from you
for a few hours,

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,420
I already feel heartbroken
and miss you dearly.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,260
The days feel like years,

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,340
and my heart aches so much.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,500
Looks like you need me a lot.

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,020
How about

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,820
becoming a part of my body?

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,980
No, Your Lordship!

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,500
If I become a part of your body,

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
in this world,

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,460
you will lose a little maidservant

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,340
who admires and likes you the most.

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,940
Hmm,

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,140
that makes sense.

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,700
I'll spare your life then.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,260
Thank you for not eating me!

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,420
The air today

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,140
seems filled with unfriendly scents.

36
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,500
Was it that obvious?

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,900
Not this one.

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,620
Not in here.

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,700
No.

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
Nope.

41
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,740
Not this one.

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,500
Not what?

43
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,220
No!

44
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,740
Lord Fox Demon,

45
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,180
you can't jump out like this!

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,500
You will startle me to death!

47
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,260
You have been polishing in the treasury
for an hour.

48
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,060
Why?

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,260
Can't you tell?

50
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,540
Only a spotless environment

51
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,300
is befitting
of Lord Fox Demon's noble status.

52
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,980
Let alone polishing for an hour,

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,180
and I would not mind polishing
for a whole day.

54
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,980
Are you looking for something to harm me?

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Your Lordship,
please do not speak falsely.

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,820
I have just been investigated

57
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,540
and found to be of utmost purity.

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,380
(Oh no,)

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,220
(this d*mn Fox Demon has his eyes on me.)

60
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,060
(How about I go all out)

61
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,060
(and kill him?)

62
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,100
Go away! Stay away!

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,700
One pack isn't enough,
then I will use ten of them.

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,620
I don't believe it won't poison you.

65
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,700
Lord Fox Demon, time to eat!

66
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,700
Lord Fox Demon,

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,660
please enjoy,

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,820
and I will leave you to it.

69
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,300
Eat with me.

70
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,980
Your Lordship, this is inappropriate.

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,940
How can a maid
eat at the same table with you?

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,420
Nothing is inappropriate when I grant it.

73
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,340
Sit there.

74
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,700
Come on,

75
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,900
have a drink.

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,100
No!

77
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,660
I don't drink alcohol.

78
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:39,980
How about this?

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,140
I'll drink tea instead of alcohol.

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,260
Cheers, Your Lordship!

81
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,980
I hope you always have a good mood!

82
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,580
Alright.

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,860
Not bad,

84
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,220
but it tastes a bit astringent.

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,660
You didn't poison the drink, did you?

86
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,980
Why would I ever poison it?

87
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,940
Why are you so nervous then?

88
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Not at all!

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,340
One more!

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,300
Cheers again, Your Lordship!

91
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,260
I wish you eternal prosperity
for thousands of generations.

92
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:35,940
Your Lordship!

93
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,700
What's wrong?

94
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,420
The alcohol is poisoned.

95
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
I treat you so well,

96
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,660
but you dare to poison me!

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,980
Who dares to poison you?

98
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,580
Your Lordship,

99
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,140
hang in there.
I will call an imperial physician!

100
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,860
Not even the imperial physician
can save me

101
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,580
from this deadly poison
piercing my organs.

102
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,460
Only your blood can save me.

103
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,180
Ah!

104
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,980
Your Lordship, are you fine already?

105
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,580
Have I been not fine?

106
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,660
What are you doing?

107
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,460
Nothing!

108
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,060
Were you trying to assassinate me?

109
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,380
No!

110
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,620
It's a prop

111
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,940
that I usually use for my acting...

112
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,260
Just a theatrical prop.

113
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,500
I wanted to show you my talent.

114
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,220
Oh,

115
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,620
is that so?

116

[Visual effects. Do not imitate.]

117
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,340
Your Lordship,

118
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,020
it doesn't hurt at all!

119
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,900
I have excessive internal heat,

120
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,220
causing my gums to bleed.

121
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,620
Can I go rinse my mouth?

122
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,900
It hurts so bad!
