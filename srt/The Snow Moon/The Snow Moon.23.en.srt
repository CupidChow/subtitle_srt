[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 23]

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,860
I'm here.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,820
Don't be afraid.

4
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,460
Bo Qiu!

5
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,820
You're a demon?

6
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,500
I'm a half-demon.

7
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,700
Yu Li, what are you doing?

8
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,260
I'm going to kill all of you.

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,860
Have you lost your mind?

10
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,820
I have not!

11
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,980
Qingchuan,

12
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,300
you had no idea
how Mysterio was formed, right?

13
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,860
I was the mastermind behind Mysterio.

14
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,780
All these pitiful children
are just like me.

15
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,700
We're half-demons who are
not allowed to exist in the world.

16
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,060
We have been

17
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,820
trying to instigate humans
to wage war against demons.

18
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,460
We will annihilate both humans and demons

19
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,820
and establish a wonderful world.

20
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,100
Yu Li,

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,620
what are you doing?

22
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,820
Your Majesty, you're too naive.

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,420
Humans’ desire cannot be
eliminated completely.

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,060
Wars and massacres will always happen

25
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,980
as long as selfish humans like them exist.

26
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,980
Your Majesty,
you cannot do anything about it

27
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,300
even when you're the ruler of the nation.

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,500
A wonderful world can only be established

29
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
by eliminating all humans!

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,820
Although that's the case,

31
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,620
you can't just kill all of them.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,380
Most of them are innocent.

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,940
Innocent?

34
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Hahahaha!

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,340
My father is the noble demon hunter,
Master Huang.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,940
He's also the creator
of the Secret Scroll.

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,620
Therefore, I know the secret within.

38
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,180
And, my mother is a demon.

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,580
She has never harmed a single human.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,020
As the mighty demon hunter,

41
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,060
my father suffered a humiliating death.

42
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,700
My mother brought me
to live with the demons.

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,700
However, humans
slew the demons mercilessly.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,340
As I was a half-demon,

45
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,660
everyone took their frustrations out
on me.

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,740
Her father was the one
who massacred my family!

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,820
I'm going to kill you and avenge them!

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,860
She's a human!
Her father is a demon hunter!

49
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,660
She'll also kill us off in the future!

50
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,540
That's not true! I'm a demon!

51
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,620
My mother is a demon!

52
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
I didn't kill any demons!

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,980
I won't kill you guys off.

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,740
- She's a human!
- She's a human!

55
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,380
- She's a human!
- She's a human!

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm a demon, right?

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,500
Yes, you're a demon.

58
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,220
They were wrong about you.

59
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
You're such a cute girl.

60
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,300
You would never kill one of your own.

61
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,540
(After that,)

62
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,220
Don't be scared.

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,980
(my mother committed suicide
to pay for my father's sin.)

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,820
Even so, the feud didn't end there.

65
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,740
I was chased out of the village.

66
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,940
Back then,

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,380
I was only six.

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,340
Go to hell!

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,670
Leave now!

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,900
Go to hell!

71
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,260
Leave right now!

72
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,140
Scram!

73
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,460
- Leave!
- Go to hell!

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,500
(I almost died on the streets.)

75
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,460
(After that, I was saved by my master,)

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
(who was a demon hunter.)

77
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,620
He brought me back to his sect.

78
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,980
However, my seniors and juniors
were jealous of

79
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,980
my potential.

80
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,300
They said I had the blood of a demon.

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,980
They said I was a freak.

82
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,580
You're powerful

83
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,500
all because you're a demon.

84
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,660
Why are you trying to learn
demon-hunting spells?

85
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
You're the demon here.

86
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,540
You're the demon!

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,220
- Freak!
- You little freak!

88
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,700
- You're the demon!
- I left the sect and wandered aimlessly.

89
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,460
I was an outcast
to both humans and demons.

90
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,180
I'm a freak.

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,900

the prejudices in the world are!

my desolate life before.

We discovered some hidden villages
containing demons.

127

We've already eliminated them all.

128
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,180

Even if you did locate her whereabouts,

186
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,740
you would never tell me about it.

187
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,900
Am I right?

188
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,220
Your Majesty,

189
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,460
once, I thought I was
a benevolent individual.

190
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,380
However, I had no idea
that I was this superficial.

191
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,860
I had no way to change this world.

192
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,900
Your Majesty, your concept

193
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
is the reason why I've survived until now.

194
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,580
Since I cannot win Su Xiaohuan's heart,

195
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,180
I should follow
the path of great righteousness.

196
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,660
Hahaha.

197
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,100
The path of great righteousness, huh?

198
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,900
Indeed. Love means nothing

199
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,380
