[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 13]

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:21,540
[Blessed With Time]

3
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,620
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,940
It's a starry night tonight.

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,220
And the view is excellent.

6
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,620
On such a romantic night,

7
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,180
an exciting show is about to begin.

8
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,380
Please enjoy the first program,

9
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,180
Da'e Flies To the Moon.

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,060
It's Chang'e.

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,660
Chang'e Flies To the Moon
was my favorite program

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,260
whenever my mother
brought me to a lantern festival party.

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,460
Two people who love each other
cannot be together.

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,900
They have to be separated.

15
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,340
It was excruciating.

16
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,140
Music.

17
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,340
You've put in a lot of effort.

18
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,700
However, for some reason, after seeing it,

19
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,620
I feel like using the loo. I'm leaving.

20
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,220
Wait.

21
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,060
I was born into a prosperous family.

22
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,660
Rich in both money and real estate.

23
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,020
I enjoyed boundless bliss.

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,020
However, we were
struck by a terrible disaster.

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,660
My entire family died in front of me.

26
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,340
I wandered alone,

27
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,980
being cold and hungry.

28
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,700
But I was frail and
had no one to depend on.

29
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,420
I almost starved to death
in front of a temple.

30
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,900
Luckily, my foster mother took me in.

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,700
However, I was born a jinx.

32
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,340
My foster mother died right at the door.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,060
Got my mother buried,
and got myself buried in debt.

34
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,700
And now, I'm even more pitiful.

35
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,180
I came here and became your servant.

36
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,820
And, Your Majesty treat me
like your first love.

37
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,220
I try my best to serve Your Majesty,

38
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,260
hoping to see your smile.

39
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,540
To see your smile!

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
That was very touching.

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,780
But I need to use the loo urgently.

42
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,820
I can't hold it in anymore.

43
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,940
Wait!

44
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,580
Late at night, I was at the Buddhist hall.

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,020
And I remembered my biological mother.

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,300
My mother was pregnant with me
for ten months.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,500
She turned into an old hag because of me.

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,740
We can never repay our parents.

49
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,860
So I started to practice Buddhism
as my repay.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,860
My mother was pregnant with me
for ten months.

51
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,460
That's enough!

52
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,500
What kind of programs are these?

53
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,380
Are you trying to kill me with them?

54
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,740
That's not it.

55
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,420
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,180
I did this before.
I'm quite familiar with it.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,860
That's why I wish to
show you something new.

58
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,700
You achieved your goal.
I need to use the loo.

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,420
Your Majesty!

60
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,700
Your Majesty!

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,700
Your Majesty!

62
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,740
Your Majesty!

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,180
What are you trying to do?

64
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,180
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
I have some heartfelt words
to tell Your Majesty.

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,940
Actually,I fell for
Your Majesty ever since

67
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,340
I first saw Your Majesty.

68
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,940
I was deeply captivated by your charm.

69
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,140
You're tall and stately
and such a handsome man.

70
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,820
You're sincere in treating people.
Most importantly, you're understanding.

71
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,860
I love that about you.

72
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,980
My heart races

73
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,380
whenever I see you.

74
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,580
Whenever late night arrives,

75
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,340
my love for you flows within my heart.

76
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,780
Stop.

77
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,460
That sounded familiar.

78
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,900
Have I heard that somewhere before?

79
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,100
No way. This is my first time
making an honest confession to you.

80
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,940
All right then. I have to use the loo now.

81
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,540
Your Majesty, what do you think about me?

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,780
You need more practice.

83
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,020
Your Majesty,

84
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,460
am I pretty?

85
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,380
Your Majesty!

86
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,420
Your Majesty,
are you taking a leak or a dump?

87
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,020
Why don't you say it louder

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,100
and let the entire palace know
that I'm having a number two?

89
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,540
What?

90
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,260
Do you want to join me?

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,100
That's not it.

92
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
I'm just here to take a look.

93
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,380
I'll stop now. I'll wait outside.

94
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,940
Your Majesty, why did you come out?

95
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,020
I suddenly

96
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,140
don't feel like using the loo now.

97
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,060
Your Majesty,
are you looking for something?

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,140
Do you need my help?

99
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,580
I'm afraid there's an adulterer
hiding in the bedchamber.

100
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,980
What adulterer?

101
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,100
I have no idea what you're talking about.
