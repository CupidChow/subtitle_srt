00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,540
If you insist on turning against the world

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,740
to take her away,

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,660
I'll have no choice

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,300
but to stop you.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,100
Hold on!

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,380
Your Lordships.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,500
I never expected such an honor

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
to have you two fighting over me.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,860
Well, I mean,

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,100
there is no need
to make such a fuss over me,

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,540
Your Lordships.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,860
Besides, I'm not an object.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,940
You should ask for my opinion as well.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,020
Lord Qingchuan.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,940
Actually, I've always been fond
of Lord Fox Demon.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,980
I fell in love with him

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,380
ever since I first laid eyes on him.

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,020
This feeling, you know,

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,260
it's like we've known each other
for a long time.

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,860
So I don't want to deceive myself anymore.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,300
I must go back to his bedchamber with him.

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,820
I must go back with him.

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,260
This is my decision.

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,540
So, Lord Qingchuan,

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,020
Let's call off our childhood engagement.

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,860
Lord Fox Demon.

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,420
Let's go back.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,220
You've acted it out well, Your Lordship.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,180
It's just an act.

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,820
Why take it so seriously?

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,220
(This fox is so unpredictable.)

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,980
(It's terrifying.)

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,380
(I wonder if Lord Qingchuan got my hints.)

36
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,700
(I have to find a way
to get the Lord Fox Demon out of here.)

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,660
(So that Lord Qingchuan
can study the Earth Scroll.)

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,220
What you said today
truly touched my heart.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,140
No wonder you're my favorite little maid.

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
You're so sweet, Your Lordship.

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,140
It's my great honour

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,860
to serve you.

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,220
Now that you're back.

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,660
I’ll reward you by having
the courtyard cleaned thoroughly.

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,980
In your absence,

46
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,060
even the air was filled with dust.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,140
Your Lordship.

48
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,980
This courtyard is as clean as your hair.

49
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,180
There's no need to clean it further.

50
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,460
Since the weather is so nice.

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,980
Why don't we go out for a stroll?

52
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,980
I don't want to go out.

53
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,700
Now you can start cleaning.

(Taking so much effort to get me back)

57
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,260

I've fulfilled the task you assigned to me

62
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,620
with great precision.

63
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,020
The ground outside is
as clean as your hair,

64
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,780
pure and spotless.

Clean the floor here.

66
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,940
Isn't here spotless?

67
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,780
No need to clean it, right?

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,700
Go ahead.

69
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,980
I never expected our Lord Fox Demon

70
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,900
to be so childish.

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,900

I've finished cleaning.

Are you satisfied?

75

Oh on, stop shaking your hand!

81

Stay still.

82
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,180
Or I'll eat any part you move.

83

Your Lordship.

84
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,860
Are you almost done?

85
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,140
Almost done.

86
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
Please finish a little faster.

87
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,380
It's done.

97

for taking matters into my own hands?

102
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,820
I did it for the sake of the world.

103

You said you like the fox demon today.

104

Is it true?

105
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,140
No.

106
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,060
How else could I have fooled him?

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,860
So you said you liked me.

108
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,740
It was also to placate him?

109
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,700
That's right.

Let's use a small lantern as a signal.

If you see a lantern hanging at the door,

117
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,380
you can go straight in.
