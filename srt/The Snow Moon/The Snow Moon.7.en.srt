00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 7]

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,100
Don't go.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,900
(Oh no...)

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,220
(Lord Qiansui came right after me.)

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,980
To investigate yesterday's
assassination attempt,

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,260
I need to take
Su Xiaohuan for questioning.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,300
I request your permission, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,420
(He is indeed targeting me.)

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,620
(Lord Qiansui's eyes
are filled with murderous intent.)

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,660
(My life is at an end.)

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,140
Why are you both looking at me?

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,660
(If Lord Qiansui dares to coerce me,)

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,300
(don't blame me for betraying you.)

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,100
Say something.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Does the assassination

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,300
have anything to do with you?

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,020
No, nothing at all.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,300
Lord Fox Demon, you know very well

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,180
that I risked my life
to save you yesterday.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,820
Even if you save me,

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,420
it could be because
you were charmed by me.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,380
Do you really have
no intention of killing me?

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,180
Absolutely not,

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,060
let heaven and earth bear witness,
and the sun and moon be my pledge.

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Your Lordship...

26
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,500
Your Majesty,

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,460
I believe Su Xiaohuan is not honest.

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,260
She must be involved
with the mastermind behind the scenes.

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:09,820
Yes,

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,180
you are right.

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,580
Qingchuan,

32
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,260
interrogate her well.

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:15,780
Yes.

34
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,940
Miss Su,

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,020
come with me.

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,660
Oh no.

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,060
No, no!

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,900
Lord Fox Demon,

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,820
I don't want to leave you.

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,980
I just want to serve you by your side.

41
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,700
Watch your manners!

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
My beloved Lord Fox Demon,

43
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,180
I would feel suffocated

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,100
and life would be meaningless without you.

45
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,060
Lord Qiansui,

46
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,300
please, for the sake of Lord Fox Demon,

47
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,180
don't make things difficult for me.

48
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,860
When I get scared,
I tend to blabber nonsense.

49
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,820
Please...

50
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,220
have some understanding.

51
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,460
Alright,

52
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,500
what would you blabber when you're scared?

53
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,300
I would blabber...

54
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,980
I am blabbering right now!

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,900
Since you don't want to tell me,

56
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,020
Imperial Governor Office,

57
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,020
give her a strict interrogation

58
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,180
and report
all the results to me truthfully.

59
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,580
As for her punishment,

60
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,020
bring her back,

61
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,500
I will personally eat her.

62
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,620
Yes!

63
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,860
(If I sneak attack him now,)

64
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,620
(there's a hundred percent chance
of success,)

65
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,460
(but the same chances
that I'll be hacked to death by knives.)

66
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,780
I'm not walking anymore.

67
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,220
Anyway, it's just death.

68
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,100
After dying and going to my next life,

69
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,180
maybe I'll be a grown woman again
after eighteen years.

70
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,700
Nobody said you'll die.

71
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,700
Are you lying to me again?

72
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,540
I have said that
if the Fox Demon dares to harm you,

73
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,700
even if it means using
all my forces to kill him,

74
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,940
I will ensure your safety.

75
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,540
I came here today to protect you,

76
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,860
so how could I harm you?

77
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,980
Seriously?

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,380
Follow me.

79
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,500
[Harmony and Pleasant Breezes]

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,860
Here.

81
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:10,900
Lift!

82
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,780
Mommy!

83
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,940
Mommy, wake up!

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,580
Mommy!

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,450
Please give me some food!

86
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,040
Thank you.

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,900
- Thanks.
- Thank you!

88
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,620
Here.

89
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,640
- Take the bowl.
- Thank you!

90
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,900
Do you live here?

91
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
In the front.

92
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,520
Thank you, Your Lordship.

93
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,700
I'll just escort you here.

94
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,740
The palace is no longer safe.

95
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
After I declare war on the Fox Demon,

96
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,380
I'll come to pick you up.

97
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,620
Your Lordship!

98
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,380
Just go.

99
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,700
Come with me.

100
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,940
This porridge is nothing but water.

101
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,900
Have you withheld
the disaster relief grain from the people?

102
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,700
Your Lordship,

103
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,420
we don't have any rice.

104
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
This is all the rice we've got.

105
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,820
Lord Qingchuan,

106
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,220
do you have more food?

107
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,780
I don't mind starving,

108
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,900
but my grandson

109
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,860
is having a bad fever.

110
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,860
Do we still have rice at home?

111
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,100
Master...

112
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,340
Bring all the rice here.

113
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,500
Yes.

114
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,460
Let's go.

115
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,620
So, are you really
the former crown prince?

116
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,660
Ten years ago,

117
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,500
the Fox Demon concealed
my father, the king,

118
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,820
and coerced the courtiers,

119
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,060
but I was saved by a loyal officer,

120
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
who used his own son to replace me.

121
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,500
Over the past decade,

122
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,260
the Fox Demon has slaughtered
the loyal subjects,

123
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,820
coupled with continuous natural disasters,

124
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,580
causing the people
to freeze and starve to death.

125
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,220
As the former crown prince,

126
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,820
I could only watch all of this

127
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,060
helplessly.

128
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,340
I hid myself

129
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,620
to gain the Fox Demon's trust

130
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,180
so that I could have a chance
to eliminate the Fox Demon

131
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,900
and save the people.

132
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
I didn't expect

134
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,980
that my soft-heartedness
would lead to such a calamity.

135
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,700
Xiaohuan,

136
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,620
I know you have a kind heart,

137
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,580
but one doesn't always show goodness
or wickedness on the surface.

138
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,020
You thought the Fox Demon wasn't evil,
so you changed your mind.

139
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,060
But little do you know
that great evil can appear as kind.

140
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,740
Miss, can you give me some food?
I'm so hungry.

141
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Don't disturb the lord.

142
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,940
I'm sorry, Your Lordship,

143
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,580
my girl is young and rude.

144
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,100
Please don't mind her.

145
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,500
Little girl,

146
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,980
I'll use this jade pendant
to exchange some food for you.

147
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,180
Wait here for me.

148
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,140
Are you really giving it up?

149
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,780
Yes.

150
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,500
While this jade pendant

151
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,300
is the only connection I have to my past,

152
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,260
I've committed a grave mistake,

153
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,820
and I can't continue
to think only of myself.

154
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,300
I can't let these innocent people
continue to suffer.

155
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,980
Do you really want to know
about your past?

156
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,980
Yes.

157
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,340
(You were originally
the daughter of the Prime Minister,)

158
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,100
- (and we had a prearranged marriage.)
- You won't get away!

159
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,220
I was supposed to marry you
once you came of age.

160
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,340
Let's see if you can.

161
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
As proof, we each take

162
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,340
a piece of the jade pendant.

163
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:06,780
OK!

164
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,980
(But everything changed due to)

165
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
(the Fox Demon's usurpation of power.)

166
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,900
The Prime Minister, to hide me,

167
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,940
didn't hesitate to exchange
my identity with your brother.

168
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,740
I've survived until now

169
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,780
with the sole purpose
of reclaiming the throne,

170
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,100
avenging the deep-seated enmity,

171
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,980
and seeking a chance

172
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,100
for the well-being of the people.

173
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,580
How about my parents?

174
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,900
The entire Prime Minister's family

175
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,660
was brutally killed by the Fox Demon.

176
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,740
Could it be that the images

177
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,500
in my dreams are all true?

178
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,540
How could I have forgotten
all these past events?

179
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,100
It's better to forget it.

180
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,060
You won't suffer as much.

181
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,060
Mommy, I'm so hungry.

182
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,660
Don't worry. We will have food soon.

183
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,340
No,

184
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,340
I want to take revenge.

185
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,180
Don't be delusional.

186
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,380
For the sake of avenging my family

and alleviating the suffering
of the people,

188
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,380
since I've committed a grave mistake,
I must make amends with my life.

189
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,660
But what can you do
since the Fox Demon is so strong?

190
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,260
I'm the only one
who can approach the Fox Demon.

191
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,380
I will definitely
think of a way to help you.

The only grand demon hunter in the world
who could fight the Fox Demon,

194
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,900
Master Huang, has already passed away.

195
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,740
However, he left behind
three volumes of mystical sealings

196
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,020
to deal with the Fox Demon.

197
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,100
The Heaven Scroll,
which was used the other day,

198
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,740
is now completely ineffective.

199
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,500
Only the Earth Scroll and the Human Scroll
can seal the Fox Demon.

200
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,460
Where are the Earth Scroll
and the Human Scroll?

201
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,340
They were found by the Fox Demon

202
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
and sealed in his bedchamber.

203
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,740
No one is allowed to step close to them.

204
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,300
I can look for it in his bedchamber.

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,580
The Fox Demon must have sealed
these two scrolls in his bedchamber,

206

and only those with royal blood

207

Currently, only you,
Master, have royal blood.

209
