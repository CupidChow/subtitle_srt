[The Snow Moon]
[Episode 17]

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,620
[Imperial Governor Office]

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,540
Lord Qiansui has issued an order.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,620
No matter what happens.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,780
No one is allowed to enter.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,100
It's urgent. Let me in.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,340
Lord Qingchuan.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,700
Lord Qingchuan.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,300
Stop calling.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,220
Lord Qingchuan.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,380
Yu Li.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,580
Su Xiaohuan.

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,620
Master is still casting the spell.

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,820
Don't disturb him here!

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,380
Yu Li.

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,060
If using the Earth Scroll
to deal with the Fox Demon,

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,380
the caster will die together.

18
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,260
We can't let anything happen to Qingchuan.

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,060
For the sake of the world,

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,940
Master is willing to sacrifice himself
to deal with the Fox Demon.

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,740
Who are we to stop him?

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,540
Anyone can be sacrificed.

23
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,340
But not him.

24
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,820
He's the last of the royal bloodline.
The world needs him.

25
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,420
Besides, you and he
have been through a lot together.

26
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,700
How can you bear to watch him die?

27
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,540
Who are you to say that?

28
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,980
We've been preparing for this

29
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,980
for ten years.

30
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,220
You've hindered us more than once.

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
And now you're talking about the life
and death of my master here?

32
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,220
If it weren't for you,

33
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,020
Master wouldn't have to do this.

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,740
There's got to be another way.

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,380
Human Scroll.

36
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,020
Didn't you say
there's still the Human Scroll?

37
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,780
Even if there is the Human Scroll,

38
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,180
no one can decipher it.

39
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,860
I triggered the Human Scroll rune
with the Fox Demon before,

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,100
right on the icy bed in his bedchamber.

41
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,420
There must be a way to decipher it.

42
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,300
Yu Li, go in and save him quickly.

43
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,180
We have no time!

44
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,300
If you're lying to me,

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,260
I'll kill you.

46
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:34,980
Open the door!

47
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,060
Master!

48
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,380
Lord Qingchuan.

49
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,900
Yu Li.

50
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm sorry, Master.

51
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,380
There must be another way.

52
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:53,900
Yes, there is.

53
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,900
There's still the Human Scroll.

54
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,460
We can decipher the Human Scroll.

55
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,180
I know there's an icy bed
in the fox's bedchamber.

56
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,500
You want money, don't you?

57
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,180
Don't do it.

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,700
He has money.

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,500
Don't do it.

60
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,820
My only goal

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,660
is to kill the Fox Demon.

62
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,940
But you've destroyed the formation today.

63
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,140
Then don't blame me.

64
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,260
Hold on.

65
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,100
I destroyed the formation.

66
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,260
Just kill me alone.

67
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,140
Don't hurt my master.

68
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,660
You all deserve to die.

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,420
Do you want to kill the Fox Demon?

70
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,220
There is another way.

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,940
She can decipher the Human Scroll.

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,580
Yes.

73
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,620
I can decipher it.

74
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,740
So you can't kill us.

75
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,100
How can I trust you?

76
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,860
If she can't decipher the Human Scroll

77
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,100
within three days,

78
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,540
you can

79
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,260
have our lives.

80
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,860
Alright.

81
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,260
I'll give you three days.

82
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,700
Go quickly.

83
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,180
Master.

84
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,820
Your Majesty.

85
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,940
Your Majesty.

86
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,900
Your Majesty.

87
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm still late.

88
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,620
Why did you turn into stones?

89
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,180
Which one is your head?

90
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,380
Is it this one?

91
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,220
Your Majesty.

92
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,020
I'm sorry

93
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,460
for causing you to end up like this.

94
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,860
It's my fault for betraying you
in this lifetime.

95
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,700
If there's another lifetime,

96
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,180
I'll make it up to you.

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,620
Your Majesty.

98
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,260
No way.

99
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,860
In this lifetime,

100
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,220
you have to stay with me.

101
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,820
Your Majesty.

102
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,220
I'm so glad you're alive.

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,460
I almost died.

104
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,900
What a pity.

105
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,340
Blah...

106
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,060
Nonsense.

107
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,860
It's better to live than to die.

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,020
It's good to be alive.

109
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,180
How did you convince him to stop?

110
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,380
I...

111
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,220
I told him

112
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,900
that life is precious.

113
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,940
Even if you don't cherish his life,

114
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,500
you should cherish your own, right?

115
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,300
Yes.

116
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,220
You should cherish it.

117
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,180
That made him stop.

118
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,020
Your Majesty.

119
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,260
It's a great virtue to correct
what you have done wrong.

120
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,340
Can you please not blame him

121
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,500
and me anymore?

122
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,180
I didn't take him seriously.

123
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,660
Since you pleaded for him,

124
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,900
I'll kill him now.

125
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,020
What kind of logic is that?

126
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,140
No, Your Majesty.

127
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,860
He interrupted the formation
and has been seriously injured.

128
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,700
He won't live for long.

129
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,220
But you've lived so long.

130
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,140
He's just a passer-by in your life.

131
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,660
A speck of dust.

132
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,740
You'd be upset with a speck of dust?

133
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,260
I don't think so.

134
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes, I would.

135
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,060
But..

136
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,580
For your sake,

137
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,740
I'll spare his life for now.

138
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,820
For my sake

139
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,180
to spare him.

140
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,820
That means he has spared me.

141
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,980
♪Who's listening to the faint moaning?♪

142
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,620
♪The dainty fan chases the fireflies
in the sky♪

143
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,220
Master.

144
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,940
I'm fine.

145
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,860
We've sacrificed so much,

146
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,780
and we were so close to success.

147
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,900
Yet, in the end, we failed.

148
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,940
Master.

149
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,140
There must be another way.

150
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,140
Yu Li.

151
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,660
I used to think you were
the last guy who could stop me.

152
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,340
Now, you seem to have changed.

153
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,820
Master.

154
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,660
My loyalty to you

155
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,980
has never changed.

156
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,660
It's impossible for Su Xiaohuan
to decipher the Human Scroll.

157
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Take a chance to escape.

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,180
Master.

159
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,380
No matter what happens,

160
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,380
I'll be with you.

161
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,180
What should I do?

162
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,500
To save Lord Qingchuan,
I must comprehend the Human Scroll.

163
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,660
But if the bad guys
get their hands on the Human Scroll,

164
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,500
the Fox Demon Emperor will...

165
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,100
It's a dilemma.

166
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,260
Let me try to comprehend the Human Scroll

167
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,420
and see what secrets it holds.

168
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,860
Save Lord Qingchuan first.

169
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,140
As for Fox Demon Emperor

170
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,260
whether this method is true or false,

171
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,540
it's up to me.

172
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,740
How should I comprehend the Human Scroll?

173
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
Little scroll, be good.

174
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
I love you!

175
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,340
Show me what you can do.

176
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,700
It doesn't work.

177
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,300
Show me what you can do.

178
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,300
Or I'll burn you!

179
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,980
I'm serious!

180
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,420
My almighty, please empower me at once!

181
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,460
Abracadabra!

182
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,940
It doesn't work either.

183
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,300
Is it the wrong way?

184
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,540
I lost my family at the age of three,

185
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,620
wandered hungry at four,

186
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,460
labored as a child at five,

187
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,460
and was beaten up at ten.

188
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,580
Please have mercy on me, Mr. Human Scroll.

189
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,900
What a cold-hearted being you are.

Your Majesty.

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm cleaning the bed.

193
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,580
You wouldn't

194
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,100
be yearning for that night, would you?

195
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,220
No way.

196
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,820
Since you've been so good lately,

197
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,300
and you saved my life.

198
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I'll give you a reward.
