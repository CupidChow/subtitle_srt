=Episode 2=

3
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,960
Father!

4
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,960
Father.

5
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,439
Father.

6
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,880
(Why?)

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,680
(Why did it turn out like this again?)

8
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,159
Father.

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,079
(Why didn't this change?)

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,280
Chunman.

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
This was really unexpected.

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,599
I didn't expect

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,799
your father
to jump from the second floor.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,519
You can't blame me,

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,599
let alone blame Shizhen.

16
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,200
You two are engaged.

17
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,000
If you cause a scene,

18
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,560
it won't be good for you either.

19
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,420
(May 2nd)

20
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,120
(Even with one more chance,)

21
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,120
(I still couldn't stop Father's death.)

22
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,280
(Does that mean)

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,919
(I'll also die)

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,719
(if I go after Zhou Yisen rashly?)

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,759
(Father left no clues
in my previous life.)

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
(But this time,)

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
(he left me this cufflink.)

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,199
(Could it be the key
to changing my fate?)

29
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,159
(I can't act foolishly
and involve myself again.)

30
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,240
(I'll use Zhou Chi and Gu Shizhen)

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
(to turn on each other)

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,039
(and help me eliminate Zhou Yisen.)

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,719
Today I'll give you

34
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,319
a chance to avenge your father.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,039
Chi.

36
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,560
Zhao Chunman is here.

37
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,719
Got it.

38
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
My condolences.

39
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,360
(To Gu Shizhen)
Gu Shizhen isn't here.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,919
Please pass this to him.

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
I want to break off our engagement.

42
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,860
(To Gu Shizhen)

43
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
You shouldn't call it off just yet.

44
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
This engagement with Shizen

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,879
can protect you and your mother
at the very least.

46
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,319
Are you saying

47
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,560
I should cling to my father's killer
for protection?

48
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,920
No, of course not.

49
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Then tell me.

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,519
Why did Zhou Yisen target our family?

51
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,360
Speak.

52
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,079
Having something blur your vision
feels awful.

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Goodbye.

54
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,639
(No one knows what happened,)

55
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,120
(much less what lies ahead.)

56
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,920
(But I know)

57
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,480
(escaping won't fend off the unknown.)

58
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,560
(Only when my enemies fall)

59
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,360
(will I be truly safe.)

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,399
(To uncover
the truth behind Father's death)

61
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,879
(and take down Zhou Yisen,)

62
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,680
(Zhou Chi and Gu Shizhen)

63
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,279
(are my trump cards.)

64
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,079
(And I myself)

65
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,680
(am the only stake on the table.)

66
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,560
(Zhou Chi.)

67
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,399
(The scarf was my test for you.)

68
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,399
(Now,)

69
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,319
(Welcome to my gamble.)

70
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,920
Come drink some soup.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,439
Oh.

72
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,180
(To Gu Shizhen)

73
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Drumstick.

74
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,439
While you were gone,

75
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,600
Zhao Chunman stopped by.

76
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
You're quick to change.

77
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,279
Weren't you
always calling her "Sister-in-law"?

78
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,160
Don't you have Ms. Luo now?

79
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,839
This way is better.

80
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,079
Saves the embarrassment.

81
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,839
I planned to call off the engagement,

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,879
but I can't let Zhao Chunman
be the one to say it.

83
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,330
If I a woman take the lead
on something like this,

84
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,839
how could I show my face again?

85
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,959
So I'm not

86
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,639
calling it off.

87
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,319
But I won't go through with it either.

88
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,120
Zhen.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,439
Isn't that a bit unfair to her?

90
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
How do I usually treat you?

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,199
Like a real brother.

92
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,000
Exactly.

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Women are like clothes.

94
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Brothers are like limbs.

95
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,199
Chi, with your brawn and my brains,

96
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,600
we're Foster Father's right-hand men.

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,199
Yi Gang and even the whole South City

98
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,560
are what we should really
be focusing on.

99
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,160
It's just a woman.

100
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,600
What fairness?

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
Try this new French wine.

102
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,399
Miss, this looks beautiful on you.

103
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,759
Perfect for a casual encounter.

104
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,559
He.

105
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,399
Are you sure Gu Shizhen arranged
to meet someone from Big Knife Gang

106
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,639
to talk business at the coffee shop?

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,799
It can't be wrong.

108
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,279
Keep searching their preferences.

109
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't worry, Miss.

110
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,240
To be blunt, Ms. Zhao,

111
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,879
all I want is your money.

112
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,919
See

113
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,519
how much you're willing to offer.

114
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,799
Mr. Gu

115
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,440
really have zero sincerity.

116
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,279
No one has ever

117
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,600
tried to haggle with me a second time.

118
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,879
That is my greatest sincerity.

119
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,320
Don't push it.

120
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
In less than six months,

121
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,000
you raised from 10% to 20%.

122
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,279
You're clearly

123
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,639
trying to ruin Big Knife Gang!

124
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,320
What are you doing?

125
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,720
Do you want to give 20% more

126
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
or have Big Knife Gang erased

127
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
from the entire South City?

128
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
It's your call.

129
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,440
Gu Shizhen.

130
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,519
Just wait.

131
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,200
(He's coming.)

132
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,799
Ms. Zhao.

133
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,600
What are you doing?

134
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,559
What reporter?

135
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,080
I think you're just a filthy thug!

136
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,519
You...

137
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,519
Mr. Gu.

138
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:26,960
Scram.

139
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,600
Hey.

140
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,879
Are you alright?

141
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,279
Not thanking me?

142
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,840
Thanks.

143
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,200
My father died right in front of me.

144
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,519
He was killed by Yi Gang.

145
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,759
And you expect me to say thank you?

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,399
Your father's death was an accident.

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,120
I wanted to save him too,

148
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,720
but I was one step too late.

149
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,610
Sign the annulment letter
and give it to me as soon as possible.

150
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,919
(This woman)

151
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,279
(appeared in Father's study)

152
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,159
(before his accident.)

153
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,000
Boss.

154
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,759
Isn't that Gu Shizhen's fiancée?

155
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,000
Follow her.

156
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,380
(Shali Pastry Shop)

157
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,720
This cake's delicious.

158
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,120
Yes.

159
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,960
What?

160
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,919
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

161
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,919
Ms. Zhao.

162
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,639
Scram!

163
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,879
Hurry.

164
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,720
Ms. Zhao.

165
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,639
Come with us.

166
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,919
You're not from Yi Gang.

167
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,720
Pfft.

168
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,440
Yi Gang is nothing.

169
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,679
Besides,

170
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,960
would Yi Gang touch you?

171
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,559
Everyone knows

172
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,720
you're Gu Shizhen's fiancée.

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,519
But this is where your luck ran out.

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,559
Gu Shizhen left me with no way to live.

175
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,960
So we can only use you

176
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,240
to negotiate with him again.

177
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,200
Hurry.

178
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,639
What a nuisance.

179
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,000
Is Big Knife Gang
trying to break the rules?

180
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
You'd better ask

181
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,519
your big brother, Gu Shizhen, first.

182
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Kill him for me!

183
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,080
This is payment for the cakes.

184
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,840
Claim the rest from Yisen Manor.

185
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,039
Who are you?

186
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,440
Why are you following me?

187
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,840
Where's the list?

188
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,440
What list?

189
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,200
Where did you get the cufflink?

190
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Father gave it to me.

191
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,000
He was killed by Zhou Yisen.

192
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,039
Zhao Qingzhai was your father?

193
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,519
Yes.

194
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,600
Meet me at this address on Saturday.

195
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,360
My codename is Yueji.

196
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,159
Out of the way!

197
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,559
Who are you?

198
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,679
Who's blocking the car?

199
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:27,960
Go first.

200
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,039
Does it hurt?

201
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,840
No.

202
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,360
It's for you.

203
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,360
Aren't you going to help me open it?

204
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,120
Sure.

205
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,559
Why are you giving me cake?

206
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,000
You probably
didn't get to eat any this year.

207
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,400
Happy birthday.

208
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,279
How did you know?

209
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,880
Even Gu Shizhen didn't know.

210
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,240
Zhen told me to take good care of you.

211
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,079
So if he hadn't said anything,

212
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,240
you wouldn't have taken care of me?

213
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,440
No.

214
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,359
Yum.

215
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,960
Since you're celebrating my birthday,

216
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,480
you should share it with me.

217
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,359
Times are chaotic outside.

218
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,359
You need to learn to protect yourself.

219
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Some things are too dangerous.

220
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,200
Don't do them.

221
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,160
Protecting yourself

222
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,039
isn't just about avoiding danger.

223
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,359
Eliminating danger counts too.

224
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,759
I'm going home.

225
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,519
Will you send me back?

226
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,359
Sure.

227
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,640
Don't catch a cold.

228
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm home.

229
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,799
Here's your coat.

230
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,119
It's fine. Keep it.

231
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,759
