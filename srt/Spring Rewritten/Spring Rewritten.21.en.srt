3
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,960
Your scarf.

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,119
Thanks.

5
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,879
Chi... Chi.

6
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,359
Open it.

7
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,239
Open it.

8
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,799
Open it!

9
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,519
This is Zhen's warehouse, isn't it?

10
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,159
Chi.

11
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,719
(It really is opium paste.)

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,159
Fulu!

13
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,000
Chi,

14
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,680
what are you doing here?

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,360
Why are you here, Zhen?

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,960
Where's the goods?

17
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,400
They're gone.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,759
What kind of attitude is that?

19
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,719
What do you think

20
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,879
I'm in Yi Gang for?

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,000
I've always wanted to destroy
their drug business.

22
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,080
You robbed the opium

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,599
behind my back.

24
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,159
You have no right to question me.

25
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,199
Besides, I found out

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,319
that Zhou Yisen forced your father
into debt

27
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,479
and made him sell opium.

28
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,960
Then, he sold it to my father.

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
Chunman's father accidentally

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
reported him.

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,879
So...

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,719
So?

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,520
Zhou Yisen has lived too long.

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,879
Mr. Zhou, you asked me
to check the cargo numbers.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,639
It's exactly as you suspected.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,280
You two have grown bold.

37
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,280
Running a warehouse

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
to stash my goods?

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,479
Seems like I've spoiled you too much

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,639
that you've forgotten

41
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,879
I hate betrayal the most.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,639
It's my doing alone.

43
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,520
Really?

44
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,280
You two are tight.

45
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
The more you insist on it,

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
the less I believe it.

47
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm not lying.

48
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,919
Ever since you joined Yi Gang,

49
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,280
you've covered

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,800
for everything he's done.

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
This time,

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
a few kowtows

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,319
won't save you.

54
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,600
Do you still claim

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,519
it was all your idea?

56
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,879
Yes.

57
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,560
It's mine alone.

58
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,680
Very well.

59
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,199
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,319
How dare you?

61
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,879
Throw him in the sea and feed the fish.

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,600
After him.

63
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,639
Yes.

64
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,519
I spent over ten years

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
only to raise such an ingrate.

66
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,600
He actually tried to kill me.

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Foster Father,

68
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,360
calm down.

69
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,160
Chi must've been led astray by someone.

70
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
I'll bring him back

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
and beg for your forgiveness.

72
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,120
Tell me.

73
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,600
What reward do you want this time?

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,399
I have a favor to ask.

75
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,000
Speak.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,959
I want to marry Zhao Chunman
as soon as possible.

77
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,240
That way,

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
it's easier for us to keep
Zhao Qingzhai under our thumb.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,879
Fine.

80
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,319
(Zhao Residence)
Mr. Zhao, Mrs. Zhao,

81
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,279
these are the betrothal gifts I brought.

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Shizhen,

83
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,759
ever since you joined Yi Gang,

84
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,959
we haven't seen you much.

85
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,920
I've also avoided bringing up
this engagement

86
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,600
as I'm worried it might upset you.

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,519
We assumed

88
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,279
you'd forgotten about it.

89
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,360
How could I forget, Mr. Zhao?

90
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,959
I wasn't well-prepared before,

91
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,720
so I felt embarrassed to come.

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,639
Shizhen, I'll be frank with you.

93
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,079
Why don't we

94
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,000
call this engagement off?

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,720
Seems like you've been wanting
to break it all along.

96
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,439
Have you forgotten

97
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,439
how my father died?

98
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,800
About your father's death,

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
I honestly feel bad about it.

100
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,759
But I don't regret it.

101
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,800
What I regret is

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,319
not breaking off

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
the engagement sooner

104
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,560
for fear of gossip.

105
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Why do you want to break it off?

106
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,439
Is it because

107
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm an orphan?

108
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,690
Or do you think
this betrothal gift isn't enough?

109
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,519
Of course not.

110
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,959
Mr. Zhao,

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,160
I'm not doing this only for myself.

112
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,959
The boss is watching you now.

113
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,310
Foster Father is just following orders.

114
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,720
As for me,

115
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,839
I only want to hold the wedding

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
with Chunman soon,

117
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
so we can become a family

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,000
and I can protect you better.

119
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,959
I may have no power or influence,

120
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,399
but I'm no coward,

121
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,040
and I won't

122
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,199
let anyone control me easily.

123
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
I won't even trade my daughter
for safety.

124
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
So you mean

125
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,920
to stand against Yi Gang?

126
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,519
I agree to the marriage.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Man.

128
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,399
But our wedding

129
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,320
must be officiated by Zhou Yisen.

130
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,080
Uh...

131
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,679
Today,

132
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,279
I, Zhou Yisen, will witness this union

133
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,200
of the groom, Gu Shizhen,

134
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,519
and the bride, Zhao Chunman.

135
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,879
You are now husband and wife.

136
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,600
- Good!
- Good!

137
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,679
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

138
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,200
Kiss!

139
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,120
Man.

140
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,279
Chi.

141
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,639
Zhen,

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,120
didn't you say

143
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,559
women are obstacles to success?

144
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,039
What are you doing?

145
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,639
What are you getting at, Zhou Chi?

146
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,399
Zhen.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
Zhou Yisen is dead.

148
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,200
(Tamamo)
It's Mr. Tamamo's badge.

149
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,440
Why would Chi have it?

150
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,360
Could it be that the boss
values him more?

151
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,120
Zhen,

152
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,000
now that you have a wife,

153
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,720
you've got a weakness.

154
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,159
There are things you're no longer
fit to handle.

155
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,960
What do you mean?

156
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,600
The boss and Mr. Tamamo
prefer me more.

157
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,200
From today on,

158
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,720
Yi Gang will be under my command.

159
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,759
Good!

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,879
From now on, we follow Chi.

161
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,440
Yes.

162
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,399
We all follow Chi.

163
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

164
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,200
- We'll follow you, Chi.
- We'll follow you, Chi.

165
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,039
(This time,)

166
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,240
(Zhou Chi and Gu Shizhen
turn out differently.)
