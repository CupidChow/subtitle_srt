3
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,560
Who's there?

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
It's me.

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,359
It's late now.
Why didn't you turn the light on?

6
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,200
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm looking for something.

8
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,200
What? Do I even need to report to you?

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,879
Come see me in my room.

10
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,920
Hmm.

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,480
If I don't ask,

12
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,319
you don't have to explain.

13
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,719
But don't let it happen again.

14
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,879
I'm heading out.

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,519
(Zhou Chi,)

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,560
(you know I'm using you.)

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,079
(Why do you let me off every time?)

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,159
(Is it because you killed my father)

19
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,959
(and you're helping me out of guilt?)

20
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,760
Send Zhao Chunman away now.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,519
If Foster Father finds out,
we're finished.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Foster Father?

23
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,519
You're scared of him?

24
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,879
Does he know
you've been stealing his goods?

25
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,680
How do you know about that?

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,199
Doesn't matter how.

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,840
What you should worry about is

28
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,800
if I know,

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,879
he'll too.

30
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,759
Whatever the case,

31
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,080
I see you as my brother.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
I don't want to see you in trouble.

33
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,479
I'll send Zhao Chunman away.

34
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,400
(Zhao Residence)
Go back and rest up.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,599
Watch your wound.

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,479
I owe you again.

37
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,080
It's fine.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
You can repay me slowly.

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,120
Didn't you save me once, too?

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
You want to stop here?

41
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,280
Go on in.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,520
Is it you, Man?

43
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,120
Yes, it's me, Mother.

44
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,159
Who's that?

45
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
A friend.

46
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,520
Shouldn't you invite him

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
to our place?

48
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,680
Man, call him in.

49
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,439
Your mother's really kind.

50
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,120
But if she knew

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,759
you shot my father,

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,039
she wouldn't be.

(Zhao Residence)

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,800
I didn't mean to kill him.

Once Father's case is settled,

91
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,600
I'll cut ties with them for good.

that tonight the Rose Organization

112

00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,879
(Search all guests there)

116
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,480
(and find the list.)

117
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,679
Mr. Zhou wants you to investigate
all guests,

118
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,000
especially

119
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,559
Luo Yu

120
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,600
and Zhao Chunman.

121
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you all for your kindness.

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,559
The ball officially starts now.

123
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,600
Wishing you a wonderful evening.

124
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,519
Mr. Gu, may I dance with you?

125
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,279
Dance with Zhao Chi.

126
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes.

127
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,559
Chi, may I dance with you?

128
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,240
Look at me. I'm your partner now.

129
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,879
(The bouquet is gone.)

130
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,679
Are you looking for someone?

131
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,039
You've seemed distracted all night.

132
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,399
Thank you,
but I don't need your concern.

133
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,679
What's wrong with you, Luo Yu?

134
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,480
Luo Yu?

135
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,200
Why are you crowding around here?

136
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,519
Disperse. Shoo!

137
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,279
Stop gawking.

138
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,279
Gu Shizhen said
you're a rose with thorns.

139
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
Thorns can hurt others,

140
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,679
but they can hurt yourself, too.

141
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,600
Gu Shizhen said that

142
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
because I'm his fiancée.

143
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,440
Who are you to judge me?

144
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,440
A sidepiece
who stole her best friend's man?

145
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,320
The one who isn't loved
is the real sidepiece.

146
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,559
Goodness!

147
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,879
Isn't that Zhou Chi from Yi Gang
she just hit?

148
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,320
This is going to be complicated.

149
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,200
Zhao Chunman,
how dare you throw water on me?

150
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,759
Is your arm all right?

151
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,600
Gu Shizhen,

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,120
look how he protected her woman.

153
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,840
And you?

154
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
Who said you're my woman?

155
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,759
You two-timer jerk! Shameless!

156
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,759
Get lost.

157
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,039
Come with me.

158
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,960
Two good friends fighting over a man.

159
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,090
Two buddies fighting over a woman.

160
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,559
What a show.

161
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,320
It hurts a little. Bear with it.

162
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,720
Did you finish donating the money?

163
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,480
Yes, done.

164
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,799
Get your wound treated and leave fast.

165
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,519
It's not safe here tonight.

166
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,519
I know.

167
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,279
I'm heading out.

168
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,639
You should go.

169
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,720
What are you doing here?

170
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,399
Are you okay?

171
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,440
Sorry, I hit you hard.

172
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,879
Don't fake concern.

173
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,759
You...

174
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,519
You're Rose?

175
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,279
Man, I'm sorry.

176
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,639
I must've upset you for so long.

177
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
Do you mean Gu Shizhen?

178
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,440
You know

179
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,639
that's not what I really care about.

180
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,200
I know.

181
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,159
You're upset because I betray you.

182
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,360
The organization ordered me
to approach him.

183
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I never wanted to drag you into this.

184
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,039
I didn't know

185
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,519
you'd been involved all along.

186
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,679
So you and my father

187
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,320
kept me in the dark this whole time?

188
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,600
That's the rule.

189
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,440
No one can reveal their identity

190
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,879
except to the liaison.

191
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,519
Your father and I planned

192
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,799
to hand over the list at Yuchun Theater.

193
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,919
But Yi Gang has been watching
the Zhao family.

194
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,159
I've decoded the list.

195
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,240
Keep it safe.

196
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,720
I will.

197
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,120
Don't worry, Man.

198
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,639
Man, you must leave now.

199
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,960
Yi Gang showing up here is a bad sign.

200
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,000
I know.

201
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,159
You should leave, too.

202
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,759
Hmm.

203
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,039
Be careful.

204
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:05,960
Okay.

205
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,880
(Looks like it was Luo Yu's mission
in the previous life)

206
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,200
(to seduce Gu Shizhen at Yuchun Theater)

207
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,559
(and hand over the list.)

208
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,080
You're in such a rush.

209
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
Where are you going?

210
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,519
Where's Zhao Chunman?

211
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,879
I'm looking for her.

212
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,200
We're not done yet.

213
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,399
Forget her.

214
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,360
Let's talk first.

215
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,960
What are you doing?

216
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,559
(Gu Shizhen took Luo Yu away.)

217
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
(Will something happen to her?)

218
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,879
(I couldn't change my father's fate.)

219
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,919
(I can't let Luo Yu die either.)

220
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,279
What are you doing, Shizhen?

221
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,679
You told me to get lost earlier,

222
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,600
and now you're grabbing me.

223
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,919
Say it.

224
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,039
What have you done?

225
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,799
Zhou Yisen told me
to keep an eye on you.

226
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,919
How would I possibly know
why he's watching me?

227
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,600
If he really is,

228
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,639
he can just have you marry me,

229
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,720
and let him watch me
right under his nose.

230
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,519
Zhao Chunman's still here.

231
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,879
What if she sees us?

232
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,279
Isn't that exactly

233
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,879
what you want?

234
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,359
(This feels so familiar.)

235
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
(Last time at Yuchun Theater,)

236
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,599
(Zhen and Luo Yu were in the room,)

237
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,559
(and Zhao Chunman went looking for him.)

238
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,990
(So what happened at Richard Hotel
isn't the real end?)

239
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,160
(When will the end point be in this life then?)

240
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,279
(No.)

241
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,960
Stop, Zhao Chunman.

242
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,720
Zhou Chi, what are you trying to do?

243
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,640
It's dangerous here.

244
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,640
Leave right now.

245
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,400
I know,

246
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,359
but I have to save Luo Yu.

247
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,559
You want to save her, and I want to save you.

248
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,240
If you're here to avenge
your father's death,

249
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,079
you'd better stop now.

250
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,279
Move.

251
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,480
Move.
