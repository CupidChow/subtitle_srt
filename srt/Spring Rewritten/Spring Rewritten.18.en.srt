3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,759
Let go of me!

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
You're tempting

5
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,240
than ever.

6
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,120
Gu Shizhen.

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Hands off me!

8
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,120
Don't touch me! Let go!

9
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,439
Chi...

10
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,879
Chi...

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,239
Take a good look.

12
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,239
Who is on top of you?

13
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,080
Kill me if you can, Zhou Chi!

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,479
Zhao Chunman has always been mine!

15
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,639
Let go!

16
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,840
Zhou Chi!

17
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,080
Go ahead and kill me!

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,159
You rascal!

19
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,879
Zhou Chi!

20
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,560
What do you want?

21
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,200
You're not the only one
who know how to drug people.

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
Have a taste of your own medicine.

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,919
Well...

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,960
Kill me.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,439
Kill me if you can!

26
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,599
Let go! Let go of me!

27
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,280
Chunman!

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Chi...

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,039
I feel so bad.

30
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,439
Hang in there.

31
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,919
I'll help you with it.

32
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,919
Chi...

33
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,039
I feel so bad.

34
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
No, that won't do.

35
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,080
Have a shower to sober yourself up.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,719
Help me.

37
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,879
Where's Zhao Qiuling?

38
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,600
Zhao Chunman.

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,639
Zhao Chunman is at the warehouse
on the outskirts of the city.

40
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,639
Give me the car keys.

41
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:05,079
Zhao Chunman... Zhao Chunman!

42
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,079
Qiuling!

43
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,639
Qiuling!

44
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,879
Why are you here?

45
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Man.

46
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,000
I've done you and our parents wrong.

47
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,600
Qiuling.

48
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
I know it all.

49
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,319
Qiuling.

50
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,839
Mother.

51
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,360
Mother.

52
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,439
Qiuling?

53
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,839
Mother.

54
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,839
Qiuling!

55
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,199
I wasn't a traitor.

56
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,480
I didn't bring our family shame.

57
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,160
Mother.

58
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,360
As long as you're home.

59
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
As long as you're home.

60
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,480
As long as you're home.

61
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,519
I'll make you something to eat.

62
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,600
Mother.

63
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,519
We need to go now.

64
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,720
It's dangerous here.

65
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,800
We're leaving?

66
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,360
Ma'am.

67
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,759
You could stay at my place for now.

68
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,279
Sure.

69
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
Come.

70
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Let's go.

71
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,080
Are you alright, Qiuling?

72
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,919
You shouldn't be moving

73
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,759
in this condition.

74
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
Our last meal

75
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,000
together

76
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,639
was fifteen years ago.

77
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,919
Back then, my father
hadn't started using opium.

78
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,080
The worst is behind us.

79
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,360
No matter how things were,

80
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,879
you and Man

81
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,679
will only get better from here.

82
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,799
Let go of the bad memories.

83
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,039
Try the noodles I made.

84
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,120
Mother.

85
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,559
After lunch,

86
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,279
Chi and I will go pick up some supplies.

87
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,360
Be careful.

88
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,279
Don't worry, ma'am.

89
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,320
I've got this.

90
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,799
Let's dig in.

91
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,639
Are you satisfied with the goods, Morita?

92
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,559
I am.

93
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,399
So Zhao Qiuling

94
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
has been a mole
working for you all these years.

95
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,320
How do you feel about that?

96
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,600
Gu.

97
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,759
Are you mocking me?

98
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,159
Of course not.

99
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,840
What I want to say is,

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
in South City,

101
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,159
only I am your best partner.

102
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,279
I've also heard

103
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,039
that the King of Hearts

104
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,440
was your buddy,

105
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,399
Zhou Chi.

106
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,399
That's why we should join hands.

107
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,799
To a successful partnership.

108
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,159
To a successful partnership.

109
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,740
(Ready-to-Wear Boutique)

110
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,559
Run!

111
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,440
After them!

112
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
Over here!

113
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,399
Stop!

114
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,919
Quick, they're up there!

115
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,639
Hurry!

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,840
Quick! After them!

117
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,279
Go! Go! Go!

118
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,519
Qiuling!

119
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,120
Take her!

120
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
Qiuling!

121
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,720
Go!

122
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,480
Chunman!

123
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,840
Qiuling!

124
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,240
Go!

125
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,039
Gu Shizhen...

126
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,879
Qiuling...

127
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,159
Hurry... Go.

128
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,919
They won't get far. After them!

129
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,879
Go...

130
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,240
Qiuling!

131
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,679
Qiuling!

132
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,679
Let's go!

133
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,080
They're catching up! Let's go now!

134
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,240
Qiuling!
