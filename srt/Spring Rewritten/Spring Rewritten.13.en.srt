3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,439
Rest up early.

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,880
I'll sew the button back on your shirt.

5
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,680
Chi.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,079
Rise and shine. Get out of bed.

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,439
Mrs. Zhao,

8
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,280
let me help you.

9
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,719
(Luo Yu still died.)

10
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,360
(Even Yueji is dead.)

11
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,919
(But Zhou Yisen is still alive.)

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,199
(Have things really changed?)

13
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,000
(Or have I)

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,599
(made it worse?)

15
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,919
(If Zhou Yisen doesn't die,)

16
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,479
(how long can this peace last?)

17
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Add more angelica root.

18
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,319
Okay.

19
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,159
He's waiting for you.

20
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,959
This is the doll from that day.

21
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,000
Why are you here alone?

22
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Well,

23
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,639
Su Ruan's got a new performance.

24
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Do you want to go see it?

25
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,000
Sure.

26
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
Come on. Get on.

27
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,680
Let's go.

28
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Get on.

29
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,000
Am I heavy?

30
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Nope.

31
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,319
Hold on tight.

Jeez, I just peeled it.

Chunman and I came to see your new play.

45
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Alright.

46
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,560
Go wait downstairs.

47
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,439
Don't make a fuss here.

48
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,199
Go on.

49
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,480
We'll head down first then.

50
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,319
Mm.

51
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,959
We came to the right place, didn't we?

52
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,639
Yeah.

53
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,199
It's really good.

54
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,759
Her singing.

55
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,840
I've wanted to give you this hair clip

56
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,879
for a long time.

57
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,039
How long's a long time?

58
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,080
Since the year I met you.

59
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,960
I got your hair clip back

60
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,039
from them.

61
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,420
(Five silver coins)

62
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
But it got stepped on.

63
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,679
I've wanted to buy

64
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,159
one just like it for you.

65
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,240
I'll answer your question now.

66
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,159
Yes.

67
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,360
It can be me.

68
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,600
But now, I want to ask you.

69
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,159
Can it be me?

70
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,639
Aren't you going to put it on for me?

71
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
Does it look nice?

72
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,440
Yes.

73
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,440
What brings you here?

74
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,039
Give it back to me.

75
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,639
Give it back.

76
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,320
(Zhao Residence)

77
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,799
Tofu for sale!

78
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,720
Miss, would you like some tofu?

79
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,480
Mister, I'll take two.

80
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Sure.

81
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,580
Here you are.

82
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,919
Thank you.

83
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,720
Sure.

84
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,440
Tofu! Tofu for sale!

85
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,660
(Find the list at theater backstage
and move it out)

86
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,360
(It's Yuchun Theater again.)

87
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,200
(Everything's back to square one.)

88
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,039
(Tomorrow,)

89
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,000
(can I escape fate this time?)

90
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,639
(Father risked his life to protect
the list.)

91
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,320
(I must go.)

92
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,320
The boss is putting on pressure now.

93
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,279
You know who's backing him.

94
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,000
We have to deal with

95
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,559
the Rose Organization.

96
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,080
After Yueji died,

97
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,320
they've been quieter.

98
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,000
We need to find the right chance

99
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,080
to lure them out.

100
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,679
That's easy.

101
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,559
Don't they want me dead?

102
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,039
Let's do it

103
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,240
at Yuchun Theater.

104
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,120
We suspected that place before anyway.

105
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,120
(Everything feels like
it's back to the starting point.)

106
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,600
(But what about Zhou Chi?)

107
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,799
(Will he go tomorrow?)

108
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
(Will he be in danger?)

109
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
(Maybe)

110
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,320
(he shouldn't show up there tomorrow.)

111
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,639
(Maybe she should show up there)

112
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
(tomorrow.)

113
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,060
(Zhao Residence)

114
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,559
Heading out?

115
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,080
Yes.

116
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,240
I need to handle something.

117
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,360
What's it?

118
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
Yi Gang's business?

119
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,600
No.

120
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,840
Well.

121
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
Stay home

122
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,399
with me today.

123
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,240
Don't go anywhere.

124
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,000
Mrs. Zhao, the scissors broke.

125
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
I'll go buy a new pair.

126
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,600
No need.

127
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,799
There's another one here.

128
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:42,919
Mrs. Zhao,

129
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,480
the weather's getting cooler.

130
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,279
I'll go to the tailor's

131
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,840
and have a few pieces made for you.

132
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,360
Didn't we just have some made yesterday?

133
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,159
That's enough to wear.

134
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,559
Good. As long as you have enough.

135
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
I'll go take a shower.

136
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,919
Mother, I'll make dinner.

137
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,320
What's with them today?

138
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,480
They're acting so strange.

139
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
