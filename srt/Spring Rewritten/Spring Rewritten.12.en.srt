=Episode 12=

3
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:43,960
Zhao Chunman.

4
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,520
What do you want to say?

5
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,320
I didn't kill your father.

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,879
About his death,

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,560
I didn't mean to kill him.

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,359
It was Gu Shizhen.

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,079
Hmm.

10
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,840
Remember the day we swore brotherhood?

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,079
Ten years ago,
right here in this church,

12
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,319
we became sworn brothers.

13
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,799
Let's do it here, Chi.

14
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,879
Isn't this a church?

15
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,800
Why are we doing it here?

16
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,280
Shouldn't Chinese brothers swear
in a temple?

17
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,319
Why here?

18
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,039
Chinese deities

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,120
must be busy these days.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,479
Foreign gods seem freer.

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,639
Does it count
without a priest's witness, then?

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,599
Just go through the motion.

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,120
It's not like we really
worship foreign gods.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I, Gu Shizhen.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I, Zhou Chi.

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
From today on,

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,400
I swear brotherhood with Zhou Chi.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,879
From today on,

29
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,319
I swear brotherhood with Gu Shizhen.

30
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm the elder brother.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
He's the elder brother.

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
Starting today,

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
if I have a bite to eat,

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,719
he has too.

35
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,639
Starting today,

36
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,639
we share blessings and hardships together.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,039
- Until death.
- Until death.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,039
We shouldn't have come.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
It's snowing hard.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
Fish are frozen solid.

41
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,199
We can't eat them.

42
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,280
Looks like we're going to
freeze to death here.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
I'm sorry, Zhen.

44
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,919
I only know how to fish.

45
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,840
It's fine. As long as we're still alive,

46
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,039
we'll succeed one day.

47
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,759
Warmer now?

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
I promise you,

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,560
someday,

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
we'll have our own turf

51
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,960
and call the shots.

52
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,439
I believe you.

53
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,879
It's my fault

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
for smuggling cigarettes
behind your back.

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,000
But Chi,

56
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,079
are you really giving up
our fifteen-year brotherhood

57
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,439
over a woman?

58
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,439
As long as you give Zhao Chunman back
to me,

59
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,399
we'll still be brothers.

60
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,120
Gu Shizhen,

61
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,439
you still think

62
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,439
Zhao Chunman is the reason

63
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,800
we ended up like this?

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Who else, if not her?

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,920
How did we meet?

66
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,680
You sent Fulu and Shouxi to beat me up,

67
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,839
then you swooped in to rescue me.

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,600
And how did we get into Yi Gang?

69
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,720
I almost lost my hand that time.

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,399
To you,

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,800
everyone and everything

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,040
can be gained through scheming.

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,920
Yes.

74
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,639
I planned it all.

75
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,079
But Chi,

76
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,839
haven't I treated you well?

77
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,199
Have I ever cut you out of anything good

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,879
or kept them from you?

79
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,120
Haven't I loved you enough
as a brother?

80
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,079
You call that love?

81
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,800
Why isn't it love?

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,199
Everyone keeps saying I don't know love.

83
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,519
Then what is love?

84
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,519
I gave you all
what I thought was most precious to me.

85
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,000
Why isn't that love?

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,319
You shouldn't use love as an excuse

87
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,439
to lie and deceive.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,240
I did it for us.

89
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,879
Stop lying to yourself.

90
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,199
You did it for you.

91
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,199
You knew about

92
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,480
the warehouse long ago,

93
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,279
but for the sake of brotherhood,

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,879
you didn't expose me.

95
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,560
Now you're turning on me

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,920
just because of Zhao Chunman.

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,399
Remember this.

98
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,879
We're done

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,639
because of a woman.

100
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,000
I told you,

101
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,639
this has nothing to do with her.

102
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,920
Your stuff is outside.

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
Take it

104
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,439
and go.

105
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,639
Get lost!

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,399
I promised you

107
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,639
we'd make something out of ourselves,

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,199
and I kept my word.

109
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,240
But you've strayed from me.

110
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,639
Cigarette smuggling.

111
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,480
You'd better quit now.

112
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,720
I heard Fulu was killed.

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,360
Yes. Likely by the Big Knife Gang.

114
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,000
Why would they kill him?

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
It wasn't Fulu they wanted to kill.

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
It was me.

117
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,839
I pushed their price down too far,

118
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,399
they've hated me since.

119
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,319
And you?

120
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,519
Fulu sold out your secret warehouse.

121
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,560
Didn't you hate him?

122
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,319
Of course not.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,839
Besides, I don't have a warehouse
to begin with.

124
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,519
There's nothing to hate him for.

125
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,560
I was wrong about you last time.

126
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,560
But even if you had killed Fulu,

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,519
I'd still have you back.

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,759
Warehouse or not,

129
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,800
it's true that he sold you out.

130
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,920
Since he betrayed you,

131
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,360
he deserved to die, right?

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,959
Right.

133
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,560
Between Zhao Chunman and Zhou Chi,

134
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,959
who matters more to you?

135
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
Yi Gang.

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,959
And between Yi Gang and South City?

137
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,399
Foster Father.

138
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,240
The boss is in South City now.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
We need to move fast
on that Rose Organization list.

140
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,279
This is our chance

141
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,720
to prove ourselves to the boss.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,759
What are you doing here?

143
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,840
What are those?

144
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,879
Everything I own.

145
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,159
Gu Shizhen threw me out of the manor.

146
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,720
Because of you.

147
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,919
Isn't this your own decision?

148
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,519
Why are you blaming me now?

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,440
I have nowhere to go.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,159
Nowhere?

151
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,399
You can go to hotels or casinos.

152
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,080
If not,

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,639
you can go to Yuchun Theater.

154
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
Why come here?

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,279
What's with that look?

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,159
Zhao Chunman.

157
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,879
What?

158
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,480
I saved your life.

159
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,519
Is this how you treat your savior?

160
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,720
That's not right. People will talk.

161
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,279
Since when do you care

162
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,679
about gossip?

163
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,639
Or are you hoping Gu Shizhen

164
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,320
takes you away again?

165
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,840
Think of me as a tenant.

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,679
I'll pay rent.

167
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,360
If so, remember what you said.

168
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,879
Mother.

169
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,440
Mrs. Zhao.

170
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,200
We don't welcome

171
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Yi Gang.

172
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,879
I don't have to sleep inside.

173
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,960
I can sleep outside.

174
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,399
Mother, he saved me.

175
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,559
Let him stay in the storeroom.

176
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,320
Mother.

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,919
That's okay.

178
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
The storeroom is pretty good.

179
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,720
You're dirty.

180
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,759
Go take a shower.

181
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,000
Are all Yi Gang gangsters

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,159
this messy?

183
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,039
Get him some clean clothes.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,240
Here's your pillow.

185
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,480
Okay.

186
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,679
(March 2, rainy)

187
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,840
(Your shoes get wet whenever it rains.)

188
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,399
(Luckily, I put some bricks
before you came.)

189
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,000
(You saw me today, didn't you?)

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,120
(Wonder if you remember me.)
