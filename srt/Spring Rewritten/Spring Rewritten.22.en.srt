=Episode 22=

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Why did you kill Foster Father?

4
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,719
Didn't you say

5
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,280
he had his eyes on our family?

6
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,519
So I had no choice but to strike first.

7
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,359
Why do you have that?

8
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,359
If not me,

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,760
then who should have it?

10
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,799
I mean

11
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,599
the King of Hearts is the hero I admire.

12
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,000
I never expected

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,319
to see his mask here.

14
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,159
Isn't that natural to get to know

15
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,280
my lover's preferences?

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,439
Thank you.

17
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,840
I need to go take care of something.

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,039
Wait for me at home.

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,840
Sure.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,240
(How come Gu Shizhen knows?)

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
(Why did Gu Shizhen lock the door?)

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
Step back.

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,080
Chi?

24
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,719
The officiant is dead.

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,639
This wedding doesn't count.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Please leave the mansion immediately.

27
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,080
The ceremony is complete.

28
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm now your sister-in-law.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,599
Chi.

30
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,560
Well...

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,480
Whether you want me
to stay out of your way

32
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,400
or you're afraid for me,

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
you know it well.

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,319
Don't flatter yourself.

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,159
Do you recognize this?

36
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,620
How much longer
are you going to pretend?

37
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,360
Cut it out.

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,400
Now I run Yi Gang.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,400
So get out!

40
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,240
You need not kick her out.

41
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,639
I'll take her away.

42
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,520
No way.

43
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,719
Why not?

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,680
She's my wife now.

45
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,120
And you've got Yi Gang now.

46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,319
What more do you want?

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
Pack your stuff.

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
We're leaving the mansion.

49
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,319
Gu Shizhen.

50
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,279
Do you even have anywhere to go
outside the mansion?

51
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Gu Shizhen.

52
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,879
I'll walk on my own.

53
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,519
Let me go!

54
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,920
Gu Shizhen, what are you doing?

55
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,160
Drop the act.

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,759
What do you mean?

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
I've had enough of it all.

58
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,279
I remember everything.

59
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,920
So do you.

60
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,199
Zhou Chi remembers too, doesn't he?

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,759
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,920
I don't understand.

63
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,800
All of you betrayed me in the past life.

64
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,319
In this lifetime,

65
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,319
I want every one of you
to pay the price!

66
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
Yi Gang

67
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,199
and you.

68
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,319
I want it all.

69
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,920
Say you love me.

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
(Zhao Chunman.)

71
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,000
(You're as stubborn in this life.)

72
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,759
(However,)

73
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,800
(you're now mine.)

74
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,360
Let's see how long
he can keep up the act.

75
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,759
