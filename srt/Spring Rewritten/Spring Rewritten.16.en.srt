3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,359
Serve them right.

4
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,280
That's karma.

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,240
They deserve to die.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,880
Heaven sees all!

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,500
(Brutal. Merciless. Unrighteous)

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,679
Congratulations, Mr. Gu.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,960
- Congratulations, Mr. Gu.
- Congratulations, Mr. Gu.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,439
The 800 members of Qingmu Hall
swear loyalty to you.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,399
Baihua Hall also swear loyalty to you.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
I thought you wouldn't come.

13
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,840
How could I not?

14
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,959
You invited me.

15
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,319
Of course I have to be here.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,040
We promised to witness

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,879
each other's glorious moments.

18
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,280
Congrats.

19
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,079
Stay for dinner.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,599
No.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
I'll have it at home.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,560
What?

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,719
Can't wait to see Zhao Chunman?

24
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:37,840
There's someone here

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,319
you might want to see.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Qiuling?

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,879
Miss, buy a bouquet?

28
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,560
Please buy a bouquet of flowers.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,599
No thanks.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,919
Come, Shouxi.

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,599
Give my hat back, thief!

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,639
Chi.

33
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,360
Give it back to me.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,719
Catch it.

35
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,000
Run!

36
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,520
Thief.

37
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm not a thief.

38
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,439
Right.

39
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,280
You're not a thief.

40
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,759
You were just robbing.

41
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,879
Sorry, I didn't know.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,759
You're able-bodied.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,639
You can make an honest living.

44
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,039
Stealing or cheating

45
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,080
isn't the right thing to do.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,319
Thank you.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,199
Go shine shoes
outside the Richard Hotel.

48
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,240
You'll find wealthy people there.

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,639
Take this money
and buy yourself some decent clothes.

50
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,120
Give the hat back.

51
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,560
Miss.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,039
He's just a kid. He doesn't know any better.

53
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,800
No one ever taught him.

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,599
Don't hold it against him.

55
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,280
I'm sorry about that.

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,180
Pay me back once you earn money.

57
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,960
Qiuling.

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,840
This is who I really am.

59
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,400
I trust you, Chi.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,240
Take me home.

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,879
I want to watch them

62
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,080
from afar.

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,560
I'll carry you.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,080
Qiuling, we're almost there.

65
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,919
Hang in there.

66
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,599
Qiuling.

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Qiuling.

68
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,919
Stop spraying, Man.

69
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,039
Mother.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
Let me give your clothes a spray.

71
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,000
That's too much.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
The smell's already all over me.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
Man, where did you get this perfume?

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,839
It's so pungent.

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,759
It's way too strong.

76
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,879
You and your father always like

77
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,920
this kind of new stuff.

78
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,480
Doctor.

79
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,879
Doctor.

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,120
Quick. Bring him over there.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
He's not Qiuling anymore.

82
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,600
This is Mr. Tamamo,

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,279
the boss's favorite.

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,839
(Qiuling disappeared for so long.)

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,639
(How did he end up like this?)

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Congratulations.

87
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,319
You got what you wanted.

88
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,959
I'm still far from what I want.

89
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,639
Zhao Qiuling,

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
why can't I meet the boss yet?

91
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,800
Haven't you been putting in
a good word for me?

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,839
Are you doubting me now?

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
You know

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
my patience has a limit.

95
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,240
That's why you deliberately arranged
for Zhou Chi to come here.

96
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,680
If Zhao Chunman knew

97
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,319
who you are now,

98
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,519
she'd be even more shocked

99
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,160
and hate you more than Chi.

100
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,759
Last time you promised goods
for the boss,

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
but I haven't seen them yet.

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
Bring them to me.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,920
Now that Zhou Yisen's dead,

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,560
not just the goods,

105
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,439
even the list,

106
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,600
I can hand them over.

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,319
But you have to pick them up yourself.

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
Go wash your hands. It's time to eat.

109
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Why is it you?

110
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,959
Where's Zhou Chi?

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
Why can't it be me?

112
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,959
You two made up pretty fast.

113
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,399
We are never on bad terms.

114
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,160
After my mother passed,

115
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,959
I haven't eaten a woman's cooking
in a long time.

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,319
Help yourself.

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,720
But leave after you eat.

118
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,040
Sit down

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,399
and eat with me.

120
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,920
I don't eat with lackeys.

121
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,759
What did you say?

122
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,319
I said

123
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,959
you're a lackey.

124
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,519
Do you still want to see Chi?

125
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,199
Come with me somewhere after we eat.

126
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,079
Let go. I can walk on my own.

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,319
Mr. Gu,

128
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,600
Zhou Chi escaped.

129
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,040
Shizhen,

130
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
I'll take the goods.

131
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,040
Sure, go ahead.

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,000
Mr. Tamamo.

133
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,120
Wait.

134
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,600
Your glasses are dirty, Mr. Tamamo.

135
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,399
Wipe them.

136
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,080
Thank you.

137
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,559
Mr. Morita,

138
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,080
the goods have been taken care of.

139
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,679
Who's there?

140
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,639
Stop. You're not allowed in.

141
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,970
What are you doing here?

142
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,519
Since you wouldn't recommend me,

143
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,600
I had to come myself.

144
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,039
I'm Gu Shizhen of Yi Gang.

145
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
Greetings, sir.

146
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,360
A guest is a guest.

147
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,480
Mr. Gu,

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
please have a seat.

149
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,200
I'd like to invite Mr. Morita

150
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,399
to enjoy an opera performance.

151
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,420
(Mr. Morita)

152
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,360
(You're invited to tea and opera
at Yuchun Theater)

153
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,759
Yuchun Theater?

154
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
I know.

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,600
The famous performer, Su Ruan.

156
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,879
What play is it?

157
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
A play that brings us

158
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,879
the Rose Organization list.

159
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,440
Mother.

160
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,879
Man,

161
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,159
can you open the door?

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
Mother,

163
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,519
let me offer incense for Father, please.

164
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,130
I have no traitor for a brother.

165
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,799
Mother and Father have no traitor
for a son either.

166
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,679
Mother.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,559
Go ahead and be your Mr. Tamamo.

168
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,559
Sorry.

169
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,720
Man,

170
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,480
South City is dangerous.

171
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,279
You and Mother must be very careful.

172
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
My name is Su Ruan

173
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,080
from Yuchun Theater.

174
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,679
If you ever want to watch an opera,

175
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,679
come find me there.

176
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,080
Sure.

177
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,159
See you next time, Miss.

178
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,080
Hmm.

179
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,039
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

180
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,360
It's done.

181
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,240
I wonder

182
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,600
what in this world

183
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,720

193

Then why did you come?

194
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,799
We all thought you were dead.

195
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,600
Ruan,

196
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,360
you're in danger now.

197
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,039
Leave as quickly as you can.

198
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm not leaving.

199
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
If I leave,

200
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,080
I lose my homeland.

201
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,960

you chose to side with Gu Shizhen?

I've already died

205
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,120
a noble death.

That's why

207
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,120

became you.

Now that I'm back,

212
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,279
you don't have to continue that.

213
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
This path is too dangerous.
