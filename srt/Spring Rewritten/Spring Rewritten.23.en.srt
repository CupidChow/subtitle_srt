3
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,319
Good morning.

4
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:10,840
Good morning.

5
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,319
Here, I'll put it on for you.

6
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,000
Sure.

7
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Does it look good on me?

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,079
It does.

9
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,040
Good morning, Father.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,359
Good morning, Mr. Zhao.

11
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,080
Someone's in for a treat.

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,240
It's crab roe buns
from Sihai Restaurant!

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,280
There's also

14
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,039
shaobing from Fengqing Road.

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,080
These youtiao
are from the corner stall.

16
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,360
Zhou went out early to get these for you.

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
He just knew you liked these

18
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,960
without asking me.

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
It's only been a day.

20
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,360
What's there to make a fuss about?

21
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,719
I've been buying you food for decades.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,400
But I never once heard a compliment.

23
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,439
How did you know?

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,400
I'll tell you later.

25
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,719
Come on, have a seat.

26
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:01,960
Sit.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
Zhou Chi.

28
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,120
You said

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,080
you and the Yi Gang

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,719
will never serve the Japanese again.

31
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,199
Do keep your promise.

32
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,120
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

33
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,879
I never go back on my word.

34
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,439
Father.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
If you can't trust Zhou Chi,

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,159
you can at least trust King of Hearts.

37
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,000
Zhao.

38
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,680
Mm.

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,479
Let's eat.

40
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,319
Dig in.

41
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,000
Eat up.

42
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,800
How did you know
what I like for breakfast?

43
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,199
You visit this tailor shop twice a year.

44
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,240
It's usually on the first day of spring
and White Dew.

45
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,080
You visit the bookstore and the park

46
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,000
once a week.

47
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,000
Your favorite pastries
are from The Su's.

48
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,759
And you get your favorite jewelry
from The Qian's.

49
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,039
Back when you studied on West Street,

50
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,759
a boy used to bully you.

51
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,000
He waited for you after class.

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,599
That's right.
I think his name had a "Dong" in it.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,079
Liang Dong.

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
He later transferred schools.

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,399
It was you.

56
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,879
Before the road
in Zhao Alley was fixed,

57
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,600
it was full of potholes when it rained.

58
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,360
But the section I often walked

59
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,079
was neatly paved with blue bricks.

60
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,199
Zhou Chi.

61
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,279
Do you know
you need to express your love?

62
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,800
Otherwise, you tend to miss the chance.

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,839
Compared to missing the chance,

64
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,160
I don't want you to get upset.

65
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,439
I told it

66
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,879
the things I couldn't tell you.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,720
And as I spoke,

68
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,800
I started to think of it as you.

69
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,560
- (In this lifetime,)
- (In this lifetime,)

70
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,000
- (everything finally changed.)
- (everything finally changed.)

71
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,839
Master ordered us to search
all of South City for Gu Shizhen.

72
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,959
How come he's still nowhere to be seen?

73
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,600
Cut it out.

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Keep searching.

75
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,360
Catch Gu Shizhen

76
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,319
and we'll be rewarded.

77
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Got it.

78
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,000
Come, let's go.

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
(It's all your fault.)

80
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,519
(It's not mine.)

81
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,900
(Zhao Residence)

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,759
I'm entrusting the list to you.

83
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,959
Get it to Yueji as soon as possible.

84
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,720
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

85
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
Make sure Chunman stays out of it.

86
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,000
Why?

87
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,199
You don't seem to be happy
by my presence here.

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,879
Didn't you say you liked me,

89
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,199
and you wanted to be with me?

90
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,240
I was just startled by you.

91
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,759
It's dark here,

92
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,160
and you suddenly popped out of nowhere.

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,199
Did you come to pick me up?

94
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,759
How sweet of you!

95
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,319
What are you doing, Shizhen?

96
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,920
Drop the act.

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,959
Shizhen.

98
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,160
What are you doing with these letters?

99
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,759
Are they just ordinary letters?

100
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,920
You're Rose from the Rose Organization.

101
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,279
Didn't your best friend tell you?

102
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,720
I've already killed you once.

103
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,240
Since you're mine,

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,039
tell me how you want to die.

105
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,039
Luo Yu is dead.

106
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,960
I waited here for you so many times,

107
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
but you never showed up.

108
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,559
Gu Shizhen had been
secretly watching me.

109
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,039
From now on,
I'll give you my full cooperation.

110
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,159
Sir, someone asked
to meet you outside the city.

111
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,919
You're mad again.

112
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,120
You lost again.

113
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,240
I haven't lost yet!

114
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,360
Shizhen.

115
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
I didn't have to come here to see you.

116
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
Yet...

117
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,960
Zhao Qiuling.

118
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
You'd better stop pretending
to be a saint.

119
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,080
I have nothing to say to you.

120
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,039
All I want is to win.

121
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
It's not that you can't love.

122
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,279
It's that no one's ever truly loved you.

123
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,320
Just repent.

124
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,840
Shut up.

125
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,240
Let's just...

126
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
Shut it!

127
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,679
I'm sick of hearing the same words!

128
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,360
Why should I love anyone?

129
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Who's ever loved me?

130
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,279
No one loves me.

131
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,080
I can love myself.

132
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
I'll take back the Yi Gang.

133
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,840
I'll have the boss
help me seize South City.

134
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,840
Zhao Qiuling.

135
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
For the sake of our brotherhood,

136
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,039
I'm giving you one last chance
to make your choice.

137
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,480
What choice?

138
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:19,960
Either

139
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,759
you confess your identity to the boss

140
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,840
or

141
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,840
I give him the list.

142
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,080
But the thing is

143
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
Su Ruan is on that list too.

144
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Don't you hurt her!

145
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
Then you'll have to die.

146
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,799
- Bravo!
- Brava!

147
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,799
- Brilliant!
- Nice one!

148
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,399
Such a beautiful song.

149
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,159
Indeed.

150
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,039
I never noticed

151
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,000
you're this tall, Tamamo.

152
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,240
The Chinese claim one must
endures humiliation to achieve success.

153
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,519
And it takes that one man
to make things happen

154
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,919
or ruin the plan.

155
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,559
I'm someone who values talent.

156
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,159
Now,

157
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,799
I'll give you one more chance.

158
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,200
As long as you beg for mercy

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,039
and sincerely pledge loyalty to me,

160
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,279
I'll spare your life.

161
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,240
Boss.

162
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,799
Now you know who in South City

163
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,799
is truly your best partner.

164
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,960
I can have my men

165
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,799
help you take back the Yi Gang.

166
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,360
Zhou Chi.

167
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,399
The show is about to begin.

168
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,399
I won't go soft on you anymore.
