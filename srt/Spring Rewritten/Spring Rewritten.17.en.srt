3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,880
I... I got the hang of it.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,159
Aim for that hole.

5
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,719
You have to follow the posture
I taught you.

6
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,719
Train your arm strength.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
You don't seem
to have any strength at all.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,880
Practice more in your spare time.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,759
Got it...

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,000
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,000
Su Ruan.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,640
I'll take your role
in today's performance.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,400
It's my own performance.

14
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,879
No one can replace me.

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,879
My brother is still alive.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,400
I know.

17
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,840
Then you should leave.

18
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,519
Don't you want to see him again?

19
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,040
Now Gu Shizhen is convinced

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,159
that the list is in my hands.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,879
Whether I leave or not

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,560
makes no difference to me.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,040
But it matters to the organization.

24
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,560
Remember.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,959
You and Zhou Chi must stay out of this.

26
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,500
That's the only way
to protect the organization.

27
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,479
Perfect.

28
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,319
Absolutely perfect.

29
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,919
Make way! Everyone, step aside!

30
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,960
Clear the way! Move!

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,879
Step aside! Step back!

32
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,080
Everyone, step back now!

33
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,039
I'll give you the list.

34
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,240
But I don't want
the patrons of Yuchun Theater

35
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,800
to have come all this way for nothing.

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,319
May I

37
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,680
sing them a few more lines?

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,919
Ms. Su,

39
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,080
go ahead.

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,279
I've relocated the list.

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,319
Let this matter

42
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
end with me.

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,959
Su Ruan...

44
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,920
There's no need to persuade me.

45
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,040
If my death

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,079
can guarantee the safety
of the others in the organization,

47
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,879
then it will be worth it.

48
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,959
I will have no regrets.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,160
I wish you two

50
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
a long and happy life together.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,199
May you have a blissful future.

52
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,879
- Brilliant!
- Bravo!

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
You wanted the list, didn't you?

54
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,240
Here you go.

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,839
You...

56
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,920
The list is gone.

57
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,560
The list is gone!

58
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,560
Is that

59
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,439
all you've got?

60
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,000
If any of you here

61
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,639
are from the Rose Organization,

62
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,920
watch closely!

63
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,800
This

64
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,759
is your fate.

65
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,879
Death isn't a punishment.

66
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,199
A life worse than death is.

67
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,879
Make her life worse than death.

68
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,399
That's what counts as punishment.

69
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,439
The list is gone.

70
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,360
Are you happy now?

71
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,279
Are you happy now?

72
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,959
Do you have any idea

73
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,480
how important that list is to me?

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,199
Do you have a death wish?

75
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
Do you think

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,399
you'll die an easy death?

77
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,399
Let me go!

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,439
You animal!

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,160
Stop resisting.

80
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,560
Let go of me!

81
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,519
Animals! You traitors!

82
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,959
I love you.

83
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Kill me...

84
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,079
Kill me...

85
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,879
Let her go!

86
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,319
Mr. Tamamo.

87
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,759
Nice shooting.

88
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,120
She was just an actress.

89
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,040
It's not worth dirtying your hands, sir.

90
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,879
Dump her at the market square.

91
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Get in.

92
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
Alright, everyone disperse!

93
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Stop staring!

94
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:08,353
I'll ask you one last time.

95
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,320
As long as you come back to me,

96
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,279
we'll still be brothers.

97
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,559
I've made myself clear.

98
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,879
I never go back on my path.

99
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,480
And I don't have a traitor
for a brother.

100
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,320
When we meet again,

101
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,679
either you die

102
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,639
or I do.

103
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,960
You want to kill me?

104
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,600
Yes.

105
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,639
I want to kill you.

106
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,919
Zhao Qiuling.

107
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,919
It must be painful

108
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,240
to kill the woman you love.

109
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,480
Go on. Pull the trigger.

110
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
But if you kill me,

111
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,600
who will supply you

112
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,840
with medicine and ammunition?

113
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
What about your comrades?

114
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,559
I really want to shoot you dead.

115
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,000
Who would've thought

116
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,279
the boss' right-hand man

117
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,240
is actually a mole

118
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,480
from South City?

119
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
When did you find out?

120
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,960
After you took the supplies,

121
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,519
I had someone follow you.

122
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,159
You didn't deliver them

123
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,200
to the boss at all.

124
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,519
Also,

125
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,360
it's hard for a good man
to change the look in his eyes.

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
(When you saw Chi)

127
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,639
(or fired)

128
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,360
(at Su Ruan,)

129
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,759
I was still wondering

130
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,120
why Chi had become the King of Hearts.

131
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,759
I then realized one thing.

132
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,799
(It was right after you disappeared.)

133
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,600
So

134
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,000
you were

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
the the King of Hearts.

136
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,559
It could be me,

137
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,600
Chi,

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
or anyone else.

139
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,639
It could even be you.

140
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm not as noble as you all.

141
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,360
I just want those around me

142
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,759
to live a good life.

143
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,679
But why do you all

144
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,200
have to go against me?

145
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,759
I did everything I could

146
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,000
to give you all

147
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
a comfortable life.

148
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
Yet you've tried to play good cop,

149
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,559
making me bad cop here!

150
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Shizhen.

151
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,660
When you lose
both your country and family,

152
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,639
you'll have no choice
but to become a slave.

153
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,159
What comfortable life
will there be to enjoy?

154
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,519
Haven't you read the papers?

155
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,440
Many people like you

156
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,919
get killed everyday.

157
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,039
Look at them enjoying nightlife!

158
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,399
Do any of those people care

159
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,559
what flag flies over South City?

160
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,480
No matter what flag it is,

161
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,639
they still get to feast.

162
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
So, why can't I do

163
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
as they do?

164
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,000
Gu Shizhen, you...

165
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,679
Where's my brother?

166
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,679
You'll find out soon.

167
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,519
Qiuling.

168
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,879
Qiuling!

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,799
Where's my brother?

170
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,919
What's the rush?

171
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,000
Have a meal with me

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,240
and I'll take you to him.

173
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,200
Gu Shizhen,

174
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,200
what trick are you pulling now?

175
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,039
What else could I do?

176
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,240
Zhao Qiuling,

177
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,639
a mole from South City.

178
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,480
That head of his

179
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,679
is worth 500 taels of gold.

180
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,879
All I ask

181
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,000
is one meal with you.

182
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,720
That's a fair deal, isn't it?

183
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,879
Freshly imported French wine.

184
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,759
Try it.

185
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,039
Finish it.

186
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,080
Let me see

187
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,440
how different a virtuous woman is
from the rest

188
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,279
when she's in heat.
