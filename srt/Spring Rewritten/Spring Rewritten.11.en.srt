=Episode 11=

3
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,039
Bummer.

4
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,719
Stay here and don't move.

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
If you don't behave,

6
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,920
I'll bring your mother over
to keep you company.

7
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:50,820
(Zhao Residence)

8
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,560
Where's Ms. Zhao?

9
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,879
I haven't seen her
since I woke up this morning.

10
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,480
Maybe she went out.

11
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,680
Fine, I'll come back later then.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,480
Sure.

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,439
Someone's lying over there.

14
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,240
Looks like someone from Yi Gang.

15
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,159
Let's go check.

16
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,719
Excuse me.

17
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,680
Coming through.

18
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,919
Fulu?

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,639
Fulu.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,159
Fulu.

21
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,879
Who's that?

22
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,840
Fulu.

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,080
Fulu.

24
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you for bringing Fulu back.

25
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
Fulu said

26
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,759
if he ever

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
died out there

28
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,840
and someone brought him home,

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,759
it could only be you.

30
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,560
He told me to give you these diaries.

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
(Wednesday, rainy)

32
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,120
(We've been watching a boy
named Zhou Chi.)

33
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,280
He's got his eyes on the girl

34
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
who was betrothed to Zhen.

35
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
Zhen, he wants your girl.

36
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,479
Let's beat him up.

37
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,479
Don't.

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
I'll make him my sidekick.

39
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,800
So we pretended to bully him,

40
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
then Zhen swooped in and saved him.

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
What are you doing?

42
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,480
- Money!
- Let's go.

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,879
Are you all right?

44
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,399
(Tuesday, sunny)

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
(Zhen's been wanting to get us
into Yi Gang.)

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,839
(Today, he finally came up
with a plan.)

47
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,519
The two of you

48
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,759
find some desperate guy in the casino,

49
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,199
get him to assassinate
Yi Gang's boss, Zhou Yisen,

50
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,360
at Richard Hotel this Friday.

51
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,480
This is all the money

52
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,959
Chi and I earned from shining shoes.

53
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,519
Whether we make it or not

54
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,639
depends on this shot.

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,399
We will make it.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,639
That guy seems to be
Yi Gang's boss, Zhou Yisen.

57
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,839
They're gangsters, right?

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,639
So what?

59
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,120
As long as we can feed ourselves.

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,399
And they treat their members well
and are loyal.

61
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,199
Mr. Zhou.

62
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
Run, Mr. Zhou!

63
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,360
Chi.

64
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,279
(So everything was a setup
from the get-go.)

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,879
(Gu Shizhen,
this is who you really are.)

66
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,079
You!

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,959
Are you in?

68
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,519
Zhou...

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,360
Are you in?

70
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
This is my last warning.

71
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,399
My patience is wearing thin.

72
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
Stay put and don't move,

73
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,279
or you'll never

74
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,560
see your mother again.

75
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,920
Wait here till I get back.

76
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,879
By the way,

77
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,759
some good news for you.

78
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
King of Hearts took Luo Yu's body away.

79
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,879
But don't expect him

80
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,519
to come for you.

81
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,079
He won't make it here.

82
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,879
You're in?

83
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
Why didn't you open the door?

84
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,879
Let's talk.

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,839
Fulu's dead.

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Who dares lay a hand on my people?

87
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,720
Where's Fulu right now?

88
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,320
I found his body by the moat.

89
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
I had him buried at home.

90
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Thank you, Chi.

91
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
Whose turf is that?

92
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
The Big Knife Gang's.

93
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,080
But Fulu didn't die there.

94
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,519
There are wood splinters and blood
under his nails,

95
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,159
so he didn't drown.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,159
Are you suggesting...

97
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,120
(It was you, right?)

98
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,399
Foster Father.

99
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,320
If that's the case, nothing we can do.

100
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,919
We have to be even more careful
from now on.

101
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,919
Fulu'd been with us for over ten years.

102
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,480
Why aren't you sad at all?

103
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,080
We live on a razor's edge.

104
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,200
Staying alive depends on skill.

105
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,039
In the future,

106
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,440
watch

107
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,320
what you say and do.

108
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,320
I need to head out for something.

109
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Do you need my help?

110
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,480
No.

111
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,360
(Is he going after)

112
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,519
(Zhao Chunman?)

113
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
You were so eager to meet me.

114
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,720
When are you setting up my meeting
with the boss?

115
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,879
He's returning to South City soon.

116
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,519
I'll make the arrangements.

117
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,879
You seem down.

118
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,919
How do you cheer up

119
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,879
a stubborn woman?

120
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
If they're regular women,

121
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,120
clothes, jewelry, flowers, and dessert.

122
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,580
But I'm not sure about
the type you're talking about.

123
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,679
She's not like others.

124
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,679
Regular women just take my gifts

125
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,600
and cling to me.

126
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,600
She gives gifts back

127
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,759
and keeps pushing me away.

128
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,559
What's on her mind, really?

129
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,679
I remember you saying

130
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,159
women aren't worth the trouble.

131
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,879
You've changed.

132
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,879
Did she change you?

133
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
I don't know how to love her.

134
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,919
What does loving someone really mean?

135
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,399
Chunman's still not back yet?

136
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,200
No. What's going on with her?

137
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,919
Flowers for sale!

138
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,879
Sir, buy some flowers
for your girlfriend.

139
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,360
Give me a bouquet.

140
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,480
Here you go.

141
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,080
How much? Take it yourself.

142
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
One, two.

143
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,679
That's enough. Thank you, sir.

This is for you.

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,320

Hmm.

182
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,399
Are you trying to take my woman from me?

183
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,080
Yes, I am.

184
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,320

185
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,399
I don't,

186

but do you?

187
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,319

Zhou Chi, if you leave this place today,

189
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,880
don't ever come back.

190
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
I never look back.

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,960
Zhou Chi!

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,319
Anyone who stands in my way today dies.

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,599
Out of my way!

194
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,319
Let him go.
