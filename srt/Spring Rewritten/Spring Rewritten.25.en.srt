3
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,520
I haven't cleaned up this place
in a while. Have a seat.

4
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,439
Chi.

5
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,560
Father, Mother, Qiuling,
Luo Yu, and Su Ruan.

6
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,079
They all failed to escape the fate.

7
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,280
Does that mean

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,319
that no matter
how many times I'm reborn,

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,920
I can't change the outcome?

10
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,000
That it might even end worse?

11
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,359
At least this time,

12
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,760
we survived.

13
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,200
But those dearest to us died
for the greater good.

14
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,799
How could we live only for ourselves

15
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,439
and scrape by?

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,920
Have you ever heard of this saying?

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,480
People only truly live
for a few moments.

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
And those transient moments
are eternal.

19
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,919
I experienced eternity

20
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,639
in our encounter.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,479
Actually, I've always felt inferior.

22
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,800
I've been ashamed of my background.

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,639
And I'm afraid to face the past.

24
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,360
You've done well enough.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Many who've walked through the mud

26
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,360
find it hard to believe in sunlight.

27
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,159
Having suffered so much,

28
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,000
they want others
to suffer just as they did.

29
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,360
But you're different.

30
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,360
You've been through the rain,

31
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,479
yet you still hold umbrellas for others.

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,400
Well,

33
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,039
even if you can't face the past,

34
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,159
it doesn't stop you from moving forward.

35
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,159
You and Qiuling showed me sunlight.

36
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,080
That's why I believe in it.

37
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,159
Happy birthday.

38
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,360
I didn't get you a cake this time.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,970
I'll make it up to you after this.

40
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,399
Thank you, Chi.

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,800
Eat up.

42
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,759
I've thought it through.

43
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,399
I'm getting you out of South City.

44
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,279
Are you really going to do that?

45
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,439
I lost my family and friends.

46
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,759
The fewer people
who experience that, the better.

47
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,480
And I want Zhou Chi to live.

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,199
Sure.

49
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,560
We'll leave tomorrow.

50
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,839
Chi.

51
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,040
If I had never met you,

52
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,040
would you...

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,000
As long as I'm here,

54
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,399
there's no "what if."

55
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
(Chi.)

56
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,360
(Perhaps it was my obsession)

57
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,560
(that led to
an even more unbearable result.)

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,959
(This time,)

59
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,959
(I want to protect you.)

60
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,439
(I'm putting an end to all this.)

61
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,240
I didn't go to you.

62
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,879
But you came to me instead.

63
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,800
Let her up.

64
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,000
Speak.

65
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,439
What do you want with me?

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
I came to kill you.

67
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,199
Very well, my wife.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's make it a fair game.

69
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,439
It's just the two of us here.

70
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,279
Tell me.

71
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,800
How do you want to kill me?

72
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,160
Come with me.

73
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,879
Zhou Chi is here.

74
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,959
I knew you wouldn't give up so easily.

75
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,279
Thus,

76
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,480
I laid the trap in advance.

77
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,000
You think Zhou Chi
can walk out of Yisen Manor alive?

78
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
Let him go.

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
All of this started because of me.

80
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,279
Let him go. Kill me instead.

81
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,879
For the sake of your brotherhood.

82
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,240
You want to save Zhou Chi that badly?

83
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,960
Even if it costs your life?

84
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,600
Fine.

85
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,360
Tell me

86
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,159
that you love me.

87
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
You led me on, Zhao Chunman.

88
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,039
Say you love me!

89
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,759
Is that a difficult thing to do?

90
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,159
With the gun pointed on your head,

91
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,200
why don't you say it?

92
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,799
Shoot me to death.

93
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,039
You think I dare not do so?

94
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,000
I never doubted that, Gu Shizhen.

95
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,960
But let Zhou Chi go.

96
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,840
Kill me.

97
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,960
Go ahead and kill me!

98
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,879
