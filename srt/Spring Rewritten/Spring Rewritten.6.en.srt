3
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,599
Hold there. Show your token.

4
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:23,250
(Yi)

5
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,800
(Yueji, how much longer do you need?)

6
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,000
(She made it.)

7
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,199
Wait here for me.

8
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,439
You asked to meet both me and Zhen.

9
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,159
Foster Father.

10
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,639
Are you all right, Foster Father?

11
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
Where were you?

12
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,639
I came late.

14
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,000
Catch her.

15
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,240
Kill her.

16
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
You still can't let go
of your father's death?

17
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,360
If it were you,

18
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,039
could you?

19
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,800
Notify everyone

20
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,319
to check their tokens.

21
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,360
Find out whose is missing.

22
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
Search every room.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,840
You guys, follow me.

25
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,199
So this is why you called me here?

26
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,240
Zhao Chunman!

27
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,039
You think

28
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,120
I wouldn't do anything to you, right?

29
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,599
Search over there.

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,520
If you don't want to die,

31
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,039
follow me.

32
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,000
Check thoroughly.

33
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
Search every room on the third floor.

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,550
(Room 305)

36
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,919
Come.

37
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,175
(Level 3, Richard Hotel)

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,839
Go upstairs.

39
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
Don't let a single room go unchecked.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,879
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,199
Chi, Ms. Zhao,

42
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,879
why are you here?

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
You came rushing.

44
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,839
What's going on?

45
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,360
Someone stole the token

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
and injured Mr. Zhou.

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,839
Chi, let me see your token.

48
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
(Zhou Chi,)

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
(he...)

50
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,480
(Finally)

51
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
(I protected you in this life.)

52
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,720
It's her.

53
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
She's the assassin.

54
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,319
Chi, don't let her go.

55
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
(Is that a dream?)

56
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,079
(Why does it feel so real?)

57
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
(April 29, Republic of China)
(April 29)

58
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
(April 29)
(Wasn't I supposed to die May 14)

59
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
(at Yuchun Theater?)

60
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,399
Why has time turned back?

61
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,199
(I'm in Yisen Manor now.)

62
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,639
(This isn't a dream.)

63
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,560
(Tomorrow is the day
Zhen goes to Zhao's residence.)

64
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,959
(Mr. Zhao died on that day
in the previous life.)

65
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,639
(Zhou Chi.)

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,879
(She only met you just before she died
last time.)

67
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,639
(Some words)

68
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,800
(you never said to her.)

69
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,839
(Your cowardice)

70
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,120
(cost her life.)

71
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,680
(Don't you want to change something
this time?)

72
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,959
(If Mr. Zhao doesn't die,)

73
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,000
(there won't be the theater incident,)

74
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
(and she won't die.)

75
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
(But what if I still can't change it?)

76
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,120
(I must save them both in this life.)

77
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,240
Chi, what's up?

78
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,759
Zhen,

79
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,439
I'll pick up Zhao Qingzhai
for you tomorrow.

80
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,680
All right.

81
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,199
(When I saw you again in this life,)

82
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,000
(I was even more determined
to do something.)

83
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
(This time,)

84
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,839
(I swear I'll protect you.)

85
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,839
I don't like smoke.

86
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,039
Take me with you,

87
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
or don't bother going back.

88
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,840
(The last time we met
in the previous life.)

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
(The first time we met in this one.)

90
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,039
- (Zhao Chunman.)
- (Zhou Chi.)

91
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,600
- (Your gun still aims at me.)
- (My gun still aims at you.)

92
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,919
(But no matter
how many times we meet again,)

93
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,879
(I won't dodge.)

94
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,399
I promised to bring you here,

95
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,879
not to take you inside.

96
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,080
(I hope I could save your father
this time.)

97
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,399
Today, I'll give you a chance

98
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,679
to avenge your father.

99
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,840
Chi.

100
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,000
(Mr. Zhao, this shot won't kill you.)

101
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,120
(I hope you can survive this.)

102
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,960
(Please forgive me.)

103
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,879
Zhen,

104
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,200
what are you doing?

105
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,120
For the sake of old ties
with the Zhao family,

106
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,080
I'll give Zhao Chunman an intact body.

107
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,360
Father!

108
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,440
Father!

109
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,480
(Why?)

110
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,919
Father!

111
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
(Why couldn't I change it?)

112
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,919
(I'm sorry.)

113
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,399
(Now I can only hope)

114
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,120
(you'll feel fear for this place)

115
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,480
(and stay away from Gu Shizhen.)

116
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,559
Follow her.

117
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,879
(Stay away from Yi Gang.)

118
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,600
(Stay away from me.)

119
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,320
(I know you're flirting)

120
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,559
(with me and Zhen at the same time.)

121
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,519
(I also know you want to avenge
your father's death.)

122
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,960
(You can lie to me or use me.
I don't mind.)

123
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,279
(I'm willing to.)

124
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,480
(As long as you're alive.)

125
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,200
(The moment you dropped the key)

126
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,480
(into my hand,)

127
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,080
(Room 305)
(I knew then)

128
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,790
(all those moments I thought you cared
were just a lie.)

129
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,320
(You never loved me.)

130
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,200
(But that's okay.)

131
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,600
(I love you.)

132
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,200
(I want to keep you safe,)

133
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,720
(no matter what lifetime it is.)

134
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,279
(Zhao Chi,)

135
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,000
(why do you always help me?)

136
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,587
(Yi)

137
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,879
Let's go.

138
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,720
What happened with Wu?

139
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,279
No idea.

140
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,279
When I ran into me, he looked panicked

141
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,360
and tried to snatch my token,

142
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,279
so I had to shoot him down.

143
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,879
Then why are you here?

144
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,039
I asked him to meet.

145
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,639
You called both of us here?

146
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
Zhao Chunman,

147
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,600
how dare you toy with me?

148
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,440
Yeah.

149
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,799
I wanted revenge.

150
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
I want you to feel the pain

151
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,440
you and Luo Yu brought upon me.

152
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,159
I chose between you and Luo Yu.

153
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,840
So, who would you pick between us?

154
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,240
Who says I have to choose?

155
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,440
I choose neither of you.

156
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,759
Because I don't love either of you.

157
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,240
Let go.

158
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Let go.

159
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,039
Chi,

160
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,080
you raised your hand against me
for a woman.

161
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,080
I knew the day would come
when you'd grow up

162
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,799
and want what belongs to me.

163
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,879
But I didn't think it'd be over a woman.

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,799
If you truly loved Chunman,

165
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
I wouldn't have done this.

166
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,519
But you don't.

167
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,320
Gu Shizhen.

168
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,960
The last time you called me that

169
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,440
was 15 years ago.

170
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,799
It still sounds more natural from you.

171
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,960
Wu has been with me for over ten years.

172
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,159
I never thought he'd be a traitor.

173
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,799
I couldn't believe that either.

174
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
But that's the fact.

175
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,799
Do you remember

176
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,679
how you and Shizhen joined the Yi Gang?

177
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,399
Want a shoe shine, sir?

178
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,360
No.

179
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,360
Ma'am, shoe shine?

180
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,559
How about a shine, mister?

181
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,600
Let me give you a shoe shine, mister.

182
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,960
That guy looks like Yi Gang's boss.

183
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,799
I heard he's got hundreds under him.

184
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,559
That's an illegal gang.

185
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
So what?

186
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,360
As long as we can feed ourselves.

187
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,159
They also treat their own members
well and are loyal.

188
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,600
Mr. Zhou, run! Mr. Zhou!

189
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,159
Chi!

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
Are you okay, Zhen?

191
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,000
Stop! Don't run.

192
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,559
This time,

193
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,759
one of you who should've been here
wasn't,

194
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
and one who shouldn't be here was.

195
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,559
I didn't die.

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,679
Are you and Shizhen disappointed?

197
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,000
I wouldn't dare, Foster Father.

198
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,960
You wouldn't. What about Gu Shizhen?

199
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,080
He wouldn't either.

200
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
I was being foolish.

201
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,360
Come in.

202
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,279
Foster Father.

203
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,360
Sort out your woman problem fast.

204
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,559
Tie up loose ends.

205
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,799
I won't let Yi Gang ruin

206
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,559
over a woman.

207
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Thank you, Foster Father.

208
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,279
Go.

209
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,559
Foster Father...

210
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,519
Sir,

211
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,279
why didn't you just kill Zhao Chunman?

212
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,600
What trouble can a mere woman stir up?

213
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,480
I was worried

214
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
they'd get out of hand

215
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,559
and gang up on me.

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,679
But now I'm not anymore.

217
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,919
Using Zhao Chunman
to keep them in check

218
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,159
is the best bet.

219
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,000
Everything has pros and cons.

220
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,960
You can only win
if you weigh them wisely.

221
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,799
About the Big Knife Gang's
goods being off,

222
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,440
how's the investigation going?

223
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,399
It's almost done.

224
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,679
It definitely has something to do

225
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,279
with the Rose Organization.

226
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,279
Keep digging.

227
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,639
Especially the women
who have been to the mansion lately.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,480
I'd like to see

229
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,840
whether it's a mole inside
or an enemy outside.

230
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,360
Zhao Chunman.

231
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
What's the matter?

232
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
(What am I doing?)

233
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,279
(Wasn't I hoping)

234
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,480
(she'd stay away from us?)
