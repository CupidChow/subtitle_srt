00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,840
Move.

4
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,520
Move.

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,359
Move.

6
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,840
Luo Yu, Gu Shizhen.

7
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,640
I heard everything.

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,319
What are you doing in there?

9
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,760
You think I'm that easy to bully?

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
The two of you can't even wait, huh?

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm still here.

12
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,680
You were siding with me just now,

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,599
and you're already messing
with my best friend.

14
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,400
And you still expect me to love you?

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,959
You can shut me out today,

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,719
but after this,

17
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,640
don't you show up in front of me again.

18
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,599
Get out of my way.

19
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,599
Did you forget what happened earlier,
Luo Yu?

20
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,239
You have no shame.

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,879
Zhao Chunman,
who are you to talk to me like that?

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,799
Who am I?

23
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,359
Gu Shizhen is my fiancé.

24
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,439
You're my best friend.

25
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,080
Yet you keep throwing yourself at him.

26
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,240
We are true love.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,479
Not like you.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,159
Keep an eye on her.

29
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,520
Zhen.

30
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,000
(What's going on?)

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,759
(Gu Shizhen's gone.)

32
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,439
I think my cover is blown.

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm afraid it won't be easy for us

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,960
to get out of here.

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't worry.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,680
I'll get you out safely.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,560
Do you remember when we first met?

38
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,240
Of course I do.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Who are you?

40
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,560
Shhh.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,400
What are you doing?

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,879
I'm writing calligraphy.

43
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,797
Carry on.

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
I'm playing hide-and-seek with them.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
My name is Luo Yu.

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,800
What's yours?

47
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,000
Zhao Chunman.

48
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,439
So you were born in spring?

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,639
Yes. Go ahead and hide.
I'll cover for you.

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,479
Just like now.

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,879
I'll cover for you.

52
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,680
Come on.

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,039
I don't want to waste my breath on you.

54
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,960
Leave now before you annoy everyone.

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,319
Zhao Chunman, just you wait.

56
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,400
We're not done yet.

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,399
Someone's fired a gun!

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,560
Run.

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,079
Zhen, Luo Yu left.

60
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,639
Are you all right?

61
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,360
After her.

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
She's over here.

63
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,240
Go.

64
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,319
Over here!

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,879
Stop! Don't run!

66
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,920
Stop!

67
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,360
Get in.

68
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
She's here. Stand right there!

69
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,319
Hurry!

70
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160

You should be safe now.

75
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,959
Get off.

76
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,759

Stand right there!

84
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,199
Tell me.

85
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,360
Who's your accomplice?

86
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Bah! Traitor!

87
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,759
Don't want to talk?

88
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,560
Then we'd rather kill by mistake

89
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,079
than let one slip away.

90
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,600
None of you is living alive.

91
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800

94
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,600
I want Mother!

95
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,079
Take the girl and go.

96
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,680
Hmm.

97
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll take your guns.

98
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
After him!

99
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,000

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
- Stop!
- Stop!

101
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
Go now before they catch up.

102
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,000
My name is Zhao Chunman.

103
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,679
(Great! The handover's done.)

104
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,000
(Luo Yu didn't die.)

105
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,360
(It's finally over.)

106
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,080
Zhen.

107
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,399
We lost her.

108
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Nothing?

109
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,399
Yes.

110
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,720
Luo Yu had nothing on her.

111
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,919
Feelings do grow

112
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,720
after a man and a woman sleep together, huh?

113
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,799
You couldn't bring yourself
to search her, could you?

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You taught me

115
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,919
that once a man has money and status,

116
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,519
he can have any woman he wants.

117
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,480
Why would I hesitate over a woman
who's a threat to me?

118
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,279
Well said.

119
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,559
What about her body?

120
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,110
I'll do as you say, Foster Father.

121
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
I want to try that.

122
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,960
Look at that.

123
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,399
Let's go.

126

(Yu,)

127
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,880
(you cared so much
about your appearance.)

128
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
(I can't let you be humiliated
like this.)

129
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,039
Let go.

130
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,720
Zhao Chunman.

131
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,759
Let go.

132
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,799
I'm taking Luo Yu away.

133
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,879
Zhao Chunman,

134
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,080
if you go over there now,
you won't save her,

135
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,759
you'll get yourself in trouble, too.

136
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
I never expected
Luo Yu to be with the Rose Organization.

137
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,480
I know very well
what kind of person Luo Yu was.

138
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,639
But you,

139
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
I know nothing at all.

140
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,440
The best actor here is you, Zhou Chi.

141
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,759
I found this where Luo Yu was killed.

142
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,840
You killed her, right?

143
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Even now, you're still pretending.

144
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,639
It wasn't me.

145
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
This is a misunderstanding.

146
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,480
No matter what kind of person I am,

147
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,759
I would never be the one who hurt you,

148
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,279
nor would I let anyone hurt you,

149
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,799
not even you yourself.

150
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,300
(Mibola Coffee)

151
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
(Why isn't Yueji here yet?)

152
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,240
Are you waiting for someone?

153
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,159
No matter who you're waiting for today,

154
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,320
only I'll show up.

155
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,600
Do you know why Luo Yu died?

156
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Excuse me.

157
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,000
This is what women always like.

158
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,240
Luo Yu took something Yi Gang wanted.

159
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,720
She took what she shouldn't have,

160
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,559
so she had to die.

161
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,720
And Yueji from the Rose Organization

162
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,559
stood up against Yi Gang.

163
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,159
She had to die, too.

164
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,399
They're both dead,

165
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,480
but you're still alive and kicking.

166
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,559
You should know by now

167
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,919
who you can really count on.

168
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,039
Can you put Luo Yu down?

169
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,559
I just want to give her
a dignified death.

170
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
It's not that simple.

171
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,000
I need to talk to my foster father.

172
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,720
But since you asked,

173
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
I'll take care of it.

174
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,159
Wait for me.

175
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,600
I'll take you for a meal after that.

176
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,240
And return your coat as well.

177
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,919
Mr. Zhou, we've got it.

178
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,440
Big Knife Gang's goods

179
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,519
are hidden in Gu Shizhen's warehouse.

180
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,559
I've sent people over.

181
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
Bring him here.

182
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Zhen,

183
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,399
shouldn't you report to Mr. Zhou first?

184
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,720
There's no way he'd agree to that.

185
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,519
I'd just be asking for trouble.

186
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,759
But Ms. Zhao...

187
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,600
As long as she thinks
I'm making an effort.

188
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,919
Give me your hand.

189
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,360
