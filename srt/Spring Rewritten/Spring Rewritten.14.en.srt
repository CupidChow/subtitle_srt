=Episode 14=

3
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,920
Sorry,

4
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,840
I can't let this happen again.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
(If you don't go to
the Yuchun Theater this time,)

6
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,519
(everything might change)

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,879
(and I might be able to protect you.)

8
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll be back soon.

9
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,540
(Yuchun Theater)

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,760
Move those stools over here.

11
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,560
Come on.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,319
Good. Set them down here.

13
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,200
Chi.

14
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,290
Has Mr. Zhao arrived yet?

15
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,120
Not yet.

16
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,319
(Zhou Chi, did you knock me out)

17
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,439
(just so you could work for Yi Gang?)

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
(In the previous life,)

19
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,039
(Luo Yu and Gu Shizhen)

20
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,599
(were in the dressing room.)

21
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,960
(This time, no one came for the list.)

22
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,719
(Dressing Room...)

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,719
(The list is here.)

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,560
Why are you here?

25
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
What are you doing?

26
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,520
Nothing.

27
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:44,919
Gu Shizhen, let go of me.

28
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,800
What's your mission today?

29
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,719
What do you mean?

30
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,199
Is the list here in Yuchun Theater?

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
I know you're with
the Rose Organization.

32
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,000
I also know

33
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
what your mission is.

34
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,599
But even after I killed Luo Yu,

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,680
I can't bring myself to kill you.

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Why?

37
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,280
Because I love you.

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,519
Why can't you be with me?

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
If it were before,

40
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,560
I'd hold you at gunpoint

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,879
and threaten you to be my woman,

42
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,800
but now,

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,079
I'm asking you to be my woman.

44
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,519
You say I don't know how to love.

45
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,439
I can learn.

46
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,360
Isn't that enough?

47
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,480
You'll never learn.

48
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Then teach me.

49
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,040
If you're willing to teach me,
I can do it.

50
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,680
Gu Shizhen,

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,560
loving someone is a skill.

52
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,519
You don't have it.

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,079
You do.

54
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,639
You can try to love me.

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
You'll never truly love anyone.

56
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,639
Back then, when I loved a woman,

57
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,639
all I wanted was her body.

58
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,879
But I don't want your body.

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,319
I want your heart.

60
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
You want Zhou Yisen dead, don't you?

61
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,519
I can do it.

62
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,319
Zhou Chi can't.

63
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,720
He's too soft-hearted. He can't do it.

64
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,959
Will you love me

65
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,879
if I kill Zhou Yisen?

66
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,879
Let go.

67
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,519
Zhen.

68
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,879
Foster Father's here.

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
(Why did she still come?)

70
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,040
Right.

71
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,879
Good.

72
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,480
Watch the performance with me.

73
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,279
I don't want to see Zhou Yisen.

74
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,319
Foster Father,

75
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,040
it's all set.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,839
Hmm.

77
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
Chunman,

78
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,399
go home now.

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,839
Why can't I come here, if you can?

80
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,040
Didn't you say

81
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
you weren't helping Yi Gang?

82
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,839
You didn't take my words seriously.

83
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,040
Why should I listen to you?

84
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,160
I'll explain later.

85
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,639
Chi.

86
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,879
Come here.

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,839
Don't make a scene here.

88
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,240
There's an ambush.

89
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,240
I'm just going to the restroom.

90
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,519
You want to tag along?

91
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm just going to the restroom.

92
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,120
You want to tag along?

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,519
(No!)

94
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,399
(Everything's back to square one.)

95
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,680
Chi, come here.

96
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,879
Coming.

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,720
The performance is good.

98
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Zhao.

99
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
(Someone shot Zhou Yisen.)

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,959
Shooter's on the second floor.

101
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,279
Go. Hurry.

102
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,240
Don't let them get away.

103
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,959
Close the gates.

104
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,759
Block every exit.

105
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,639
Quick. This way.

106
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,240
Hurry.

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,759
Search every room.

108
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,319
Come on. Over here.

109
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,720
Come over here.

110
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,120
Follow me.

111
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,759
(If we keep going,)

112
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,759
(will we run into Zhen?)

113
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,759
(In the previous life,)

114
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
(he came up from this staircase.)

115
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,080
(Zhou Chi... Why did he stop?)

116
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,279
(Gu Shizhen's about to show up.)

117
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,080
(If we can get out safely,)

118
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,879
(everything should finally end.)

119
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,480
Once we leave here,

120
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,840
we'll be out of the woods.

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,679
Leave and don't look back.

122
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,440
(This scene overlaps with last time.)

123
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,559
Chi!

124
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
Zhou Chi,

125
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,720
why did you have to come?

126
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,200
Why?

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,799
Because

128
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,159
I can't

129
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,840
watch you die again.

130
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,720
(Die)

131
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,799
(again?)

132
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,840
This time,

133
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,759
everything should be over.

134
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,480
Zhou Chi.

135
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,360
Zhou Chi.

136
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,360
Zhou Chi!

137
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Zhou Chi.

138
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,159
Zhou Chi.

139
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,679
(I'm in a hospital.)

140
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,759
(I didn't die.)

141
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
(Does that mean the ending has changed?)

142
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't move.

143
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
You need a jab later.

144
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,360
You're awake.

145
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,080
Didn't expect you'd shoot me

146
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
over a woman.

147
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,360
If I really did,

148
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
you wouldn't be alive to question me.

149
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,399
So I should thank you instead?

150
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,360
Chi,

151
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,159
I've never thought

152
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,039
we would end up like this

153
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,639
because of a woman.

154
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,360
She wasn't the one
who tried to kill Zhou Yisen.

155
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
I know.

156
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
That's why I killed Wen.

157
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,279
I promised I'd take Zhou Yisen out
for her

158
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,120
and protect her.

159
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,600
Gu Shizhen,

160
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,159
you're such a hypocrite as always.

161
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
What are you doing? Let go of me.

162
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,639
Gu Shizhen, let go.

163
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,039
Can't you see you're hurting her?

164
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,799
Chi, are you okay?

165
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,720
Is it serious?

166
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,039
Why are you so shy?

167
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Let me see your wound.

168
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,720
Man, wait outside.

169
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,919
I'll take care of him.

170
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,639
Why are you drawing the curtain,
Su Ruan?

171
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,919
Let me check your wound.

172
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,120
I have something to say to Chunman.

173
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,440
Your priority now is

174
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
healing up.

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,799
Got it?

176
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,320
Are you jealous?

177
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,879
They've known each other
since childhood, just like us.

178
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,279
Zhou Chi spends way more time with her

179
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,320
than you have.

180
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,720
Naturally,

181
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,799
they're closer.

182
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,840
Feelings aren't measured by time.

183
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,720
Zhao Chunman.

184
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,960
I saved your life.

185
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
And this is how you treat me?

186
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,399
I can give you back my life.

187
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,480
Gu Shizhen,

188
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,279
if you love someone,

189
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,759
you don't use threats or favors
to control them.

190
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,919
Man, Chi's resting now.

191
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you so much

192
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,200
for taking care of him these days.

193
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,080
As for his stuff,

194
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,840
I've collected it from your house.

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,279
(Why is Su Ruan)

196
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,440
(acting so strange?)

197
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,580
(Zhao Residence)

198
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,440
(She really took all his things.)

199
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,879
(But this)

200
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,919
(doesn't feel like
something Zhou Chi would do.)

201
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,279
Eat up. What are you waiting for?

202
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,039
Okay.

203
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:44,759
Zhou Chi,

204
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,639
why did you have to come?

205
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,799
Because

206
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
I can't

207
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,720
watch you die again.

208
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,679
(Watch me die again?)

209
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,320
(Could it be that Zhou Chi)

210
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,039
(remembers something just like I do?)
