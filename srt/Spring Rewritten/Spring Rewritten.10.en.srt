3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Did he agree?

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't come closer.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,280
I'll get your clothes dirty.

6
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,799
Did Zhou Yisen hit you?

7
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,320
I'm fine.

8
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,520
Here's your coat.

9
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,000
Zhen,

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,120
why didn't you say a word
when you were back?

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,599
Mr. Zhou's looking for you.

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,719
Zhen, Mr. Zhou's waiting.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Am I deaf or what?

14
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,799
You've got the guts

15
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,040
to steal my goods.

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,159
Foster Father, I don't know
what you're talking about.

17
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,519
You don't know?

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
Then was it Zhou Chi?

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
He might have the guts,

20
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,840
but never the ambition.

21
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,840
Pick it up.

22
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,680
I heard you were playing victim
in front of Zhao Chunman.

23
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,960
Let me help you look the part.

24
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,680
I swear I don't know anything.

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Once they're back from the warehouse,

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,520
you'll know everything.

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,159
Mr. Zhou.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,919
Zhen.

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,159
Mr. Zhou, the warehouse

30
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,400
is empty.

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Proceed as planned.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,759
Move the goods out.

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,159
Zhen.

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,599
(Caishikou Execution Ground)
We've been stuck for days.

35
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,879
When's this going to end?

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,199
Enough whining.

37
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,260
(Retribution)

38
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,879
Hold there.

39
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,719
No crossing here at night. Go back.

41
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,000
Go.

42
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,560
It's King of Hearts. Run!

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Wait.

44
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,319
Give her a proper burial.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,560
Yes.

46
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,680
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

47
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,399
Why so shy?

48
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,319
We were kids back then.

49
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,800
One of my shirt buttons is missing.

50
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,000
Somehow,

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
it was found on Luo Yu.

52
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,160
(No! The button fell off)

53
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,190
(when Zhou Chi changed into
the King of Hearts costume.)

54
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,360
(I kept it in my purse
and forgot to give it back to him)

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,680
(before I swapped purses with Luo Yu.)

56
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,600
(Now's not the time)

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
(to reveal my identity.)

58
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
What's wrong?

59
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,920
Did Zhao Chunman get the wrong idea
about you and Luo Yu?

60
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
Even worse, she thought I killed Luo Yu.

61
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,480
You two shouldn't have much contact,

62
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,439
or you might expose yourself.

63
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,000
Boy, I like your mask.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
Can I buy it from you?

65
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I found it. You can have it for free.

66
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,319
Let me pay you.

67
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,480
Here.

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,040
There you go.

69
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,560
Thank you.

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
Can we buy candy with the money?

71
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,759
Looks good?

72
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,319
Yes!

73
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,560
Let's go buy candy.

74
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,079
You like King of Hearts?

75
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,519
Instead of liking the hero,

76
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,279
you expect me to like you traitors?

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,000
What's it to you anyway?

78
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,720
My name is Zhao Chunman!

79
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,079
Why are you in my place?

80
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,399
Get out.

81
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,360
You're not welcome here.

82
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,240
So you like King of Hearts.

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
I found it somewhere.

84
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
What a coincidence.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
I also found something.

86
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
Yours, isn't it?

87
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,399
What is that?

88
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,720
Never seen it.

89
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,300
You were in a hurry
when you switched coats with Luo Yu

90
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,000
during the ball, right?

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,279
Switched coats?

92
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,160
It's Luo Yu's, I think.

93
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,000
I've got hers, too.

94
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,759
You killed Luo Yu.

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,240
You killed Luo Yu.

96
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,120
So what if I did?

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,519
You're despicable.

98
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,879
Don't touch me.

99
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,519
I killed someone

100
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,759
to keep your secret safe.

101
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,559
How long have you been with me, Fulu?

102
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,480
Zhen,

103
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,559
I was a year longer than Chi.

104
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,919
How does it feel working with me?

105
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,360
If not for you,

106
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,080
I couldn't feed Grandma and myself.

107
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
I also learn to read.

108
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Serving you

109
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
is the luckiest thing in my life.

110
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,919
The more you read,

111
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,919
the better you lie.

112
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,799
What did Zhou Yisen promise you

113
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,919
that made you rat me out to him?

114
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,159
Mr. Zhou threatened me with Grandma.

115
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,919
I didn't tell him much.

116
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,279
It's just

117
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,279
when he pushed too hard,

118
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,240
I...

119
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,039
I told him a little.

120
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,360
A little?

121
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,200
Don't you know I can't tolerate

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,559
even the smallest betrayal?

123
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,600
Zhou Yisen threatens you
with your grandma,

124
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,000
and I don't?

125
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,639
You forgot

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,360
how much your grandma likes me.

127
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,440
Did you tell Zhou Yisen

128
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,759
about the Rose Organization cufflink?

129
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,200
No.

130
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,639
Very well.

131
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,960
Thank you, Zhen.

132
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,320
Shouldn't you thank me?

133
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,639
Your mother's frail.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,980
If you don't want her to suffer,

135
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,480
you'll listen to me from now on.

136
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,600
Chunman!

137
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,200
(Did I hear that wrong?)

138
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,159
(How could she be here?)

139
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,480
Don't come here. Go away.

140
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,360
Save your strength.

141
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,279
What's with that look?

142
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,000
You hate to see me that much?

143
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,159
Who do you want to see then?

144
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,039
Chi

145
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,799
or King of Hearts?

146
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,399
It looks ugly on you.

147
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,159
Say you love me, and I'll let go.

148
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,600
In your dreams.

149
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,080
Zhao Chunman, you're mine.

150
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,600
You're always mine, Zhao Chunman.
