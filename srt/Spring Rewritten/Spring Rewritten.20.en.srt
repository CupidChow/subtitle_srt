3
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,140
(March 11)

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
(I'm really back.)

5
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
Man,

6
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,680
are you having a nightmare?

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Father.

8
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid.

9
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,120
Father's here.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,159
I'm going to

11
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,599
pick up the goods later.

12
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,280
Stay home

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,400
with Mother.

14
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,000
(This is before Father goes to
collect the herbs.)

15
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,400
(This must be the batch)

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,920
(Yi Gang intercepted.)

17
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,079
(This time,)

18
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,879
(I must protect Father, no matter what.)

19
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,719
(I must get rid of Zhou Yisen)

20
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,120
(before things get worse.)

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
Man, what are you thinking about?

22
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,960
Mother's been having migraines lately,

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,439
but she didn't dare tell you.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,919
Picking up the goods is easy.

25
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,479
Father, stay.

26
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll go.

27
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,280
No.

28
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,360
Father,

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,719
I know your secret.

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,479
You're the liaison
of the Rose Organization.

31
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,439
You taught me before.

32
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,700
When the country's in danger,

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,990
everyone has to take responsibility.

34
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,840
These crates can go on the truck now.

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,840
Yes.

36
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,479
(It's the herb list.)

37
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,439
(Found it.)

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,159
Nobody move.

39
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,759
Zhou Chi.

40
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,439
You know my name, Mrs. Gu?

41
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,280
I said nobody move.

42
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,560
Sorry.

43
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,039
We'll cover the workers' medical expenses.

44
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,360
(Does Zhou Chi)

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
(have no memory this time?)

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
Why are you the one
picking up the goods?

47
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,039
Zhao Chunman.

48
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,120
Zhao Chunman.

49
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,560
My father is feeling unwell,

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
so I came in his place.

51
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,240
What are you doing?

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,039
We're taking this.

53
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,110
What brings you the right to do so?

54
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,719
Our goods have proper transport papers.

55
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,919
That's exactly why

56
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,120
we need to take them.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,190
There are words that this batch
contains a Rose Organization list.

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
We're confiscating it.

Mrs. Gu,

64
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,959
even if you kill me,

65
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,560
we're keeping this batch.

66
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:40,959
Chunman.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,360
(He didn't come back.)

68
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,120
It's Foster Father's order.

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,519
Don't make things hard for us.

70
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,399
Worst case,

71
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,759
we'll check the goods

72
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,759
and send them back later.

73
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,839
Zhen,

74
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,639
why are you being so nice to her?

75
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,000
Come on. Pull the trigger.

76
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,319
If you do, it means
you're hiding something.

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,519
Scared?

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,839
(It's not that I'm scared, Zhou Chi.)

79
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,800
(It's just I can't do this.)

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,199
If you are, tell your father

81
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,800
to mind his own business

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
at Qingzhai Pharmacy.

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,639
Don't let us find out

84
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,160
he's involved with
the Rose Organization.

85
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,879
Otherwise,

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,319
don't blame me for being rude.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Chi,

88
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,639
take the goods back first.

89
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,279
I'll send her home.

90
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,480
Load the goods on our truck.

91
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,920
Let's go.

92
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,199
No need.

93
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,279
Wear this.

94
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,519
If you freeze,

95
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,360
I feel bad.

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
We're almost there.

97
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,959
Go on back.

98
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,040
We're already at your door.

99
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,240
I should at least

100
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
greet your parents.

101
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,199
You just took our goods,

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
and now you're thinking of
visiting them?

103
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,720
Is that really a good idea?

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,639
That's exactly why

105
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,079
I need to explain to them in person.

106
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
What's there to explain?

107
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,720
Foster Father

108
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
heard from the boss

109
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,040
that your father's good

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,920
carried key intel
for the Rose Organization.

111
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,480
He even started suspecting your father.

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,720
My father is the most honest man.

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,079
He'd never get involved
in something so dangerous.

114
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,160
But Foster Father is watching him now.

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't worry.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,560
You're my fiancée.

117
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,360
I'll keep you and your family safe.

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,639
Once I finish

119
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,839
investigating the batch,

120
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,160
I'll return it to you.

121
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,199
After all,

122
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,959
I'm the Zhao family's son-in-law.

123
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,360
(What's going on?)

124
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,240
(Zhou Chi doesn't remember anything,)

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,199
(yet Gu Shizhen behaves
like a different person.)

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
(If I'm the only one here this time,)

127
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,480
(what should I do?)

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Let's go.

129
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,639
Let me explain to them.

130
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,199
(Does Zhou Chi really not remember?)

131
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,879
(He's acting so strange.)

132
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
(This isn't like him at all.)

133
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,279
(I'll test him one more time.)

134
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,439
(If he truly has no memory,)

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
(then even if I'm alone this time,)

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,639
(I'll keep going)

137
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,759
(and do anything I can)

138
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,000
(to change the ending.)

139
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,759
Tell Mr. Zhou

140
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,639
that I sincerely ask to see him.

141
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,559
What kind of sincerity is that?

142
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,639
That makes you come here yourself, Mrs. Gu?

143
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,799
I'll find those herbs myself.

144
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,080
What are you doing?

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,759
Put me down.

146
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,000
Let go.

147
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,960
What kind of sincerity did you bring?

148
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,559
Hand it to me.

149
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,679
No. It's none of your business.

150
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,120
So, the sincerity you brought

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
is yourself?

152
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,279
Haven't I told you?

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,639
Your whole family should stop showing up
in our sight?

154
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,559
Zhou Chi.

155
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,279
What are you doing?

156
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,039
What are you doing?

157
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,480
Am I sincere enough for you?

158
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,080
Feels familiar, Zhou Chi?

159
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,159
What?

160
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,720
You're good at this.

161
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,919
Do you treat every man like this?

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,879
You!

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well,

164
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,799
so this is how

165
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,919
you bewitched Zhen.

166
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,200
Too bad.

167
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,559
I'm not into women who act cheap.

168
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,799
In that case,

169
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,559
I'll leave.
