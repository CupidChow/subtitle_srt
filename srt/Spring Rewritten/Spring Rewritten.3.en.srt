=Episode 3=

3
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,840
Since you said relying on Yi Gang

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,280
can keep me safe for now,

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,000
if it can be Gu Shizhen,

6
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,240
why can't it be you?

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,200
Think it through and answer me.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,439
Goodbye.

9
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,480
(I couldn't change Father's death
in this life.)

10
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,480
(But now there's a new breakthrough,)

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,599
(maybe this time
I can uncover the truth,)

12
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,040
(eliminate Zhou Yisen,)

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,640
(and change my fate.)

14
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,040
Come in.

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,799
Zhen.

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,400
Big Knife Gang
wasn't satisfied with the terms.

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,799
They even found Ms. Zhao today,

18
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,319
trying to kidnap her

19
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,280
to threaten you.

20
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,319
Fortunately, Chi arrived just in time

21
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,519
and saved Ms. Zhao.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,799
Anything suspicious about Zhao Chunman?

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,519
Nothing suspicious for now.

24
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,580
I haven't broken off the engagement yet.

25
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,400
Call her Mrs. Gu.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
Yes, Zhen.

27
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,480
You know how to handle

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
the goods from Big Knife Gang, right?

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,640
Yes.

30
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,280
80% goes to Mr. Zhou.

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,919
The extra 20%
goes to the small warehouse.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,319
But if Mr. Zhou finds out...

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,039
Will you tell him?

34
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,680
No.

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,400
Then who will?

36
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,000
Big Knife Gang

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
or Chi?

38
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,960
Remember, Chi must never find out

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
about the small warehouse.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,199
Yes, Zhen.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,439
Wait.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,560
Thank you, Zhen.

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,919
Cash on delivery.

44
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,120
Chi, the goods have no problem.

45
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,400
Zhou Chi.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
If you want to blame someone,
blame Gu Shizhen.

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,080
Get him!

48
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,120
Get him!

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,240
Shouxi, leave with the guys!

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Forget the goods!

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,759
No! If we don't bring back the goods,

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,240
Zhen will kill us!

53
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,199
Chi!

54
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,519
Shouxi!

55
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,120
How did this happen?

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Zhen

57
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,759
wanted a 20% cut.

58
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,920
The deal fell through.

59
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,680
He's trafficking tobacco too?

60
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,439
Even so, it's not worth risking your life.

61
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,399
Shouxi!

62
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,480
(I never expected)

63
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,800

Why are you here?

79
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
Those people from earlier today

80
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
are with the ones tonight, right?

81
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,399
You kept checking your watch.

82
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,319
I figured it wasn't that simple.

83
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,639
I didn't expect to return your favor
so quickly.

84
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,879
I never asked you to repay me.

85
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,079
I owe you far more.

86
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,920
Take your time paying me back.

87
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,199
Can you still hold on?

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,199
We're almost at the hospital.

89
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,120
Help Chi into the car.

90
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,240
We didn't get the goods.

91
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,799
It's fine.

92
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,519
I'll handle it.

93
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,840
Qipao suits you better.

94
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,320
You're eager
to break off the engagement.

95
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,639
Is it because of another man?

96
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,360
Didn't you say you haven't agreed yet?

97
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,159
Get a coat for Mrs. Gu.

98
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,159
Yes.

99
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,720
Sit in the back.

100
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,559
I'll only say this once.

101
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,919
I meant the car behind us.

102
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
As long as our engagement
isn't called off,

103
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,399
you're still my fiancée.

104
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,759
Your eyes and heart

105
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,440
should be focused on me.

106
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,679
Gu Shizhen,
aren't you being too arrogant?

107
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,000
When you were with Luo Yu,

108
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,360
did you remember our engagement?

109
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,320
Before demanding things from others,

110
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,919
look at yourself first.

111
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,360
If you'd come a little later today,

112
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,159
you'd have to pick up Zhou Chi's corpse.

113
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,399
You care so much about Zhou Chi.

114
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,639
You like him?

115
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,759
How come I never noticed before

116
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,919
that you two were so close?

117
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,720
Stop the car.

118
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
Stop the car!

119
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
No point wasting words on you.

120
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,620
(Surgery)

121
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,540
(Surgery)

122
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
What are you doing?

123
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,639
Chen, do me a favor.

124
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,679
I just need this one shot

125
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,799
for tomorrow's headline.

126
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,600
You know I have principles.

127
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,960
My patients all have privacy rights.

128
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,919
Tell me why you bring the camera.

129
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,159
To stir up gossip again?

130
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,519
Let me tell you.

131
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,639
You can't just take photos

132
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,639
of whoever's lying in there.

133
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,000
The president
of Allied Chamber of Commerce,

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,639
Zhao Qingzhai's daughter, Zhao Chunman.

135
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,360
You know her, right?

136
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,990
I heard
she's breaking off her engagement.

137
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,559
The one inside might be her new lover.

138
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
Just let me take one photo.

139
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,000
If your story gets out,

140
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,559
Ms. Zhao's reputation will be ruined.

141
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
Sorry.

142
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,840
Mr. Zhang, what is it?

143
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,919
You're so anxious to see me.

144
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,519
Are you
going to do something about this?

145
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,440
If you don't say what it is,

146
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,720
how do I know whether I will?

147
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,000
Everyone knows you and Zhou Chi

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,919
are like real brothers.

149
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Even if he kills someone,

150
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,399
you'd clean up his mess.

151
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,480
See him out.

152
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,200
He hit me first.

153
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,000
Then he set fire to our office.

154
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
If we hadn't noticed in time,

155
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,639
our office would've burned down.

156
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,759
Nan...

157
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,690
Nanling Entertainment News.

158
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Nanling Entertainment News.

159
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,799
The newspaper wasn't affected, right?

160
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,440
Thankfully, no.

161
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,360
Now,

162
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,159
no one in South City
would dare want Zhao Chunman.

163
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,559
I guess I did you a favor.

164
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,159
You did me a favor?

165
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,960
I think

166
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,610
you want the whole South City to know

167
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,360
that Zhao Chunman
wants to break off the engagement.

168
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,639
Mr. Gu, I'm just reminding you

169
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,159
the people closest to you
are the hardest to guard against.

170
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,240
Look,
you always have your brother's back,

171
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,399
but he's after your fiancée.

172
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,840
I don't need your reminder!

173
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,840
Other than me,

174
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,440
no one
has the right to criticize my brother.

175
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,519
From now on, don't let me see

176
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,159
Zhao Chunman's name in the paper again.

177
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,600
Alright.

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
(No woman
has ever escaped from my grasp.)

179
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,159
(Zhao Chunman.)

180
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,679
(You're interesting.)

181
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,799
If you want to laugh, go ahead.

182
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,360
Don't hold it in.

183
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,879
I'm not that heartless.

184
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,159
Thank you.

185
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,519
Judging from Gu Shizhen's attitude,

186
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,919
I think he took the bait.

187
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,000
A man like Gu Shizhen

188
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
only cares about winning.

189
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,200
Just make him think he's the hunter.

190
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,080
The sense of defeat and danger

191
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,559
will push him
to take every step himself.

192
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,080
But

193
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,799
Gu Shizhen and Zhou Chi

194
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,159
are Zhou Yisen's right-hand men.

195
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,559
Dealing with both of them at once

196
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,200
is dangerous.

197
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
I know what I'm doing.

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,519
By the way,

199
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,120
have you heard of Rose Organization?

200
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,879
Rose Organization?

201
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,279
Their members
come from all walks of life.

202
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,120
Some donate supplies to the frontlines.

203
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,399
Some assassinate traitors.

204
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,319
You asked me to check

205
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,559
Zhou Yisen's meeting spot
with the Japanese.

206
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,559
Protect yourself.

207
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,940
(Zhao Residence)

208
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,000
(May 11th, Richard Hotel)
(May 11.)

209
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,759
(If I eliminate Zhou Yisen this time,)

210
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,759
(everything might change.)

211
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,440
(Zhou Chi has already taken the bait.)

212
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,359
(Now I just need Gu Shizhen.)

213
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,720
Mr. Gu, Miss is getting changed.

214
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,759
You can't go in.
