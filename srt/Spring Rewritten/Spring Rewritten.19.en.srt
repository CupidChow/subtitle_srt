3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,039
I'm not wrong.

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
It's you all who are wrong.

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,320
I treat you right,

6
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,240
you should treat me the same.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,799
Mother.

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,640
Why are you so flustered?

9
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,799
What has happened?

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,239
Where's Qiuling?

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,680
Where's he?

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,239
Didn't he go out to look for you?

13
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,000
Qiuling... He can't come back for now.

14
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,840
Let's pack our things.

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,079
We'll get you to the dock first.

16
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,079
To the dock?

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
Did something happen to Qiuling?

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,799
No.

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,599
Tell me, Man.

20
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,400
Mrs. Zhao.

21
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,799
Mrs. Zhao.

22
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,879
Qiuling is fine.

23
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,879
Just a small injury.

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,159
Sending you away

25
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,800
is to keep Chunman and Qiuling safe.

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,560
Where's he?

27
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,400
I want to see him.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,599
Mrs. Zhao,

29
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,639
please trust me,

30
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,560
all right?

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,039
Qiuling's really fine.

32
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,960
All right.

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
What's it?

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,919
Something's wrong.

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
It's too quiet.

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Someone's here. Come.

38
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,800
You're so heartless.

39
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,800
You're leaving

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
without Zhao Qiuling.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,360
Qiuling.

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Mother.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,719
Mrs. Zhao.

44
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,319
Qiuling.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Mrs. Zhao.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,000
Mother.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
No.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,319
Mother.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
Listen to me.

50
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,400
A mother can never abandon her child.

51
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,479
I can't watch them
humiliate your brother.

52
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,840
Zhou Chi.

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,120
Take Man and go.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,159
Leave now.

55
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:25,840
Mother.

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,400
Go.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,240
Mrs. Zhao.

58
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,479
Go.

59
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,080
Mother.

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,400
Chunman.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,960
Qiuling.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,400
Mother.

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,199
Qiuling,

64
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm here to take you home.

65
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,319
Qiuling.

66
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,199
Mother.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,120
Qiuling.

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,120
Man!

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,220
Mother.

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,719
Mother.

71
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,240
Go.

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,639
Mother.

73
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,240
Let's go.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,639
Mother.

75
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,240
Come on.

76
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,520
Fei,

77
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,439
no need to chase them.

78
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,079
They'll come to us.

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Slowly.

80
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,839
Don't go.

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,240
It's dangerous.

82
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,879
You've got a fever.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Without the herbs to stop
the bleeding and infection, you'll die.

84
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,240
Let me get you some water,

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,160
all right?

86
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,240
Wait for me.

87
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,260
(Huichun Apothecary)

88
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,319
(Every apothecary in town)

89
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,920
(is guarded by Gu Shizhen's men.)

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,399
(But Chi can't wait)

91
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,319
(too long.)

92
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,279
Mr. Gu told us

93
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,319
to guard the apothecary.

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,279
Mister.

95
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,079
Do you want Zhou Chi to live or die?

96
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,079
The choice is yours.

97
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,399
I want him to live.

98
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,680
Then, do as I say...

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
I will.

100
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,120
I'll do anything.

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Chi,

102
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,120
I brought you medicine.

103
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Where's Zhao Chunman?

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,319
What's Gu Shizhen done to her?

105
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,240
Chi,

106
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,639
forget about her.

107
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,000
Worry about yourself first.

108
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,959
Today's our wedding day.

109
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
You're marrying me,

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
and you can't can change that.

111
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
What's with you attitude?

112
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,519
Don't throw it on the floor.

113
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,279
Throw it at my head.

114
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,120
Go on.

115
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:42,879
Do it.

116
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,759
You have a death wish?

117
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,560
I won't let you die.

118
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,560
Kissing me disgusts you?

119
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,879
Sorry.

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,759
Sorry, I lost it again.

121
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,279
I swore I'd change.

122
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,440
Please.

123
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,159
Let me go.

124
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,879
Let us go.

125
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,840
I was wrong.

126
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,200
Yufen,

127
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,399
I... I lost it again.

129
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,919
Give me time and a chance.

130
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,080
I'll change. Please.

131
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,120
Give me time and a chance.

132
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll change. Please.

133
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,679
Zhao Chunman,

134
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
you made me.

135
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,759
Good afternoon, everyone.

136
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,519
We're grateful you could join us

137
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,919
for the wedding of Mr. Gu Shizhen

138
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,879
and Ms. Zhao Chunman.

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,840
Groom,

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,679
will you take this bride,

141
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,360
love her, respect her,

142
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,919
never leave her,
and stay faithful for life?

143
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,679
I will.

144
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,279
Bride,

145
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,440
will you?

146
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
I...

147
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,000
She won't.

148
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,240
You've got the guts to come.

149
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,840
I'm taking her with me.

150
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Shouldn't you ask her

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
if she wants to go with you?

152
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Did you hear what he said?

153
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,279
I didn't hear a thing.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
She says she didn't hear you.

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
Zhou Chi,

156
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,200
don't say I never looked out for you.

157
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,919
I'm giving you a chance.

158
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,039
Walk over here,

159
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480
and ask her yourself.

160
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Take off your shoes.

161
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,960
What?

162
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,279
That hurts you to watch?

163
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,960

00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,519
Why did Zhou Yisen target my family?

197
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,519
Since you say I can be safe

198
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,080
by relying on Yi Gang for now.

199
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,360
If Gu Shizhen could do that,

200
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,600
why can't you?

201
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,960
You know

202
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,240
I'd never let you lose.

203
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,799
You don't always lose.

204
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,960
I can't watch you die again.

205
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,480
And I can't

206
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,879
watch you die again either.

207
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,679
Will you take one more bet with me?

208
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,000
I will.
