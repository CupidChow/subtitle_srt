3
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:43,075
(Shanghai Xin Xin Department Store)

4
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,200
Do I have the honor today

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,479
of being Ms. Zhao's driver?

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,359
You weren't like this the other day.

7
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,159
You changed your tune pretty quickly.

8
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,399
Just over the past few days,

9
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,640
I realised we're not suitable.

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,719
How are we not suitable?

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
I think we're a great match.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Do you want to know
how your father died?

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,040
How did my father die?

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,680
It was your foster father
who told Chi to shoot.

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,719
Because Chi's father

16
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,319
was killed by your father.

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,359
Impossible.

18
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,719
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Chi yourself.

19
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,799
So between Zhou Chi and me,

20
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,760
you can only choose me.

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,480
I already said

22
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,439
I'm not choosing either of you.

23
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,239
Let me out of the car.

24
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,840
(I'm not choosing either of you.)

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Gu Shizhen, what are you doing?

26
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,639
Stop the car!

27
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,919
Gu Shizhen, are you mad?

28
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,759
Where are you trying to go?
Stop the car now!

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,080
Gu Shizhen, didn't you hear me?
Stop the car!

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Gu Shizhen, don't drive any further!

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,960
We're almost at the mountaintop.

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,479
Gu Shizhen, calm down!

33
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,800
Turn downhill.

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,080
There's a cliff below!

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,360
Don't you want to live?

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,280
Of course I do.

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,639
But I want you even more right now.

38
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,639
Gu Shizhen, stop! Stop the car!

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,759
Gu Shizhen, you're insane!

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Let me tell you,

41
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,919
I'm not taking back
the letter of withdrawal.

42
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,520
And I'll never fall in love with you.

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,719
Then do you love Zhou Chi?

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,960
Do you think he's easier to use

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
or easier to fool?

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Yes.

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
I do love him.

48
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,919
He's far more lovable than you.

49
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,680
If you don't love me,
why give me sweets?

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,840
Why go to the hotel with me?

51
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,120
From the very start,
I was only using you.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
Taking revenge on you.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
Can't you see that?

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,080
Zhao Chunman.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,840
No woman gets to
humiliate me again and again.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,719
You and I are the same kind of person.

57
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,639
We'll do whatever it takes
to get what we want.

58
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,439
Only I am truly your match.

59
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,879
Yes, we are the same kind of people.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
You're mad,

61
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
and so am I.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
But stop deluding yourself.

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,039
What about Zhou Chi?

64
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,560
He's the one who shot your father.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,879
If you won't choose me,
you can't choose him either!

66
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,680
That's none of your business!

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,719
This is my decision to make!

68
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,360
I will never be with you.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,280
Then I'll let you die.

70
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,280
Die!

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,159
Beg me to let you go!

72
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,280
Gu Shizhen!

73
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,240
Gu Shizhen!

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,639
(It was your foster father
who told Chi to shoot.)

75
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,040
(Because Chi's father
was killed by your father.)

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,879
(Could it really
be like Gu Shizhen said?)

77
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,279
(Was Zhou Chi's father
really killed by my father?)

78
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,839
(Then why did he still save me)

79
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,480
(at the Richard Hotel?)

80
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, Man.
Why are you sitting on the ground?

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,279
Get up quickly. The floor is cold.

82
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,120
Mom.

83
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,160
Did Dad kill someone

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,519
called Zhou Kun?

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,399
(That was a few years ago.)

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,519
(One day, your father
went out on some errands.)

87
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,240
Mister,

88
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,720
can I shine your shoes?

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,040
Not today. I have things to do.

90
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,839
Mister...

91
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,319
Just a quick shine.

92
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,399
Hey, lad, get up. Come on.

93
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,120
I really am busy today.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,240
I won't be needing it today.

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,480
How about this, here,

96
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,319
take this money.

97
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,759
Shine my shoes next time.

98
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,879
Thank you, Mister.

99
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,319
How much did you make today?
Hand it over.

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,839
Dad!

101
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,240
This is to buy medicine for Mom.

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,319
Your mom's not dying.

103
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,839
It's your dad
who won't last much longer.

104
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,120
Boss.

105
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Give me some opium paste.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,399
Give it to me.

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,920
Hand over the opium!

108
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,480
Stop smoking it!

109
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,519
I'm telling you,

110
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,319
this stuff destroys others and yourself.

111
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,390
It harms your wife and children too.

112
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,720
Give it to me.

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,240
Listen to me!

114
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm Zhao Qingzhai.

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
I can use herbal formulas

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
to help you quit.

117
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,120
Find some time

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
and come to Qingzhai Pharmacy.

119
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,319
I'm begging you.
Give the opium back to me.

120
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Please give it back.

121
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm begging you...

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,240
(He never went to your father.)

123
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,959
(He died two days later
from withdrawal.)

124
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,959
Zhao Qingzhai...

125
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,160
You want me dead?

126
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
(His wife, unable to afford medicine,)

127
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,399
You want me dead?

128
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,759
(died of illness as well.)

129
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,360
(To people like Zhou Kun,)

130
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,759
(death was too easy.)

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,759
(But his poor wife)

132
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,360
(never had a single good day with him.)

133
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,000
(So, Zhou Chi...)

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
(Did you kill my father
because of that?)

135
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:07,087
(Nuno Watch Shop)

136
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,639
(Now that Zhou Yisen is injured,)

137
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,360
(it'll be hard to approach him again.)

138
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,519
(Though the crisis
isn't fully resolved,)

139
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,480
(I'm still alive.)

140
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,040
(Does that mean)

141
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,079
(something has already changed?)

142
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,519
Would you
like your watch repaired, Miss?

143
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,519
Master.

144
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,480
Do you think time can go backwards?

145
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,399
If time could go back,

146
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,480
wouldn't everything
start all over again?

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Miss.

148
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,560
If time really could rewind,

149
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,160
would you be willing to live it again?

150
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,079
No, I wouldn't.

151
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,319
Because there was too much misfortune.

152
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,839
But if it already happened,

153
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,480
then I can only accept it

154
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,279
and try to change all that misfortune.

155
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,519
But what if changing those misfortunes

156
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,240
came at a great cost?

157
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,440
Miss, this watch can't be repaired.

158
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,480
Take it back as a keepsake.

159
00:08:52,780 --> 00:09:00,462
(Mibola Cafe)

160
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,200
(South City Police. Closed)

161
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,960
Miss, want your shoes shined?

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
Not today.

163
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,679
Just one pair, please?

164
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,240
How about this, I'll give you money,

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,240
but I won't get them shined.

166
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
Thank you, Miss.

167
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
(Zhao Residence)

168
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,559
(Lately, the Yi Gang has been
suppressing the Rose Organization.)

169
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,480
(We need to relocate the list quickly.)

170
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,159
(The cipher book is at Yisen Manor.)

171
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,440
(You're the one
most likely to get close.)

172
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,639
(Zhou Chi.)

173
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,519
(I wish I could cut ties with you.)

174
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
(But I have no choice
but to keep using you.)

175
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,559
(Father is gone.)

176
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,480
(I must complete)

177
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
(the mission he left behind.)

178
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,440
(And maybe)

179
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,720
(this mission)

180
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,559
(will help me uncover all the answers)

181
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,919
(and eliminate Zhou Yisen.)

182
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,279
(Zhao Chunman.)

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,399
(Are you really just using him?)

184
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:29,362
(Cure the sickness.)

185
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,399
(I'm not choosing either of you.)

186

188
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,919
How about I place a bet?

189
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,360
Zhao Chunman.

190
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,240
Can you stop messing with me?

191
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
Are you betting or not?

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,759
What's the bet?

193
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,440
Dice. Guess the number.

194
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,360
If I win,

195
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,799
you'll agree to one condition.

196
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,559
If I lose,

197
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,360
I'll never show up
in front of you again.

198
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,240
I guess triple six.
