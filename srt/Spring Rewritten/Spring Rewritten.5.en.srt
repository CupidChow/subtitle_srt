00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,599
and follow your heart?

47
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,800
I have nothing.

48
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,639
Not even a heart.

49
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,079
If you're heartless,

50
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,240
you wouldn't be standing here.

51
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,399
Remember that day

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,800
under the same streetlamp

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,319
where I asked you the question?

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,720
Can you give me an answer now?

55
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,399
I'll wait for you at Room 305 tomorrow.

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,399
If you don't show up,

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
I'll become

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,319
Gu Shizhen's woman.

59
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,319
Time to say goodbye.

60
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,000
See you tomorrow.

61
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,360
See you tomorrow.

62
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,279
Take this.

63
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,240
Give your parents a proper burial.

64
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,879
No, Zhen.

65
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,720
Your family's in trouble, too.

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
I can't take your money.

67
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,079
If you see me as your brother,

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
you know what that means?

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It means if I have a bite to eat,

70
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,279
you'll have one, too.

71
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,079
Take it.

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Chi.

73
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,120
Zhen.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,759
You're back.

75
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,639
Sit for a while.

76
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Chi,

77
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,600
it's been a while

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,319
since we had a chat, right?

79
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,879
Yes.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,079
Do you remember

81
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,800
what we said when we swore brotherhood?

82
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,279
Whatever

83
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,399
I have,

84
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,319
you'll have, too.

85
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,279
Whatever you have, I'll have, too.

86
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,319
But there are some things

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,720
we can't both share.

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
A person isn't a thing.

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
In times like this,

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
objects may hold values,

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,759
but people may not.

92
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,519
Zhen, you don't even like her.

93
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,759
Why won't you let her go?

94
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,360
Don't you know me?

95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,879
I don't have to like it,

96
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,120
but what I want,

97
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,480
I must have.

98
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,199
She's not an object.

99
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,879
Zhao Chunman isn't a woman
you can handle.

100
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,879
Only I

101
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,759
can control her.

102
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,240
Zhen, this isn't something

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,519
you or I can decide.

104
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,199
It's her choice to make.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,079
You've changed.

106
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,120
I don't know if you've grown up,

107
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,680
or if you've just had a side I never knew.

108
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,279
What about you, Zhen?

109
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,160
Do you also have a side

110
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,759
I don't know?

111
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,720
If she's willing to marry you,

112
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,040
I'll leave South City at once

113
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,680
and never come back.

114
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,720
Leave South City?

115
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,199
Chi, a woman isn't worth it.

116
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,879
I'll make you give up.

117
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,600
No woman

118
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,279
is worth it.

119
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,079
And I'll make you see

120
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,039
women

121
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,519
can't be trusted.

122
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,300
(Richard Hotel)

123
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,062
(Mibola Coffee)

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
We're sorry

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
about your father's death.

126
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,639
What exactly did Zhou Yisen want

127
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,600
from my father?

128
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,480
The list of key members
of the Rose Organization.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,679
It was supposed to be passed to Rose

130
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,960
through your father.

131
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,799
We didn't expect

132
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,960
that your father to sacrifice.

133
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,720
(Yueji, Rose Organization)
I hope you can find the list.

134
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
It must never fall into Yi Gang's hands.

135
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,879
I'll find the list,

136
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,759
but I also want you

137
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,080
to take Zhou Yisen out.

138
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Zhou Yisen's been our target all along.

139
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,279
But he's very cautious.

140
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,600
To get close to him,

141
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,200
you need Yi Gang's token

142
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,720
and also lure away two men.

143
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,919
Gu Shizhen and Zhou Chi.

144
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,360
They are Zhou Yisen's right-hand men.

145
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
They're hard nuts, though.

146
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
Leave them to me.

147
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,279
Please be there on time.

148
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,200

(I want an answer tomorrow.)

155
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,799
(If you don't show up,)

156
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,399
(I'll become)

157
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,600
(Zhou Shizhen's woman.)

158
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,762
(Room 305)

159
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,080
You were outside.
Why didn't you come in?

160
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,559
I was just about to.

161
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,912
(Richard Hotel)

162
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,320
Can I hear

163
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,720
your answer now?

164
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,159
Those eyes of yours

165
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,080
soften anyone's heart.

166
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,399
If you feel it,

167
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,559
why won't you admit it?

168
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
If I do,

169
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,159
will you stop avenging
your father's death?

170
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
If it were you, would you?

171
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,519
You're breathing heavily.

172
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,519
I look down on gutless men.

173
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Gutless or not,

174
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,080
try me and find out.

175
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,879
Sure.

176
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,720
Take it off

177
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,320
for me.

178
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,480
I don't like being on the bottom.

179
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,080
Mr. Zhou, this is the contract.

180
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,879
Please have a look.

181
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,000
Stay here.

182
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
I'll go downstairs to check.

183
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay.

184
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,200
Hello, room service.

185
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,920
Hello, Miss.

186
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Here's the red wine you ordered.

187
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,119
(Yi)

188
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,559
I didn't order red wine.

189
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,359
I thought you were late.

191
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,519
You came early.

192
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,599
I just got here.

193
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
Were you in a rush?

194
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
You're sweating.

195
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
Won't you let me in?

196
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,920
You're not meeting someone else,
are you?

197
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,599
If I did,

198
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,079
wouldn't you eat me alive?

199
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll eat you right now.
