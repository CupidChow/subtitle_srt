Why not come in
when you're already here?

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,679
I was just about to.

5
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,040
I hate

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,599
spineless men.

7
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,200
(Gu Shizhen, Leader of Yi Gang)

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,879
Chunman, check yourself

9
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,319
whether I'm spineless.

10
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,719
Sure.

11
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,760
Help me

12
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,560
undress.

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,200
(I personally stirred up)

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,159
(a vortex between two men)

15
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,840
(and got deeply involved.)

16
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,200
I don't like being underneath.

17
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,799
(In my past life,)

18
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,280
(they ruined my family)

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,519
(and made me betrayed by all.)

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,760
(Given another chance,)

21
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,760
Chunman.

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,439
(I just want to change everything.)

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,959
(And they)

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
(are my final bargaining chips.)

Gu Shizhen.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
(Luo Yu, Chunman's Best Friend)
When will you break off your engagement?

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,759
So eager to laugh at your good friend?

31
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:39,960
Yes.

32
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,439
Her father just died.

33
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,600
Give it a little time.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,280
Since you want it so badly,

35
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,599
I can give it to you.

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,280
(Today I was supposed to avenge my father,)

37
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,599
(but I unexpectedly caught)

38
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,759
(my best friend and my fiancé)

39
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,639
(indulging in pleasures
and cursing me to unrest.)

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,400
Someone...

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Who are you? What do you want?

42
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,520
Zhou Chi.

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,460
Gu Shizhen is my big brother.

44
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,439
You should call me sister-in-law then.

45
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm not here for Gu Shizhen today.

46
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,680
Step aside.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
If you're here for your father's death,

48
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,439
I suggest you forget it.

49
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,560
Zhou Chi.

50
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,439
I didn't see you today,

51
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,199
so stay out of it.

52
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,519
Remember to take the safety off
before you shoot.

53
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,879
What a show.

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,319
(My father's murderer
is right in front of me.)

55
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,839
(No matter what Yi Gang's motive is...)

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,199
(Zhou Yisen,)

57
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,160
(I will make you pay with your life.)

58
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:58,879
Sir.

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,279
Catch the killer!

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,439
The killer is on the second floor.

61
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,920
Quick!

62
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,519
Hurry!

63
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,319
Come with me.

64
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,079
That way.

65
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,800
Alright.

66
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,680
That way.

67
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,639
Alright.

68
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,319
Who's in there?

69
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,360
It's me.

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Chi.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,879
What happened?

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,839
Mr. Zhou was shot.

73
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,639
We're chasing the killer.

74
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,759
Got it.

75
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,439
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

76
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,399
What are you waiting for?

77
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,439
Come with me.

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Zhen.

79
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,360
What's going on?

80
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
Did you see the killer?

81
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,959
I went to the restroom and found Chunman

82
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,639
knocked out.

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,959
Yes.

84
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,759
Just now in the restroom,

85
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,480
I saw a woman jump out the window.

86
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,639
Get her to somewhere safe first.

87
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,759
Sure.

88
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,120
Zhen!

89
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,480
It's her.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,839
She's the killer!

91
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,560
Chi!

92
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
(How ridiculous.)

93
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,959
(He's with Gu Shizhen.)

94
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,000
(I thought)

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,199
(he'd be my salvation
in a desperate moment.)

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,800
(It turns out)

97
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,680
(he's my final death sentence.)

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
I just want to know

99
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,800
why Zhou Yisen killed my father.

100
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,480
(If you're here
for your father's death,)

101
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,079
(I suggest you forget it.)

102
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,639
Father!

103
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,959
Your father's death is complicated.

104
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,519
Your mother
just has one more body to collect.

105
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,959
Mr. Zhao, Yi Gang's Zhou Yisen
sent an invitation.

106
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,279
Father!

107
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,720
(Where is this?)

108
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,399
(Am I dead?)

109
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,200
(This is...)

110
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,039
(My room.)

111
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,860
(April 30th)

112
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,279
(April 30th?)

113
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,720
(The day my father was killed.)

114
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,320
(Didn't Zhou Chi shot me dead)

115
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,679
(at the theater on May 14th?)

116
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,240
Miss, you're awake.

117
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,679
Mr. Zhao ordered a cake
from the bakery this morning.

118
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,799
He's celebrating your birthday tonight.

119
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,799
(My father's alive.)

120
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,320
Where's my father?

121
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,080
He's talking with Mrs. Zhao.

122
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,759
Yi Gang sent an invitation,

123
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,399
inviting Mr. Zhao to discuss something.

124
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
Miss, you haven't even washed up yet.

125
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,559
(Zhou Chi?)

126
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,519
(Why is it him?)

127
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,159
(He tried to protect me
in the last life,)

128
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,320
(but why did he shoot me
in the corridor?)

129
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,440
(I also died at Yuchun Theater.)

130
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,799
(It was Gu Shizhen who picked up Father
in the last life.)

131
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,279
(Why is it Zhou Chi this time?)

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,840
(If everything can change,)

133
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,039
(could that mean Father won't die?)

134
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,600
(Zhou Chi.)

135
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,120
(Since the change starts with you,)

136
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,679
(I'll take my chances with you.)

137
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,399
(I'll bet that you're useful to me.)

138
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,919
(I'll bet
that you can change the ending.)

139
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,840
Come wait in the study with me.

140
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,039
Sit down.

141
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,279
My neck hurts from looking up at you.

142
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,360
My father's has been unwell.

143
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,840
I'll attend in his place.

144
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Sorry, Ms. Zhao.

145
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,360
Foster Father asked Mr. Zhao
to attend in person.

146
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,600
Ms. Zhao?

147
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,679
Sorry, Sister-in-law.

148
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,519
Call me Zhao Chunman.

149
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,080
Zhou Chi.

150
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,039
You know my name?

151
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,840
Kid, let's go.

152
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm going too.

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,720
(Zhao Qingzhai, Zhao Chunman's Father)
No.

154
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,120
Let's go.

155
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,360
Wait.

156
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,799
Take me with you.

157
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,879
Or you're not going anywhere.

158
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,480
Man.

159
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't fooling around.

160
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,320
(Whether the last glimpse from the last life)

161
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,480
(or the first look in this life...)

162
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,840
(Zhou Chi.)

163
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,279
(My gun still points at you.)

164
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,360
Ms. Zhao, if you're going,

165
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
shouldn't you get changed first?

166
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,840
You're coming too.

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
I have to watch you

168
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,519
to stop you from taking my father.

169
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,360
Mm.

170
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,279

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,840
Wait in the car.

190
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
I said I'd bring you,

191
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,480
not take you inside.

192
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,920
Keep an eye on her.

193
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,580
(Yi)

194
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,000
(Chunman, you can't get out of the car.)

195
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,480
(In the last life,
Father had an accident on the way back)

196
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,799
(after visiting Yi Gang.)

197
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,839
(I'm with him this time.)

198
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
(The ending will probably change.)

199
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,160
(What happened?)
