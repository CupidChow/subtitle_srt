3
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,240
Drink up! Cheers!

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,060
(He killed his father and betrayed his brother)
Well, let me tell you.

5
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:42,880
(to rise to power)
Well, let me tell you.

6
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,960
We did a nice job.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,840
Good days are just around the corner.

8
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,759
Let's drink, brothers!

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,560
Here, cheers.

10
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,879
Well,

11
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,319
if I hadn't cleaned up after you,

12
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,961
you'd be done for

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,480
if it got out.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,120
Thank you for your help.

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,239
Here, let me toast you.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,200
I'll have one.

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,260
(Zhao Residence)

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,200
Qingzhai.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,280
Go get some help to save Qiuling.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,799
I've tried everyone I could.

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,560
Qiuling...

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:03,959
He...

23
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,599
He died serving the country.

24
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,520
But he was our son too.

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,759
Loyalty and filial piety can't coexist.

26
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,759
That was his choice.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,000
We should respect it.

28
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,000
Qiuling...

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,599
He died for his country.

30
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,280
He's the pride of our family.

31
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,800
(But why?)

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,280
(Where did it go wrong?)

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,759
Qiuling!

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Mother!

35
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:36,759
Mother!

36
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,719
Qiuling! Qiuling!

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,639
Qiuling!

38
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
Qiuling!

39
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,800
Qiuling...

40
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,719
Gu Shizhen, what do you want?

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
Is that how you speak to me?

42
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,639
I kindly brought Qiuling back to you,

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,759
but you act like I'm not welcome here.

44
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,560
No, it's not that.

45
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,479
My father's just too heartbroken.

46
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
Not only am I here
to deliver Qiuling's body,

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
but I also came

48
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,680
to pick up my wife.

49
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,479
Zhou Chi said

50
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,040
the wedding didn't count.

51
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,199
What? Zhou Chi?

52
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,759
Who does he think he is?

53
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,519
It didn't count because he said so?

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,759
I'm now in charge

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,800
of the Yi Gang.

56
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,639
What are you doing?

57
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,439
Hands off my father!

58
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:30,720
Don't move!

59
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,480
Not my father!

60
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,680
Man...

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
Don't make me resort to violence.

62
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,759
Come.

63
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,639
We're going home.

64
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,160
Man!

65
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
Man!

66
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,160
Zhou Chi!

67
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,519
Run!

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,079
Don't be silly.

69
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,199
With you here, would he dare run?

70
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,199
I beg of you.

71
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:58,639
Chunman.

72
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't beg him.

73
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,519
Please

74
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,319
don't.

75
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
No!

76
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,680
Watch closely.

77
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,879
Don't worry.

78
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,639
He won't die.

79
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,639
If he died, who would share my joy?

80
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,439
Chunman, it's time to make up

81
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,920
for our wedding night.

82
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,720
Chi.

83
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,920
Are you alright, Chi?

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
If you're still alive,

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,399
stand guard for me now.

86
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,720
So what if you have memories?

87
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,959
You still ended up in my hands.

88
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,240
In the past life,
I couldn't bring myself to hurt you,

89
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,120
and I let you fool me over and over.

90
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,399
You're good at holding back, huh?

91
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,399
Trying to make me please you?

92
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,439
Dream on!

93
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,319
Here. Don't you want the list?

94
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,560
Be a good wife

95
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,319

The list...

Mr. Zhao has relocated it.

111
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,399
How is your wound...

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
I've got thick skin, so I'll be fine.

113
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,120
We have to get Father and Mother packed
and out of South City.

114
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,120
Once Gu Shizhen comes around,

115
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,320
who knows what he'll do next.

116
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,639
Father.

117
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,519
Mother.

118
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,000
Why aren't you two asleep yet?

119
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Mother?

120
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Mother.

121
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,159
Mother!

122
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:06,759
Mr. Zhao.

123
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,120
Mother! Mother!

124
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,399
Mr. Zhao.

125
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,159
I didn't mean to hurt the elderly.

126
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,759
But they were just too stubborn.

127
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,320
Since the list
is already in Yueji's hands,

128
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,960
then I

129
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,759
can only use Ms. Zhao's name

130
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,960
to bring her here.

131
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,360
Mr. Zhou...

132
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,720
Ah, no.

133
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,759
I should call you

134
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,200
Mr. King of Hearts.

135
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,519
I'll make those disobedient ones

136
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,759
see what awaits them.

137
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,600
Let them enjoy the sight
of their great hero,

138
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,399
King of Hearts, in utter ruin.

139
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,559
Mr. Morita.

140
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,320
May I make a deal with you?

141
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,000
What kind of deal?

142
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,159
The Rose Organization is trivial.

143
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,840
Its annihilation

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,759
won't do you any good.

145
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
All the credit
will all go to the military.

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,639
You're just working for them.

147
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,320
The Zhao family has an ancestral
Chinese medicine prescription.

148
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,120
If you have it,

149
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,720
it‘ll bring real benefits

150
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,039
to both your family and your business.

151
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,240
Miss Zhao, could I

152
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,759
have a look at that prescription?

153
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Sure.

154
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,039
This way, please.

155
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,519
What are you trying to do?

156
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,440
You won't get away.

157
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,559
I'm telling you.

158
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,759
My men are stationed out there.

159
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,000
Who said I was trying to run?

160
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,600
Even if it costs my life,

161
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I'll kill you with my own hands.
