=Episode 4=

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,640
Get out!

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,640
You look beautiful in a qipao.

5
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,640
This is a gift for you.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,560
Thanks, but I don't need it.

7
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,679
I know I spoke out of turn

8
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,000
back at the dock.

9
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,520
I also know

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,679
you resented me

11
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,079
because of Mr. Zhao's death.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,600
Now that Mr. Zhao is gone,

13
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,560
I just want to take better care
of you and your mother.

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,079
It's just a small gesture from me.

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,400
I'll get going now.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,239
Wait.

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,159
Have a seat.

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,519
I'm done.

19
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,240
How did you know my size?

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,319
I guessed.

21
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,879
Here. A return gift.

22
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,000
I've always been
the one giving gifts to women.

23
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,240
This is the first time
I've received a gift from one.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,759
Thanks for last time at the coffee shop.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,240
You don't lack anything,

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
so I didn't know
what to give you in return.

27
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,360
I thought the candy was tasty,

28
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,360
so I bought you some.

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
You're really beautiful.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Really?

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,080
You've seen
plenty of beautiful women before.

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
That was in the past.

33
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,280
I only want to look at you now.

34
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,840
I hope I can keep looking at you.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
Keep looking at you.

36
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,319
Last time Luo Yu said

37
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,759
free love is popular now.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,639
We can try spending time together first.

39
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,080
If we're a good match,
I'll take it back.

40
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,400
If we're not, I won't.

41
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,280
Want to play a game tomorrow?

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Sure.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,759
You're back.

44
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,279
Got into another fight?

45
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,079
I ran into two punks

46
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,199
and couldn't help myself.

47
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,959
We have so many men.

48
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,079
Let them handle it next time.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,990
I'm not breaking off the engagement
with Zhao Chunman anymore.

50
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,800
Alright, got it.

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,160
We're playing a game
with Zhao Chunman tomorrow.

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Join us.

53
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,399
Sure.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,199
What game are we playing?

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
Four players is perfect for mahjong.

56
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,680
Count me in.

57
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Miss.

58
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,079
Zhou Chi
used to visit Yuchun Theatre often,

59
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,560
but not recently.

60
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,120
Keep watching them.

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,639
Sure.

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,480
The dress today looks nice.

63
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I picked it.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,040
East wind.

65
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,560
Pong!

66
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,519
The dress is nice,

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
but it looks strange on you.

68
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Old styles suit you better.

69
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,000
Suitability doesn't matter.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,399
Seven circles.

71
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,560
What matters is what I like.

72
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,079
Three circles. Want it?

73
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,959
Chi.

74
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,319
Foster Father

75
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,680
said you don't need to go
to Richard Hotel tomorrow.

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Someone's been causing a scene
at the casino lately.

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,560
Go take care of them.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,399
Sure.

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,000
One tile from winning.

80
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,040
Red Dragon.

81
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,160
I win.

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,759
What's with you two?

83
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,240
One feeds, the other plays.

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
How can we play like this?

85
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,759
My tiles were awful.

86
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,040
You want my stuff and my man.

87
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,600
You can't want my tiles too.

88
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,399
There's so many people at this table.

89
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,600
Who knows which are yours

90
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,199
and which aren't?

91
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,720
Right?

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Zhou Chi.

93
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,319
Qiang.

94
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Chi.

95
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,800
Come take over for me for two rounds.

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,279
My arm's sore. I'm taking a break.

97
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,000
If you win, the money's yours.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,839
If you lose, it's on me.

99
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,399
Got it.

100
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,680
Red Dragon.

101
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,959
He.

102
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,160
My stomach hurts a bit.

103
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Cover for me.

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,639
Yes, Miss.

105
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,399
There's a batch of good goods
on a cargo ship docked recently.

106
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,600
Want to hear about it?

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Keep playing.

108
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,600
Chunman.

109
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,399
Chi.

110
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,039
Have you decided?

111
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,519
Since you said relying on Yi Gang

112
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,960
can keep me safe for now,

113
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,639
if it can be Gu Shizhen,

114
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,960
why can't it be you?

115
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,960
Shizhen, where are you going?

116
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,639
Haven't made up your mind?

117
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,639
Chunman.

118
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,200
Chi.

119
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,840
Why didn't you answer when I called?

120
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
I win.

121
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,759
Here.

122
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,600
Let's call it a day.

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
This round doesn't count.

124
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,399
Consider it my treat, alright?

125
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,879
Shizhen, can you send me home?

126
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,080
I want to talk to Chunman
about our engagement.

127
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,559
Take a car home yourself.

128
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,360
I'll drive Ms. Luo back.

129
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,399
Chi, I'll go get the car ready.

130
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:05,879
Alright.

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
You like eating those that much?

132
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,679
Tomorrow I'll have someone
peel one big bag for you.

133
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,879
I thought
you were going to peel them for me.

134
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,399
If a man makes others
do what they can do,

135
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,360
it means he's incapable.

136
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,840
What were you doing with Zhou Chi
behind the curtain?

137
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,759
The way he looks at you
is anything but innocent.

138
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,799
I had a stomach ache.

139
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,399
He poured me a glass of water.

140
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,799
He's your brother.

141
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,600
You're suspicious of your own brother?

142
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,399
I doubt you.

143
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,960
I doubt your judgment.

144
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,759
I can give a woman everything she wants.

145
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,679
As long as your taste isn't too bad,

146
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,360
you should know how to choose.

147
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,799
Where does it hurt?

148
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Here?

149
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,399
Or here?

150
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,600
Ms. Luo left her hat.

151
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,399
What kind of person do you take me for?

152
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,039
I'm going to Richard Hotel tomorrow.

153
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,840
If you think we can go on,

154
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,840
find me at Room 305.

155
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,159
The eyeliner's too high.

156
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,399
Let me fix it for you.

157
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,399
(Su Ruan, Yuchun Theater)
You haven't come in a while.

158
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,840
Why are you free today?

159
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,559
I'm feeling troubled,

160
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,860
so I came to listen to some opera.

161
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,200
I don't sell herbal medicine here.

162
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,480
If you're upset,
see a traditional doctor.

163
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Why are you here?

164
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
It's lively here.

165
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,799
What?

166
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,399
Doesn't Yi Gang

167
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,360
have hundreds of brothers?

168
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
If only Qiuling were here.

169
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,960
He loved tangerines.

170
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,759
It's not me who makes you feel safe.

171
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,080
It's Zhao Qiuling who does.

172
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,639
But

173
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
he probably died out there.

174
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,840
It's been three years.

175
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,200
Not a word from him.

176
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll wait for the show outside.

177
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,879
Su Ruan.

178
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:10,840
Chunman.

179
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,799
Let me sing a piece today.

180
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,399
What nonsense are you up to now?

181
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,440
No one's watching you anymore?

182
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,600
After my father died,

183
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,440
my mother hasn't had time to watch me.

184
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,000
What? Are you afraid I'll mess up?

185
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
You haven't insisted
on singing in years.

186
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,759
What came over you today?

187
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm borrowing your place
to meet someone.

188
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,399
Who?

189
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,080
Can I?

190
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,840
Can I?

191
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,240
Alright.

192
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,480
Look at that figure.

193
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,360
Good!

194
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,399
That's some good singing.

195
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Turn around.

196
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Turn around and let me see you.

197
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,600
(Ding Liang, Well-known in South City)
Turn around and sing a few more lines.

198
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,480
Why did you stop?

199
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,759
Sing!

200
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,000
Sir.

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
Please don't disturb the performance.

202
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,840
What?

203
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,600
Don't disturb.

204
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,159
What?

205
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,200
Scram.

206
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,799
You sing very well.

207
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,279
I want to reward you.

208
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,240
I like you.

209
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Come with me today.

210
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Come.

211
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,759
You...

212
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,440
Get him!

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,759
How dare you kick me?

214
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,799
Everyone in South City knows Ding Liang.

215
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,640
That's Yi Gang's Zhou Chi.

216
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,680
Who?

217
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,039
Yi Gang's Zhou Chi.

218
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,799
Apologies. Forgive me.

219
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
Scram.

220
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Sure, let's go.

221
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
What happened?

222
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,200
Why is it you?

223
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,200
Chi, thank goodness you were here.

224
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
Do you know who she is?

225
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
She is Qiuling's little sister,
Zhao Chunman.

226
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,359
Ms. Zhao is no amateur.

227
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,200
Her mother was once

228
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
the Kunqu opera queen of South City.

229
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,759
Was it good?

230
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,880
What? You two know each other?

231
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
I'm borrowing your place
to meet someone.

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,359
Alright, I'll leave you two to talk.

233
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,240
Mm.

234
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,039
Why are you here?

235
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,359
Weren't you with him?

236
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,799
I thought you didn't care.

237
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,799
The weather suddenly got cold at night.

238
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,279
