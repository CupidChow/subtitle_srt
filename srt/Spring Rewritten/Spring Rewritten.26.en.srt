3
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,719
What a weakling.

4
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,719
Let's go.

5
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,240
- Come on.
- Let's go.

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,079
(It hurts. Where am I?)

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,079
(I'm back here again.)

8
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,000
Chunman?

9
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,920
How do you know my name?

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,799
Who are you?

11
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,239
(She doesn't remember me.)

12
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,640
(She didn't come back.)

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
(That means she's still alive.)

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
That's great!

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
You're alive!

16
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,439
(Since Heaven gave me another chance,)

17
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,680
(Zhao Chunman,)

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,919
(I swear I will save you)

19
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,080
(on May 14th, ten years from now.)

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,980
(Ten years later)

21
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,199
I heard King of Hearts

22
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,400
just killed another traitor.

23
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,560
I wonder if King of Hearts is handsome.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,159
Even if he's not,
I'd still want to meet him.

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,520
Mm. I want to meet him too.

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,199
Do you think we'll ever run into him?

27
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,800
That's probably a long shot.

28
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,519
(Since your passing,)

29
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,040
(I've lived on with courage.)

30
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,120
(I count each sunrise and sunset,)

31
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,279
(waiting for death to come,)

32
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,639

If time could turn back,

61

would I want to start over?

who answered that question.
