=Episode 15=

3
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, well.

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,560
You take after your father in many ways.

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,320
But when it comes to someone you like,

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
you're not as brave as he was.

7
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,240
If you like him, go for it.

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,799
If you have doubts,
find the answer from him.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,560
You've got a mouth.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,799
Use it.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,319
Go ahead.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,680
You came here for Chi?

13
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,159
No.

14
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,680
I came here for you.

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
Some questions

16
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,200
you already know the answer.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,760
There's no need to ask.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,480
Even if you ask,

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,959
the answer won't change.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
Su Ruan,

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,599
are you in some kind of trouble?

22
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,560
Tell me.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
No.

24
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,519
You want to ask Zhou Chi, right?

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,959
Whatever you want to ask him,

26
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,359
you can ask me. It's the same.

27
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,439
You're not him.

28
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,799
How could it be the same?

29
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,359
I'm not him,

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,390
but I know him better
than he knows himself.

31
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,960
Here.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
He asked me to pass this on to you.

33
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,240
Keep it. Use it as a rag.

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,080
Looks like the dead can never win
against the living.

35
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,719
I wish you happiness
on my brother's behalf.

36
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,879
Well done.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,039
I did what you said.

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,759
Tell me where Qiuling is.

39
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,759
Not enough.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,199
You!

41
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,560
This pendant pairs with Zhao Qiuling's,
right?

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Give it back to me.

43
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
You want it back?

44
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,360
Do as I say.

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,719
Once I have Zhao Chunman,

46
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,039
you'll have it back.

47
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,560
Gu Shizhen,

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,599
you know nothing about love.

49
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,800
All of you act so high and mighty.

50
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,400
Love?

51
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,599
Who are you to judge it?

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,199
My love is for me to judge.

53
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,199
Look.

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,890
My grandfather passed it to my father,

55
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
and my father passed it down to me.

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,079
My father said

57
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
it's called Lover Pendants.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,079
There's only one pair
in the whole world.

59
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,199
It's meant for someone

60
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
you truly choose.

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,639
One for you,

62
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,079
and one for me.

63
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,959
(Qiuling,)

64
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,560
(are you dead or alive?)

65
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,839
(I can't wait any longer.)

66
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,160
Mr. Zhao,

67
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,959
the one tried to kill me

68
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,759
was Gu Shizhen.

69
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,839
It was Gu Shizhen.

70
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,680
Where's the fire?

71
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,600
Wen isn't dead.

72
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,600
Zhen, you can't go back to the manor now.

73
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,399
South City isn't that big.

74
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,480
Where else could I go?

75
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,279
Unless I leave the city,

76
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,040
but that would mean

77
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,439
everything I've worked for
all these years would go to waste.

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll never do that.

79
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,439
But if you go back now,

80
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,639
Mr. Zhao will kill you.

81
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,879
The ones who aren't dead yet will be.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,879
And the ones who should die will die.

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
Foster Father.

84
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Foster Father, forgive me.

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,399
No need to apologize yet.

86
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,519
There's someone else.

87
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,560
I heard you two were looking for Wen.

88
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,959
He's here.

89
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,959
What's wrong with you today?

90
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,920
Lost your tongues?

91
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,879
Just kneeling here?

92
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm not dead,

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,560
and you can't kneel for me,

94
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,279
so you're feeling frustrated?

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm the one who shot Wen.

96
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,519
Because he was about
to shoot Zhao Chunman.

97
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
I know.

98
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,959
Wen said Zhao Chunman wanted to kill me.

99
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,920
But you still protect her?

100
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
Zhao Chunman wasn't the shooter.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,279
Who was it then?

102
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
You?

103
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,240
Or him?

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,759
You were once as close as brothers,

105
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,439
and now you want to kill each other

106
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,920
over a woman?

107
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,680
Last time, it was the Richard Hotel.

108
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,639
This time,

109
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,120
the Yuchun Theater.

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,439
Funny how you say the place is safe,

111
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,720
yet it only gets more dangerous for me.

112
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
The Rose Organization is cunning.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
I saw it with my own eyes
that someone in a black coat

114
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,660
ran out from the second floor.

115
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,199
But it wasn't Zhao Chunman.

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't believe either of you.

117
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
I said before,

118
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,000
if you can't handle your woman problem,

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
I'll do it for you.

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,639
Now I'm giving you both

121
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,559
a fair chance.

122
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,759
Each gun

123
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,320
has a single bullet.

124
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,879
Take turns

125
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,480
and shoot each other.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,360
Whoever survives,

127
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440
I'll believe him without doubt.

128
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,440
And I'll throw him

129
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,559
the grandest wedding with Zhao Chunman

130
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,480
in South City.

131
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,519
Make your choice.

132
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,679
Time's running out.

133
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,279
Come on.

134
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,960
What? Can't pull the trigger?

135
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,919
Since you can't choose,

136
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,679
why not let someone choose for you?

137
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,759
Here

138
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
or here?

139
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,840
Him or him?

140
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,039
You decide.

141
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,360
No?

142
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,720
You three are something else.

143
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,480
Raise your guns.

144
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,799
Fire.

145
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,679
Mr. Zhao!

146
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,919
(Zhou Chi is the King of Hearts.)

147
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,200
It's you.

148
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,000
Zhou Yisen

149
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,790
is faithless, gullible,

150
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,960
and harms his own buddies in the gang,

151
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
breaking the gang's rules.

152
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,519
Starting today,

153
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,879
Yi Gang is under my command.

154
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
Any objections?

155
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,440
Mr. Gu.

156
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,159
I hate fence-sitters the most.

157
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,039
Who knows when
you'll stab me in the back?

158
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,039
- Mr. Gu.
- Mr. Gu.

159
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,639
Chi,

160
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,679
what about you?

161
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,200
(Yi)

162
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,000

has been right by my side.

184

Do you know why

185
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,360
I went to Yuchun Theater?

186
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,440
Why?

187
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,000
Because

188
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,720
I couldn't watch you die again.

189
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,519
Zhou Chi,

190
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,640
I didn't see you today,

191
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,039
so you don't meddle in my business.

192
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:51,920
Sorry.

193
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,559
I should've realized it sooner.

194
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,359
Why are you apologizing?

195
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,319
If I had realized earlier,

196
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,559
I could've protected you better.

197
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,079
Haven't you been protecting me
all this time?

198
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,599
I could still do better.

199
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,119
(Zhou Chi,)

200
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,519
(are you my good luck?)

201
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,799
Chi,

202
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,240
when the day comes

203
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,790
that South City no longer needs
the King of Hearts,

204
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,500
let's leave this place together.

205
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,880
Sure.
