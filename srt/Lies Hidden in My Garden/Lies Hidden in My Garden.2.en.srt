1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,610
(Kim Tae Hee)

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,100
(Im Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,240
(Kim Sung Oh)

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,720
(Choi Jae Rim, Jung Woon Sun)

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,100
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

6
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,590
How can I help you?

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm visiting Dr. Park Jae Ho.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,270
(September 19, Joo Ran and Sang Eun)

9
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,220
Ma'am, it's me, Kim Yoon Beom!

10
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,120
Don't you remember me?

11
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,560
I drove Dr. Park a few times before.

12
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,270
He's probably at the hospital right now.

13
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,660
What brings you here...

14
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,780
The thing is, I dropped by Eumgang for an errand,

15
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,080
and I also had something to give to Dr. Park.

16
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,940
Ma'am, are you going t keep me standing in front of the gate?

17
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,520
(Sister-in-law)

18
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,280
Yes, Unni.

19
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,190
I think I'll arrive around 9.

20
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,900
I'll eat before I go. Don't worry.

21
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,210
Right, what time do you go to work today?

22
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,730
At 8 o'clock?

23
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,440
Okay.

24
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,480
The call is not going through...

25
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:22,900
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

26
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,390
Here.

27
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,860
W-What did you want to drop off?

28
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,530
Well, it's this.

29
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,100
It's a bit heavier than you think.

30
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,230
Ma'am.

31
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,630
- Where should I put this?
- Wait! Excuse me!

32
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,330
Shit!

33
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,070
Move, move, move!

34
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,080
Wow.

35
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,360
I didn't realize it because I always went to the parking lot at night.

36
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,480
Wow, the neighborhood and the house are so impressive during the day!

37
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm sorry. He scared you, huh?

38
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,740
I'm sorry!

39
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,840
I should live in a house like this, too, someday. Don't you think?

40
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,940
What the... Ma'am, what's this smell?

41
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,630
I-It's fertilizer. It's a natural fertilizer.

42
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,950
Mr. Kim Yoon Beom!

43
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,020
You scared me.

44
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,390
You called my name so loudly.

45
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,530
I can't accept stuff like this without my husband's approval.

46
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,910
T-Take it back with you.

47
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,940
Approval?

48
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,370
Ma'am.

49
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,500
Are you afraid...

50
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,100
of Dr. Park?

51
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,730
W-What are you doing right now?

52
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,180
Gosh, don't get the wrong idea.

53
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,650
You had a bug in your hair.

54
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,000
I thought you'd get scared if I told you.

55
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll talk to my husband on the phone. Stay here for a second.

56
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,930
Go ahead, then.

57
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm sorry, Ma'am!

58
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,380
Your house is exactly my style. I wanted to show it to my wife.

59
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,970
We're planning to move soon.

60
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,420
We're about to have a baby, too.

61
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm so sorry, Ma'am.

62
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,470
I'll leave this time.

63
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,760
Please tell Dr. Park about our plan

64
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,330
to go night fishing tonight!

65
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,020
He forgot last time and didn't show up.

66
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,550
If he does that again this time,

67
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,090
I'd be very disappointed. Tell him that.

68
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,710
Well, then...

69
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,990
Hey! Take a good look at this place.

70
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,710
We'd be living in a house like this soon, too.

71
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,330
Even the press release came out.

72
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,690
But he won't confirm it.

73
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,170
Kids Care must've done something, right?

74
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,880
Hold on.

75
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,950
I'm sorry. I'm in a meeting right now. I'll call you back soon.

76
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,470
What?

77
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,190
What are you talking about?

78
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,510
Doesn't it look great?

79
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,010
You can never get this kind of stuff in Seoul.

80
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,590
It's kind of heavy.

81
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,860
Pardon?

82
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,590
Oh! The heavier, the better!

83
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,800
What's the point of boiling them if they're empty inside?

84
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,850
- I'll take this.
- Yes, yes!

85
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,610
Well...

86
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,340
Where can I find energy drinks?

87
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,080
Energy drinks?

88
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,660
I'll get you a bottle if you want it right now! Excuse me.

89
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,650
Mr. Park! Give her an energy drink!

90
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,930
What was it?

91
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,490
You must've been really shocked.

92
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,850
What was it?

93
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,740
Before we moved in,

94
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,760
someone buried...

95
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,200
something in here...

96
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,670
I'm sorry! I was kidding!

97
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,760
Look! It was this thing!

98
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,190
Did you get really scared?

99
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,280
I was kidding! I was kidding!

100
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,740
There was a bunch of trash the workers left when they built the house.

101
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,690
The building manager said dirt can rot because of stuff like this.

102
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,790
I mixed it up thoroughly with other dirt for now.

103
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,990
Let's call someone if we keep smelling it.

104
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm sorry!

105
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,180
Aigoo.

106
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,040
Was it...

107
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,250
Was it really just this?

108
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,290
Yes, why?

109
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,260
You think the previous owner buried a dead body or something?

110
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,380
What is it?

111
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,250
Do you really believe that?

112
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,760
Did you take your pills?

113
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,340
No!

114
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,400
Honey! I definitely saw it.

115
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,910
They were fingers.

116
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,630
Are you sure you dug everywhere?

117
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll dig myself.

118
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,530
I need to see it for myself.

119
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,510
It's okay!

120
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,070
It's okay!

121
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,780
It's okay.

122
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,120
You're not the only one who thought that.

123
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,150
I thought it was a human hand at first, too.

124
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,230
But it's such a relief that

125
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,000
there was no hand buried in our backyard.

126
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,090
The reason why...

127
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,060
you smelled the stench so much

128
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,180
is probably because it's Sister-in-law's memorial day soon.

129
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,800
As time passes,

130
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,220
everything will be okay.

131
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,630
So don't worry.

132
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,500
Look at me.

133
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,260
You trust me, right?

134
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,570
Honey.

135
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,450
I'm not getting better at all.

136
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,910
I think I keep making you and Seung Jae suffer.

137
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,330
No.

138
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,730
You're not.

139
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,020
Don't try too hard.

140
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,530
I don't care what you're like at all.

141
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
Because we're a family.

142
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,980
(Team Leader Kim Yoon Beom of Yoosung Pharma: I correct the amount. It'll be 500 million won. See you at Banyeo Reservoir at 11 tonight.)

143
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,160
You always make me eat instant seaweed soup.

144
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,250
But you're making her bone broth because she's your mom.

145
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,630
You'd be basically cooking my bone marrow, right?

146
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,220
Isn't that true?

147
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,460
I bought it with my money.

148
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,830
Do you want to see the receipt?

149
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,550
Put it away!

150
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,470
You think that counts as money?

151
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,210
Aigoo! If it isn't one thing, it's another!

152
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,840
How about the drink?

153
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,200
Oh, here.

154
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,250
Let me open it for you.

155
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,470
(How to get a place as a minor)

156
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,910
And you get this.

157
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,300
And next, from this 6.5 point...

158
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,720
Isn't it tiring to go to the academy in Seoul?

159
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,810
So far, so good. I get to see my friends, too.

160
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,670
Son.

161
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,020
You know, right?

162
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,660
That I'm really doing my best.

163
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,830
You have to take that point up.

164
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,970
And how about the second point? The second one is...

165
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,040
Drink it. Mom told you to drink it while it's warm.

166
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,910
So, this is the point where you have to bring up. If so...

167
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,980
Where is Mom?

168
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,740
She's probably sleeping after taking her medicine.

169
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,100
Don't walk loudly on the stairs.

170
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,810
Drink it.

171
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,460
You have to calculate what the value of A would be, right?

172
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,970
And how would you calculate that?

173
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,030
Honey.

174
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,420
Does dirt smell like that when it's spoiled?

175
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,250
Just like a dead body rotting?

176
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,820
I'm not sure.

177
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,370
We perceive unpleasant odors similarly.

178
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,230
And I do, too.

179
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,530
I remember...

180
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,850
that smell.

181
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,620
Unni...

182
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,380
What's this smell?

183
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,940
Honey.

184
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,890
Why keep reminding yourself of something that makes you anxious?

185
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,380
Drink it.

186
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,030
Min Soo gifted it to me.

187
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,680
It's apparently good for anxiety relief.

188
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,290
Try some.

189
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,640
It smells nice.

190
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,220
Doesn't it?

191
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,900
I don't think I'll go night fishing tonight.

192
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,180
Because of what happened earlier today, too.

193
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,340
I feel bad leaving you alone behind.

194
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,520
It's okay.

195
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,400
You haven't gone fishing because of moving and all that because of me.

196
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,860
You need a place to blow off steam other than the hospital and home.

197
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,220
Also, why would I be alone?

198
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,340
I have Seung Jae.

199
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,380
Aigoo, Seung Jae must be happy.

200
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,180
Don't worry about anything

201
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,100
and sleep tight.

202
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,650
Whatever it is,

203
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll take care of it.

204
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,400
(It's raining a lot. Are you okay, Honey? Safe travels.)

205
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,010
(It's raining a lot. Are you okay, Honey? Safe travels.)

206
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,710
(1:40 a.m.)

207
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,070
(September 20)

208
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,980
Mom.

209
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,370
(September 20)

210
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,710
They say my husband is dead.

211
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,500
What?

212
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,460
What did you just say...

213
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,170
Sang Eun?

214
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,420
My gosh! My gosh! What do we do, Sang Eun?

215
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,070
What do we do with our poor Sang Eun?

216
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,860
What do we do about our poor Sang Eun!

217
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,640
He's really dead, right?

218
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,100
What do we do...

219
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,070
- Pardon?
- Well...

220
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:14,780
What do we do with our poor Sang Eun?

221
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,860
He looks too peaceful.

222
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,030
Well, yes.

223
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
Good morning! Did you sleep well, Honey?

224
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,950
Look at the weather.

225
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,450
It poured last night, and it cleared up completely.

226
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,840
When did you get home?

227
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,430
Huh?

228
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,030
Oh, I didn't go.

229
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,330
I tried to go out, but it was pouring too much.

230
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,150
Mom likes sunnyside ups.

231
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,510
What do I do? I ruined it.

232
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,880
- Should I make you another one?
No, I'll take it.

233
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,680
You weren't there when I woke up.

234
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,920
So I thought you went out in the rain.

235
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,500
It rained way too much. It was a downpour.

236
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,900
I guess I fell asleep in the study preparing for the seminar.

237
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,320
You want coffee, right?

238
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,740
No, Honey!

239
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,630
Seung Jae's lactose intolerant.

240
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,490
Milk gives him a stomachache.

241
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,900
Oh, right.

242
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,900
I'm sorry, Seung Jae. I forgot.

243
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,220
Seung Jae, you're going to Aunt's memorial mass, too, right?

244
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,740
Do I have to go?

245
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,710
Hey. You're making Mom sad if you say that.

246
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,540
If she were alive, she would've liked you a lot.

247
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,020
Okay, I'll get ready.

248
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay. Eat.

249
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,370
Let's eat.

250
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,330
Have some of this.

251
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,730
Geez!

252
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,090
Oh, boy. You can't drink stuff like this when you're pregnant, right?

253
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,300
Detective Yang, don't we have anything else?

254
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,200
Give it to me. I don't care.

255
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,070
O-Okay.

256
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,090
Sang Eun, Oppa's calling. I'll take this for a second.

257
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,910
- Hey, hey! Wake him up.
- Oh, Honey!

258
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,020
- Well...
- Wake up!

259
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,890
You must be in shock.

260
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,790
But there are a few things to confirm.

261
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,980
I'm okay. Go ahead.

262
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,340
Okay.

263
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,290
When was the last time you saw your husband?

264
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,760
I had bad anemia the last few days.

265
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,840
So I took a half day off to go to my mom's house.

266
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,950
My husband picked me up and drove me there.

267
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,360
He was on the way to the reservoir.

268
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,620
It was probably past nine.

269
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,190
Sounds like he enjoyed night fishing.

270
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,370
He doesn't even eat sashimi because he doesn't like the fishy water smell.

271
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,120
He said he was meeting with some

272
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,650
hospital director at the reservoir for business.

273
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,730
Director? Do you know who that is?

274
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,460
The name was...

275
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,620
Park something.

276
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,110
I know the name of the hospital. Kioomai Hospital.

277
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,370
Kioomai?

278
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,930
He was on TV, too.

279
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,130
Kioomai...

280
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,990
(Kioomai Pediatric Clinic)

281
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,460
Dr. Park Jae Ho.

282
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,510
Dr. Park Jae Ho. Is this the person?

283
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,110
Yes, I think so.

284
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,120
By the way, Mr. Kim...

285
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,440
definitely went fishing for work that day, right?

286
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,010
Why do you ask?

287
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,410
Your husband was fired from work a month ago.

288
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,830
How was he on the day he went missing?

289
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,010
Just tell me anything you remember.

290
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,940
How much do you think I could get?

291
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,150
How many 50,000 won bills would fit in there?

292
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,320
We should try living like other people, too.

293
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,930
He was pretty much his usual self.

294
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,710
That's the kind of person he was.

295
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,280
He didn't show it even if he was suffering.

296
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,110
He was so excited that he was becoming a father!

297
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,910
How could something like this happen?

298
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,420
Aren't you getting in?

299
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,650
I want to be alone.

300
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,140
See you at the funeral home.

301
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,800
At times like this, our family should-

302
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,060
I'll call you. You can get going, sir.

303
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,960
Aigoo, baby mama! No one's stealing your food!

304
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,400
Eat slowly.

305
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,650
Looks like the annoying man is no longer around.

306
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,380
I know right away because I do business in front of the police station.

307
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,330
There are usually two types.

308
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,680
One is someone who keeps sighing in front of food.

309
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,850
The other type eats like they've been starving for months.

310
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,590
They don't even notice if it's hot, spicy, or how it tastes.

311
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,180
They just devour it without caring.

312
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,960
How far are you?

313
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,380
Five months.

314
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,670
Aigoo! That's the best time.

315
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,510
You'd know later.

316
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,030
You're in springtime right now!

317
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,990
(His family*)
(Saved as "Not my family," which sounds like "Husband's" in Korean)

318
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,270
- Yes, Brother-in-law.
- Sang Eun.

319
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,410
How could Hyung be like this?

320
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,460
He came to my wife's pharmacy and ordered a thousand of that stuff.

321
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,070
How could he ghost us after that?

322
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:12,180
I sent all the stuff to Hyung's house. So, take care of it. Seriously...

323
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,510
I didn't want to say this, but-

324
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,410
Go ahead!

325
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,420
We'll cut ties with Hyung.

326
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,110
My parents will do the same.

327
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,240
The ties have already been cut.

328
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,790
They have been cut?

329
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,710
Is that what he said?

330
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,800
Wow, what an ungrateful bastard!

331
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,730
That's not it, Brother-in-law.

332
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,420
Your brother died.

333
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,910
Pardon?

334
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,270
What do you mean?

335
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,440
He did what?

336
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,320
He died. Excuse me.

337
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,190
- Ahjumma! Give me a Coke.
- Okay.

338
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,560
- Brother-in-law. I'm eating right now. I'll call you back.
- Sang Eun. Sang Eun-

339
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,490
(Returned Merchandise)

340
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,000
When did you get a car wash?

341
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,040
Not sure. I think it was around last week.

342
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,590
Let's go.

343
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,480
Hello!

344
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:38,060
You're the ones who moved to Cornelia Hills, right?

345
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,780
I finally get to meet you!

346
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,430
Hello.

347
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,200
- Hello.
- Yes.

348
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,440
There's a tea party and a meeting for the middle school department.

349
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,670
Would you like to join us?

350
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,720
She's not feeling so well.

351
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,290
And our son is still adjusting.

352
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,620
We'll stop by when we get a chance.

353
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,140
- Okay, then. See you!
- Yes.

354
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,800
Bye.

355
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,830
My gosh! It's her! It's that woman!

356
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,540
I heard she got out. It must be true.

357
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,080
Did she move back into that house?

358
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,260
Gosh. Isn't she scared?

359
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,560
By the way, is it true that she killed her husband?

360
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,710
But since she got out-

361
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,440
The mass started!

362
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,870
This mass on a fall day with a feeling of a bountiful harvest

363
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:07,690
will be a memorial mass for Moon Young Ran, Sister Veronica,

364
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,720
She doesn't bother you, right?

365
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,610
Huh? Who?

366
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,880
Oh, Ms. Oh Hae Soo?

367
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,910
You know her name, too?

368
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,480
It just...

369
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,370
happened so.

370
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,920
Don't humor her for no reason.

371
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,380
She doesn't suit you.

372
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,610
Excuse us for a second!

373
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,390
Aigoo, hello.

374
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,400
We're from Hwaju Police Department.

375
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,210
You're Dr. Park Jae Ho, correct?

376
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,830
Yes, what's this about?

377
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,700
You know Mr. Kim Yoon Beom, right?

378
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,810
He was found dead at Banyeo Reservoir this morning.

379
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,190
We're talking to material witnesses right now.

380
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,630
I'll be right back.

381
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,990
Go inside with Seung Jae.

382
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,320
Would you like to take our car?

383
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,380
No, I'll take my car.

384
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,440
Okay.

385
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,820
Seung Jae, go inside with Mom.

386
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,170
I didn't go.

387
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,320
I tried to go out, but it was pouring too much.

388
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,780
Mom!

389
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,600
Unni! Unni!

390
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,960
Unni! Unni!

391
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,350
Unni!

392
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,000
Whoa! You're up!

393
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,170
I think you passed out for a second.

394
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,950
Seung Jae and I moved you here.

395
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,690
By the way, looks like you had a dream while you were out.

396
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,340
My gosh! Your house is so pretty.

397
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,730
Wow!

398
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,640
You have a pool, too. It's so cool!

399
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,500
Could I come by to swim sometime?

400
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,310
My gosh.

401
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:00,070
There isn't a speck of dust in this house.

402
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,510
What is this, an aseptic room?

403
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,830
How could this be?

404
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,640
By the way, looks like you took care of it.

405
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,410
It doesn't smell inside the house at all.

406
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,650
Well...

407
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,580
I appreciate you helping me,

408
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,700
but I think I need to rest.

409
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,390
You want me to leave, right?

410
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,390
Yes.

411
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,570
Come over to my house and hang out.

412
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,530
I'll show you something really pretty.

413
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,210
We're neighbors.

414
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,100
Hey, No. 511!

415
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,950
Are you going somewhere nice?

416
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,870
That lady is here right now.

417
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,870
Your landlord!

418
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,180
Hello.

419
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,420
I couldn't tell because you were so skinny.

420
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,150
But it's finally starting to show.

421
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:52,470
How come you haven't paid the monthly rent in two months?

422
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,000
Why don't you switch to a full-term lease instead?

423
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,720
Monthly rent?

424
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,560
We're on a full-term lease.

425
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:05,910
Didn't you know you got the deposit back and switched to monthly payments in May?

426
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,100
I didn't know.

427
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,540
Why not? Didn't you discuss it together?

428
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,460
Did the husband do it by himself?

429
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,780
My gosh! Aigoo...

430
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,830
How could you not know?

431
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:28,580
Well, it doesn't get resolved just because you didn't know.

432
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,950
Ma'am?

433
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,190
Are you listening to me?

434
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,790
I didn't go.

435
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,330
It rained way too much. It was a downpour.

436
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:50,070
I guess I fell asleep in the study preparing for the seminar.

437
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:09,730
(CCTV)

438
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,540
(Cornelia Town, Park Jae Ho)

439
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,650
(The video cannot be found)

440
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,460
(The video cannot be found)

441
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:00,790
You know Mr. Kim Yoon Beom, right?

442
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:05,720
He was found dead at Banyeo Reservoir this morning.

443
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,980
I didn't go.

444
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,990
I tried to go out, but it was pouring too much.

445
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,700
I don't smell anything.

446
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,550
By the way, looks like you took care of it.

447
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,860
It doesn't smell inside the house at all.

448
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,760
How about you, Seung Jae? Don't you smell anything foul?

449
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,110
No.

450
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,740
I don't smell anything.

451
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,940
Seung Jae.

452
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,510
Yes.

453
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,590
What is it?

454
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,190
Don't drink milk.

455
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,960
It hurts your stomach.

456
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,560
I'll take it with me.

457
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,130
You're home, Honey.

458
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,530
Yes, you ate, right?

459
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,550
A supplier at work suddenly died.

460
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,190
I think I'll have to go to the funeral.

461
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,540
Kim Yoon Beom.

462
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,170
He's the one who dropped off the fishing bag, right?

463
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,160
Yes, he is.

464
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,330
You know him since you saw him a few times, right?

465
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,590
Yes.

466
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,180
He came by yesterday, too.

467
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,600
To give you the fishing bag.

468
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,510
I know.

469
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,660
He was fine yesterday,

470
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,660
but I'm going to his funeral.

471
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,030
You never know what'd happen in life.

472
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,540
What if I come with you, too?

473
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,790
Do you want to?

474
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,990
Yes.

475
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,760
He's not a total stranger to me.

476
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,740
It feels stuffy being only at the hospital or home.

477
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,010
I don't have to if you feel uncomfortable.

478
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,730
You must've improved a lot.

479
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:01,200
You're considering going to a funeral on a day like this.

480
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,200
I'd be happy.

481
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,490
I get to go on a drive with you, too.

482
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,120
Let's go together.

483
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,340
I'll be ready in a bit.

484
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,870
Sang Eun.

485
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,550
I wanted to get Mother a drink,

486
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,680
but I don't have any change.

487
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,280
There's a coin purse inside that bag.

488
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,060
Take it.

489
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:06,500
My gosh! You decorated your phone so prettily!

490
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,600
Is it yours?

491
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,900
(Grasshopper: Mom, will you keep acting like this? I want your milk.)

492
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,650
(Grasshopper)

493
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,830
(Grasshopper)

494
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,190
Shit! Are you ghosting me? Do you want to die?

495
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,120
The customers are waiting right now!

496
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,940
Hello?

497
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,330
Hey, you're not Mom, are you?

498
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,130
Shit! Who are you-

499
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,230
Hey, you bastard.

500
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:26,420
How dare you mess around with a girl who could be your daughter? What were you going to do?

501
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,920
Tell me. Huh?

502
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,200
I didn't do anything.

503
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,640
He's so adorable right now!

504
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,450
Hey, hey, let's go now. You're done filming, right?

505
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,450
- Yes, yes.
- You're done, right?

506
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,830
- Yes.
- Let's go.

507
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,000
Let's go!

509
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,240
I'm kind of...

510
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,360
fearless these days, Dr. Park.

511
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,440
How much do you think I could get?

512
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,880
How many 50,000 won bills would fit in there?

513
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,520
Take a good look at this place.

514
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,180
We'd be living in a house like this soon.

01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,840
How come in this girly phone,

521
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,020
your number and a photo of your family are saved?

522
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,100
Could I check your CCTV?

523
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,390
You went out that night.

524
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,290
There is evidence of you going out everywhere!

525
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,060
Do you think I killed Kim Yoon Beom?

526
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,290
You don't know anything, do you?

527
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,030
Your husband...

528
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,180
killed my husband.

529
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,170
How could a person kill another person?

Don't you think?
