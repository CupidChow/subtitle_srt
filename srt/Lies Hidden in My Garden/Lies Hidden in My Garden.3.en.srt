1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,660
(Kim Tae Hee)

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,160
(Im Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
(Kim Sung Oh)

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,640
(Choi Jae Rim, Jung Woon Sun)

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,060
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

6
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:53,903
What are you doing?

7
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,063
What's all this?

8
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:01,873
What...

9
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,643
goes...

10
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,363
around...

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,123
comes around. Stuff like that?

12
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:24,243
Twenty million won for this bastard.

13
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:26,923
Ten million won for this one.

14
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:30,133
Aigoo.

15
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:37,413
And for this bastard, I took care of it for 30 million won and got him a pharmacy at a general hospital.

16
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:46,793
Did you steal them?

17
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:51,123
No, I didn't steal them.

18
00:01:51,123 --> 00:01:52,923
I punished them.

19
00:01:56,103 --> 00:02:01,243
You know, if South Korea

20
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:03,863
takes just one step...

21
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:07,873
If it takes exactly just one step forward,

22
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:10,573
it'd become really great.

23
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,863
But why is it in this mess?

24
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:20,803
Because bastards like these are holding onto that foot tightly

25
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:23,923
and stopping it from moving forward.

26
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:26,423
That's why we're all screwed.

27
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:30,303
So what should I do?

28
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,593
I should punish them, right?

29
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,003
Don't you think?

30
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,283
But why...

31
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,783
would you punish them?

32
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:58,223
Because they deserve it.

33
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,923
(Dr. Park, you know me, right?)

34
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,643
How were you going to...

35
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:24,233
punish Park Jae Ho?

36
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,993
Sang Eun.

37
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:47,443
Mother and Father aren't as healthy as usual.

38
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:49,343
They catch a cold often, too.

39
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:54,683
I told them it'd be better if they didn't come.

40
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,673
It's too quiet.

41
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,303
Of course.

42
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,223
Sang Eun.

43
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:15,373
I'm not sure if I should tell you this now, but...

44
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:18,183
actually, Hyung...

45
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,923
Hyung wasn't supposed to go like this.

46
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,303
Who wants to go like this?

47
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:29,073
No, that's not what I meant.

48
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:36,183
He had some debt.

49
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:41,573
I see.

50
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,473
Father's old colleague was doing something.

51
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:48,833
So, Hyung and I invested some money into it.

52
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:53,893
He never told you, right?

53
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,783
Was that what that money was for?

54
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,983
Did you know?

55
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:06,523
I didn't, but I found out eventually.

56
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,473
How much did he invest that he had to get the deposit back?

57
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:16,263
I invested 30 million won, and Hyung...

58
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,123
invested 200 million won.

59
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:33,413
Brother-in-law.

60
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:38,303
We couldn't afford 200 million won even if we took the deposit back.

61
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,713
You must be mistaken.

62
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,133
A bank loan...

63
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,023
Have you checked?

64
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:53,223
It turned out to be a scam.

65
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:55,253
Father and I had no idea, either.

66
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,903
I mean, we're victims, too!

67
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:01,603
Because of that, even though he forced his products at my wife's pharmacy,

68
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,183
I couldn't even say no to him.

69
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,823
Here.

70
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,833
Father told me to give it to you.

71
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,263
100,000 won from Aunt.

72
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:43,173
100,000 won from Uncle.

73
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:47,363
And 100,000 won from you.

74
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,103
Is that right?

75
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:51,383
Pardon?

76
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:58,983
I know he didn't love him because he was

77
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,593
forced to raise his late brother's son, but...

78
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,873
And when you didn't have a single penny,

79
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,703
your hyung paid for...

80
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:15,823
your honeymoon to Hawaii, so you're not intimidated by your pharmacist wife.

81
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:19,693
We paid for the venue for Father's 70th birthday.

82
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:25,263
We paid for Mother's surgery and hospital bills, too.

83
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,433
But 300,000 won is...

84
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:36,183
That's nothing.

85
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:38,263
I mean, Sang Eun.

86
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:39,503
How could you say that?

87
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:42,053
As you said, your hyung...

88
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,593
shouldn't have died like this.

89
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,603
I guess I shouldn't have come.

90
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,783
I'll get going.

91
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:58,923
My parents would've been very disappointed if they heard you!

92
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:04,063
They should've come in person if they'd been so disappointed!

93
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:09,193
If they made their nephew walk on eggshells for raising him,

94
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:11,393
they should've come out of guilt!

95
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:15,203
You should've at least come and apologized

96
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,573
for feeding him cold food,

97
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,133
beating him up while raising him,

98
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:27,173
and taking your brother's money and sending only your kid to college!

99
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,493
You should've gotten down on your knees

100
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:33,520
and apologized even if you thought it wasn't fair for you!

101
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,723
Why...

102
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:40,293
Why do you lead such embarrassing lives?

103
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,553
I guess you still pity him

104
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,943
because he was your husband.

105
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,203
Yeah.

106
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,263
I felt sorry for him sometimes.

107
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:39,083
As much as I did for myself.

108
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:43,143
Oh, hello.

109
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:47,853
Pardon?

110
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,443
Thank you.

111
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:04,053
Not at all.

112
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,973
He didn't tell you?

113
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,603
I didn't even tell you, either.

114
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:50,043
I don't know, man! How could I say it myself?

115
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,693
You should hear directly from him. Yeah.

116
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:55,643
I just arrived. I'm on the third floor.

117
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,603
Okay, hurry up. Okay.

118
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:46,933
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

119
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:53,003
We're so sorry for your loss.

120
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:55,673
- I'm Mr. Kim's-
- Dr. Park Jae Ho.

121
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:59,433
You know me, right?

122
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:09,263
(May he rests in peace. - Dorothy Furniture)

123
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,673
You came early.

124
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,013
Long time no see, Ms. Moon.

125
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:15,073
It's been so long, Ms. Moon.

126
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:16,473
So, this is how I see you.

127
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,063
Seung Jae is doing well, right?

128
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,253
Yes. Have you been well?

129
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:26,693
Sang Eun, you contacted everyone, right?

130
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:30,923
There are so few visitors.

131
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,283
There's a reason for it.

132
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:37,673
Pardon?

133
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,043
Dr. Park Jae Ho.

134
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,193
Could I talk to you for a second?

135
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,443
Me?

136
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,003
Stay here for a second, Honey. I'll be right back.

137
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,023
Take care of my wife.

138
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,363
Hello!

139
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:09,183
(Dr. Park, you know me, right?)

140
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:16,903
So, how's Dr. Park these days?

141
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,703
Pardon? What do you mean...

142
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:24,273
He got a prescription for sleeping pills, saying he couldn't sleep for the past few days.

143
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:28,483
I was wondering if he's worried about the MOU with Myungjin University.

144
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,003
Oh...

145
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,303
He doesn't talk about work that much at home.

146
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:41,943
We'll go out to smoke for a second.

147
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,623
Really?

148
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,863
You've got to be kidding me!

149
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,763
What's this about?

150
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:01,953
You wanted to talk to me instead of mourning?

151
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:14,233
You were threatened by my husband, right?

152
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,213
Because of this.

153
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,423
That's what this is about?

154
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:28,423
So you were the one who texted me.

155
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,813
What do you think this girly phone is about?

156
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,323
I'm not sure.

157
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:41,053
How come in this girly phone,

158
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:44,693
your number and your family photo are saved?

159
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:48,023
I guess I'm just very, very, very curious.

160
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,973
To be honest,

161
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,893
I don't know anything.

162
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,833
Not yet, anyway.

163
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,623
But...

164
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:01,383
before my husband went to the reservoir,

165
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:05,163
as if there's a chance he wouldn't be back,

166
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,813
he gave me this, and I think there's a reason for it.

167
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:18,903
Make sure to call me if you find out something amazing.

168
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:22,343
You never know. I might get scared.

169
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,373
Okay, I'll be sure to do that.

170
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:33,513
I'll try my best to find out that reason properly.

171
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,013
How cheerful you are.

172
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:44,803
What if you do?

173
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:49,503
Will you threaten me? Like your husband did?

174
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:55,043
If it's necessary.

175
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,573
Let me make this clear.

176
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:28,573
I have no reason to make a deal.

177
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,573
I've noticed this since earlier.

178
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:39,203
You resemble your husband a lot.

179
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:47,873
Mr. Kim Yoon Beom repeatedly made the wrong decisions.

180
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:52,203
He might've done that his whole life.

181
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:58,843
And I believe those wrong decisions led him to his death.

182
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:06,213
For the sake of the baby inside you,

183
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:08,883
I hope you make a different decision.

184
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,743
Sunbae!

185
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,103
Take good care of yourself, then.

186
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:23,623
Again, I'm so sorry for your loss.

187
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:06,703
My gosh! Your things are as pretty as you.

188
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:09,443
Pretty lady, can I have this?

189
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,423
Yes, you can have it.

190
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:15,753
My son runs a cell phone store in Seoul.

191
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:18,263
Would you like to meet him sometime?

192
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:22,553
Wait. Don't be coy and try meeting him.

193
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:25,433
My son is even a college graduate.

194
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,703
Forget about being my daughter-in-law, then.

195
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,923
Do you want to be my daughter?

196
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:37,623
Ma'am, please let go of me!

197
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:40,553
It's because you're so pretty!

198
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:43,413
Don't be like this and come home with me!

199
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,653
Please let go of me!

200
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:48,063
No! No!

201
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:49,683
I'll come with you.

202
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,973
Please take me with you!

203
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,793
Please leave me alone!

204
00:22:04,863 --> 00:22:07,493
Put your hand away!

205
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:19,523
I-I'm sorry.

206
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:22,533
I-I didn't mean to do that.

207
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:25,433
- I'm sorry.
- Mother!

208
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,463
Please let go...

209
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:33,883
You!

210
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:36,313
You don't know anything, do you?

211
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:39,493
Listen to me carefully.

212
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:45,163
Your husband killed my husband.

213
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:50,483
What the hell are you doing right now?

214
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:55,033
Excuse me, Mother is a little unwell.

215
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,443
I hope you understand.

216
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:43,123
Hello?

217
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:45,713
Is this Mr. Kim Yoon Beom's wife?

218
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,893
This is she.

219
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:55,673
This is Detective Choi Soo Hyun of Woonpyung Police Station's financial crime unit.

220
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:59,193
I'm calling about the petition he received regarding blackmail.

221
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:03,013
He's supposed to be cross-examined today but can't be reached.

222
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:08,743
That moron is dead.

223
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:11,843
Geez!

224
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:16,643
How many times do I have to say that?

225
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:20,063
Pardon? Mr. Kim Yoon Beom died?

226
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:22,483
Yes! Yes! Yes!

227
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:26,423
Mr. Kim Yoon Beom is dead! He died!

228
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:31,133
He doesn't exist in this world! How many f***ing times do I have to say it?

229
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:38,903
He's dead! He's dead! He's dead!

230
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,043
Geez, shit!

231
00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:07,623
Listen to me carefully.

232
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:12,973
Your husband killed my husband.

233
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:19,303
He was found dead at Banyeo Reservoir this morning.

234
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,263
Night fishing?

235
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:25,613
You're overstepping the boundaries a bit.

236
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:31,223
You keep saying absurd things without having any fear.

241
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,913
What are you doing?

242
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:03,583
I'm looking for something.

What are you looking for?

244
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:09,873
M-My earring.

245
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,773
I was definitely wearing them when I left.

246
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:15,303
But one of them is missing.

247
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,953
I was wondering if it fell in the car.

248
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:42,493
Are you sure you lost it here?

249
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,723
Yes.

250
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:45,703
Hold on.

251
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:51,843
I think I dropped it somewhere here.

252
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:53,283
Yeah?

253
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:02,203
You're in trouble now.

254
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:04,403
They were my mom's favorite.

255
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:07,193
It wasn't easy for her to give them to you.

256
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,613
I'm sure they're really expensive.

257
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:18,643
I'm just kidding!

258
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:22,923
I can't see well because it's dark.

259
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:26,363
I'll look again tomorrow. Okay?

260
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:29,173
Gosh! It's okay!

261
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:32,743
We'll just buy another one if we can't find it.

262
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:34,373
Let's go in.

263
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:51,883
Are you here for some tea?

264
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:57,583
Could I check that CCTV over there?

265
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,813
I need to check something.

266
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:09,343
That thing?

267
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:15,933
I'll let you if you tell me why!

268
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:23,953
Someone keeps leaving trash in front of the house.

269
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,693
You're lying.

270
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,743
The trash collection site is right nearby!

271
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,413
Why would anyone leave trash here?

272
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:36,913
I just need to check a few hours between the 19th and 20th.

273
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:39,453
So just tell me!

274
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:50,023
I'm sorry to bother you so early.

275

Before Mr. Kim died,

287
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:09,753
100 million won was deposited to his burner bank account.

288

It looks like you're the one who sent it.

(Bank Transactions (Deposits and Withdrawals))
Is that correct?

290
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,143
Yes, I loaned it to him.

291
00:32:19,143 --> 00:32:21,343
You loaned it to him?

292
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:24,273
It wasn't just a few million. It was 100 million...

293
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:28,903
Wow, you must've been pretty close.

294
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:35,063
It'd be revealed through investigation, anyway.

295
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:37,423
So let me be honest with you.

296
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:45,953
There's a bit of a rebate issue between some of our doctors and Mr. Kim.

I have to cover things up as much as I can as the director.

299
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:58,983
You paid him 100 million for helping?

300
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:02,443
One hundred million won.

301
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:05,903
Is that considered little or a lot?

302
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:09,193
I can't get a sense at all.

303
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:13,933
This is so strange.

304
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:18,733
Mr. Kim earned 100 million, but why...

305
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,053
did he go into the water?

306
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,413
Why do you ask me that?

307
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,173
I wouldn't know.

308
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,033
Yes, yes!

309
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:34,223

You know, the 100 million won...

320

You should be paid back if you loaned it to him.

I wish you had an IOU or something.

322

But it was a burner bank account, so...

00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:35,513
Yes.

333
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:38,713
That house has been empty for a long time.

334
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,783
The reason is that...

335
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:44,573
there was a foul smell coming from that house a few years ago.

336
00:36:44,573 --> 00:36:46,653
I guess people reported about it.

337
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:49,983
It turns out a man was dead inside

338
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:52,413
and she was found there alone.

339
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,323
Did you say, "found"?

340
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,633
Yes.

341
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,713
But you know what's really funny?

342
00:37:03,713 --> 00:37:07,553
According to her, she's the dead man's wife,

343
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:12,043
but no one has seen her or knows her in the neighborhood.

344
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,333
Isn't that crazy?

345
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:20,113
Geez. How could a person kill another person?

346
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:22,453
Don't you think?

347
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:28,223
She's obviously bad news.

348
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:30,443
You should be careful, too.

349
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:33,963
Don't humor her for no reason.

350
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:38,683
Okay?

351
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,913
We have everything here.

352
00:37:42,913 --> 00:37:49,393
Even with the meat, you have to measure the right amount of water.

353
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:55,093
It's best when it's done like this, slowly...

354
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:08,653
They believe that? Geez...

355
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:13,223
That night.

356
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:15,763
That night?

357
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:21,243
The night you were supposed to go night fishing with Mr. Kim Yoon Beom.

358
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:25,023
You mean the night I didn't go fishing because of the rain?

359
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:26,553
What about it?

360
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:30,543
Honey.

361
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:33,153
Why do I feel like you...

362
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:36,003
- went out that night-
- Oh, right!

363
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:39,473
I forgot to bring it in!

364
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,043
Bring what in?

365
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:51,853
It was so hard to find it.

366
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:54,423
I was thinking of getting a similar one behind your back,

367
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,063
but it showed up in time.

368
00:38:56,063 --> 00:38:57,403
Here, take it.

369
00:38:57,403 --> 00:39:00,593
Mom will love it if you wear them when we visit next time.

370
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,283
What are you doing? Take it.

371
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,973
What is it?

372
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,433
Was I not supposed to find it?

373
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,713
Honey.

374
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:35,353
I never lost this.

375
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:42,023
Aigoo.

376
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:44,093
What are you talking about?

377
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:48,853
You were so worried because you lost it in the car!

378
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:52,443
You even came out to look for it in the middle of the night.

379
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:54,073
Isn't that right?

380
00:39:56,013 --> 00:40:02,803
I said I never lost this earring.

381
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:09,083
Seriously.

382
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:25,823
I'd answer you back if only you made sense.

383
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:29,443
Why would this be in there, then?

384
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:32,543
You lost it, and I found it!

385
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:35,793
What's the problem this time, anyway?

386
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:39,953
- Honey!
- Did you forget why we moved all the way here?

387
00:40:39,953 --> 00:40:41,863
Did you?

388
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,173
Please...

389
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:50,713
Please be honest with me.

390
00:40:51,393 --> 00:40:54,493
That night you were supposed to go night fishing,

391
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,713
you left the house.

392
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:00,883
When I woke up, you weren't next to me

393
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:04,543
and there are so many traces of you going out!

394
00:41:04,543 --> 00:41:07,633
Why do you keep lying to me?

395
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:11,323
By chance, are you...

396
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,323
You can't be, right?

397
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:30,953
Do you think I killed Kim Yoon Beom?

398
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,353
Please...

399
00:41:40,353 --> 00:41:44,183
Please be honest with me, at least.

400
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:48,033
I'm your wife.

401
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:51,033
- So I could help you-
- Help?

402
00:41:55,753 --> 00:41:57,253
You'd...

403
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:00,153
help me?

404
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:13,403
Whenever you do stuff like this,

405
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:19,283
do you think about how hard this would be on Seung Jae and me?

406
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:20,953
Do you?

407
00:42:20,953 --> 00:42:24,543
Because you always do this, our Seung Jae...

408
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:31,273
Shit!

409
00:42:33,903 --> 00:42:35,573
Seung Jae...

410
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,393
What about him?

411
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:48,283
I received a call from his teacher a few days ago.

412
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:53,153
- Why?
- He apparently told her he wanted to die!

413
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,993
Our Seung Jae is still struggling with that incident a lot!

414
00:42:56,993 --> 00:42:59,313
The kids at the academy mock him and talk behind his back!

415
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:00,923
He's still in the 8th grade!

416
00:43:00,923 --> 00:43:02,623
How do you think he feels? Huh?

417
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:05,253
How do you think he feels?

418
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:12,703
Last time, it was his teacher. Now it's me.

419
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:16,223
Who's next? Is it Seung Jae?

420
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:20,193
It's not like that, Honey.

421
00:43:20,193 --> 00:43:26,243
I mean, what more could I possibly do? Huh?

422
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:28,253
You know what?

423
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:31,283
I can get tired, too!

424
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:36,123
Shit!

425
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,723
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

426
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:45,043
I'll go get some fresh air.

427
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:05,733
Bang! Bang!

428
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:09,763
- Bang! Bang! Bang!
- Bang! Bang!

429
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,683
- My gosh!
- Mom!

430
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,623
No...

431
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,253
Wait...

432
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:37,593
Do you really think I did it?

433
00:44:40,283 --> 00:44:42,913
If you do...

434
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:51,573
I guess I'll play with building blocks first time in a while.

435
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:04,303
She's the woman who killed her husband.

436
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:06,083
That murderer?

437
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,013
How could a murderer be out in public like this?

438
00:45:09,013 --> 00:45:11,343
Murderer! Murderer! Bang! Bang!

439
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:15,523
- Murderer! Murderer! Bang! Bang!
- Be quiet! Let's go!

440
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:18,083
Let's go.

441
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,333
Hello.

442
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:48,273
What are you doing here?

443
00:45:50,263 --> 00:45:51,783
Can't you tell?

444
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,133
I'm playing hooky from the academy.

445
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:57,293
Oh, I see.

446
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:07,433
You should leave.

447
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,763
People are watching.

448
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,783
You helped my mom, too.

449
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:46,503
You're the black sheep of the neighborhood, right?

450
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:55,333
Even the dogs in the neighborhood will find out soon.

451
00:46:58,923 --> 00:47:02,443
People say you came back.

452
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:03,983
Why?

453
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:07,173
There isn't really a reason.

454
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:13,083
I came back because this is the house I was born and raised in.

455
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:18,153
When you grow up,

456
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:23,423
you'd want to go back to where you came from.

457
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,173
Your real home.

458
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,873
What's a real home?

459
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:36,023
I don't know.

460
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:46,723
The place where the secrets only you know about are buried?

461
00:47:54,883 --> 00:47:57,803
A home is a home!

462
00:47:57,803 --> 00:48:00,893
Go in now. Your mom must be worried.

463
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:03,343
Can I...

464
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:07,163
ask you other stuff next time?

465
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:09,943
Huh?

466
00:48:12,763 --> 00:48:14,293
Well...

467
00:48:15,903 --> 00:48:17,723
Okay.

468
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:19,593
Anytime.

469
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:40,923
(The room you inquired about is currently vacant. Please let us know before visiting. - Yeoksan Real Estate Agency)

470
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:59,123
If you have a photo or an object you want to give him,

471
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:01,243
you can put it in here.

472
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:08,623
I don't have any.

473
00:50:08,623 --> 00:50:10,513
Please just close it.

474
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:14,753
Goodbye, Yoon Beom.

475
00:50:14,753 --> 00:50:19,063
Go there and meet with the parents

476
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:21,403
who left before you.

477
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:31,253
"What goes around comes around."

478
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,443
Welcome!

479
00:50:40,193 --> 00:50:43,603
You suffered so much from morning sickness.

480
00:50:43,603 --> 00:50:46,363
You're finally eating now.

481
00:50:46,363 --> 00:50:48,723
You moron...

482
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:50,723
I was wondering where you went early in the evening.

483
00:50:50,723 --> 00:50:53,033
Did you go fishing?

484
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:55,213
You want to do everything others do?

485
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:58,743
I'm the only one who always goes through this!

486
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:01,333
It was my first time this month.

487
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,993
You don't even know.

488
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,733
Whatever! Peel the onions!

489
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:06,403
Okay.

490
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,963
Yes, three?

491
00:51:20,963 --> 00:51:24,743
Unni. That bag...

492
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:28,493
How many 50,000 won bills do you think would fit in it?

493
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:33,573
What? Did you just say something to me?

494
00:51:35,463 --> 00:51:39,763
Right, did you check the insurance?

495
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,273
- Insurance?
- Yes.

496
00:51:43,273 --> 00:51:48,483
Yoon Beom asked me which insurance to get recently.

497
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:51,463
I got him in touch with a friend who's in insurance sales.

498
00:51:51,463 --> 00:51:55,593
And that friend kept saying she'd treat me to a meal!

499
00:51:55,593 --> 00:52:01,093
He apparently signed up for five insurance plans.

500
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:03,383
Isn't it hot, Mother?

501
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:05,553
Eat slowly! Drink this water.

502
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:07,063
What company is it?

503
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:09,083
Doseong Insurance.

504
00:52:12,313 --> 00:52:15,353
- Where are you going?
- Sang Eun!

505
00:52:15,353 --> 00:52:17,413
Sang Eun!

506
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:20,813
Where is she going in the middle of a meal?

507
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:29,093
(Doseong Life Insurance)

508
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:32,583
Why? Why won't you give it to me?

509
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:36,103
No, I'm not saying I won't.

510
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:39,843
As I told you, the plan Mr. Kim Yoon Beom signed up for

511
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:42,633
doesn't pay out if he committed suicide

512
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:45,063
within two years of signing up.

513
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:51,533
You'd pay me if it wasn't suicide, right?

514
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,903
Yes, of course.

515
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,883
We're getting updates on the investigation process

516
00:52:55,883 --> 00:52:59,063
- and when the case closes-
- How much is it in total if it wasn't suicide?

517
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:00,253
Pardon?

518
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:02,993
Well, let's see.

519
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:08,633
He signed up for five plans in total.

520
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:15,413
The total payout would be about 520 million won.

521
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:23,593
It wasn't suicide.

522
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:26,143
I know that.

523
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,623
It wasn't suicide.

524
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,483
I know that.

525
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,753
But why...

526
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,823
would you punish them?

527
00:57:50,943 --> 00:57:53,403
Because they deserve it.

528
00:59:37,513 --> 00:59:43,793
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

529
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,533
Do you trust your husband?

530
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:50,113
So he threatened my husband for engaging in some kind of prostitution...

531
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:53,533
Lee Soo Min. I'm thinking of meeting her.

532
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:56,293
I'll come with you, too.

533
00:59:57,363 --> 01:00:01,203
Don't poke around like your husband

534
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:03,353
and get hurt for no reason.

535
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:04,983
Telling from your face,

536
01:00:04,983 --> 01:00:07,563
I must've done something right this time.

537
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:09,233
(Choo Sang Eun)
Kim Yoon Beom.

538
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:11,783
Why did you kill him?

539
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:18,483
♫ Why does the end feel so futile? ♫
