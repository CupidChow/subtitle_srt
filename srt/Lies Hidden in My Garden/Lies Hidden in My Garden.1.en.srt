(September 18, Moon Joo Ran)

10
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,490
Didn't you hear music or something like that?

11
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,030
Is she pretending she's not home?

12
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,740
She can't be!

13
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,430
If we leave a note, she'll see it later.

14
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,500
Looks like she's not there.

15
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,670
What's this smell, by the way?

16
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,280
(You moved in three months ago, but we never got to say hello. You're invited to the neighborhood group chat. ID is "cornelia79." Welcome, Neighbor.)

19
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,860
I'm coming back home in six years.

20
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,380
Huh?

21
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,700
Hello!

(Antidepressant)

23
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,410
Honey.

24
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,940
I'm sorry, Honey. I'll call you back in a bit.

(Kioomai Hospital, Director Park Jae Ho)

26
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,720
Hello.

27
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
Yes, Hello.

28
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm sorry. I should've visited you sooner.

29
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,680
Nice to meet you. I'm Seung Jae's teacher, Shin Ji Soo.

30
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,670
What's going on with our Seung Jae?

31
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,160
These are what he handed in for all subjects on the test a few days ago.

32
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,870
Seung Jae gets excellent grades,

33
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,020
and he has never had any trouble with his classmates since he transferred.

34
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,060
But he's been talking less, and skipping lunch the last few days.

35
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,570
All he does is sleep on his desk.

36
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,780
Could something have been going on at home recently?

37
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,790
How about his mother...

38
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,000
Seung Jae.

39
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,750
I have no choice but to call your mother if you keep quiet like that.

40
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,690
How about Dad?

41
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,500
Please call him instead of Mom.

42
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,830
My wife hasn't been feeling so well lately.

43
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,930
I guess Seung Jae noticed that.

44
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,130
I'm sure he's been stressed out since we moved suddenly

45
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,410
and he had to transfer abruptly.

46
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,650
I'm sorry. I'll try talking to him.

47
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,370
The thing is, Dr. Park...

48
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,060
He told me that he wanted to die.

49
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,240
They say stuff like that easily at that age.

50
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,890
I heard there was an incident before he transferred.

51
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,100
It seemed like it had to do with his mother.

52
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,540
Would you be able to tell me about it, by chance?

53
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,390
The incident?

54
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,570
You're making it sound like it was a crime.

55
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,090
Oh! I didn't mean it like that, Dr. Park.

56
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,920
I'm sorry if it came across that way.

57
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm starting to feel a little offended.

58
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,690
I'll calm him down first and come by again.

59
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,350
Thank you.

60
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,770
Dr. Park! Dr. Park!

61
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,630
Did you want to sit there?

62
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,940
It's not ready yet...

63
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,380
Let's not tell Mom about today.

64
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,320
It'd be too much for her since it's Aunt's memorial day soon.

65
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,740
Dad.

66
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,170
Can't we go back to Seoul?

67
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,510
Son.

68
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,470
You remember why we moved all the way here, right?

69
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,720
Mom?

70
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,650
I thought you understood, too.

71
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,960
Was I mistaken?

72
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,730
Is that it?

73
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
No.

74
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,320
I understand.

75
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,310
Seung Jae, you acting this way

76
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,970
would be bad for Mom.

77
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,260
You know, right?

78
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,900
Honey!

79
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,490
What are you doing over there?

80
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,500
You're coming home together.

81
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,810
I asked you what you were doing.

82
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,280
I keep noticing a foul smell these few days.

83
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,520
I thought maybe a stray cat buried a mouse.

84
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,420
I want to try digging it up.

85
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,120
A smell?

86
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,270
It doesn't smell like anything.

87
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,520
Can't you smell it?

88
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,070
How about you, Seung Jae?

89
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,870
Don't you smell anything foul?

90
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,700
No.

91
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,790
I don't smell anything.

92
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,120
Natural fertilizer?

93
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,700
You really don't remember?

94
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,140
You asked me to get it to start a vegetable garden in the backyard.

95
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,250
I looked it up, and apparently, it can smell foul.

96
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,210
I did?

97
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,040
Really?

98
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,550
Oh, right! I remember.

99
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,650
I asked you to get it for me.

100
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,920
So that was the smell.

101
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,300
Thanks for the meal.

102
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,350
Don't you want to eat more?

103
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,890
Honey, we should brace ourselves from now on.

104
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,190
What?

105
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,250
For our son's puberty.

106
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,840
Write down all the things he upset you about from now on.

107
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,260
Wait until he gets a girlfriend. I'll show her all of that stuff.

108
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,890
He's the director at Kioomai Children's Hospital.

109
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,730
Let me introduce you to Dr. Park Jae Ho. Welcome.

110
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,230
Hello, I'm Park Jae Ho.

111
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,290
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

112
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,240
The allergy season is coming up.

113
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,550
People are experiencing symptoms. What should we be aware of for children?

114
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:16,600
Since children have a weak immune system, wearing a mask outside would be important.

115
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
I see.

116
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,130
- Who's this?
- Hello!

117
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm your neighbor who just moved across the street.

118
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,190
I wanted to say hello.

119
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,890
I'm sorry, but we have a bit of a situation.

120
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,490
We'll say hello sometime during the day.

121
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,960
Pardon?

122
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,270
Oh, yes.

123
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,540
I guess I came by too late.

124
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,120
- I'm sorry!
- Yes.

125
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,290
Get home safely.

126
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,180
Geez!

127
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,280
What's this smell?

128
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,450
What are you doing? Come here. Let's watch my interview together.

129
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,380
(You moved in three months ago, but we never got to say hello. You're invited...)

130
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,000
Did I go there too soon?

131
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
(You moved in three months ago...)

132
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,840
It doesn't smell here.

133
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,490
Parents can't stop their children from going out.

134
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,960
That's true.

135
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,910
Make sure they wear a mask when they go outside.

136
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:22,010
Also, try not to let them stay outside for an extended period of time, either.

137
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,280
While playing outside...

138
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,880
My hair looks kind of weird.

139
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,770
The makeup didn't go on as nicely as last time, right?

140
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,310
No. I think you look fine.

141
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,460
Got it. Pollen allergy doesn't only affect adults...

142
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,660
That was the woman who had just moved here, right?

143
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,860
Yes, she seemed a bit fussy.

144
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,620
Have you seen her?

145
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,400
Briefly during the day.

146
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,780
The real estate agent said the house would be empty for a while since they had a situation.

147
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,790
I thought that was great because no one would bother you.

148
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,700
Honey, let me look into it again tomorrow, okay?

149
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,490
By the way, you picked really good apples, Honey.

150
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,730
They really good!

151
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,850
Honey, your phone.

152
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,780
(Team Leader Kim Yoon Beom of Yoosung Pharmaceuticals)

153
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,660
Don't think of it like that.

154
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,740
- Hello?
- Don't make it too complicated...

155
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,330
Just think you have to prepare before fall, no matter what.

156
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,690
Yes, got it. Let's talk about allergies in children...

157
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,520
You're overstepping the boundaries a bit.

158
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,330
As far as allergies are concerned, how would you go about...

159
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,270
You keep saying absurd things without having any fear.

160
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,130
A treatment that this pediatrician used on his patients for the first time.

161
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,390
Oh, I see.

162
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,150
Night fishing?

163
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm not sure. I think it'd only mess with my head more.

164
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,000
There are so many things that could trigger it around us.

165
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,630
- Let me think about it.
- For most, it's usually not harmful at all...

166
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,400
but the antigens that are not harmful to some children at all

167
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,070
could trigger a strong immune reaction...

168
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,040
Oh, I see. Being immune isn't always good for children...

169
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,070
Geez!

170
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,140
What's this smell?

171
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,600
What are you thinking so intently about?

172
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,140
It's nothing.

173
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,650
Do you think it still smells?

174
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,970
No.

175
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,490
How about the sound?

176
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,710
You said you kept hearing a thud from the second floor.

177
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
Do you keep hearing it?

178
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,570
No.

179
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,640
I don't hear it anymore.

180
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,640
I know you get sensitive around this time.

181
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,540
Seung Jae and I are trying to be more careful because of that, too.

182
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,060
I'm sure your sister wants you to be happier than you are now.

183
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,220
That's the only reason I brought you all the way here, too.

184
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,330
Honey.

185
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,990
I want us to be happy here.

186
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,470
I'm sorry.

187
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,700
Because of me, both you and Seung Jae...

188
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,330
(Unni's Memorial Day)

189
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Unni!

190
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,910
What's this smell?

191
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,820
(September 19, Moon Joo Ran)

192
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,150
Geez!

193
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,180
What's this smell?

194
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,710
Who is it?

195
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,280
I live here.

196
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,850
Oh! I saw you yesterday! I'm your neighbor!

197
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,310
Nice to meet you! I'm Oh Hae Soo.

198
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,800
Well...

199
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,580
I'll get going now.

200
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,310
Excuse me!

201
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,100
What was that smell last night?

202
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,600
It couldn't have been coming from inside.

203
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,760
I think it was coming from the yard.

204
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,060
It's the fertilizer smell.

205
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,900
It's a natural fertilizer.

206
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,590
Fertilizer?

207
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,100
I don't think it was a fertilizer.

208
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,320
Isn't there something rotting in the yard?

209
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,480
It must smell a lot inside, too.

210
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,370
Is it okay?

211
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,270
I couldn't stand it even for a second.

212
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,830
(September 18, Choo Sang Eun)

213
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,480
Geez! Come on!

214
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,820
I told her not to put this in the hallway!

215
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,290
Geez! Gosh...

216
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,300
(511)

217
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,440
Excuse me! Ma'am!

218
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,100
Ma'am! Open the door!

219
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,200
Why?

220
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,900
Why don't you report him already?

221
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,160
Please leave, Ahjussi.

222
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,550
I'm still alive.

223
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,550
I can't run up to the fifth floor because my knees are worn out.

224
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:57,040
I'll report myself next time if you can't! Understand?

225
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,670
This won't happen next time.

226
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,340
Do you want me to promise you?

227
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,180
I don't know! Whatever!

228
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,120
You always say you're okay.

229
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,870
I don't know! I'm leaving!

230
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,820
You can't do this, man!

231
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,030
This will end badly! Seriously!

232
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,200
Geez!

233
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,490
Has the old man gone senile?

234
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,770
Why is he meddling?

235
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,540
Geez.

236
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,460
Hey! Put this away, too.

237
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,680
Geez, you're so clumsy.

238
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,910
Here!

239
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,380
What's this?

240
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,780
You wouldn't know even if I told you. Just use it.

241
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,620
Is there something you want to eat?

242
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,260
I'm okay. I'm not hungry.

243
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,320
Look at yourself.

244
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,260
Who'd think you're five months pregnant?

245
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,030
You got so skinny, as if you weren't an eyesore already.

246
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,910
How could the baby grow properly in that cramped belly?

247
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,260
Other women crave all sorts of things when they're pregnant.

248
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,500
Why are you like that?

249
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,320
- Strawberries.
- What?

250
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,090
Speak up instead of mumbling!

251
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,710
Strawberries.

252
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,530
I want strawberries.

253
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,010
You've got to be kidding.

254
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,410
Go get them.

255
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,400
The weeds that cause allergy are ragweed and Japanese hops.

256
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,270
Since they're so common,

257
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:04,190
they can be easily found inside apartment courtyards,

258
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,570
on the sidewalks or up on hills.

259
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:12,320
If your children have allergies,

260
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,320
try to learn what ragweed looks like,

261
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,370
and Japanese looks like and...
(Dr. Park Jae Ho)

262
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,250
Don't be pathetic and get the old ones on sale! Get the organic ones!

263
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,690
Aigoo! Dr. Park! I finally got a hold of you.

264
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,290
It's me!

265
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,110
I'm watching you on TV right now.

266
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,480
You're looking better and better on-screen somehow.

267
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,680
You're overstepping the boundaries a bit.

268
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,160
You know, because you keep avoiding my calls,

269
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,910
my misunderstanding just keeps growing.

270
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:01,290
You keep saying absurd things without having any fear.

271
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,520
I know, right?

272
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,970
I'm kind of fearless these days, Dr. Park.

273
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,520
Now that we're talking about it,

274
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,760
why don't I try to be more afraid and you...

275
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,770
can try to give your brain a break.

276
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,320
How about some night fishing?

277
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,190
You said you liked Banyeo Reservoir last time.

278
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,120
Remember, right?

279
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,080
Around 11 would be good. What do you think?

280
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,380
Night fishing?

281
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,320
I'm not sure. I think it'd only mess with my head more.

282
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,650
What's the problem, Dr. Park?

283
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:52,650
I'll get you a really nice fishing bag this time.

284
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,370
I have some stuff to give back to you, too.

285
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,020
(Organic)

286
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,500
(Strawberry Ice Cream)

287
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:34,130
(Jeim Pharmacy)

288
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,610
No, no, listen to me! Hurry.

289
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,490
Oh, my! Dance?

290
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,180
Excuse me!

291
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,500
Excuse me!

292
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,060
Could you give me one of those?

293
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,060
Wake up, ahjumma!

294
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,610
You'd end up giving birth to a kid like me!

295
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,730
Hey, what the heck!

296
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,960
Is she out of her mind?

297
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,310
Do you want one?

298
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,820
She's leaving because she's scared!

299
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,860
- Hey, you want one?
- Come here!

300
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,370
- I'll give you one! Don't go!
- Where are you going?

301
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,670
- Come over here!
- Don't go!

302
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,100
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

303
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,820
- So that wasn't it?
- Weren't you talking about that?

304
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,670
No, no. What I said was...

305
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,830
That cheap stench will get on me, too! You got that?

306
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,250
When I tell you not to do it...

307
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,230
just don't do it!

308
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,990
Shit...

309
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,400
Where are you going? Huh?

310
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,920
Where are you going, huh?

311
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,530
Is something over there? Huh?

312
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,470
You're dead tonight, okay?

313
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:38,020
(Unni, could these serve as evidence?)

314
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,040
Evidence aside...

315
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,680
How can you keep living like this?

316
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,150
I'm doing this because I can't.

317
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,590
Unni.

318
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,870
The lawyer who helped you back then.

319
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,690
You'll come when I meet with them, right?

320
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,130
Yes. A divorce senior is still a senior.

321
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,530
Anyway, would you be alive by then?

322
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,020
Oh, right. We're having a work dinner with the people from the HQ.

323
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,670
You should come to show yourself.

324
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,930
I can't. I took a half day off.

325
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,920
I need to visit my family in Hwaju.

326
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,770
It's because of your mom, isn't it?

327
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,040
Your contract is expiring soon!

328
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,560
You're taking a half day off to visit your mom at a crucial time like this?

329
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,040
If you can't get hired full-time this time-

330
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,870
I won't, anyway.

331
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,210
You know what's going on with Deputy Kim and Ms. Kim, Unni.

332
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,700
Those bastards.

333
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:49,300
I should just report them to the HQ and get rid of them completely!

334
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,380
(Yoon Beom oppa)

335
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,080
Sorry, give me just five minutes. I'll change quickly and be right there.

336
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,950
What are you doing? Come down quickly!

337
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,010
(12 Cha 6642)

338
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,730
(All voice recordings)

339
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,280
Shit!

340
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,970
Will you keep annoying me like this?

341
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,690
What's with you?

342
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,570
You know there's no place to park!

343
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,850
You should've hurried and waited for me!

344
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,880
She's so thoughtless. Seriously...

345
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,930
I know. I should've hurried. I'm sorry.

346
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,750
Geez! Turn away when you do that.

347
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,790
Gosh, seriously!

348
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,320
You can't be serious right now.

349
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,080
Shit!

350
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,580
Move, move, move!

351
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,170
Shit!

352
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,200
Hey!

353
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,790
Hey.

354
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,360
Wouldn't most pregnant women cover their stomachs first?

355
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,590
How come you're holding the handle like that?

356
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,590
You tried to get an abortion behind my back. Some mother you are.

357
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,040
I know. How dare I...

358
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,850
Here we go again! You're talking back again?

359
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,360
Sorry.

360
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:30,240
But I thought we were going to my mom's house.

361
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,070
Cornelia.

362
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,070
What's that place?

363
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,410
How much do you think I could get?

364
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,760
What do you mean?

365
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,910
That thing.

366
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:46,050
How many 50,000 won bills would fit in there?

367
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,910
The baby will be born soon, too.

368
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,960
We should try living like other people, too.

369
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,570
Don't you think?

370
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:39,090
(September 20, Choo Sang Eun)

371
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,230
Mom.

372
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:01,330
Aigoo! Sang Eun, you're up!

373
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,030
How come you're coming back with Mom?

374
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,670
Gosh, Sang Eun.

375
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,970
I was on my way home from work and

376
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:13,740
I saw Mother sitting in the garden like a new bride!
(Mother! 1. Don't go out alone. 2. You have to stay at home...)

377
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,840
I want you to go home now!

378
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,350
Go! Come on!

379
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,250
Bitch.. What a bitch...

380
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,570
Don't be like that, Mother!

381
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,170
She might talk like that,

382
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,140
but she's happy that you often come these days.

383
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,800
Mother! Let's take a shower now! Let's!

384
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,120
Sang Eun, you might be upset but try to understand.

385
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,360
She's been worse lately.

386
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,640
Mother!

387
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,640
She wants to leave because you keep saying you hate her and are afraid of her!

388
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,130
Oh, right!

389
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,320
Gosh, you almost forgot about this!

390
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,200
This is a really expensive brand.

391
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,700
Yoon Beom gifted it to you, right? Gosh, I'm jealous.

392
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,970
Do you want it?

393
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,520
What would I want that for?

394
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,750
It suits a young and pretty lady like you.

395
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,900
Sang Eun, come with Yoon Beom next time when Oppa is home.

396
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,250
I'll make his favorite dumplings.

397
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,290
Unni.

398
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:43,260
He never liked dumplings.

399
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,470
Huh?

400
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,990
Yes.

401
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,250
Yes, this is she.

402
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,230
Right now?

403
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,220
Where should I go to?

404
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,020
Mom.

405
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,520
They say my husband is dead.

406
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:21,000
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

407
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,560
Does dirt smell like that when it's spoiled?

408
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,500
Just like a dead body rotting?

409
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,220
You think the previous owner buried a dead body or something?

410
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,470
What was it?

411
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,180
He said he was meeting some hospital director at a reservoir.

412
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,390
Is it because you're afraid of Director?

413
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,720
What?

414
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,480
Is that what you believe?

415
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,740
I definitely saw it.

416
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,360
I'll dig it.

417
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,400
I need to see it for myself!

418
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,000
