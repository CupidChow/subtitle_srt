00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:09,809
(Kim Tae Hee)

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,099
(Im Ji Yeon)

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,289
(Kim Sung Oh)

4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,559
(Choi Jae Rim, Jung Woon Sun)

5
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:34,959
(Lies Hidden in My Garden)

6
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,229
Stop!

7
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,739
Look over here.

8
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,609
Look over here, I said!

9
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,619
Hey, you have to do it like that.

10
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,979
Done.

11
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,899
Whoa...

12
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,489
Hey, it's my school uniform. Why does it look so good on you?

13
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:04,749
- Does it?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:07,939
Your school uniform is pretty. I'll keep it clean and return it to you.

15
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,419
Just throw it away.

16
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:13,719
- Why did I run away with my school uniform?
- I know, you're a runaway!

17
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,609
I'll take a really pretty one for you. Look here.

18
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,119
- Do I look like a student?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,599
- A middle schooler? A high schooler?
- My gosh...

20
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,189
Hey!

21
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,289
You can't dye your hair here! Don't you know?

22
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,559
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

23
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:29,119
Hey!

24
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,139
Geez...

25
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:35,889
Please put in your card.

26
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,479
There.

27
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,329
Hey, you know that your phone sucks, right?

28
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,959
What's the point of making money? Get a new one!

29
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,829
- No, I can't. My mom bought it for me.
- Hey...

30
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,599
By the way, why did you come all the way here?

31
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,199
Do you know someone around here?

32
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:09,049
Just because. There's someone.

33
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,069
- Hey.
- Huh?

34
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,389
You go on ahead.

35
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:17,639
- I'll meet with someone first.
- Why?

36
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,039
Why?

37
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,299
Hey!

38
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,529
Hey, Park Seung Jae!

39
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,049
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Soo Min.

40
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,519
Who are you?

41
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:58,659
Bus No. 734 is arriving soon.

42
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,409
We live in the same neighborhood.

43
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,059
How come I've never seen you before?

44
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:07,689
I know. I guess only I noticed you.

45
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,539
I know your mom and dad, too.

46
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:14,849
Your mom is really pretty.

47
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,909
Yes.

48
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,269
I guess she is.

49
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:27,119
You don't resemble her at all. You resemble your dad.

50
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:31,259
That's not true! I look exactly like my mom!

51
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,189
You look very happy.

52
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,009
Are you happy?

53
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,339
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,019
You're so funny.

55
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,559
What's the big deal? Tell me.

56
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:11,669
Are you happy? Are you glad you were born?

57
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,839
What are you saying?

58
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:23,359
Gosh. The midterm exam is next week.

59
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,729
Do you have the book, "Definition of Math," by chance?

60
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,109
Yes.

61
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:32,189
That's great! Could you loan it to me?

62
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,659
Okay.

63
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:44,329
It's probably at home.

64
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,269
Well...

65
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:49,029
If so,

66
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,589
I want to come over to your house.

67
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,709
What?

68
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,199
Why? Can't I?

69
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,509
I'm sorry. I dropped it by mistake.

70
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,229
It's okay.

71
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,279
You'll get hurt. Go over there.

72
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:40,659
It's dangerous. Come down.

73
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,069
It's okay.

74
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,159
I'll die, worst-case scenario.

75
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,209
Why would you say that?

76
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,149
Come down right now.

77
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:57,629
Someone told me once

78
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,029
that I shouldn't have been born.

79
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,469
What a terrible thing to say.

80
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,279
Who do they think they are to say such a thing?

81
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,289
Park Jae Ho.

82
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,349
Your dad.

83
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,649
Right? The director of Kioomai Hospital.

84
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:59,379
I was curious...

85
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,909
to see how someone who says stuff like that lives.

86
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,929
What are you talking about right now?

87
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,139
How do you know my dad?

88
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,159
Park Seung Jae.

89
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:25,329
You should've asked me how I knew your name first.

90
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,379
Didn't your mom tell you not to let strangers in your house?

91
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,189
Who are you?

92
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:02,089
What's this?

93
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,749
You know. Why do you ask?

94
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,879
You see this, right?

95
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,429
Two lines mean that you're pregnant.

96
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,909
Why...

97
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,449
are you showing me this?

98
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,369
Your mom.

99
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:30,309
She's so pretty, but...

100
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,529
I'll end up winning, anyway.

101
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,459
I'll get going.

102
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,479
Thanks for the juice.

103
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:05,159
You said something so strange.

104
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,539
I-I...

105
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,329
I don't really understand it.

106
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,319
Park Seung Jae.

107
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,019
Listen carefully.

108
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,919
So I'm saying...

109
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,439
you might have to call me "Mom."

110
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,489
Take care, then.

111
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:41,009
I'll come back when your younger sibling gets bigger.

112
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,169
(Mom: Seung Jae, I'm at Grandpa's house. There are snacks in the fridge.)

113
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,929
What happened?

114
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,999
(September 9)

115
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:43,149
(September 10)

116
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,649
You haven't left yet.

117
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:09,099
No, I'm leaving now.

118
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,159
Why did you come back in?

119
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,719
I forgot a document for the seminar.

120
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,179
I see.

121
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:30,289
(September 18)
Honey.

122
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:34,169
(September 18)

123
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:37,769
What are you doing over there?

124
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:42,149
I keep noticing a foul smell these few days.

125
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,359
I thought maybe a stray cat buried a mouse.

126
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,909
I want to try digging it up.

127
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:55,179
(September 19)

128
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,279
Under the ground...

129
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,479
I'm sorry! I was kidding!

130
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,359
Drink it. Mom told you to drink it while it's warm.

131
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,579
Drink it.

132
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,289
Min Soo gifted it to me.

133
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:40,329
It's apparently good for anxiety relief.

134
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:41,819
Try some.

135
00:15:54,919 --> 00:16:01,309
(September 20)

136
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,199
Seung Jae.

137
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,089
Your dad and I need to talk.

138
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,699
Go upstairs.

139
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,439
Mom.

140
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,859
Go to your room.

141
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,419
The things she said to Seung Jae.

142
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:46,999
Do you believe what someone like her said?

143
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:58,329
I only saw her at the hospital parking lot once. That's all.

144
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,689
You just saw her once.

145
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,559
But why would she lie to Seung Jae like that?

146
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:13,969
I guess the broker who finds girls like her

147
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,669
got a few doctors at the hospital involved.

148
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,519
I was worried it'd come up during the merger,

149
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,619
so I confronted her about it.

150
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,529
She ended up visiting me out of spite.

151
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,669
You know kids these days. They're so reckless.

152
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,479
Not to mention kids like her.

153
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:41,409
I shouldn't have underestimated her for being a kid.

154
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,629
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:52,019
I was the only one who didn't know what happened to my son in my house.

156
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,209
Not only that, I mentioned the smell,

157
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,789
but you ignored me.

158
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,469
If I told you...

159
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,369
If I had told you, what could you have done about it?

160
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,679
For whose sake do you think we kept it a secret?

161
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,159
No.

162
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,689
That was just an excuse

163
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:23,259
to deceive me completely.

164
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,719
Does that matter right now?

165
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,159
Lee Soo Min.

166
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:36,659
Where is she?

167
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:46,919
The night I was supposed to go night fishing with Kim Yoon Beom.

168
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,149
I took care of her that night.

169
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,959
Just forget about it.

170
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:05,729
That's our only option right now for the sake of Seung Jae.

171
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:11,869
Was she an object or a plant?

172
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:15,309
She was a person.

173
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,689
She was just a 15-year-old girl!

174
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,629
Did I kill her?

175
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,189
Our son...

176
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,379
Seung Jae killed her.

177
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,159
I'm his dad.

178
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:32,999
What more could I possibly do?

179
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,679
I'll go to the police station with Seung Jae right now.

180
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,329
I can't just watch him being tormented.

181
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:50,829
Are you out of your mind?

182
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,529
Seung Jae is only 15.

183
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:54,809
Do you want to ruin his life?

184
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,479
You know what kind of person our Seung Jae is.

185
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:04,079
He won't be able to handle the guilt throughout his life.

186
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,859
I know how terrible that feels.

187
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,329
I can't let him live that way.

188
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:18,739
You're worried he'd end up like you?

189
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,019
Seung Jae is my son.

190
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,459
He's not that weak!

191
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,389
If you really want to go to the police station,

192
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:39,849
go, then.

193
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:44,009
It'd all be over then.

194
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,439
Over?

195
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:57,799
What do you mean by that?

196
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,649
This house.

197
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,539
The hospital.

198
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,689
Including Seung Jae's future.

199
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,249
Everything we've been working for will crumble.

200
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,779
If that happens, I won't be able to handle it,

201
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,499
not just Seung Jae.

202
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,549
So...

203
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,959
So, is that why you've been hiding it all along?

204
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,819
I'm the head of this family

205
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,269
and my responsibility is to protect this family.

206
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:57,609
What do you think I could've done?

207
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,769
Should I have taken him to the police station for killing someone,

208
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:03,129
shut down the hospital,

209
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:06,449
and let him be ridiculed for the rest of his life?

210
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:11,389
No.

211
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,329
No, I can't do that.

212
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:22,579
If you can't understand that,

213
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,979
could we continue...

214
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,839
to be a family?

215
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,659

(Adult diapers. Buy one, get one free event.)
Hello?

217
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:59,999
I'll be there by 11.

218
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,289
Those are the event items!

219
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,549
The elders don't like the complimentary ones because they're scratchy and uncomfortable.

220
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:19,869
So everyone gets those instead.

221
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:23,429
You should stock up since the event doesn't happen often!

Did you know that woman was coming, too?

(Hwaju Police Station)

225
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,539
The place Lee Soo Min was buried

226
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:17,109
and the place Kim Yoon Beom was found.

227
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,469
They happened to be in the same place.

228
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:28,089
Kim Yoon Beom introduced me to that place

229
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:34,169
since it's secluded and has clean water.

230
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:39,329
Of all days, he had to die the day I buried Lee Soo Min.

231
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:46,959
No.

232
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:51,939
He might end up being the key suspect.

233
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,859
Let me ask you one thing.

234
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,619
How did he end up with Lee Soo Min's phone?

235
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:08,789
I guess she left it in the car when she got drunk

236
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:12,429
and he found it while he was driving my car.

237
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:15,099
He had a tendency to steal.

238
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,299
What if...

239
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,619
Choo Sang Eun tells the police about it?

240
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:31,499
She knows better than anyone that there's no evidence.

241
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:34,479
And even if she digs further,

242
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,149
she's the one who'd be in danger.

243
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:41,939
Kim Yoon Beom...

244
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:46,119
was probably killed by her.

245
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,429
I'll call a taxi.

246
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:56,449
You can take the car.

247
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,599
I'll protect our family, no matter what.

248
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:13,849
Good luck with the interview.

251
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,409
Help me get up. Please?

252
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,089
What's the deal?

253
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:42,319
People like you should've never been born.

254
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,659
Green plum tea is apparently good for pregnant women.

255
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:41,639
So both of you suspected your husbands' relationship with Soo Min

256
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:46,049
and looked for her to confirm it?

257
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:49,579
Yes.

258
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:53,499
All of it was a misunderstanding on my part.

259
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:58,539
Nothing happened between my husband and Soo Min.

260
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:04,429
Grasshopper. You know him, right?

261
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,499
His real name is Joo Tae Gyung.

262
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:09,989
Yes.

263
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:13,739
He said he got this phone from some ladies.

264
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,779
It was you two, right?

265
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:19,149
Yes.

266
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:21,629
Who was in possession of

267
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:25,069
Lee Soo Min's phone originally?

268
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,269
Ms. Choo Sang Eun.

269
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:45,159
It's true.

270
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:47,019
I had it.

271
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,489
Since my husband had it.

272
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:52,239
How strange.

273
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:57,069
You're certain he was killed, but...

274
00:31:57,069 --> 00:32:00,369
why didn't you turn this into the police?

275
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:03,269
It could've helped with the investigation.

276
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:13,269
- Ms. Choo Sang Eun.
- You must know if you saw it.

277
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:17,199
I didn't even know what kind of stuff he did with her.

278
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,029
It's not like I'd want everyone to know about it.

(Lee Soo Min, Age: 15)

280

Well, Ms. Moon.

281
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,159
Oh!

282
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,149
Oh! You are in shock!

283
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:45,279
I'm sorry! I was going to put them away!

284
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,039
By chance...

285
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,549
do you think it's possible that Mr. Kim

286
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:53,779
killed Soo Min and decided to kill himself

287
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,639
out of guilt at all?

288
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,759
Ms. Choo Sang Eun.

289
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:15,939
I'm not sure, either.

290
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,549
We're done!

291
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:25,159
You can leave now.

292
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:27,319
Thank you!

293
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,899
By the way,

294
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:36,779
was Soo Min reported missing?

295
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,939
How did you know?

296
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:42,969
The day before the body was found,

297
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:47,179
her father reported her missing.

298
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:49,529
You could say he was lucky.

299
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,459
Okay, then. Have a good day.

300
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:08,549
Unfortunately, your husband's case will be concluded

301
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:11,509
as suicide, as I told you before.

302
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:15,329
He was suddenly dismissed from work, got sued multiple times,

303
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:18,439
and he was pressured financially, too.

304
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:21,339
You said you didn't know, right?

305
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:25,529
No, not at all.

306
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:33,829
It must've been tough for you. Thank you for coming all the way here.

307
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,619
Do you want to pick up Mr. Kim's belongings?

308
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,989
It's quite a distance to come here from Seoul.

309
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,139
I'll take them.

310
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:32,879
I guess it's really all over now.

311
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:41,749
So as our misunderstandings.

312
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,289
Misunderstandings?

313
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,219
Lee Soo Min's phone.

314
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,919
Dr. Park Jae Ho had it originally.

315
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,299
My husband just stole it from him.

316
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:05,229
Did you...

317
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:08,929
say that to the police, too?

318
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:17,349
No.

319
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,939
Not yet.

320
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:40,279
Hello?

321
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:35,079
(Kim Yoon Beom. May he rests in peace.)

322
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:44,489
We don't usually call the family unless it's serious.

323
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,699
But Ms. Yoon Myung Soon...

324
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,489
You must know since she's your mother,

325
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:50,329
but she's really something.

326
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:53,399
She's extremely difficult than most.

327
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,499
Give it to me. I'll do it.

328
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,469
Oh! I almost forgot.

329
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:06,699
Someone at the administration was looking for you.

330
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,399
They haven't been paid for the outpatient treatments and medicines.

331
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,769
They wanted me to tell you that.

332
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,529
I'm not saying everyone does it,

333
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:18,619
but people sometimes disappear, leaving their family members here.

334
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:24,739
Oh, the laundry room is on the second floor.

335
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,789
- Hello?
- Ms. Choo! I did it! I did it!

338
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,819
You have to move out by October 10th, okay?

339
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,839
The 10th?

340
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,089
How could I move out so quickly?

341
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:48,919
Why? Do you want me to find a place for you?

342
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:55,399
Okay, then.

343
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,469
It's that pretty lady!

347
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,089
Congratulations.

348
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,919
Wow! I thought it'd be impossible. Can't believe this day came, Sunbae!

349
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:52,929
You'd better get it together, too.

350

Don't try to do anything funny again.

351

I know!

352
00:40:56,349 --> 00:41:00,199
I'm regretting it a lot, Dr. Park Jae Ho!

353
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,639
Shouldn't we celebrate this evening?

354
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,649
We should call Min Soo hyung, too.

355
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,979
Min Soo hyung! Speak of the devil!

356
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,069
What? Yeah.

357
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:25,809
You received a call?

358
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,889
Yes.

359
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,419
All right.

360
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:35,759
Why? What is it?

361
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:40,459
He got a call from the police station asking if he knew Lee Soo Min.

362
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:51,169
I think it's the police. Shit!

363
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:54,469
Sunbae, what should Min Soo hyung and I do?

364
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,359
Sunbae...

Gun Hoo.

366
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:19,769
Why are you asking me that?

367
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:23,369
I have nothing to do with it.

368
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:40,339
So, if it's concluded as suicide, the insurance money...

369
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:43,589
You don't get a single penny?

370
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:47,299
- Apparently.
- My gosh!

371
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,679
What will you do from now on?

372
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,329

374
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:02,969
Can I stay over at your place in Hwaju

375
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:05,599
for two or three months?

376
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:08,229
Pardon?

377
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:12,929
The owner wants me to move out right away.

378
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:16,889
- I won't be there too long-
- Well...

379
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:18,719
the thing is, Sang Eun...

380
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:22,069
Actually, next month...

381
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:26,149
my youngest sibling got a job around there, so

382
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:30,279
he'd be staying with us for a while. I already talked to Oppa about it.

383
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:35,039
And Oppa isn't as healthy as usual since he worked too much.

384
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,629
I don't think he could travel long distances anymore.

385
00:43:38,629 --> 00:43:45,189
We're thinking of selling the truck and opening a small kimbap shop.

386
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:49,199
Wouldn't you feel uncomfortable living with Oppa?

387
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,549
I'll figure it out.

388
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:53,159
I'm sorry, Sang Eun.

389
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,099
I'll take care of Mother. You should rest at home.

390
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:02,589
By the way, what's that? Is it yours?

(Kim Yoon Beom. May he rests in peace.)

392
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:09,599

405

Later. Let's talk later.

Seung Jae...

408
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:00,069
It's about Seung Jae.

409
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,829
I drove him here.

410
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:25,939
That's all I know.

411
00:47:25,939 --> 00:47:29,079
I'll wait here. Go see him right now.

412
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:56,149
Seung Jae.

413
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:59,239
Come in first, Mom.

414
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,969
What's this place?

415
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:31,939
It'll be your home from now on.

416
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:35,489
It looks bad now, but if you decorate it-

417

Park Seung Jae!

418
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:43,589
I won't go back, Mom.

419
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:04,879
Seung Jae.

420
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:08,279
I know you're struggling right now.

421
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,859
- I do, but this is-
- Mom.

422
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:18,779
I saw everything.

423
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:24,489
What did you see?

424
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:34,559
Dad...

425
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,319
Dad...

426
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,819
killing Lee Soo Min.

427
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:48,479
I saw everything.

428
00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:56,899
Seung Jae, Dad left for the seminar early this morning

429
00:49:56,899 --> 00:50:01,399
and I'm visiting my sick great-aunt. So I can't drive you to school.

430
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:04,289
Get ready right after breakfast and leave early, okay?

431
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,929
Okay.

432
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:59,069
Seung Jae, are you ready to go?

433
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,539
I'm sorry...

434
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:14,069
I'll be right back. Just wait for a moment.

435
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,649
I...

436
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:25,599
I'll be right back.

437
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:55,009
In the first sentence, there's a long subject.

438
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:57,639
What would be the verb?

439
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:59,679
The verb is...

440
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:02,309
Seung Jae!

441
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:28,539
You haven't left yet.

442
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:32,769
No, I'm leaving now.

443
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,859
Why did you come back in?

444
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,259
I forgot a document for the seminar.

445
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:38,559
I see...

446
00:52:40,229 --> 00:52:43,569
Didn't you hear a noise from the ceiling just now?

447
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:50,819
What noise?

448
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:07,079
Did you take your med?

449
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,379
I did.

450
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:14,789
You go ahead. I'll pick up the document and leave.

451
00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:02,019
(Pass)
If you don't feel good after seeing a doctor, go home right after.

452
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:04,889
Or should I come with you since it's lunch break soon?

453
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:06,549
No.

I heard it.

456
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:38,559
I heard the noises she made.

457
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,099
I definitely heard it!

458
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:45,649
I could've saved her!

459
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,379
This is all my fault.

460
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:02,139
Seung Jae, I...

461
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:04,609
I couldn't trust myself.

462
00:57:06,229 --> 00:57:07,949
That's why...

463
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,629
Mom!

464
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,059
It's not your fault.

465
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,299
Dad did it.

466
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,009
What's certain is that...

467
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:34,419
the one who did that to Lee Soo Min

468
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,059
was dad.
