1
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:07,417
(This drama is based on imagination
and historical facts.)

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,472
(Most psychological descriptions
of characters and details are fictitious.)

3
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,780
You must be insane.

4
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:33,220
You bullied me first.

5
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:21,851
(After 15 years)

6
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,938
I am afraid to say this,

7
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:26,656
but it is only right for His Majesty
to make decisions...

8
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:30,094
regarding personnel, military,
and punishment issues.

9
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,595
His Majesty is too aged,

10
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,278
and to save him from trouble,

11
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,758
His Highness has taken the throne
in the interim.

12
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,344
What do you mean by that?

13
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:40,492
I am talking about the precedent.

14
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:43,209
Are you saying you have considered...

15
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,906
all the precedents of the past 300 years
in the Joseon dynasty?

16
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:00,823
It is impossible to go over all that.

17
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:03,960
In that case, you cannot bring up
the precedent here.

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,474
If he visits and asks His Majesty
every time,

19
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:09,133
it cannot be called the regency.

20
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,258
"If he visits and asks His Majesty
every time,"

21
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:12,639
"it cannot be the case of regency."

22
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,180
It has only been a month
since His Highness took the regency.

23
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:18,507
He cannot make decisions
on life or death issues...

24
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,977
directly himself!

25
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:27,953
"It has only been a month
since he took the throne in the interim."

26
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,453
"He cannot decide
on life or death issues..."

27
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:31,887
"on his own."

28
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:35,725
He must make decisions himself
to learn anything.

29
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,375
His Highness does not need to know.

30
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,719
He does not need
to know about Noron and Soron.

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,555
Nor is he needed to know
about personnel and military,

32
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:53,539
not to mention any political affairs
in the Royal Court.

33
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,375
What...

34
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:05,788
That is correct.

35
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:10,430
His Majesty is unwell,
but he will soon recover.

36
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,477
And I am not yet good enough
to meddle with the Royal Court.

37
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:19,531
However,

38
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,806
if I do not even attempt
to learn anything,

39
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,643
it will also be undutiful of me
to be his grandson.

40
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,133
That is my only concern.

41
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,189
Undutiful...

42
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,605
"There is no need
for His Highness to know?"

43
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,855
How could you say something
so thoughtless?

44
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,020
All this is for him to learn
as many political affairs as possible.

45
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:04,525
And you say he does not need to know?

46
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,517
Your Highness, you must not let him slide
for his unforgivable remark.

47
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,920
Unforgivable? Watch what you say!

48
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:14,365
The Second State Councilor said it
only out of concern...

49
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,759
- for His Highness.
- Do not turn on us. You are in the wrong!

50
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:17,760
- What?
- How could you?

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,786
- How dare you...
- You shall be silenced!

52
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,547
How dare you speak of...

53
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,594
Do not point your finger at me!

54
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:46,359
("The History of Us")

55
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,305
You have got to be kidding me.

56
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,961
If you are not feeling well,
you should just rest at home.

57
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,476
How dare you sneeze before His Highness?

58
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:08,649
Goodness.

59
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,777
Everyone learns from their mistakes.

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,594
Do not blame him for it.

61
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,166
Okay.

62
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:24,827
Wait. Should you use
the character for courtesy...

63
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,462
instead of the one for law...

64
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,874
This is why...

65
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:47,153
I told you to hire them based
on their personality, not their writing.

66
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:51,124
Just now, you mentioned
that everyone learned from their mistakes.

67
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,374
And you were the one who said...

68
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,288
you could see that punk's personality...

69
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,126
from his writing.

70
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,038
What about his personality?

71
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,334
- He is a perfect historian material.
- My lord.

72
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:11,292
He is stubborn and slow-witted.

73
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:13,214
His sentences are well-written.

74
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:16,662
He is young and from a respectable family.

75
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,582
He even was a child
brought into the palace for His Highness.

76
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:20,960
(When a crown prince is little,
a boy is brought into the palace for him.)

77
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,339
Speaking of which,

78
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:27,590
I want you to help me out today.

79
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,222
What is bringing you to the library
at this hour?

80
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:40,569
Everyone was assigned
to sort out the last month's journal.

81
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,807
So we are short on hands.

82
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,907
I have no choice but to borrow your hands.

83
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:50,079
By any chance,

84
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,848
did he not call you over in private?

85
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,132
Pardon?

86
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,472
I am talking about His Highness.

87
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,026
Did he not ask to see you in private?

88
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:03,058
His Highness would not bother
to call over someone like me.

89
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:04,175
I am not sure.

90
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:08,397
Maybe to celebrate
meeting his old friend again.

91
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,722
He and I are friends? That is impossible.

92
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:34,857
It is my first time to come here at night.

93
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,355
How should I put it?

94
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:40,839
This place is like it has
hundreds of years of life within it.

95
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,899
Copy the entire appeal...

96
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,636
and 3,000 names here.

97
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,229
Yes, my lord.

98
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,239
Pardon?

99
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,574
- Did you say 3,000 names?
- Yes.

100
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,823
This appeal was issued
by 3,000 Confucian scholars from Yeongnam.

101
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,579
So, are you telling me...

102
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:03,023
to write down all 3,000 names?

103
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,153
Of course.

104
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:05,597
In the annals,

105
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,409
it is okay to include
only the summary of an appeal.

106
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:12,034
But, in the "Royal Secretariat's Journal,"
all the names must be written...

107
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:15,294
even if 10,000 people issue an appeal.

108
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,301
This is the reason...

109
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:22,724
why hundreds of years are alive here.

110
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:25,750
What?

111
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,802
Does this task seem petty?

112
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,520
No. It is not petty.

113
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,372
Then, good luck.

114
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,864
Gosh.

115
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:52,594
You just heard things.

116
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,617
No, I am sure someone was there.

117
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:56,712
You said...

118
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,983
you checked the records
of who entered and left the library.

119
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,081
But there was no one.

120
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,319
Yes, that is the problem!

121
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:05,055
- Someone may be slipping in and out...
- No way.

122
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,258
Who, aside from us, would even consider
entering the history library?

123
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,560
Not even His Majesty
may enter there easily.

124
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,562
And if it be a spirit, who can say?

125
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:14,698
Do you not know?

126
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,048
Many trainee historians
have ended their lives,

127
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,371
unable to withstand the harsh training.

128
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,173
Even in death,

129
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:27,410
they say, they return
to continue their work.

130
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,512
My lord!

131
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:33,550
Take rest whenever you are able.

132
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:09,988
Oh, right.

133
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,989
I have heard
that the historians are exceedingly busy,

134
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:16,089
attending to both His Majesty
and myself in turn.

135
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,027
That is not the case, Your Highness.

136
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:20,864
They are merely fulfilling their duties.

137
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,181
You would do well to recall...

138
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:27,437
the previous instance of regency...

139
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,173
so that you may allocate
the tasks with discernment.

140
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:51,828
I shall attend to what His Highness
has commanded today.

141
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:55,242
The most recent case of regency...

142
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,948
involved the deposed Crown Prince Sa...

143
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:07,883
If we examine the records
from 1749 to 1762,

144
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,430
we might ascertain how many historians...

145
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:16,523
served both the king
and the deposed crown prince.

146
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:17,867
You.

147
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,590
Do you still not understand
the rules you must follow...

148
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,125
as an apprentice historian?

149
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,457
First,

150
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,900
do not seek to uncover
the incident that happened in 1762.

151
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,085
Second,

152
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,639
never mention it,

153
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:46,038
even if you learn of it.

154
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:50,620
But that's because...

155
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,322
But why?

156
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,764
- Do not ask why!
- Do not ask why!

157
00:12:55,414 --> 00:13:00,230
If you make a mistake,
it could only cost you your life.

158
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:03,069
But this matter could endanger
the lives of your entire family.

159
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:06,905
So? Have none of you...

160
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,202
ever sought the truth?

161
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,733
- Let us get back to work.
- Yes.

162
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:17,648
- Where is the book?
- Where was I?

163
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:37,689
Who is there?

164
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,337
Are you a person or a ghost?

165
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,039
Show yourself!

166
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,370
You fool!

167
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,245
You shall find yourself
in grave trouble...

168
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,153
should I catch you!

169
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,308
Who on earth is there?

170
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,789
This is where the royal final drafts
are preserved!

171
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:23,963
Cease this game at once
and reveal yourself this instant!

172
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:31,654
Who are you over there?

173
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,027
Who are you,

174
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:36,559
showing such disrespect
in this hallowed place?

175
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,707
I have heard that one would not survive...

176
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,644
should they lay their eyes
upon what is kept here.

177
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,746
If it were to threaten one's life,

178
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,644
would it not be preferable
to cease to exist altogether?

179
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:10,138
Your Highness!

180
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,372
How could you allow the brush you use...

181
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,497
to record our grand history to fall?

182
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:32,216
It has been 15 years,
yet you have not changed at all.

183
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:35,677
You did the same
in the Royal Office just the other day.

184
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:37,314
Your generosity is...

185
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:40,536
No, I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness.

186
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:46,052
However, what brings you here?

187
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,575
I do not know.

188
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,309
Do you believe there exists a door
in this palace...

189
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:02,574
that I cannot open?

190
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,655
Come to my quarters at midnight tomorrow.

191
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,260
Do not breathe a word to anyone.

192
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,301
Look at you.

193
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:31,996
Who did you see last night at the library
that changed your expression?

194
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:34,056
What do you mean by "who"?

195
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:35,481
What are you talking about?

196
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:37,559
I did not see anyone.

197
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:40,689
Many report seeing strange things
during this time of training.

198
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:43,473
After a long night of hard work,

199
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:46,817
they might glimpse kings
or their deceased fathers.

200
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,257
Is that right?

201
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:49,371
What is it?

202
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:52,228
Did you dream of the Crown Prince...

203
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:54,580
you have long wished to meet?

204
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:56,496
How could that be?

205
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,514
Even if it were the Crown Prince himself,

206
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:01,314
he cannot enter the library so freely!

207
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:04,762
I was merely speaking of a dream!

208
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:10,676
Speaking of the Crown Prince,

209
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:12,902
have you heard the rumor?

210
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:14,809
What rumor?

211
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:17,982
It is said that the Crown Prince...

212
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:21,201
has been secretly gathering
young officers.

213
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,265
Did he not summon any of you?

214
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:30,140
It makes sense for His Highness.

215
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,168
Everyone at the Royal Court,
like the Second State Councilor,

216
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,336
does not approve of him.

217
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:34,956
He must be trying...

218
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:38,768
to secure younger officers
as allies before his coronation.

219
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:56,859
("1762, A Leap Year of May
in Lunar Calendar,")

220
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,859
("Royal Secretariat's Journal")

221
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,766
Are you sure you want to read it?

222
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,275
I did not know you were here.

223
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:09,639
If you are not fully committed,

224
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,774
it is better not to read it at all.

225
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,089
I am aware of what happened in 1762.

226
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,156
Who does not know what occurred that day?

227
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:23,234
Then,

228
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:27,241
what difference does it make
if I read the record?

229
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:33,460
Do you really need to ask that
and still call yourself a historian?

230
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:37,749
Once it is recorded,

231
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:41,096
the events resurface
whenever it is opened.

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,849
However, our duty is
only to record it and keep it intact.

233
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,163
It is not our job to bring
past incidents back to life.

234
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:15,551
Is it not midnight yet?

235
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:17,153
No, Your Highness.

236
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:18,541
It is still not midnight.

237
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:31,200
Come to my quarters at midnight tomorrow.

238
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:32,588
Do not breathe a word to anyone.

239
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,987
Why is he here at Crown Prince Palace
at this hour?

240
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:05,092
- I know.
- Goodness.

241
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,255
You startled me.

242
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,229
Why are you here?

243
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:11,923
I was passing by and saw you here peeking.

244
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:13,955
What are you doing here?

245
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:17,905
I was just...

246
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,738
I saw Recorder Shin going
to the Crown Prince Palace.

247
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,748
You know how the officials
in the Royal Secretariat...

248
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,578
get summoned almost every day.

249
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,729
He kept writing something these days.

250
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,705
Do you think he was going
to write a request?

251
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,774
Stop peeking at them.

252
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:54,141
Let us go back now.

253
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,302
If they find you here,
they will question you.

254
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:01,494
Come on.

255
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:05,152
Recorder Shin.

256
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:07,812
My lord.

257
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,934
My lord!

258
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:35,784
- Royal Scribe Nam.
- Yes, what is it?

259
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,777
You see...

260
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,550
What happened?

261
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,091
Tell me.

262
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:47,819
Recorder Shin took a day off overnight...

263
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:49,874
and hung...

264
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,710
He hung himself.

265
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,062
What?

266
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,695
There is no way.

267
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,038
Why would he do such a thing?

268
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,487
I knew things would turn out
like this for Recorder Shin.

269
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,556
How could you say that of him?

270
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,924
Do you not think so too?

271
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:19,394
This is not something to just cover up
and oppose.

272
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:20,801
Also, the Crown Prince is not someone...

273
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:23,230
who would change his mind
over such a writing.

274
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:24,418
Be quiet.

275
00:22:24,557 --> 00:22:26,301
If you go running your mouth now,

276
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:28,801
we do not know
what will become of our lives.

277
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,023
("1762, A Leap Year of May
in Lunar Calendar,")

278
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,220
("Royal Secretariat's Journal")

279
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,024
Forty-six. It hit the mark.

280
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:13,080
Father.

281
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:32,100
The crown prince shall take his own life.

282
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:35,157
Please spare my father!

283
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:38,404
- No, Father!
- Please stop, Your Highness!

284
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:39,940
- Compose yourself, Your Highness!
- Let me go!

285
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:42,077
- I will take my life!
- Father!

286
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,857
Please.

287
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:47,982
Please spare my father!

288
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:58,526
Father!

289
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,386
Spare me.

290
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,097
Father!

291
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,919
- Father!
- Please spare me.

292
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,622
Please spare my life.

293
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:11,333
Please do not harm him!

294
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:13,641
Father!

295
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,778
Father!

296
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,715
Father!

297
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:31,591
Fifty. It hit the mark.

298
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:23,449
You dared to ignore my order
and did not come.

299
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,482
I see you were here.

300
00:25:29,374 --> 00:25:32,320
So, how is it now that you have read it?

301
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,965
Is it a writing worth leaving
to the people?

302
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,255
- Your Highness.
- It elaborates...

303
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,129
on such miserable
and disgusting scenes in detail.

304
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,887
I would say it was a fun read, though.

305
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,473
Do you not agree?

306
00:25:56,868 --> 00:25:58,621
Please reconsider it, Your Highness.

307
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:03,913
Well, then.

308
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,238
What is it you want me to reconsider?

309
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:08,801
That is...

310
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:14,452
What you are daring to do is...

311
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:16,225
What do I dare to do?

312
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:17,693
It is something...

313
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:20,100
that we cannot argue about.

314
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:23,666
Why not?

315
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:26,940
What am I trying to do?

316
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,619
Tell me.

317
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,383
I am daring to give you...

318
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,042
a chance to dissuade me.

319
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:48,808
You are...

320
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:51,800
What you are doing is...

321
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,050
trying to delete the events...

322
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:56,855
and the history...

323
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:01,464
of the year 1762.

324
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,097
I am not only trying to erase
the year 1762.

325
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:09,956
Among the records about my father,

326
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:13,287
I am thinking of finding all the parts
that are necessary to be deleted.

327
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,449
Your Highness.

328
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,926
If you are against it,

329
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,645
persuade me by bringing proper writing...

330
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,731
about why I should not do it,

331
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,465
like the paper you submitted
on your state examination.

332
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,387
You have until midnight.

333
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:32,901
You would better come this time.

334
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:54,215
Recorder Shin's writing
at least had his own logic.

335
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:56,848
However,

336
00:27:57,155 --> 00:28:00,734
it says nothing but opposing it
with writing borrowed from old books.

337
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:09,710
Have you given a thought
as to why I am trying to do this?

338
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:13,108
I will write a new one again.

339
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,973
Do you know how many people died
trying to distinguish...

340
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:23,223
between right and wrong
about my father's incident?

341
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,333
When I am crowned king,

342
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:28,692
whether I want it or not,

343
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:32,129
there will be a bloodbath again.

344
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,778
I am not trying to erase the history.

345
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:43,338
I only want to end
the exhausting political strife...

346
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:46,375
that is caught up in the past
and begin a new Joseon.

347
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,555
You would be covering the mistakes
and hiding the faults,

348
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,626
so in what way will your Joseon be new?

349
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,097
Your Highness.

350
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:06,535
You cannot do the right thing
by the wrong means.

351
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:13,676
I knew you would say that.

352
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:16,277
Your rule of Joseon should not
begin this way.

353
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:19,713
If we look into it,
I am sure there will be another way.

354
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:22,223
What other way is there?

355
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,699
My grandfather could not find the way,

356
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:31,543
so he threw my father
into a rice chest and killed him.

357
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:40,369
There is no such thing
as an absolutely perfect means...

358
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,603
that is beneficial for everyone
and righteous, whichever way you see it.

359
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,674
Politics is about survival.

360
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,260
And survival is the second-best plan
not the best way.

361
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,775
I am only trying to erase
the second-best plan...

362
00:29:55,106 --> 00:29:56,678
that we all chose that day.

363
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:04,353
Your Highness.

364
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:06,434
Im Seok Cheol, the Royal Scribe
of the Office of Palace Attendants,

365
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:07,543
has arrived.

366
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:09,124
Let him in.

367
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,582
You shall visit me on another day.

368
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:32,066
Have you, upper echelons, been aware
of His Highness' plan all along?

369
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:37,318
You must know better
what His Highness is like.

370
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,025
He will become a sage king.

371
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:43,021
Hence, you throw away
your duties as a historian...

372
00:30:43,164 --> 00:30:45,310
and conform to whatever you are given.
Is that it?

373
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:48,154
His Majesty's illness cannot
get better anyhow.

374
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,745
- When the king meets his demise...
- My lord!

375
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,216
After his death,

376
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,962
the National Annals Archive
will be established.

377
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:56,404
Then, all the records
will be gathered in one place.

378
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,196
Once the veritable records get published,
the history will not...

379
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,238
be changed...

380
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,246
nor be deleted.

381
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,348
So, are you planning
to help His Highness...

382
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,055
erase the entire record
of that incident in advance?

383
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:55,891
You are young,

384
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:58,155
bright,

385
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,249
and upright.

386
00:32:05,346 --> 00:32:07,570
But here is what is interesting.

387
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:11,882
Those old ministers
who reeks of corruption...

388
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:15,507
were once historians like us.

389
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:21,343
I despise the way things are
going in this nation,

390
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,456
but if there is one thing
I cannot still give up,

391
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:30,726
it is these records.

392
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:34,530
By nature,

393
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,434
flowers use the decomposed
to be in full bloom.

394
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,219
That is why I try to protect...

395
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,172
these.

396
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,578
We do not have to throw away
the books without any problems.

397
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:44,233
Bring those to me.

398
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,836
Have you not heard me?

399
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:56,211
Please do not read the book,
Your Highness.

400
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:58,147
Please do not read it, Your Highness.

401
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,852
Then, you shall read it out for me.

402
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,587
- Your Highness...
- "The son of a sinner..."

403
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,295
- Your Highness!
- "cannot be crowned."

404
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,393
And I am that sinner's boy
seeking to be crowned.

405
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,362
Is that what is written on it?

406
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,768
Don't bother.

407
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,938
There is no need.

408
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,516
Do you realize how many times
this happened?

409
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,386
Please compose yourself, Your Highness.

410
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,521
This must be
the Second State Councilor's doing.

411
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:42,024
That man...

412
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:45,932
will not stop until the Crown Prince dies.

413
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,665
The king must know about this!

414
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:51,266
Let us be patient.

415
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:56,305
I am sure His Highness has his plan.

416
00:35:12,149 --> 00:35:13,489
Your Highness has told me...

417
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,058
we needed to put the past behind us...

418
00:35:16,301 --> 00:35:19,578
and erase a part of history
to talk about the future.

419
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:23,955
But if you have determined to move on,

420
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,871
there is no reason to erase that history.

421
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:31,254
However, judging
from what you are planning to do,

422
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,855
I can't help but think that this is
all coming from your sense of guilt.

423
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:39,748
My sense of guilt?

424
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:41,948
Thinking that
if it had not been Your Highness,

425
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:48,277
the Crown Prince Sado, your father,
could not have died.

426
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,464
Do you even know what is coming out...

427
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,801
- of your mouth...
- It is not your fault...

428
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:55,364
that your father passed away,
Your Highness.

429
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:59,855
Anything that had happened in 1762...

430
00:36:00,864 --> 00:36:02,571
is not your fault.

431
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,008
How are you so sure?

432
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:08,847
If my grandfather did not have me
as an alternative,

433
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:10,779
he would not have killed my father...

434
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,782
in such a horrible way.

435
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:18,292
His son's excellence...

436
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:22,245
cannot be the cause of the father's death.

437
00:36:23,303 --> 00:36:24,993
Even if it is,

438
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:27,496
that is also the part of history.

439
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:31,934
Within the history of 400 years
recorded by historians like me,

440
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,980
you can see bitter regret,

441
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,536
shame, and pain.

442
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,091
Everything is written in it.

443
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:40,809
In the end,

444
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,193
the history we record day and night...

445
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:47,333
is neither yours...

446
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:49,351
nor ours.

447
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,725
Please do not let your guilt...

448
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,861
burden you and be recorded as the king
who erased the history.

449
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:02,931
That burden is way too heavy.

450
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,621
You will share that burden with me.

451
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:15,110
If I refuse,

452
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:18,082
will you abandon me as well?

453
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:21,019
Like you did with Recorder Shin Yi Su?

454
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,743
I did not abandon him.

455
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:25,400
It was him who left me.

456
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,890
He could have just fought me.

457
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:32,783
He could have argued with me
to the end if he had a different opinion.

458
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:37,708
But it was he who dared to give up...

459
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:45,407
on his king as well as his own life.

460
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:02,780
So,

461
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,671
you must not also give up on me...

462
00:38:08,058 --> 00:38:09,726
because we do not agree.

463
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,063
Yeo Kang!

464
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,285
What kind of despicable rotten eggs
did it this time?

465
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:06,761
Right away, I shall...

466
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:12,791
I knew something was strange.

467
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:16,963
This time, they acted like
they were aiming at me...

468
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:19,572
but shot others instead.

469
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,400
Your Highness.

470
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,853
Please calm down.

471
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:33,355
Who is it?

472
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,790
Is the Second State Councilor
behind this again?

473
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:40,627
Answer me.

474
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:44,775
Your Highness.

475
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:47,189
The thing is...

476
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:57,339
It seems
as though Lady Hyegyeong attempted...

477
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,502
to frame the Second State Councilor
and have His Majesty punish him.

478
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:07,756
Why did you do that?

479
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,791
Why?

480
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:12,093
Crown Prince.

481
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,017
I...

482
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:18,700
I was going to handle it myself.

483
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:23,853
Was I that unreliable?

484
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,806
No.

485
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:29,619
- That is not true.
- Then, why did you pull this trick?

486
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:32,580
One of my men got injured.

487
00:40:34,272 --> 00:40:37,051
He was to be my future subject.

488
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:47,041
I would like to keep this
from everyone else.

489
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:49,564
Yes, Your Highness.

490
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:52,267
Are you done figuring out the journal?

491
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:53,968
"Royal Secretariat's Journal..."

492
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:57,405
includes so many incidents and details.

493
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,308
Quite a lot needs to be erased.

494
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:03,361
If you can give it a little more time...

495
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:05,916
No. I cannot let it drag any longer.

496
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:11,085
If I drag more time,
it will only cause harm to my people.

497
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:15,089
Regardless of my intention,

498
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:18,293
I have no choice
but to join hands with them now.

499
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:22,063
Today,

500
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,205
I would like to tell you
something uncomfortable.

501
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:06,872
("The Analects")

502
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,450
Today is the last day...

503
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,265
for me to come to the palace.

504
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:30,365
Speaking of which,

505
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:36,895
why do I not show you
something interesting for the last time?

506
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,834
What is all this?

507
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,271
History.

508
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:55,156
A journal worth around 100 years
should be stored here.

509
00:42:56,439 --> 00:43:01,462
Guess what I love the most in our history.

510
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:08,300
It is that our ancestors always fought
with words, not swords.

511
00:43:10,205 --> 00:43:13,260
King Sejong made the Hall of Worthies...

512
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:16,448
and created the new Joseon
by studying and discussing...

513
00:43:16,505 --> 00:43:18,221
with young subjects.

514
00:43:19,105 --> 00:43:21,440
I plan to do just the same.

515
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,017
So...

516
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:28,248
I will pass the state exam
as soon as possible...

517
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,225
and come back to your side.

518
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:32,827
Until then,

519
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:38,466
please wait a bit, even if you are lonely.

520
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:40,602
Good.

521
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,004
I will wait.

522
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:04,684
(A friend visited from a faraway place.
How pleasant is that?)

523
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,386
So, at least
from "Royal Secretariat's Journal,"

524
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:35,502
is it not only right to erase
those unspeakable records?

525
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:41,429
That is true.

526
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:44,072
You are right.

527
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:49,184
"Royal Secretariat's Journal"
writes about political affairs.

528
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:53,172
However,
it cannot be compared to the annals...

529
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:55,510
that include the historians' comments.

530
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,377
I am sick of this.

531
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:39,392
You write these sentences
in that injured state.

532
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:41,822
Do you actually believe
they can change my mind?

533
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,634
If you do not even intend
to change your mind,

534
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:48,603
why do you keep asking me?

535
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,009
What are you trying to say?

536
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,876
You keep asking me...

537
00:45:54,272 --> 00:45:57,228
because you are not sure yourself.

538
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:59,423
I had certainty from the start.

539
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:04,712
I only intended to hear
old-fashioned comments from you people.

540
00:46:05,705 --> 00:46:08,892
But they were nothing but frustration.

541
00:46:10,772 --> 00:46:11,869
Figures.

542
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,494
It was wrong of me to have expectations
in the first place.

543
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:20,205
Do you remember what you told me that day?

544
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:23,587
Just like King Sejong did,

545
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,306
you wanted to study, discuss,

546
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:33,197
and make decisions on state affairs
with your subjects.

547
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:35,476
I do not remember.

548
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:39,580
I forgot that stupid remark
a long time ago.

549
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,139
No, you did not.

550
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,488
If you had forgotten it,

551
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,005
you would not have even given me
a chance to persuade you.

552
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,660
If you had actually forgotten it,

553
00:46:54,572 --> 00:46:56,556
you would not have waited for me.

554
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,767
Erasing some parts of that darn journal
will not bring about the end of the world!

555
00:46:59,939 --> 00:47:01,446
Just why...

556
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,514
do you not give up?

557
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:06,620
If we start erasing a part,
we will be bound to erase other parts too.

558
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:09,405
If we give in to them once,
they will start demanding more!

559
00:47:09,405 --> 00:47:10,665
Then what?

560
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:14,676
What about you?

561
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,896
Are you going to refuse to be my subject?

562
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:23,691
Answer me.

563
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:33,267
If you are not righteous and upright,

564
00:47:33,905 --> 00:47:36,771
that makes you just a man, not a king.

565
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:42,810
How dare you...

566
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:49,472
How could you?

567
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:01,072
Get out.

568
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,665
I will not ask you to see me again.

569
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:08,116
Your Highness.

570
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:10,992
The Second State Councilor requests
to see you.

571
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:18,572
What brings you here
without a prior appointment?

572
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,055
To my understanding,

573
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,504
a historian has been troubling
Your Highness with confusion.

574
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,413
I do not care for such indirect talk.

575
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,815
Speak plainly.

576
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,719
It concerns your suggestion...

577
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,889
to remove the record of 1762
from our last meeting.

578
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,463
I must admit your clever approach...

579
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,300
had me defeated, Your Highness.

580
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,203
You have devised...

581
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,332
a way for us, and for yourself,
to survive.

582
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:55,936
Is this not the only path forward,

583
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,340
allowing us to embrace the future
and leave the past behind?

584
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:03,284
So,

585
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:06,887
do not let a mere historian unsettle you.

586
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,256
Let us proceed together.

587
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:13,427
I am prepared to stand...

588
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:16,089
by your side, Your Highness.

589
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:35,049
Royal Scribe, my lord!

590
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:37,218
My lord.

591
00:50:37,756 --> 00:50:40,046
Wake up, my lord!

592
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,122
Also,

593
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,123
the tragedy of the incident
in 1762 lay in...

594
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:54,285
what His Majesty was compelled to do
for the sake of the kingdom.

595
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:57,731
Every detail of that day...

596
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:00,407
is recorded
in the "Royal Secretariat's Journal."

597
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,377
Those who have seen it speak of it,

598
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:06,347
and those who have heard of it
spread the word to the world.

599
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:09,420
Upon hearing, one's heart would break,

600
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:11,552
their eyes filling with tears,

601
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:16,547
finding no solace from above,
despite their most desperate prayers.

602
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:24,724
My lord!

603
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,529
Where are you going when you are not well?

604
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:29,631
Step aside.

605
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:31,565
It will do you no good.

606
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,539
His Highness has gone to see His Majesty,

607
00:51:33,564 --> 00:51:35,274
accompanied by all officers
of the Royal Secretariat...

608
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:36,802
and the Office of Palace Attendants.

609
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:38,939
You need to quit this...

610
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:43,098
Your Highness.

611
00:51:43,295 --> 00:51:44,539
Your Highness!

612
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:48,220
Your Highness.

613
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,397
Get out of my way.

614
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,574
Please do not do this.

615
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:14,982
Your Majesty,

616
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:18,341
we implore you to take pity on us,

617
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,989
to be considerate of our plight,

618
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:25,971
and to judge wisely in addressing
the matter of the Crown Prince.

619
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:38,854
I have already spoken to him.

620
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,960
What more could I say?

621
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,941
Have all the drafts...

622
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:48,943
(Chailam is a rock in Segeomjeong
where the drafts were expunged.)

623
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,892
removed at Chailam.

624
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:02,096
Come closer.

625
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,810
Though I am...

626
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,908
a merciless father
who took my own son's life,

627
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:28,148
how could I leave this world
while these records remain?

628
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:35,856
Your loyalty...

629
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:40,327
has extended beyond your father,

630
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:44,238
even to me, with such grace.

631
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:58,085
I have never regretted
choosing you as my heir.

632
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:16,205
You cannot do this.

633
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:18,714
Do you really want to die over this?

634
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:22,012
I am not doing this to die
but to protect it.

635
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,688
I will send you off to the gate, then.

636
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,648
That is not necessary.

637
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:35,580
Though I am a humble servant,
I know your intentions are noble.

638
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:38,859
Please let me go with you.

639
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:42,677
We must make haste.

640
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,024
We must have you out of the palace...

641
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:47,850
before the hour strikes half past four.

642
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:44,291
My lord.

643
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:50,064
I cannot find the journal of 1762.

644
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:51,665
What?

645
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,464
Where is Royal Scribe Nam right now?

646
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:30,370
You may stay here.

647
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:43,951
Once you had taken it, you should have
found a better place to hide.

648
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,979
Why are you still here?

649
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,723
I could not let
Your Highness travel too far.

650
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:54,595
I told you, did I not?

651
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,098
You cannot give up on me so easily.

652
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:09,007
- Yeo Kang.
- Your Highness.

653
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,830
You will be the only king alive...

654
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,730
to have read
the historian's private memoranda.

655
00:57:20,092 --> 00:57:22,098
"This is the voice of a historian."

656
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:23,955
"It is truly heartbreaking."

657
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:29,641
"The most precious inheritance
our ancestors have passed down to us is,"

658
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,775
"ultimately, their errors."

659
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,846
"If we erase all histories simply..."

660
00:57:35,871 --> 00:57:38,044
"because they are shameful or unclean,"

661
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:41,681
"what would remain for future generations
to nurture in this land?"

662
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:46,768
"But the king..."

663
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,823
"disregards history,"

664
00:57:51,102 --> 00:57:53,851
"bearing its burden alone."

665
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:58,495
"And it is this very pride
that may sustain..."

666
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,222
"Joseon's legacy..."

667
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,084
"yet will not bring true reform
to the kingdom."

668
00:58:20,465 --> 00:58:23,156
Your Highness once asked me...

669
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:27,210
if I had ever tried to understand you.

670
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:35,057
I did try, Your Highness.

671
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:38,261
I tried countless times,
hundreds, thousands.

672
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,306
As your servant,
I could easily have stood by your side.

673
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,717
But as your friend,

674
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:49,519
I could not bring myself to do so.

675
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:55,118
Because if I did,

676
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:59,016
it would mean me abandoning you.

677
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:04,650
So, Your Highness,

678
00:59:06,634 --> 00:59:08,968
cut through me right here,

679
00:59:10,323 --> 00:59:12,900
wash the bloodstained sword,

680
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:16,242
and take what happened today
as the foundation,

681
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:17,631
and please...

682
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:22,787
Please do not ever erase
or get rid of anything again.

683
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:28,230
I hope you will embrace all parties...

684
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:30,765
and blossom.

685
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:54,293
(In 1776, the king gave an order
to delete records.)

686
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:06,815
May His Majesty's spirit
find its way back!

687
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:12,562
May His Majesty's spirit
find its way back!

688
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:20,704
May His Majesty's spirit
find its way back!

689
01:02:29,823 --> 01:02:31,154
Do not worry.

690
01:02:32,758 --> 01:02:34,183
You did well.

691
01:02:35,138 --> 01:02:36,770
You did a good job.

692
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,098
You've done good.

693
01:04:29,642 --> 01:04:31,211
(In the year that King Jeongjo
was crowned, he deleted...)

694
01:04:31,236 --> 01:04:33,068
(114 articles about Crown Prince Sado
from the "Royal Secretariat's Journal.")

695
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:36,059
(We do not know of the historical records
that were deleted from it,)

696
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:41,320
(but the recorders put it down
that he deleted the history.)

697
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,520
Are you okay, Your Highness?

698
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:51,828
Of course not.

699
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,058
I got punched by you.

700
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:05,675
Still, will you do the same next time?

701
01:05:06,356 --> 01:05:07,420
Pardon?

702
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:11,505
I'm asking you to keep fighting
against me.

703
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,466
Yes, I will do that.

704
01:05:36,288 --> 01:05:38,684
("The History of Us")

705
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,726
(Special thanks to Seo Jin Won,
Cho Han Cheul, Choi Hee Jin,)

706
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,581
(Kim Da Heen, and Lee Soon Won.)
