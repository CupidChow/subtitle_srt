1
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:05,622
(A production supported by...)

2
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:06,356
(the Ministry of Culture,
Sports and Tourism...)

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,947
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

4
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,267
(Five Princes' debut has been decided.)

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:12,969
(August of 2007 at Seoulro Fishing Area)

6
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:16,605
Well, the team's name is finalized.

7
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:18,792
For your stage names...

8
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,230
Cutie.

9
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,746
Since you're small and cute.

10
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:26,181
(Cutie, Lead Dancer)

11
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:28,775
You're Clever Head
since you're good at petty tricks.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,488
(Clever Head, Leader)

13
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:31,597
You're Shy since you're darn rude.

14
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:32,788
(Shy, Lead Rapper)

15
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:34,487
Goodness.

16
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:36,284
You're Tall.

17
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:39,561
Are you still growing?

18
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,393
(Tall, Lead Vocalist)

19
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:43,612
Now, this guy is...

20
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,567
Handsome. You know why, right?

21
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:46,585
(Handsome, Center)

22
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:47,855
Just a moment, sir.

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,605
Are you out of your mind?

24
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:52,019
Cutie for a man's name? Seriously?

25
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:55,081
And why is his stage name Handsome?

26
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,762
Make mine...

27
00:00:57,205 --> 00:01:00,237
Guy or Tough. That sounds manlier.

28
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,011
At least you have an English name.

29
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:06,318
Uncle, is it really necessary
to name your nephew Clever Head?

30
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:09,073
Boys, stage names are supposed...

31
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:12,698
to be easy to remember
and give a strong impression.

32
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,115
End of discussion. I'm not changing any.

33
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,073
Goodness.

34
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,579
I think...

35
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:19,808
my stage name has nothing
to do with my personality.

36
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,948
They're related. Listen.

37
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,347
If you're actually rude,
people will eventually see it.

38
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,307
Before your personality causes trouble,

39
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:30,746
I've given you this concept
so you can keep your mouth shut. Got it?

40
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,245
Now, be grateful to me.

41
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,016
- But...
- Wait!

42
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:35,347
Something caught the bait.

43
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:36,896
It's a big one.

44
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,729
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- No way.

45
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:40,589
This must be a sign
that you'll become a hit.

46
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:41,556
- Hey.
- Guys.

47
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:42,454
Go for it!

48
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:43,704
You can do it!

49
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,323
Good luck, Five Princes!

50
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:46,361
Five Princes,

51
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:48,163
- let's go.
- Let's go.

52
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,357
(Cutie, Oh Seung Hoon)

53
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:17,393
(Genius, Han Eun Seong)

54
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:19,795
(Shy, Lee Woo Tae)

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
(Tall, Kim Joon Beom)

56
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,716
(And Handsome, Hong Jong Hyeon)

57
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,188
I had a dream.

58
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,113
- Gosh.
- Geez.

59
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:14,249
To become a hero that shines on stage.

60
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,751
(Debut of Five Princes in 2008)

61
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,790
Handsome!

62
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,290
I love you!

63
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,359
No! Handsome!

64
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,828
No, please! I love you so much!

65
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,520
- Good for you.
- I love you!

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,966
- Yes, I'm Genius.
- I thought my dream had come true...

67
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,399
until then.

68
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:37,455
Hey.

69
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,174
You're leaving the group?

70
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,181
You'll quit dancing
and suddenly become an actor?

71
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:43,707
Yes.

72
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,332
I'm sick and tired of dancing now.

73
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:48,183
Fine. Our group gained popularity
thanks to you so far.

74
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:50,852
But people have finally started
to recognize us for our skills.

75
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:52,863
You shouldn't leave the group right now.

76
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,032
Hae Min.

77
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,266
You wanted us to dance together
for the rest of our lives.

78
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:01,030
I thought we were friends.

79
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:09,337
Let's do this.

80
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:27,522
I love you!

81
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:39,695
Hae Min!

82
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,412
- Hae Min!
- I love you!

83
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,582
Please take a photo with me!

84
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,850
Hae Min, I love you!

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,833
(After 13 years
since the disbandment of Five Princes)

86
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:22,378
(Giving up is equal to failure.)

87
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,653
I brought food.

88
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:39,163
Tomorrow is your 1,000th audition, right?

89
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:40,244
Yes.

90
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:44,332
If you fail this time,
will you give up on your dream?

91
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:47,833
I'll try out for another 1,000 times.

92
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,065
Hey, I told you.

93
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,643
You're more talented
at teaching than dancing yourself.

94
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,143
My Zumba school...

95
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:59,251
is going to hire a new instructor.
What do you say?

96
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,221
Forget it.

97
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,338
Rather than teaching others,

98
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:07,588
dancing myself is much more fun.

99
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,407
- Hey.
- What?

100
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,869
Why don't you...

101
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,940
bring up some stories
about Handsome tomorrow?

102
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,133
You know, Jung Hae Min.

103
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,704
Then, you'll have your screen time on TV.

104
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:20,713
Hey.

105
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,031
I'd never drop his name for myself.

106
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,410
(Zumba Dance)

107
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:40,568
(The main rounds of "Final Dancing Star")

108
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,570
Right.

109
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,812
I'm going to make it.

110
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,557
It's going to work.

111
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:47,617
No way.

112
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,125
Of course, I can't show my journal
to anyone.

113
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,568
I see.

114
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,705
I hear you write it every day.

115
00:06:56,705 --> 00:07:00,070
Can you at least tell us
what you wrote yesterday?

116
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,484
"I want to leave..."

117
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,812
"far away."

118
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,141
Then, of all that you wrote
in your journal,

119
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,696
what is the happiest moment?

120
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,279
(When was his happiest moment?)

121
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,336
Back when...

122
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:29,898
I was part of Five Princes.

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,010
I was the happiest then.

124
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:39,836
As if.

125
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:59,634
Gosh, you're back again.

126
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:00,760
("Final Dancing Star")

127
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,359
Yes.

128
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:04,758
Who is he?

129
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,473
He's an experienced contestant.

130
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,343
You know, people don't know Five Princes,
but they know Handsome.

131
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,093
Actor Jung Hae Min
used to be part of that group.

132
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:11,996
Wait.

133
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,484
You're a big senior of mine.

134
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,285
Well, right.

135
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,445
I'll look forward to it, sir.

136
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,409
Thank you.

137
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,357
Let's do well.

138
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,091
I can never afford any mistakes.

139
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,450
You can do it.

140
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,599
You can make it happen.

141
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,312
Please get ready.

142
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,521
I...

143
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,018
I liked it.

144
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:18,321
- Sorry?
- It says you created the choreography.

145
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:19,659
You did a great job.

146
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:22,438
The structure and your move were
both good.

147
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:28,360
Based on J's review,
who's known for being strict,

148
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,376
I think you can look forward
to the acceptance text message.

149
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:37,743
Thank you. Thank you so much.

150
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,117
- Thanks for the good work.
- Thanks.

151
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,384
You'll be receiving the result
of the audition by the end of this week.

152
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,584
- Yes.
- If you pass,

153
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:49,084
you might want to prepare
for the live performance.

154
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,251
- Live performance?
- Yes.

155
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:51,751
Thank you.

156
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:57,563
Oh, right. My jacket. Darn it.

157
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:04,704
Are you going to give him a pass?

158
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:06,696
I feel bad for the guy.

159
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:09,805
It's remarkable
that he hasn't given up yet.

160
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,151
(Live performance on July 31, 4 days left)

161
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:32,595
I think you can look forward
to the acceptance text message.

162
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:37,329
Who cares if they pass me
just out of pity?

163
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,579
As long as I get the text message,
I'm good.

(I'd like to interview you
about the disappearance of Jung Hae Min.)

166
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:56,851
A reporter?

167
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,739
Rumor has it
that Jung Hae Min, the actor...

168
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:06,476
who broke the ten-million-viewer record
with the movie "Gills,"

169
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,384
has gone missing for four days now,

170
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:10,359
and the news has shocked the public.

171
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:14,251
His fans have expressed
concern, suggesting...

172
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,817
that his mental state, as shown
in his last interview, was unstable.

173
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,384
Many fans believe this situation...

174
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,984
- could be very serious
- Unstable, my foot.

175
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:22,317
What an ungrateful jerk.

176
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,442
How did they even get my number?

177
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:36,457

00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:15,512
What do you...

184
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,059
I'm a little busy.

185
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,917
In his last interview,

186
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,887
Hae Min mentioned Five Princes.

187
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,504
Why do you think he brought it up?

188
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:27,017
Has he contacted you?

189
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,617
Why would he contact me?

190
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:32,121
He wouldn't mention it for nothing,
would he?

191
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:34,859
Are you sure you know nothing?

192
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,651
Come on. Just tell me what you know.

193
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:37,851
I would if I knew anything.

194
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,660
In fact, I don't want to know. Bye.

195
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:42,106
Why do you hate Jung Hae Min?

196
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,957
There were rumors
that he was bullied by other members.

197
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:46,871
They were true, right?

198
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,676
Did you get jealous of his fame?

199
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:53,926
Oh, and do you believe
Five Princes disbanded because of him?

200
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,184
Come on, any comment?

201
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:58,746
Whether he did anything or not,
why should I care?

202
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,270
Don't you even care
about what he's been doing?

203
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,992
Whether that jerk did anything or not,
why should I care?

204
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,726
Is this really the reaction of a man
whose friend has gone missing?

205
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:20,126
We've started to form a theory.

206
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,917
Did Jung Hae Min really want
to leave the group?

207
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,659
What if he was forced to...

208
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:30,112
- because of unreasonable treatment?
- I didn't even use swear words!

209
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,979
What if all the mistreatment
from his former group...

210
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:35,351
led to his depression?

211
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,217
What does she mean by we bullied him?

212
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:39,584
Can they broadcast
this kind of fake news on TV?

213
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:41,151
It doesn't matter if it's true or fake.

214
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,551
Don't you have any concerns by now?

215
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,384
- I do.
- Right?

216
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,951
Handsome, that jerk
has always been the problem.

217
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:49,659
I'm talking about the text voting!

218
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:50,617
What about it?

219
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,832
You got a good feeling
about the last audition, right?

220
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,284
- Right.
- If you pass,

221
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,551
- you'll be on the live stage next week!
- Yes.

222
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:58,431
Your fate will be decided
by people's text votes.

223
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,051
- Can't you see that?
- I can.

224
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:04,451
Now, who do you expect will vote for you?

225
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:08,439
You've turned every woman
in this country against you.

226
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,900
Do you see it now?

227
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:15,657
You're doomed.

228
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,017
What do I do?

229
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:29,189
Hello?

230
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:32,673
This place is amazing.

231
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:42,817
It's been a hot minute, right?

232
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,704
Has it been ten years now?

233
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:56,431
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

234
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,478
Do you think an apology is enough?

235
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,769
My personal information has been leaked,
and my cafe is about to shut down.

236
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,712
Come on. How could it be
when your cafe is this nice?

237
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,051
Yes.

238
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:10,829
Do you see the window over there?

239
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:14,726
How nice. Is it art?

240
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,267
Well, the glass was fine yesterday.

241
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,917
But Handsome's fans smashed the glass
with a stone last night.

242
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,189
Cutie.

243
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:23,907
It's all thanks to you.

244
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,617
Come on. Call me by my name, please.

245
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:29,792
Cutie.

246
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:32,153
I don't think
you understand what you've done.

247
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,784
It's not about being criticized.

248
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,856
We're actually being threatened.

249
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:41,707
I have a lot of responsibilities now.

250
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,092
I have four kids to debut next month.

251
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,917
(BAKSAL Entertainment, Park Myung Jun)

252
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,384
Did the CEO pass away?

253
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,659
He's still alive!

254
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,417
We've done recording their debut album!

255
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,590
If it goes wrong,
I might pass away myself!

256
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,637
A hair salon without mirrors.

257
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:04,317
Have you seen it?

258
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:06,351
(Tall, a hair designer)

259
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:15,351
He's been stressing me out a lot lately.

260
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:19,121
You've gotten yourself
into trouble with your tongue.

261
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:23,013
But to be honest,
what did I do so wrong anyway?

262
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,784
He was the one
who abandoned everyone on this team.

263
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,217
Why should I be worried about him?

264
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:28,333
Save it.

265
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,317
Why are we here anyway?

266
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,896
Are we here
to be nostalgic and everything?

267
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,559
It's done, right?

268
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:37,412
I need to find a part-time job
or something, so I'm busy.

269
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,966
I have a plan.

270
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:46,927
It's a plan
to turn a crisis into a chance.

271
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:51,159
With this plan,
my new idol group can be popular,

272
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:52,892
and you can expand your cafe franchise,

273
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:53,935
and you...

274
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,865
You can dye your hair roots.

275
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:57,271
And you...

276
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,779
What have you been up to?

277
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:05,576
Anyway, we can do everything with my plan.

278
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:09,544
Let's find Handsome.

279
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,497
We can track him down ourselves.

280
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:17,517
- You should leave.
- I'll get going.

281
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,484
Come on, guys!

282
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:21,251
There's a rumor circulating
in the industry.

283
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:24,232
I'm not sure if he's gone missing,
but he's definitely unreachable right now.

284
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,617
His agency is looking for him quietly.

285
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,317
Why do we want to get involved in that?

286
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,333
Cutie.

287
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,084
The whole nation wants him back safely.

288
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,784
They're actually preying for it.

289
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:34,751
You mean praying.

290
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:38,193
What do you think
they'd think of us if we find him?

291
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:41,318
Plus, what if we post a selfie
of all five of us on social media?

292
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,310
That'd give us our reputation back.

293
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,833
The media would eat it up.

294
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,576
The public would love it.

295
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,759
That's how we turn this crisis
into an opportunity.

296
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:50,717
I see.

297
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,317
What good would it do
to make the public love me?

298
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,263
I'm talking about the text voting!

299
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:00,884
If you pass,

300
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,921
your fate will be decided
by people's text votes.

301
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:03,921
Can't you see that?

302
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:15,491
How can we find him?

303
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,116
It needs to go live.

304
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:21,417
We find him no matter what
before 6:00 p.m. Wednesday.

305
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,484
That's very specific.

306
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,170
Can we find him by then or not?

307
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,641
We can.

308
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,077
Don't you know me?

309
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,359
I'm Genius of Five Princes.

310
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,647
You mean Schemer, don't you?

311
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,517
I don't know why he went under the radar.

312
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:38,217
And we don't have to know it.

313
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:43,085
But I have a hunch
where he might have been.

314
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,265
Didn't you see his last interview?

315
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,551
- Why would we see it?
- I watched it.

316
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,151
He said he missed back
when he was still Five Princes.

317
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,617
He said
it was the happiest day of his life.

318
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:54,733
And right after that, he's gone missing.

319
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:58,319
It's likely that we find him
at a place related to us back in the day.

320
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:00,340
You're a little detective, aren't you?

321
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:02,517
If it's so obvious,
why hasn't his agency found him yet?

322
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,951
Of course, they can't.

323
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:05,988
They never lived under the same roof
with him back then.

324
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:07,281
But we did.

325
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:11,320
We must find him before his agency does
to turn the public opinion around.

326
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,422
I'm sure he's somewhere
that has to do with us.

327
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,203
Where do you think...

328
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,297
that place is?

329
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:27,055
You idiot.

330
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,359
Our old dorm.

331
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:33,882
It can't be.

332
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,816
He can't go in
since my boys are staying there.

333
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,511
It has to be the dorm.

334
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:42,098
I should just get ready for the interview.

335
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,707
An interview?

336
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:45,426
No way.

337
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,106
Of course, I can't show my journal
to anyone.

338
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,726
Let's go.

339
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:55,135
Where are we going?

340
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,934
To find Handsome's journal.

341
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:03,378
(Finding Handsome)

342
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,927
Hey, a little more.

343
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,156
Tall, what are you doing over there?

344
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,027
Raise your butt up a little more.

345
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,761
- Get me up there.
- Over here, okay?

346
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:24,431
Raise your butt right here. There!

347
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:27,002
- I'm almost there.
- All right?

348
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,135
- That hurts.
- Hey.

349
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,304
- You need a workout.
- It's not going to work.

350
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:32,272
- Put my leg up.
- Geez.

351
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:33,608
Good. Do it like that.

352
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,577
Hey, that's too much!

353
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:37,912
That's enough.

354
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,281
- I was just...
- Geez.

355
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,414
You try doing it, then.

356
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:43,317
- Push him up firmly. Good, right here.
- Come on.

357
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,320
- What's this?
- You jerks!

358
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:47,588
Where do you think you are?
Get out of here.

359
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:51,592
How dare you!

360
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,462
Do you know where you are right now?

361
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:56,998
This isn't somewhere
you parasites can come!

362
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:59,492
- Hey! Your life depends on this.
- My nose!

363
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,936
Genius, is it you?

364
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:07,276
I love you!

365
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,543
No! Handsome!

366
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:10,803
Are you Oh Gong Ju?

367
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,310
I had no idea.

368
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,887
Right.

369
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:21,856
That one.

370
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,124
- Let me do it.
- Geez.

371
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:31,665
Do you still live like this?

372
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:32,400
(Oh Gong Ju, Handsome's die-hard fan)

373
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:34,193
Zip it.

374
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:38,172
So, when was the last time
you saw Handsome?

375
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:41,601
On the day of that interview.

376
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:42,835
The interview.

377
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:46,346
(A few days ago,
before Handsome went missing)

378
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:50,243
I was about to go home
after my day's work.

379
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:11,839
And his eyes were like those of someone...

380
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:14,767
who left a lover beyond the galaxy.

381
00:23:16,268 --> 00:23:21,115
I hope there were the sky, the stars,

382
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,110
and me as well in his eyes on that day.

383
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:29,656
He kept looking up
for a long time after that...

384
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,517
Can you fast-forward it?

385
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:42,435
Stop.

386
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:45,372
- Who is that?
- Be patient.

387
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:55,149
It's a woman, right?

388
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:57,151
Gosh. Stop making a fuss.

389
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:09,496
So much for missing the days
back in the day.

390
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,698
That's a lot of crap, isn't it?

391
00:24:11,722 --> 00:24:14,437
He's not seeing anyone.

392
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:18,038
No, I'm sure of it. It's a woman.

393
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,006
I'm sure they eloped in love.

394
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,575
The driver was a man, for sure.

395
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,778
My heart was at peace.

396
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,079
I got it.

397
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:27,815
Let go of him.

398
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,652
So, where do you think he went?

399
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:34,889
You would've gone after him, right?

400
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:35,990
Right?

401
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,834
What am I, Usain Bolt?

402
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:41,287
I can't run after a running car.

403
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:45,366
I'm really worried for him too.

404
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:47,693
I want to know where he is
and what he's doing there.

405
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:51,705
Or...

406
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:56,143
if he's seeing any woman.

407
00:24:57,002 --> 00:25:00,280
If you're so worried, you can report
the photo to his company.

408
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:05,686
I couldn't, as I've already been
warned twice for invasion of privacy.

409
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:09,749
I won't be able to see him
if I go to jail.

410
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:13,961
So we're the only ones
who know about this information.

411
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,090
Hae Min.

412
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:20,793
I've seen him since his Five Princes days.

413
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,003
And he doesn't look as happy as back then.

414
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:25,731
Oh, I know!

415
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,809
It's 0-1-0-0-1-4-7-5-3-8-2.

416
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,078
- Over there.
- What is it?

417
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:33,146
It's written right here.

418
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:36,884
That was genius.

419
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:42,388
I didn't think they'd elope in love.

420
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,358
That's kind of romantic of him.

421
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:46,491
I'm dying to find out.

422
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:48,663
Handsome's woman?

423
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:55,094
Yes, hello?

424
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:56,904
- What?
- What?

425
00:25:56,928 --> 00:25:58,084
Hello?

426
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:04,373
You were only his manager?

427
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,847
I know that you...

428
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:11,784
kissed Handsome
over the car windows romantically.

429
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:12,819
I mean,

430
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:15,248
I just told you
he was checking the backseat.

431
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:19,541
I like women. I'm crazy about them.

432
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:22,154
Goodness.

433
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,732
For all we know, you're the one
who last saw Handsome.

434
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,102
Why didn't you tell the agency?

435
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,135
That is...

436
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:32,592
Is there a reason why you're denying
meeting Handsome?

437
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,616
Well, that is...

438
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,795
There's a lot of talk about losing him.

439
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:43,686
If I say that I drove him,
I might get fired.

440
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:47,021
He said that he wanted to go
for a quick drive...

441
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:48,388
and told me to get off for a bit.

442
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,036
So,

443
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:53,460
you got off at the entrance
of the neighborhood.

444
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:55,729
After that, Handsome moved by himself.

445
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:57,364
Yes.

446
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,506
He said he was going to Gumu-dong.

447
00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:02,962
It would've been helpful
if you knew where he was going.

448
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,031
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,107
Should I call the agency now...

450
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,851
What's the rush?

451
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:14,748
There must be a good way for you
and for us too.

452
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:17,351
How many years have you been a manager?

453
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,320
- It's my third year.
- Three years?

454
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:21,374
I've been doing this for 15 years.

455
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:22,756
Oh, gosh.

456
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:25,993
- How much is this house?
- I'm not sure.

457
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:28,655
- Wouldn't this be a crime, though?
- No, of course not.

458
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:30,327
Did he rent out this place?

459
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:34,530
This sofa...

460
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,171
is so spacious and nice.

461
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:40,898
I'm not sure we can do this.

462
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:44,265
It's okay.

463
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:45,879
We're an accomplice now.

464
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:48,882
Is that the study?

465
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:52,152
- When you say that I'm an accomplice...
- Wait, Jeong Cheol.

466
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:54,622
Have a seat here.

467
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:56,791
We said we'd be like brothers.

468
00:27:57,548 --> 00:28:00,360
Handsome is a friend of ours. It's okay.

469
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:02,464
Jeong Cheol.

470
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:05,784
Is there any chance...

471
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:09,103
that he didn't go missing
but was kidnapped?

472
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:10,228
I say this...

473
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,039
because he's so full of himself...

474
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,841
and acts all cocky too.

475
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:17,462
There must be a lot of people
who hate him.

476
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,681
That's not possible.

477
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,274
He's only been with us for a short time.

478
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:25,914
But he's a kind and lonely guy.

479
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:31,725
He's been struggling since his mother
passed away a few years ago.

480
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:35,962
His mother passed away?

481
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:37,430
Yes.

482
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:45,005
Hey, there is no journal, but...

483
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:54,249
This room is nice.

484
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,217
- Look here.
- Yes.

485
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:02,655
Right.

486
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,093
Geez.

487
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,861
It's a private account.

488
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,898
Our agency tried to log in a few times.

489
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:12,267
But they failed.

490
00:29:17,294 --> 00:29:18,313
Hello?

491
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,278
(Five Princes forever,
Handsome, I only have eyes for you.)

492
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,640
It's not his initials either?

493
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,405
Jung Hae Min...

494
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:37,538
(Failed to log in.
Please check your password.)

495
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:40,147
(Failed to log in.
Please check your password.)

496
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:41,287
Geez.

497
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:43,936
(Failed to log in.
Please check your password.)

498
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:47,022
He's made it so complicated.

499
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:50,796
Don't passwords usually consist
of your name and date of birth?

500
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:53,418
- That's true.
- You don't do that for your username.

501
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:55,476
How would that work?

502
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,738
Geez.

503
00:29:57,134 --> 00:30:00,113
(Genius, Handsome, Cutie, Shy, and Tall)

504
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:03,275
Wait.

505
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:15,621
How did you find out?

506
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,316
It was the password for the computer
at our old dorm.

507
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:20,534
You're a genius.

508
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,034
(I want to live as happy as I can.)

509
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:22,903
(I miss people who make me comfortable.)

510
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,003
(I like those who know everything
about me even when I don't tell them.)

511
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:25,050
(Not my house, but the agency's.
Not my dream, but I need it for my dream.)

512
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:25,915
(The human existence, solitude,
and loneliness.)

513
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:28,159
He hasn't given up on being so cringe.

514
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:29,359
(I hate my past and present.)

515
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:30,127
(I'll bury you somewhere deep
and never find it again.)

516
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,956
(It's not that I want to see them.
I miss them.)

517
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:34,915
What's up with all the dots
in the sentences?

518
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:37,674
(Let's hold on to it for as long as I can,
though it may hurt me.)

519
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:38,875
Isn't this our song?

520
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,159
Well, that's strange.

521
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:49,152
Why did he leave us back then
if he misses those days so much?

522
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,480
(I can look back, but I can't go back.)

523
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:54,338
(Let me just cherish it.)

524
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,434
(The smell and the memories
of those days...)

525
00:30:57,905 --> 00:30:59,076
(I can hear the laughter of them,
not knowing the end.)

526
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:00,062
Hold on.

527
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:03,177
I think he posted this
right before he went missing.

528
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:06,713
Hey.

529
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:09,292
Didn't Jeong Cheol say something
about Gumu-dong?

530
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:10,276
He did.

531
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:14,121
So he did go to our old dorm!

532
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:25,264
- Boss?
- Boss?

533
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,765
They're my boys.

534

00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:35,162
- East.
- West.

537
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,294

- North!

of BAKSAL Entertainment)

541
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:45,780
It's the boss' doing, right?

542
00:31:45,944 --> 00:31:47,067
No.

543
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,973
It's me.

544
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:54,194
Boys, have you seen someone
who looks like this?

545
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,220
I've seen him in front of our dorm.

546
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:04,689
I remember too.

547
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,891
He was covering his whole face.

548
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:09,960
So he was going to places in the pictures.

549
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,862
Do you remember what he was doing?

550
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:14,699
He was just standing and staring
at the dorm for quite a long time.

551
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,767
Also, he came with the red car.

552
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,670
I don't know if it was the mask
he was wearing,

553
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,778
but somewhat...

554
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,802
He seemed really...

555
00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:24,809
- sad, right?
- Yes.

556
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:26,489
I think he was crying.

557
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:51,302

560
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,210
How do you like your group's name?

561
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:27,705
It sucks.

562
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,075
I used to be the lead dancer too.

563
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:34,311
Dancing is pretty tough, isn't it?

564
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,015
Not really. It's absolutely fun.

565
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,007
Let's have fun.

566
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:46,306
That always comes first.

567
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:48,115
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

568
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:49,494
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

569
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:50,567
Let's do well.

570
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,163
I can never afford any mistakes.

571
00:33:57,837 --> 00:33:59,235
(The way he delivers
the message is excellent.)

572
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,361
(Also, he's skillful with the beat.)

573
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,345
(You succeed when you genuinely enjoy it!)

574
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,107
Then, I should go for the dance practice.

575
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:28,712
What if I can't enjoy it like you do?

576
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:34,697
I feel like I've reached my limit
and am distressed to death.

577
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:39,343
And still, you can't give up, then, what?

578
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:50,982
I have absolutely no clue about this one.

579
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:52,796
Same here.

580
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:57,334
I have nothing except that this was
taken around August or July of 2008.

581
00:34:58,172 --> 00:34:59,082
What?

582
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:01,471
Look at my hair color.
It's when we released "Landing on Earth."

583

("Landing on Earth"

584
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:03,774
The perm is loose,
and the black roots tell me...

585
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:05,275
that it was either July or August.

586
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,811
Why are you speaking so logically?

587
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:09,880
Either July or August.

588
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,649
He's been pretty keen since earlier.

589
00:35:13,473 --> 00:35:14,841
This is something new.

590
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:18,982
But do you remember
which ocean we went back then?

591
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:22,740
It's not like we had
written it down somewhere.

592
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,601

or the seaweed event.

Where can it be? Ulsan or Samcheok?

604
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:18,949
Samcheok is...

Do you even know the real reason
Handsome left the group?

617
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:50,492
There is no way you guys know.

618
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,797
Why? Because I kept my mouth
closed all this time.

619
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,268
What are you talking about?

620
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,021
Was there actually another reason?

621
00:36:58,606 --> 00:36:59,890
How come you never told me?

622
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,291

is as closed as an oyster.

He said he needed money.

625
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:12,656
I think it's his current agency.
They offered a big sum of money.

626
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,104
So he wanted to go there.

627
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:18,750
But I told him that wasn't possible,
and his dad jumped up and down in rage.

628
00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:21,077
It seemed his family had a money problem.

629
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:26,383
He's been struggling since his mother
passed away a few years ago.

What kind of problem?

I guess a single 50 dollar-bill
is too wobbly to feel the wind.

That's what I heard a decade ago.

So what if it's a decade old
or a half-century old?

643

- Tall.
- Yes?

- Never stop!

- We don't stop
- We don't stop

If you're going to do it like that,
don't do it.

I told you to hit your chest harder
like this.

- That's right.
- You haven't lost your touch yet.

- This pectoral muscle.
- Stop it.

672
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,670
It brings back old memories
to learn the dance moves from him.

673
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,936
Right. Cutie was so good at teaching us.

674
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,070
Better than our own instructor.

with the whole choreography.

00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,224
Right.

who auditions all the time, isn't he?)

(He's on "Final Dancing Star.")

686
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:05,924
(He'll be the first one
on that show to get zero votes.)

687
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,284
(He should get no votes.)

688
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:19,191
Did you all give up for real?

689
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:22,561
I wouldn't say that I gave up.

690
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:25,497
I just changed directions slightly.

691
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,167
What about you, Tall?

692
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,602
You don't sing anymore?

693
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,436
I do.

694
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,533
In my bathtub.

695
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:37,612
Oh, please.

696
00:40:37,698 --> 00:40:40,478
I feel much more at ease and happier
than when I sang on stage.

697
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:42,414
Anyway, you're admirable.

698
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:43,982
I can't believe you're still dancing.

699
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:45,779
Does it still make your heart pound?

700
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,352
Is it like your first love?

701
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:49,688
Does it make you happy
and excited like crazy?

702
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,300
(Giving up is equal to failure.)

703
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,067

Let's get in.

707
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,109
Are you still constipated?

708
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,200
Shut it.

709
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,977
You're only allowed to get back in
after you lose the poop stink.

Guys, look at that red car.

713
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,267
- Isn't that Handsome's car?
- Oh, that...

714
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,433
Hurry up.

715
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,129
It's his car, right?

716
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:46,106
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

717
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
This is his car.

718
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,861
- No, it's not his car.
- Why?

719
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:04,963
It has a different license plate number.

720
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:19,767
(Closed for personal reasons
since July 2, 2022)

721
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,425
Hey, didn't he post anything else
on his social media account?

722
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:27,738
No.

723
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:31,089
So that's all?

724
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,133
The whole country might remember us
as pieces of trash.

725
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,695
What are you talking about?

726
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,198
Where in the world is he?

727
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,134
Let's keep going for now.

728
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,019
Well...

729
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:08,761
Well, there's a beach right by us.

730
00:43:10,342 --> 00:43:12,364
Why don't we enjoy swimming a little?

731
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:17,068
Are you kidding me?

732
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:19,267
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

733
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,100
- Hurry.
- Stop it!

734
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,833
- One.
- Stop!

735
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,233
- Two.
- Don't do it!

736
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,526
Come over here.

737
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,200
- Hey.
- Come here.

738
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:04,108
What are you doing?

739
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,633
Come here.

740
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,100
Hey.

741
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,300
- Let go.
- You're dead meat.

742
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,542
- The two of us are coming for you.
- Here we come.

743
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:14,167
Bring it on.

744
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,831
The two of us are on the way.

745
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:21,699
Come here.

746
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,900
Samcheok is my mom's hometown,
so I came here pretty often.

747
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,470
It's so nice to come out here...

748
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:01,416
after being stuck in the practice room
all the time.

749
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:03,833
(Hello, this is the production crew
of "Final Dancing Star.")

750
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,697
(We're afraid you can't perform
in the real-time main rounds.)

751
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,372
(Thank you for applying
for "Final Dancing Star.")

752
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:10,096
(He failed to pass the audition
for "Final Dancing Star.")

753
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:19,350
He may have left the car here...

754
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,111
and moved to another lodging.

755
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:23,233
So, let's check a few places.

756
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:24,533
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

757
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,186
What are you doing?

758
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:35,507
Let's stop.

759
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:38,194
What are you talking about?

760
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:42,507
Let's stop this here.

761
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:46,767
What are you suddenly talking...

762
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:56,619
Is it so easy for you?

763
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,947
Giving up on everything...

764
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,228
and recalling memories like this.
Is it that easy for you?

765
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:07,400
Not for me.

766
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,845
It's so hard for me.

767
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:17,205
Only if Handsome, that jerk, hadn't left
the group at that time,

768
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:19,010
things would've been much better for us.

769
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:20,467
And I...

770
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:21,642
What about you?

771
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,095
Shy.

772
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:27,318
Do you think it'd have been different
had he stayed with us?

773
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:29,353
What did you say, punk?

774
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:33,800
We worked much harder
after he left the group.

775
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,392
Things didn't work out, nevertheless.

776
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,916
That was just...

777
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:40,431
the end of us.

778
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:45,447
I get that blaming others
is easier than admitting the truth.

779
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:49,767
But does it help protect your pride?

780
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,376
Hey, take him already.

781
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,463
Shy, let's go.

782
00:48:41,096 --> 00:48:43,267
Some things don't work,
no matter how much you try.

783
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,009
When you realize it,

784
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,345
passion turns into pain.

785
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,551
Just like the pop stars
who met their prime...

786
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,912
after the days of anonymity,

787
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:03,283
I also believed...

788
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:06,759
that I would be like them someday.

789
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,074
No, I wanted to believe that.

790
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,564
But I've always known...

791
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:23,457
that not everyone
can achieve their dreams.

792
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,410
I can't blame anyone, not even Handsome.

793
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:01,298
(The Shy is eliminated.)

794
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:04,008
"Show Me the Hip-hop."

795
00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:05,877
You know it, right?

796
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:13,016
I tried ten times,
from the first season to the tenth.

797
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:15,453
But I never passed, not even once.

798
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:19,883
I might've given up by Season Five...

799
00:50:19,907 --> 00:50:21,826
if I hadn't made it
past the preliminary round.

800
00:50:22,043 --> 00:50:24,362
But I always made it halfway
before getting eliminated.

801
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,297
That made it harder to let go, you know?

802
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,070
By the ninth attempt,
I finally understood.

803
00:50:34,222 --> 00:50:35,373
It was clear.

804
00:50:36,257 --> 00:50:38,297
That was where my limit was.

805
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:43,477
It was cruel...

806
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,211
to realize that I was talented...

807
00:50:47,235 --> 00:50:50,438
but not enough to become the star.

808
00:50:52,374 --> 00:50:53,547
But now,

809
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:57,008
I feel a sense of relief.

810
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:01,672
It takes courage to walk away...

811
00:51:01,741 --> 00:51:05,136
after pouring everything
into something, doesn't it?

812
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,578
Dreams shouldn't turn into burdens.

813
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,649
It's too sad when they do.

814
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,999
Is it okay to stop?

815
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:25,248
Yes. It's okay.

816
00:52:04,616 --> 00:52:05,499
Let's go.

817
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,749
That jerk.

818
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:26,944
I think they're over there.

819
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:31,497
What are they doing?

820
00:52:33,107 --> 00:52:34,091
What's going on?

821
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,488
Guys.

822
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:41,858
(Baek Jeong Cheol:
Hae Min, where are you?)

823
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:44,594
(Jung Hae Min:
Please don't try to find me.)

824
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,665
(I'm so worried about you.
Hae Min, please.)

825
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:49,874
You don't think he's about to do
something really stupid, do you?

826
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:53,044
I'm just reading it that way
because he used a lot of dots, right?

827
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:56,332
The press released...

828
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:58,842
that we admitted
to his depression and that he was missing.

829
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:00,490
You haven't found him yet, right?

830
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:02,146
(Uncle)

831
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:03,454
Hold on.

832
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,210
Hey, Uncle.

833
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:09,785
I've just read the news on him,
and it made me feel uneasy.

834
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,648
I'm not sure if it'd help find him.

835
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:14,757
Just hurry up and tell us!

836
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:17,351
It's about his family's problem,
which I mentioned earlier.

837
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,930
His mom has been sick for a long time.

838
00:53:19,954 --> 00:53:22,609
The money for her treatment and surgery...

839
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,534
And his dad was a rogue.

840
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,726
He said he needed money for settlements.

841
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:29,138
He cried so much,

842
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:32,726
saying he was a singer
and didn't want to leave the group.

843
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,937
If I had known
he would pass away like this...

844
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:38,937
- He didn't pass away!
- What are you talking about?

845
00:53:38,937 --> 00:53:40,984
I'm hanging up! Darn it.

846
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:43,954
Hop on first.

847
00:53:49,152 --> 00:53:51,483
Please. Please start!

848
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:56,741
- For goodness' sake!
- It's not working again?

849
00:53:57,592 --> 00:53:59,836
Please start! Please!

850
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,053
Please, Baksal!

851
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:05,609
We got it!

852
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:06,998
Let's go!

853
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:25,970
I want to dance.

854
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,993
All of a sudden? Dance?

855
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:32,212
Why not? It'd make you feel better.
We just got a new group name too.

856
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:37,313
Let's all come back here later.

857
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:41,344
Guys.

858
00:54:41,703 --> 00:54:44,515
As soon as we get to Seoul, let the police
know where Handsome has been so far.

859
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:45,656
Let's go back.

860
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,992
- To where?
- To Seoulro.

861
00:54:49,554 --> 00:54:51,298
- Let's go faster.
- Okay.

862
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:53,525
Resetting the route for the destination.

863
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:09,639
(Seoulro Fishing Area)

864
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,375
- Hey! It's his car.
- This is it.

865
00:55:12,266 --> 00:55:13,510
It is his car.

866
00:55:14,402 --> 00:55:16,805
You two go over there.
You're coming with me.

867
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:18,781
There.

868
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:43,114
Handsome?

869
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:49,446
Cutie?

870
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:53,242
What are you doing here?

871
00:55:57,012 --> 00:55:58,396
I'm on vacation.

872
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,031
Vacation?

873
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:03,534
What did he say?

874
00:56:04,185 --> 00:56:05,503
He's on vacation.

875
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:08,798
- Vacation?
- I see. He's on vacation?

876
00:56:08,822 --> 00:56:10,574
- Yes.
- Okay.

877
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,513
I call dibs on the first punch.

878
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,404
- You crazy...
- Hey, you jerk!

879
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:19,343
- You stupid...
- Hey!

880
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:20,978
- Hold still.
- No!

881
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,579
Punch him!

882
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,255
Geez. It's only been a few days.

883
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:33,423
Did you have to go
on vacation so secretly?

884
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:36,232
Why did you turn off your phone?

885
00:56:36,649 --> 00:56:38,527
You came all the way here...

886
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:41,032
because you couldn't reach me
and got worried?

887
00:56:41,056 --> 00:56:43,800
- Yes.
- No. What are you talking about?

888
00:56:43,824 --> 00:56:45,036
You crazy brat.

889
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,653
But he just said yes.

890
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:47,872
That's enough.

891
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:01,196
I guess I'm being punished
for betraying you guys.

892
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,389
My dad is a con man.

893
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:07,938
He's been convicted 17 times,

894
00:57:08,698 --> 00:57:11,377
always scheming and deceiving others.

895
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,438
Of course, the thought of having
a famous son would drive him berserk.

896
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,674
With his debts...

897
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:18,674
and the money
he's stolen from his victims...

898
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,412
They said I needed
to be held accountable now.

899
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:26,930
It's like a bottomless pit,
no matter how hard I try to fill it.

900
00:57:29,049 --> 00:57:30,313
It's exhausting.

901
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,899
But I used to be so passionate, you know?

902
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:38,288
I miss who I was back then.

903
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:40,993
That's why I came here.

904
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:43,141
I thought...

905
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:46,370
maybe if I did,
I'd find my motivation again.

906
00:57:49,123 --> 00:57:50,341
I'm sorry.

907
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:55,379
I'm sorry for breaking the promise.

908
00:57:58,167 --> 00:57:59,009
Sorry.

909
00:58:00,634 --> 00:58:01,916
Did it get better?

910
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,588
I mean, not being on stage?

911
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,658
Did you manage to get by?

912
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,708
Thank you, everyone.

913
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:28,078
Thanks for finding me.

914
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,574
I feel truly happy.

915
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:35,273
He said it wasn't that bad.

916
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,109
He said even though it wasn't
as much as his love for dancing,

917
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:43,648
he still enjoyed acting
and wanted to get better at it.

918
00:58:46,214 --> 00:58:50,250
If that's the case for him,
maybe I would also be fine.

919
00:58:57,324 --> 00:58:59,417
And so, we found Handsome.

920
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:01,812
And everyone went back
to their daily lives.

921
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:03,073
Enjoy.

922
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:13,200
Handsome chose a different way
of giving up this time.

923
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,059
I earnestly ask you not to be deceived...

924
00:59:15,275 --> 00:59:19,075
by the frauds of my father under my name.

925
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:21,231
That's why I suggested...

926
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:24,426
that we should not mind the eyes
of the public...

927
00:59:24,451 --> 00:59:26,236
and go find Handsome.

928
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:29,356
East, West, South, or North.
I wanted to go wherever we could.

929
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:35,045
East, West, South, or North.

930
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:38,916
That happens to be related to the name
of our new boy group.

931
00:59:40,363 --> 00:59:41,213
Guys.

932
00:59:41,549 --> 00:59:43,099
- East.
- West.

933
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:44,634
- South.
- North.

934
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:46,223
- We're Cardinal Points.
- We're Cardinal Points.

935
00:59:51,507 --> 00:59:52,755
And I...

936
00:59:53,747 --> 00:59:55,552
decided to stop...

937
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:59,536
the longest run of my life.

938
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,731
Let me tell you about our concept,
which is unprecedented.

939
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:05,614
Time for practice.

940
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:06,960
- Sir.
- Sir.

941
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,106
Hey, guys.

(BAKSAL Entertainment)

943
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:26,465
But I'm okay.

944
01:00:27,143 --> 01:00:29,145
It's only when you stop
that you can see the way.

945
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:31,614
And that's when...

946
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:34,221
you can realize happiness again.

947
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:35,372
More powerfully!

948
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:19,076
