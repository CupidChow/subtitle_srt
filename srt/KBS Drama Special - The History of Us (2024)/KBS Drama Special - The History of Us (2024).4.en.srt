00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,590
(Places, organizations, and others
in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,093
You might take all day at this rate.

3
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:20,997
Let me see.

4
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,527
Well, I think the street-view is
a little strange.

5
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:25,529
- Are you looking for this pharmacy?
- Yes.

6
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:30,901
You're dressed differently today.

7
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:32,803
What are you doing?

8
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,166
Work.

9
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,633
I'm making this strange stuff.

10
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:45,449
Oh, you said you worked
at a map-making company.

11
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,249
I didn't mean the street-view earlier.

12
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,054
The road seemed a little strange.

13
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,422
The road didn't do anything wrong.

14
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:56,093
It's not this way. It's that way.

15
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:58,599
- You see the telephone pole over there?
- Yes.

16
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,268
Go around that corner
and walk two more blocks.

17
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:02,388
You'll see it on the left.

18
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:03,898
Are you good now?

19
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:07,407
So it's the other way.

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,377
Thanks.

21
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:36,310
(the road in between)

22
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,219
Mr. Won.

23
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,610
Are you finishing up
with the update in Haesin-dong?

24
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:02,925
Yes.

25
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,405
I'm done with the man-filming work.

26
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,895
I need a few more days
to work on the details and roads.

27
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,511
Okay. That neighborhood has
a lot of veins, doesn't it?

28
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,613
Tiny veins, at that.

29
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:15,005
Small veins are my expertise.

30
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,940
Got it.

31
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,484
Gosh, you startled me.

32
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,209
Others might think you two are doctors.

33
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:21,021
They're alleyways, not veins.

34
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:22,346
I didn't know you were here.

35
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:23,636
What?

36
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,916
Shouldn't you be more attentive
to your teammates?

37
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:35,195
(Corner Pharmacy)

38
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,596
Why don't you do the coloring
comfortably at home, ma'am?

39
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,135
It's not fun to do it at home.

40
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,919
This is my pharmacy.

41
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:48,702
I know.

42
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,076
The places you reached today
said they didn't know, right?

43
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,780
Right, maybe because it's from long ago,
some of their names got changed too.

44
00:03:57,247 --> 00:04:00,183
You could just make calls
instead of visiting them one by one.

45
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,019
Making calls doesn't feel right.

46
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,521
I need to show my dad's picture
and ask them in person.

47
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:08,231
It's going to take forever to visit
all the pharmacies he did business with.

48
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,451
And even if you do visit them,
you won't be able to get anything.

49
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,551
Then, what else should I do?
I've resorted to almost everything.

50
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:19,506
This ledger is the only thing left now.

51
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:24,341
Your dad is so foolish.

52
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:28,121
He retired, and you became a pharmacist
as he always dreamed of.

53
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,525
He could've just enjoyed his later years,
joking around with me.

54
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,608
Why did he have to go out?

55
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,022
Are you checking the street-view again?

56
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:37,692
Yes.

57
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,057
I at least need to do this
to feel at ease.

58
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,392
I feel like I wander around less.

59
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:51,989
(Herb Tonic Tea)

60
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,577
- A month's worth, right?
- Yes.

61
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:03,213
I told you to skip it
once every second day.

62
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:05,716
It's not healthy to drink it every day.

63
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,197
I'll take care of it.

64
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,460
See you.

65
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,024
He's never friendly.

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,538
I feel like he's gotten worse
after what happened.

67
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:20,301
What happened?

68
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,735
That wretched love...

69
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,009
No way.

70
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:34,845
He broke up a long time ago.

71
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,826
And he's still waiting?

72
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,219
Wait inside.

73
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,518
I just happened to come outside.

74
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,522
I wonder if he'll come all the way
by the house...

75
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:21,688
and end up turning around.

76
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:25,826
Wherever you wait,

77
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,768
those who are meant to come will come.

78
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,507
Those who aren't meant to come
will not come.

79
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:36,443
Earlier in the afternoon,

80
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,892
did you go around
looking for your father again?

81
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:45,949
He left a single letter behind
and disappeared.

82
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,909
It said he'd reach us
when the time came...

83
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,288
and so we shouldn't waste our energy
looking for him.

84
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,025
Why did he have to write
"I love you" there?

85
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:59,105
I mean, how could he do this
to his one and only daughter?

86
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:01,558
Did you report him missing?

87
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,203
Yes. I did.

88
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,535
A grownup man disappeared,
even leaving a letter behind.

89
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,726
They said they couldn't do anything.

90
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:17,270
It says his number doesn't exist.

91
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,082
And there's no record
of his credit card use.

92
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,552
He went into hiding this thoroughly.

93
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,556
It keeps bothering me.

94
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,728
Don't try so hard.

95
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:33,972
Excuse me?

96
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,503
I'm home.

97
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:29,786
He should've taken this with him.

98
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:45,814
(Corner Pharmacy)

99
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,237
It's 3 dollars and 90 cents.

100
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:51,518
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

101
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,517
Which neighborhood will you try today?

102
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,329
Dong Su, come here.

103
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:13,975
What?

104
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,037
Doesn't this man look like my dad?

105
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,340
His outfit,
and especially his standing posture.

106
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,416
He does look similar. His build and all.

107
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:24,467
Right?

108
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:26,876
Hold on. When was this uploaded?

109
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:29,779
How do I remove the blurring effect?
Where should I inquire about this?

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,503
Wait.

111
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,556
- That man.
- Wait.

112
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:43,730
Excuse me!

113
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:06,768
Yes, sir.

114
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:08,268
Are you still not done?

115
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:09,401
I'm hungry.

116
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:11,934
You can start without me.

117
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:14,068
When is it done?

118
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,934
I think I can finish it
if you just let me work.

119
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:19,804
I'll see you later.

Someone from Team One was looking for you.

123
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:00,401
Did you meet him?

124
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,401

00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,117
What are you daydreaming about so deeply?

127
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:11,353
Tell me about it.

128
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:12,801
I wasn't daydreaming.

129
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:14,134
I said someone
from Team One was looking for you.

130
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,268
Okay. I'm coming.

131
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,334
The person you have reached
is not available.

132
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,634
Why isn't he picking it up?

133
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:39,868
You're sure you gave me
his number correctly, right?

134
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:49,675
Get back inside.

135
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,201
You can wait for him outside, okay?

136
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:55,968
The street-view!

137
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,201
Can you unblur it?

138
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,401
Calm down and speak precisely.

139
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:01,634
How can he possibly understand you
when you're speaking so hastily?

141

I'm not at liberty to decide on this.

143
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,968
This isn't what our team filmed.

144
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:24,034

00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,041
No.

147
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,304
Excuse me.

148
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,268
You can ask around
at work tomorrow, can't you?

149
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:47,501
It won't be necessary.

Who knows? Someone might help
if you share the whole story.

152

He doesn't want to be found, right?

153
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,301
Just asking isn't a big favor, is it?

154
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,568
I believe he must have his own reason.

155
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:06,568
That's why.

156
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,868
I really need to figure out
what his reason is.

157
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,868
Then do as you wish,

158

As you know,
I'm terrible at finding my way.

You said I should do as I wish.

166

Well, I would visit the place.

170

Then?

171
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,368
I'd investigate, and...

172
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,442
What if it leads nowhere?

173
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:07,234
Wouldn't that make things harder
than they are now?

Every time I hear
about an accident on the news,

176

my heart sinks.

177
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,134
That's not the hardest one.

What tortures me are...

179

all the imagined scenarios of him leaving,

00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,001
Just a few days ago, we lived together,

183
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,368
but now I have no idea why he left.

184
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,459
Just because you live together...

185
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,012
doesn't mean you understand
what's in his mind.

186
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,868
What if I never get
the chance to say goodbye?

187
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,301
What if I never get to face him...

188
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:02,468
with all these wild assumptions
running through my mind?

189
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:05,987
You see.

190
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,634
I can't let him be alone
without understanding why he left.

191
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,634
I need to find him...

192
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:16,234
so I can understand
why he had to go like this.

193
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,768
As long as you let me follow you,

194
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,134
I promise I won't bother you again.

195
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:23,210
Never.

196
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,734
I told you not to worry about me.

197
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,172
Go ahead.

198
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,734
But I have to ask you.

199
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,634
Can I try that ride just once, please?

200
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,625
So, you want to see
the street-view without the blur...

201
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,909
to determine if the person is your father.

202
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,868
And if it is, you want to know
the filming date, right?

203
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,508
That's correct. Please, sir.

204
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,834
But the thing is...

205
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:32,068
It would go
against the privacy policy, and...

206
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:34,268
But her father is missing.

207
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,268
All I need is to see his face.

208
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,368
- It would cause us trouble...
- I know it could cause us trouble,

209
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:44,968
but I still want to help her.

210
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:47,734
She's a friend of Seo Hu too.

211
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,201
He was here.

212
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:15,243
Is he your father?

213
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:18,768
He is.

214
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,001
He's my dad.

215
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:26,468
The filming date is June 28.

216
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:28,934
Is it after he went missing?

217
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:14,696
What's the point in coming here
when she's not here?

218
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,399
(Pharmacy)

219
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,147
You can go there again tomorrow morning
when the sun is up.

220
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:36,953
She's not back yet.

221
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:40,656
You said
it didn't even have a proper sign.

222
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:44,726
Why would you bother looking for him
a bit more?

223
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,697
You're really something.

224
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:51,634
Okay. Be careful.

225
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,013
I thought you were off your work.
Where are you going?

226
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:07,983
Well, I just came out for something.

227
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:13,955
Bye.

228
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,192
What is this...

229
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:38,179
(For Rent)

230
00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:09,411
Hello?

231
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,313
This is Won Seo Hu.

232
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,749
Oh, hi. I didn't expect your call.

233
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,983
Where are you?

234
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:20,688
Oh, well.

235
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,225
Actually, I'm not sure.

236
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:25,399
What do you see around you?

237
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,899
There's a bicycle and a no-parking sign...

238
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,201
Bicycles and no-parking signs can
be found anywhere.

239
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:34,335
Other than such things...

240
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,072
If you look around more carefully,

241
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,809
you'll find a sign
with a street name on it.

242
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,712
Okay. Hold on.

243
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,422
Yes, I found it. It says, "Yunjin-ro 20."

244
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:57,125
Stay there.

245
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:06,234
(Yunjin-ro 20)

246
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,922
Eun Ha.

247
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:36,131
It's so nice to see you here
that I feel like crying.

248
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:42,937
Have you been lost for a long time?

249
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,773
A little bit.

250
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:54,849
Where your father was standing isn't
far from here.

251
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:56,351
Do you think you can go there?

252
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,420
Yes, of course.

253
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:28,383
I wonder what he was looking at from here.

254
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:37,592
(For Rent)

255
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:50,873
The person you have reached
is not available.

256
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,897
You will be directed to a voicemail.

257
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:54,642
He won't answer, right?

258
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:03,351
Have you eaten anything?

259
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,058
I'm hungry.

260
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:19,133
Eat up.

261
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:29,511
I'm totally clueless
about why he was there.

262
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:41,523
Aren't you scared?

263
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,864
The reason you'll find
with so much effort...

264
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:51,633
may be disappointing.

265
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:58,239
Yes, I'm scared. A lot.

266
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:03,211
That's why I'm going here and there
to find him non-stop.

267
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:05,179
Then, I can get rid
of all those bad thoughts.

268
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:21,229
I didn't even try to go around
to look for her.

269
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:23,965
I just couldn't budge an inch.

270
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:33,474
When I was six,

271
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,078
I lost my mom in front of a pharmacy
for good.

272
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:42,950
She gave me a Herb Tonic Tea
and left me behind.

273
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,258
But I kept waiting for her...

274
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,827
at the spot she left me.

275
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,397
That's what you should've done.

276
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:06,241
I lost hold of my dad's hand
in a crowded place in the past.

277
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,092
You know how, when that happens,

278
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,126
you should stay right there
and wait for your parents?

279
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:16,651
I did the same.

280
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:20,221
Both of us were...

281
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,224
only six back then.

282
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:30,598
Right.

283
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,600
I was six.

284
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:35,036
You once told me...

285
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:38,005
not to try so hard.

286
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:43,411
I'm doing this for my sake.

287
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,247
Only then,

288
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:51,486
when I must let something go
despite my will someday,

289
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:59,026
the time I struggled hard
not to let it go...

290
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:01,596
gives me comfort.

291
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,533
And now,

292
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:08,403
I'm no longer a six-year-old kid,

293
00:29:08,404 --> 00:29:10,171
so I'm trying everything I can.

294
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:14,342
You know what?

295
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,845
I like it when I try hard.

296
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:21,582
Especially for the one I love,

297
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:24,017
I want to try even harder.

298
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:02,655
Let's go together tomorrow.

299
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:04,515
Excuse me?

300
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,468
It's a weekend day, so I can make time.

301
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:10,538
It's okay.
You already did a lot for me today.

302
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,255
That real estate office is located
in a remote place.

303
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,808
You've already checked the directions?

304
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:18,680
Forget it if you don't want to.

305
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:22,150
Are you sure about this?

306
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:48,760
Long time no see, Seo Hu.

307
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,013
Oh, right.

308
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,389
I left the ticket recently.

309
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:03,063
Did you see it?

310
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:06,296
I did.

311
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:08,750
You'll come, right?

312
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:14,869
When did you come back to Korea?

313
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:19,140
Around three months ago.

314
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,267
It's my first photo exhibition.

315
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,366
I want you to come.

316
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,579
I'll go inside.

317
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:35,934
I'll go with you.

318
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:37,668
What?

319
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:43,074
I'll reach you.

320
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,940
Let's go, Eun Ha.

321
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:40,367
This place?

322
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,257
Yes. What did it use to be?

323
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:43,254
A hair salon.

324
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,364
If you're looking
for the Bluebird Hair Salon,

325
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,371
it's not far away.

326
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:48,963
They moved to a location down there.

327
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,100
A hair salon.

328
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:00,251
Have you perhaps seen this man before?

329
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,980
I don't think he lives
in this neighborhood.

330
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:08,455
I've never seen him before.

331
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,151
I see.

332
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:16,858
- Anyway, thank you.
- No problem.

333
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:20,501
Goodbye.

334
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:24,651
Wait.

335
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,283
I'm sorry.

336
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,242
We talked on the phone earlier.
It's all right.

337
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,277
Still.

338
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:37,295
Did you not get lost?

339
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:38,695
No.

340
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:41,466
Someone taught me the directions,
so it was easy to find the place.

341
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,159
Why the hair salon?

342
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:50,882
He only ever goes to the barbershop
at the intersection.

343
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,162
Watch your steps.

344
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,014
Okay?

345
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:03,085
Okay.

346
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:14,352
He seems familiar, or maybe not.

347
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,985
Please take a close look.

348
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:18,653
Can you tell me anything about him
that is distinct?

349
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:20,822
He limps a little.

350
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:22,875
He used to do business with pharmacies.

351
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:24,759
If by any chance, in the past...

352
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:33,775
Oh, my.

353
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,538
Are you that man's daughter?

354
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:42,811
It's him.

355
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:47,021
It happened more than 20 years ago.
I know it's him.

356
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:51,920
I taught him how to tie her hair.

357
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,588
How to tie hair?

358
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,329
He said he had a daughter
and found it hard to do her hair.

359
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:58,281
Around the time I closed my shop,

360
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,995
he used to visit me
with some energy drinks.

361
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:04,896
At first, he was so clumsy,
but he practiced really hard.

362
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,419
Later on, he got better than me.

363
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:09,170
Look. You can tell
her hair is done so skillfully.

364
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,441
You're right.

365
00:35:32,651 --> 00:35:33,501
I'm tearing up.

366
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,703
In that childhood picture of yours,

367
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:43,882
you look so cute.

368
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,007
Your father looks great too.

369
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:52,013
Every morning, my dad tied my hair
in a way I asked him to.

370
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:54,716
Carefully like this when we had breakfast.

371
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:02,323
I miss him more, especially today.

372
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:09,263
We'll be able to find him.

373
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,683
Let's keep looking.

374
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:28,516
Hi, Ji Sun.

375
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,860
You're right.

376
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,692
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

377
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:41,162
Bye.

378
00:36:58,355 --> 00:37:01,070
Are you still waiting?

379
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:06,087
Not anymore.

380
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:10,291
If you wait for someone for a long time,

381
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:13,528
you come to think at a certain point...

382
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:19,233
that the other person might be waiting...

383
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,036
for you to stop waiting...

384
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:24,872
and for you to give up.

385
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,650
But your father...

386
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,951
might want you to keep waiting.

387
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:45,359
I hope that's true.

388
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:49,964
Thanks for today.

389
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,424
Go on inside.

390
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:54,877
Bye.

391
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:36,243
In the end, you managed
to hold a photo exhibition.

392
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,216
I'm sorry I'm too late.

393
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,273
Still, I got a ticket for you first
as soon as the tickets were out.

394
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:51,256
Don't do this.

395
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,390
Let's stop seeing each other.

396
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,264
You came to say this, didn't you?

397
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:09,350
Let's end things now.

398
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:13,748
You should've done this sooner.

399
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,451
Then, I would've held back.

400
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:20,598
I would've done less...

401
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,550
of leaving and returning out of the blue.

402
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:30,565
Regardless of when I returned,
you stayed the same without saying much.

403
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,967
So I thought it was okay.

404
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:40,157
How did you possibly expect it was okay?

405
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:41,911
At first,

406
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:46,948
I was just grateful and sorry
that you didn't ask me anything...

407
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:48,812
about what I did and where I was.

408
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,053
But eventually, I became upset.

409
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,823
I wondered if you just weren't curious...

410
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,193
instead of being considerate of me.

411
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:03,376
Isn't it because you don't care
whatever I do?

412
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,443
It's not that I didn't want to know.

413
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,643
I just felt grateful that you came back.

414
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:10,776
And it wasn't because I didn't care.

415
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,074
I just thought
pretending nothing had changed...

416
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,088
would help us get back
to what we used to be.

417
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:24,276
Why didn't you come find me even once?

418
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:33,181
Se Yeon.

419
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:37,443
If I went to you,

420
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:40,643
begging and pleading,

421
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:45,568
and you still left me even after that,

422
00:40:48,776 --> 00:40:50,876
I wouldn't be able to bear it.

423
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:54,443
I thought...

424
00:40:56,743 --> 00:40:57,876
waiting was the only way...

425
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:00,976
to protect myself and stay with you.

426
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,115
But in the end,

427
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:09,610
it turned out like this.

428
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,476
Why did you come today, then?

429
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:21,276
You could have...

430
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:24,210
just ignored it.

431
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:28,476
I wanted...

432
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:31,243
to end it myself.

433
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:36,881
Bye.

434
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,614
Seo Hu.

435
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:03,446
Take care.

436
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,016
Okay.

437
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:09,476
You too.

438
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,757
You don't have to be perfect.

439
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,524
Speak to yourself, Seo Hu.

440
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:43,924
I'll do it, okay?

441
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:44,857
Let me finish this.

442
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:46,990
Just let me do it.

443
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,190
You can't reach this high anyway.

444
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:50,057
Hand it over.

445
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:51,757
- You can't reach here.
- Come on!

446
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,390
Remember to take it before breakfast.

447
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,124
But for the evening medicine,
it might make you drowsy,

448
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:18,824
so take it before bed.

449
00:43:18,824 --> 00:43:19,857
Okay. I will.

450
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,624
I'll write it down in the bag
so you don't forget.

451
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,457
Take care on your way back.

452
00:43:27,057 --> 00:43:28,557
- Thank you.
- Bye.

453
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,757
I know you're always kind.

454
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:35,359
But you're extra kinder today.

455
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,324
What's going on?

456
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,257
There's nothing going on.

457
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,890
Come on.

458
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,124
I can see that you're on cloud nine.

459
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,724
Gosh. I'm hungry.

460
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:49,990
I'm heading out to grab something to eat
for lunch. What do you want?

461
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,757
We've already ordered kongguksu.

462
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:52,690
You did it yourself.

463
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,524
Two portions.

464
00:43:57,157 --> 00:43:58,063
Oh, right.

465
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,157
What's taking them so long?

466
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,790
Take a seat. They'll be here anytime soon.

467
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,124
I'm hungry.

468
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,824
What's that? Are you on a picnic?

469
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:30,959
What is it?

470
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,690
Gosh. It looks delicious.

471
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:41,257
Eun Ha made us this to show her gratitude.

472
00:44:41,257 --> 00:44:42,424
I think she made it early this morning.

473
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:44,664
I knew it.

474
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:47,457
Lunch boxes always contain love.

475
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,324
Can I have some digestive medicine today?

476
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,465
Are you having a heartburn?

477
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:34,957
I guess I ate too much
because it was too delicious.

478
00:45:35,224 --> 00:45:36,124
Thank you.

479
00:45:39,657 --> 00:45:41,190
What's going on between them?

480
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,124
You said you were suffering
from indigestion.

481
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,757
Every time I had indigestion,
my dad used to make me some plum tea.

482
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,490
Are you still feeling sick?

483
00:46:31,149 --> 00:46:32,054
It's okay now.

484
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,857
Everything became all right.

485
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:37,057
Are you sure?

486
00:46:38,157 --> 00:46:39,063
Yes.

487
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,257
You've been overworking
because of me these days, right?

488
00:46:45,257 --> 00:46:47,624
Ever since I met you,
I've been doing a lot of work.

489
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,490
I didn't mean to. Sorry.

490
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,157
I said I was doing a lot of work,

491
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:56,757
but I didn't say that I didn't like it.

492
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,015
These days,

493
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,090
I've been feeling so much lighter,

494
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:11,350
even about finding my dad.

495
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:13,724
It's all thanks to you.

496
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:16,624
I would still be at a loss without you.

497
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:43,228
Hello?

498
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,390
Yes. I'm his daughter.

499
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,457
Yes. Is he all right?

500
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,724
No, don't tell him.

501
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:58,190
I'll be there right now.

502
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,096
Who was it?

503
00:48:01,824 --> 00:48:03,524
Why is my dad at a nursing home?

504
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,057
I need to head there now.

505
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:09,924
It's past nine.

506
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:12,157
No, I have to...

507
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:13,724
They won't be accepting visitors now.

508
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:16,690
Just calm down now.

509
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,394
You can visit him tomorrow.

510
00:48:18,657 --> 00:48:19,590
I'll come with you.

511
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,324
Did you get some sleep last night?

512
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:48,857
A little.

513
00:48:57,824 --> 00:49:00,253
When I get the street-view in this car,

514
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:04,214
people in restaurants stop eating
and run out with a spoon in their hands.

515
00:49:06,752 --> 00:49:07,654
Why?

516
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:11,121
They think I'm a parking attendant.

517
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,367
I'm glad
the nursing home isn't that far from here.

518
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:26,971
I know.

519
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:48,230
Go in.

520
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:50,194
You've waited for this for a long time.

521
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,084
Finally, you get to see her.

522
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:30,260
I called her.

523
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:33,163
You always stopped
in the middle of pressing her number.

524
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:37,333
Why has it been so hard for you
to press the "call" button?

525
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:41,772
Thank you so much.

526
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,309
I have to check other wards.

527
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:54,525
Eun Ha.

528
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,192
What's the problem?

529
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,561
I have no problem. I'm all good.

530
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,230
I am asking...

531
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:09,366
what illness you have.

532
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,171
Parkinsonism...

533
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:18,075
The doctor said it was Parkinsonism.

534
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:22,179
They're taking good care of me,

535
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,248
from exercise and medicine to treatment.

536
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,619
I even made a good friend here.

537
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:31,122
It's soothing and fun to be with them.

538
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:36,660
There's no way you're having fun here
without me.

539
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,097
Hey. Sit down.

540
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,366
Sit down and talk.

541
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,402
You should've told me sooner.

542
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,437
How could you just vanish
into thin air like that?

543
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,405
If I had,

544
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,676
you would've never let me stay here.

545
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:52,976
Of course not.

546
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:55,112
I'd be right here for you, so why...

547
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:01,290
Eun Ha.

548
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:05,055
You were only four back then.

549
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,891
You were so little and adorable.

550
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:11,561
With that little hand of yours,

551
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,198
you put a piece of cotton candy
into my mouth.

552
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,670
How could the world be this harsh?

553
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:22,006
I can't believe she lost
both of her parents at the same time.

554
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:25,475
What should that poor girl do now?

555
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,277
My son is a senior in high school.

556
00:52:28,046 --> 00:52:29,413
I understand her dire situation,

557
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,182
but we can't afford to look after her.

558
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:36,286
Can you give us some time
to think about it?

559
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:38,890
What?

560
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:43,093
Here.

561
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,863
Is this for me?

562
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:52,803
Gosh.

563
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:58,141
I adopted you because I needed you.

564
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,278
I was afraid of the days I'd live alone,

565
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,848
so I brought you to stay by my side.

566
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:08,352
Or I would've lived a miserable life,
grief-stricken.

567
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:13,290
To me,

568
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:17,160
you're still a four-year-old kiddo.

569
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,197
How can I possibly
impose a heavy burden...

570
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,499
on a four-year-old girl as a grownup?

571
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,334
I'm not four years old anymore.

572
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:27,704
I'm also a fully grown adult.

573
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:29,973
It's because I'm your dad.

574
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,612
I couldn't give you such a burden
because I was your dad!

575
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:37,881
Then, you should've convinced me first.

576
00:53:39,184 --> 00:53:40,851
Then, you would've tried to convince me.

577
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,354
I knew you'd try to talk me
into staying with you,

578
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,290
and how could I resist it until the end?

579
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:50,293
Were you going to stay off the grid
for your life, then?

580
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,266
Two months were long enough.

581
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:57,201
How could I do that for my life?

582
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:06,610
My girl.

583
00:54:29,134 --> 00:54:31,101
By the way,
why did you leave your cane behind?

584
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,337
I was leaving you behind.

585
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,575
So, how could I take the cane
that you made for me with me?

586
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:40,717
How glib.

587
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:44,848
- Dad.
- Yes?

588
00:54:49,188 --> 00:54:51,322
You've always tied my hair nicely.

589
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:52,923
Thank you.

590
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,028
Does your father want to stay
in the nursing home?

591
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:33,867
Yes.

592
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:36,835
That's what he wants.

593
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:40,036
More than what I want,

594
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:42,273
I think his will is important
at this point.

595
00:55:44,276 --> 00:55:46,510
Finally, I found a parent
who doesn't give in to his child.

596
00:55:49,515 --> 00:55:52,950
Maybe he thought he shouldn't have
in order to protect you.

597
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:56,954
How can an ill person
protect someone else?

598
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:03,927
Have you told him about the hair salon?

599
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:09,533
He was surprised to learn
that I found out he went to that town.

600
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,903
I didn't mention the bit
about seeing him in the street-view.

601
00:56:14,506 --> 00:56:15,415
Why?

602
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,207
"I know everything."

603
00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:20,044
"Something like this must never
happen again."

604
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:23,680
I was just trying to warn him.

605
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:28,419
I've been worried sick about him.

606
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,556
Still, you must be relieved now.

607
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:33,967
I'm happy for that.

608
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,062
I don't feel helpless, at least.

609
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,399
That's good enough for me.

610
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,502
Not feeling helpless is...

611
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:51,708
a good thing.

612
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:55,913
After all these years,

613
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,082
I feel a lot at ease now.

614
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:10,627
In the past,
I just filmed the street-views...

615
00:57:11,063 --> 00:57:12,629
without much thinking.

616
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:15,698
But now,

617
00:57:17,736 --> 00:57:19,769
I think about the people on the street.

618
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:22,873
I think, "They may get lost for a little,"

619
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:27,778
"but I hope they get to the places
they wanted to go."

620
00:57:31,183 --> 00:57:32,950
Just like you now.

621
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,735
What are you doing there?

622
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:57,874
The chain slipped.

623
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:00,277
I said I'd handle it.

624
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,846
Your hands will get dirty
on your way to work.

625
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,182
It's not a big deal.

626
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:10,086
I think it works now.

627
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:12,823
- Right?
- Yes!

628
00:58:14,126 --> 00:58:15,259
It's working now!

629
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:20,096
You're very skillful!

630
00:58:20,098 --> 00:58:22,198
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

631
00:58:23,301 --> 00:58:25,369
I guess you're good at things with wheels.

632
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,403
What an expert you are.

633
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,039
Don't you need any medicine?

634
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,274
Just name them. They're free of charge.

635
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:32,184
No thanks.

636
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,144
Don't say no.

637
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:36,913
I'll get you some, so wait here.

638
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:38,915
Then...

639
00:58:39,718 --> 00:58:40,618
Yes?

640
00:58:40,686 --> 00:58:42,486
Can I borrow Eun Ha in the afternoon?

641
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:44,354
What?

642
00:58:49,227 --> 00:58:50,861
I guess my joke wasn't that funny.

643
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,610
It was.

644
00:58:56,668 --> 00:58:58,535
Although she's not mine,
you can borrow her.

645
00:58:58,970 --> 00:58:59,870
You can take her too.

646
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:01,491
What?

647
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,988
It's too hot.

648
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:46,467
I'm in the mood for some cold iced beer,

649
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:50,871
but I have no girlfriend or someone
to drink it with.

650
00:59:54,274 --> 00:59:56,260
- Tomorrow.
- What about it?

651
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:58,746
You mean the beer?

652
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,459
Why? Does tomorrow not work for you?

653
01:00:02,459 --> 01:00:03,821
It does. Totally.

654
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:06,557
- I can make it too.
- You startled me.

655
01:00:06,693 --> 01:00:08,072
Why do you keep popping up like that?

656
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:12,126
What's all this?

657
01:00:15,429 --> 01:00:16,563
Is this...

658
01:00:19,566 --> 01:00:20,468
I...

659
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:22,202
need to take a ride in these.

660
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:24,671
- Do you have more to shoot?
- I'm taking two.

661
01:00:24,924 --> 01:00:26,173
Why would you need two?

662
01:00:26,173 --> 01:00:27,708
Help me load them, and I'll tell you.

663
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,961
How could I... Fine, I'll help.
What is this for?

664
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:39,425
Seo Hu.

665
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:47,581
Why did you bring them?

666
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:50,164
You said you wanted a ride.

667
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,712
You remembered that?

668
01:00:55,536 --> 01:00:56,444
Of course.

669
01:00:57,503 --> 01:01:00,751
For some reason,
everything you say sticks with me.

670
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,616
Is your father doing okay?

671
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,352
Oh, well,

672
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,886
he said he made a good friend there,
so I assumed it was a man.

673
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:18,358
But it turns out it's a woman.

674
01:01:19,193 --> 01:01:20,561
It's the caretaker from last time.

675
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:26,533
- So, are you jealous?
- No.

676
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:28,859
I should work harder too.

677
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,656
How about we start it too?

678
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,882
What do you mean?

679
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,551
We should get on these.

680
01:01:52,396 --> 01:01:54,027
Are we going that way?

681
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:56,165
Here.

682
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:07,708
I made half of it myself.

683
01:02:08,442 --> 01:02:10,447
As for the other half,

684
01:02:11,365 --> 01:02:14,748
I can ride it around with you,

685
01:02:16,674 --> 01:02:17,575
and it's done.

686
01:02:19,463 --> 01:02:20,554
Will you go with me?

687
01:02:23,654 --> 01:02:25,759
I'm used to this street now.

688
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:28,929
It'll be my first time,
but I'll give it a go.

689
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,050
Are you ready?

690
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:48,786
Sure.

691
01:02:52,864 --> 01:02:53,987
This is fun.

692
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:56,357
You're pretty good.

693
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,358
I'm a fast learner, you see.

694
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:00,657
Why don't you lead the way, then?

695
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:02,663
What if I take the wrong turn?

696
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:03,697
That's okay.

697
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:07,017
As long as it's with you,
I think I'll be fine.

698
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:09,036
You mean that, right?

699
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,308
Are you behind me?

700
01:03:14,631 --> 01:03:16,410
I'm following right behind you.

701
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,613
Why don't we race and see
who gets to the corner first?

702
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:21,315
Just go with me.

703
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:09,853
