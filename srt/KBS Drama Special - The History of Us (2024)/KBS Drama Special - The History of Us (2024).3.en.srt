1
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:05,394
(A production supported by...)

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,197
(the Ministry of Culture,
Sports and Tourism...)

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:06,902
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

4
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:08,786
(This drama is a work of fiction,)

5
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:11,159
(and the characters, places, groups,
and events are entirely imaginary.)

6
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:17,866
(A year before the Korean War,
near the 38 Parallel)

7
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,482
Just look at that.

8
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:28,791
Young Bok has such nimble fingers.

9
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:32,289
She has already finished all the work,

10
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,660
while someone I know is still trying
to thread her needle.

11
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:42,332
Young Bok, you must be having
the time of your life these days.

12
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:45,535
Both your in-laws passed away,

13
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,271
and who knows
if your husband is dead or alive.

14
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:51,675
It looks like the whole property
is going to be yours now, doesn't it?

15
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,756
Stop.

16
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,247
Are you envious?

17
00:01:58,698 --> 00:01:59,547
Excuse me?

18
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:00,784
You must be.

19
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:06,221
I ended up having
one of the nicest houses around.

20
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,558
No, I meant...

21
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:15,737
What the... I...

22
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:17,846
That wench!

23
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,409
Hey, leave her alone!

24
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,393
Why are you always on her case?

25
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,074
She's so full of herself!

26
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,081
She always looks so grumpy
and never wears a smile.

27
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,151
She must think of me so little
when I'm older than her!

28
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,940
What does she have in her life
to smile about?

29
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,580
Don't you feel sorry
for that poor young thing?

30
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,026
Her only brother was being dragged
into forced labor,

31
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,143
and she was almost taken
as a comfort woman.

32
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,150
Can you imagine how desperate
her parents must have been...

33
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:49,908
to marry her off all the way to Cheongju?

34
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,647
Worse, her husband has gone missing
shortly after he left...

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,940
for Japan to study.

36
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:58,798
And as soon as the liberation came,

37
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:00,852
both her parents and in-laws passed away.

38
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:03,460
She had to endure one funeral
after another.

39
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:06,346
Now, she's left alone
in this whole world, just like that.

40
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:13,681
She must be so lonely,

41
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,845
waiting for her husband to return,

42
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:19,237
even though she hasn’t seen him
in her life.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,471
He probably doesn't even know
he has a wife.

44
00:05:04,157 --> 00:05:06,636
Seo Rim, is this our house?

45
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:38,101
(The Two Women)

46
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,820
Mother said a married couple
should stay in the same room.

47
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,648
I knew it was yours,
but I've been staying here.

48
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,930
Because you're my husband...

49
00:05:56,257 --> 00:06:00,001
I haven't touched any of your things,

50
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,469
so don't worry.

51
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,664
How old are you?

52
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:10,868
Next year, I'll turn 20.

53
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,838
You got married to me
five years ago, right?

54
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:18,961
Does it mean you were 14 back then?

55
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:22,422
Do you know how old I am?

56
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:25,000
How could you agree to marry a guy...

57
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:28,034
who's eight years older
and has completely disappeared?

58
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:32,656
I'm sorry,
but I can't take you as my wife.

59
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,959
I'll find a way to annul our marriage,

60
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,395
so please be ready to leave...

61
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,862
Shame on you.

62
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:43,993
What have you been doing
while your house was falling apart...

63
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,461
and your parents passed away?

64
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,275
You must've been with her,
having a good time.

65
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,680
- Young miss.
- Don't call me that. I'm your wife!

66
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:54,444
I'm the madam of this house,
registered on paper!

67
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,209
It was me who took care of your parents...

68
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,414
when they couldn't even go
to the restroom.

69
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,322
It was also me who cleaned
and maintained this house...

70
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,685
so it wouldn't fall apart!

71
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:04,587
And now you're asking me to leave?

72
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:08,758
Who gives you the right
to tell me to leave...

73
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:12,028
when I've touched every corner
of this house?

74
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,344
I won't leave.

75
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,312
I can't!

76
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,015
I have no place to go back to.

77
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:33,581
And I would resent myself...

78
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,885
if I left after everything
I've done for this house.

79
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,800
What did she mean?

80
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,307
Is that girl really your wife?

81
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,368
Then, what about me?

82
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,279
What about our baby?

83
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,683
Say something!

84
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,956
That stupid jerk!

85
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,562
How dare he abandon his wife
and take in a concubine?

86
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:58,893
Why are you suddenly siding
with Young Bok?

87
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,222
I can bear anything,

88
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,454
but I can't stand those
who do reckless things...

89
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:04,379
and girls who live as concubines.

90
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,921
Look at that thing on her hair
when she's here to work.

91
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,300
How flashy it is.

92
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:14,996
That naive girl...

93
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,103
will never be able to outdo that vixen.

94
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,376
What's this?

95
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,287
Please take it off! Help me!

96
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,759
Speak in Korean.

97
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,621
You know how to speak in Korean,
don't you?

98
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:42,929
What are you doing?

99
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:47,567
I will.

100
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,569
I'm speaking in it.

101
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:54,641
I'm speaking in Korean now.

102
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:14,327
Call her naive one more time,

103
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,196
and they'll be holding a funeral.

104
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,454
(Jerks who forget their history
have no future.)

105
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,340
I told you. It's not going to happen.

106
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,538
Sir, you know my circumstances.

107
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,283
Can I use this to make it this time?

108
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:40,620
If I...

109
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:43,323
pay you for your work,

110
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,021
where will that money go?

111
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,927
That nasty girl will get to use it.

112
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:52,532
Young Bok.

113
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,435
You, of all people,

114
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,204
can't do this to me.

115
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:07,280
Darn it. Some luck I have today.

116
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,511
That's mine.

117
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,250
That...

118
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,187
is mine.

119
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:48,588
You should at least pay
for lodging at my house.

120
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,692
When you give birth to the baby,
go back to Japan with it.

121
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,500
If it's about leaving,
you should be the one to go.

122
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,436
That's what Seo Rim told you too.

123
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:15,448
You Japanese.

124
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:19,287
Damned Japanese girl. Barbarian.

125
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,354
Young Bok!

126
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:23,957
Do you know why spoons sold so well
in every town after the liberation?

127
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,360
It's because your people took
even the spoons for the war.

128
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:30,521
Do you know why the man
at the dry goods store got all angry?

129
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:31,764
It's because your people...

130
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:33,933
took his daughter,
saying it was for the war!

131
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,669
Your people...

132
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,806
took away our rice,

133
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,009
our spoons,

134
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,781
and even my own brother.

135
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,852
And now, you want to take my husband too?

136
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:56,256
It wasn't me who did it.

137
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:58,954
I have nothing to do with it.

138
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:00,154
Of course, you do!

139
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:01,928
You're also a Japanese!

140
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,438
It was the same for us too.

141
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,477
We all had nothing to do with the war.

142
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,041
A gunshot?

143
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:54,180
It must've been soldiers training.

144
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:57,050
A few years ago, an army unit
entered the village.

145
00:14:57,754 --> 00:15:00,820
Do you know how startled I was?

146
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,354
Aren't you really going to tell me
why you fought?

147
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:11,154
We didn't fight.
She insulted me one-sidedly.

148
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:12,832
What are you doing right now?

149
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,441
Why are you touching my clothes
without my permission?

150
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,009
You...

151
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,412
You should have your meal.

152
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,340
Stop complaining.

153
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:39,219
This is my favorite food.

154
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,658
If you don't want to eat it, don't.

155
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:47,527
She's always complaining.

156
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:40,880
There's a chill in the air tonight.

157
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:44,584
Stop being so stubborn,
and go to bed inside.

158
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:47,654
Young Bok.

159
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,212
Look.

160
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,448
You should sleep inside.

161
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,283
You can't keep sleeping out here.

162
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:21,154
If I go inside,

163
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:24,957
are you going to stay with that woman?

164
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:28,661
Do you think I'm that shameless?

165
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:29,829
Yes.

166
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:33,221
I'm not going in.

167
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,467
I'll stay here.

168
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,303
Go in and get some sleep.

169
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:39,639
I won't.

170
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,374
Get inside to get sleep.

171
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,676
I'm telling you. I won't.

172
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:45,115
I'm not going in!

173
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,621
I heard about an army unit
that came to the village.

174
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:29,555
Have you had training with them
or something?

175
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:31,757
You're so agile.

176
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:36,662
I'm just kidding.

177
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:38,331
Try to put on a smile.

178
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:42,735
I can't smile
when it doesn't come naturally to me.

179
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:48,241
It's true what the elders in the village
told me about you.

180
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,711
They said that you rarely smiled.

181
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:55,414
You took care of my sick parents...

182
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:57,183
and had to protect this house.

183
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:00,052
I'm sure you had no time to smile.

184
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,077
I'm sorry, Young Bok.

185
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,531
Also, thank you.

186
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:24,890
I should have said it sooner.

187
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,460
I'm sorry for saying it so late.

188
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:45,992
From now on,

189
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:48,062
we'll do everything together.

190
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,406
I want to share the chores...

191
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:53,265
and eat meals with you at the same table.

192
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,752
How could I possibly do that with you?

193
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,312
Didn't you say you were my wife?

194
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:00,562
A husband and wife should
always do everything together.

195
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,663
Please go inside and sleep.

196
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:10,984
I'll be sleeping here from now on.

197
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,874
Are you saying your face heats up
like fire,

198
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:04,390
and your heart pounds
like a kid throwing a tantrum?

199
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:09,249
Well, there's only one explanation
for that.

200
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,593
It's called love.

201
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:14,055
You're in love.

202
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:18,224
Of course, you're in love.
Otherwise, your face wouldn't get all hot,

203
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:23,218
and your heart wouldn't ache
as if you were being hit by bullets.

204
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,851
You're so book-smart.

205
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm amazed you had no idea what love was
after acting like you knew everything.

206
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:37,780
Is this love?

207
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,156
The laundry!

208
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,868
Why don't you both try learning
how to read and write Korean?

209
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,015
- No.
- No.

210
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:12,890
It's rare for you
to share the same opinion.

211
00:24:13,142 --> 00:24:16,277
I have a ton of work to do.
I don't have any time to study.

212
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:18,346
I don't need to study
how to read or write.

213
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:22,316
Looking at Young Bok, it seems you can get
by in life just by being sturdy.

214
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,460
Hey!

215
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,186
You really have a death wish, don't you?

216
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:26,656
Watch your words.

217
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:31,225
They say, one ill word asks another.

218
00:24:31,493 --> 00:24:32,992
Do you really want to start something?

219
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:35,726
Wait. Please stop.

220
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,827
Learning to read and write is
always beneficial.

221
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:45,305
You will be able to write letters
or even read books.

222
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:47,906
- And...
- But you can just...

223
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,749
read them for me, Seo Rim.

224
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,195
Because you'll always be by my side,
won't you?

225
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:04,257
What should I do first?

226
00:25:05,813 --> 00:25:08,679
You can just leave us alone
if you're not interested, Young Bok.

227
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,515
(Gu Young Bok)

228
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,156
(Nam Haeng Ja)

229
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:48,268
"Sachiko?"

230
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:51,812
Is this how you write Sachiko?

231
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,226
Can't you even read this?

232
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,445
It says, "Nam Haeng Ja."

233
00:25:57,546 --> 00:26:00,948
When I convert my name, Minami Sachiko,
into Korean,

234
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:02,663
it's pronounced Nam Haeng Ja.

235
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,227
Seo Rim, if I combine my name
and Young Bok's,

236
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:15,351
I can make Haeng Bok, right?

237
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:18,437
Haeng from my name.

238
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,531
And Bok from Young Bok's.

239
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,137
"Happiness."

240
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,284
You're coughing so much.

241
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,503
Please drink some water first.

242
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:24,292
It's okay, Seo Rim.

243
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:31,574
It's okay.

244
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:35,363
Everything is all right.

245
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:48,308
Just stop.

246
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:50,909
Blood stains are hard to remove.

247
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,861
I know because I've tried it many times.

248
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:56,097
You just don't know how to do it properly
because you're too dumb.

249
00:27:56,698 --> 00:27:58,769
I can make it clean.

250
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,206
I can clean all the stains.

251
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:03,745
I can fix anything that's worn out.

252
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:07,589
And I can also make him healthier again
as if he's never been ill.

253
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:17,730
I was also hopeful that I could
fully recover until six years ago.

254
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,723
When I was in Tokyo,

255
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,894
I was thrown into prison
just for being part of a book club...

256
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:29,030
that studied the Korean language.

257
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:34,502
And that is
where I contracted tuberculosis.

258
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,962
I was released
after independence was restored.

259
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:42,806
Eventually,

260
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:46,736
I returned to my country,

261
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,033
but now I'm on death's doorstep.

262
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,275
Both as a son and as a man,

263
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:56,509
my life has...

264
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,822
been a failure.

265
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:43,009
Don't you dare touch it
with those filthy hands.

266
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:48,241
Seo Rim's illness is
all because of you people.

267
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,477
Whether it's Japanese or concubines,

268
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,846
I'm just fed up with you damned people!

269
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:56,216
I'm not damned nor a concubine!

270
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:57,886
You are the concubine!

271
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:01,372
I told you not to speak Japanese
in front of me!

272
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:06,220
What have you ever done for Seo Rim?

273
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:09,209
You may have taken care of his parents,

274
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:11,346
but I looked after Seo Rim.

275
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,857
You left your hometown to get married,

276
00:30:13,882 --> 00:30:16,217
but I had to leave my country
to get married.

277
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:18,253
And would you still call me a concubine?

278
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:23,658
I understand...

279
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:26,327
how you feel right now.

280
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,132
I used to feel angry and sad
all the time, just like you.

281
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:34,235
And that made me want to act mean.

282
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,707
But in the end, you and I stayed here,
just the same.

283
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,477
Because we wanted to stay with him.

284
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:45,013
Because we didn't want to feel lonely.

285
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,474
So why do you try to be alone...

286
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,586
when you need someone the most?

287
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:39,548
(Im Seo Rim)

288
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:55,964
(Gu Young Bok, Im Haeng Ja, Im Seo Rim)

289
00:31:56,067 --> 00:32:01,860
(Happiness)

290
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:17,538
Young Bok.

291
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:19,474
Are you home?

292
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:29,555
The village headman was going
to sell this to the junk shop,

293
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,985
so I got it at a cheap price.

294
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:37,775
What do you think? It'll do, right?

295
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,572
You can ride this instead of walking.
It's tiresome.

296
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:48,436
I don't know how to ride it.

297
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:51,406
You can learn it. I'll teach you.

298
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,305
Do you want to give it a try?

299
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,330
I need to go to Gyeong Ja's place
to give a hand.

300
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,322
But I'll learn it some other time.

301
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,197
You can teach me then.

302
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:17,854
Sure.

303
00:34:09,752 --> 00:34:11,352
Nam Haeng Ja!

304
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:15,682
Haeng Ja!

305
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:18,102
Where on earth did she go?

306
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:19,093
Haeng Ja...

307
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:26,767
Nam Haeng Ja.

308
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:47,730
I was going to wash the laundry,
but I slipped.

309
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,597
I didn't get hurt other than my ankle.

310
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:53,691
What about the baby?

311
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,436
Maybe it's feeling stuffed inside here.

312
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,205
It keeps kicking.

313
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:11,317
I didn't know you could smile like that.

314
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,473
No one asked you to do this anyway.

315
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,199
People will badmouth me
once things go sour for you and your baby.

316
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,372
They'll think the wife has harassed
the concubine so much...

317
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:37,939
Are you mad?

318
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:41,836
That's the only pair of shoes I have!

319
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:43,744
Oh, dear.

320
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,379
What should I do?

321
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,716
I can't believe this.

322
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:50,885
My gosh.

323
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,446
Young Bok, seriously?

324
00:35:58,471 --> 00:35:59,540
- Move.
- My shoes...

325
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:26,487
Give me your foot.

326
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:51,918
I'm sorry that I threw your ring away.

327
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,707
Also, I'm sorry
that I slapped you earlier.

328
00:36:57,943 --> 00:36:59,520
I don't feel sorry for anything.

329
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,325
Would you rather walk home alone?

330
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,832
Can I ask you something?

331
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:11,499
No, you can't.

332
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,543
What is that ring?

333
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:19,640
You always stare at it.

334
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,547
It's my treasure.

335
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,043
My mom gave me
when I left Cheongju to get married.

336
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,517
Your treasure?

337
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,655
Is it an expensive one?

338
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:44,152
No, but memories that I treasure
come to me when I look at it.

339
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:46,901
Memories like when my brother and I...

340
00:37:47,124 --> 00:37:50,543
went to the riverside
to catch marsh snails...

341
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:54,988
and my mom cooking soup
with the snails we caught.

342
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,446
And memories of eating rice cakes
with bean crumbs with my dad every spring.

343
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:06,053
Well, that ring is
just the opposite of me.

344
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,923
When people here see me,

345
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,393
bad memories come to them.

346
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:17,431
Not just bad ones, but painful ones.

347
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,777
Young Bok.

348
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,762
Do you think...

349
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:29,176
we could be friends about 50 years later?

350
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:36,384
I don't know.

351
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,676
By the way, how are you so fluent
in our language?

352
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:46,449
Did you learn it from Seo Rim?

353
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:53,901
Joseon people visited a lot
when I lived at the catholic church.

354
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,637
They taught me the language.

355
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:01,621
I don't know who my parents are.

356
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:05,074
The orphanage run by the catholic church
was where I grew up.

357
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:09,195
You could've told me that earlier.

358
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,551
You made me look like
I was bragging about having a family.

359
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:13,888
What do you mean?

360
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,637
You're an orphan, just like me.

361
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:20,355
Haven't you heard about the saying,
"Misery loves company?"

362
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:24,965
Geez, you do have a way with words.

363
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:30,604
But Young Bok,

364
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:34,275
why do you call me Haeng Ja?

365
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,535
Why not?

366
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:39,262
Are you bothered
that I don't call you Sachiko?

367
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:42,941
Of course, you should use a Korean name
if you're going to live here.

368
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,909
That's not what I mean.

369
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:48,262
I'm six years older than you.

370
00:39:55,204 --> 00:39:56,397
Little one.

371
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,934
Call me big sister.

372
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:04,041
Don't mess with me.
I'll leave you here all by yourself.

373
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:05,737
Oh, is that right, little one?

374
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,959
You're on your own.

375
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,951
Hey, Young Bok!

376
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:14,139
My leg hurts!

377
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,691
Wait for me!

378
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,912
Young Bok!

379
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:23,623
Here. It's barley tea.

380
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:28,209
I heard that you people drink tea
with your meals.

381
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,060
Is it really for me?

382
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,379
We've got a pair of rubber shoes.

383
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,381
Suit yourself. Try them on or don't.

384
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:55,891
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

385
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,125
I'm going to take care of you
until you've recovered from the delivery.

386
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:14,404
Fortunately,
we still had some seaweed left.

387
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,081
So, when's her due date?

388
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,006
Less than a month now.

389
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:19,766
Goodness.

390
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:20,900
Stop being so happy about it...

391
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,067
and think about how you're going
to get seaweed soup for yourself.

392
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,778
Isn't there any news?

393
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:31,366
Well...

394
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,692
I'm here to get some books.

395
00:42:18,123 --> 00:42:19,129
Tonight!

396
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,145
Can you sleep here tonight?

397
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:28,041
To avoid the draft,

398
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:31,137
I've let you stay in Haeng Ja's room
for the past few months.

399
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:34,653
But people will start talking
if we keep this up.

400
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:38,008
Don't worry.

401
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,566
Even though this is a small neighborhood,

402
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:40,816
there's no way they'd ever find out...

403
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:57,786
You told me to sleep here tonight, but...

404
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,575
When are you going to learn
how to ride a bike?

405
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:16,145
Are you still very busy?

406
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:19,900
We don't know
when Haeng Ja will go into labor.

407
00:43:19,925 --> 00:43:21,817
How can I leave her alone?

408
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,800
Once the baby is born,

409
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,833
I'll need to take care of them too.

410
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,801
And when spring comes, I'll have
to get back to work in the fields.

411
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,708
There's so much to do.

412
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:37,989
I always thought...

413
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:42,012
I was so unlucky.

414
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,200
But I'm glad I got to know you, Young Bok.

415
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:01,629
I hope I haven't left you...

416
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,590
with only painful memories.

417
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:21,981
When the baby is born,

418
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:24,950
you should learn how to ride a bike.

419
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,817
I'll take care of everything else.

420
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:59,598
My belly hurts!

421
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:01,934
I think the baby will be here soon.

422
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,766
I'll get the ladies here now.

423
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,644
So you should stay with Haeng Ja.

424
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,969
(The name candidates for the baby)

425
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:45,774
(Boy: Gyeong Ho, Gyu Chang, Dong Heon,
Yun Seob, Hyeong Sik, Seok Gyun, Dae Geon)

426
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:47,053
(Girl: Seon Hye, Yun Jin, So Jeong,
Ae Ran, Mi Yeong, Jeong Seon,)

427
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:47,844
(Ju Mi, Myeong In)

428
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:01,937
Young Bok?

429
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:03,333
Young Bok!

430
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,070
Young Bok! No!

431
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,833
Young Bok...

432
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,100
No!

433
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:28,030
We need to live together.

434
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:32,421
Please. Let's live together.

435
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,820
Don't give up on me.

436
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:44,002
I always thought...

437
00:47:45,225 --> 00:47:47,739
I was so unlucky.

438
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:52,363
But I'm glad I got to know you, Young Bok.

439
00:47:53,386 --> 00:47:55,070
I hope I haven't left you...

440
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:59,331
with only painful memories.

441
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,054
Haeng Ja...

442
00:49:34,168 --> 00:49:36,770
Hey. You're sure you're good
at riding a bike, right?

443
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,372
Don't you worry.

444
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:42,333
I even went on deliveries back in Japan.

445
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:46,162
I got fired after bumping
into a wall, though.

446
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:48,381
What? What did you just say?

447
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:49,714
That was the important part, right?

448
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:53,482
Hey! What did you say just now?

449
00:49:56,005 --> 00:49:58,036
You can't let go of me like this!

450
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,091
Look to the front, Young Bok.

451
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:01,459
Keep your eyes on the front.

452
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:13,536
Riding bikes is not my thing.

453
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:16,349
Just let me get on behind you
when you ride it.

454
00:50:17,343 --> 00:50:19,466
Did it hurt a lot when you fell down?

455
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,667
So, don't you die.

456
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:37,933
I'm sick and tired...

457
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:40,839
of goodbyes.

458
00:50:48,641 --> 00:50:49,964
The same goes for you too.

459
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:52,191
Never let go of my hand.

460
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,659
Now, in this world,

461
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:57,886
there are only this baby, you, and me.

462
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,339
You know it's just the three of us, right?

463
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:04,808
If you run away, that makes you a wench.

464
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:18,011
When are you going to name the baby?

465
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:20,906
You can't keep calling her without a name.

466
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:24,376
You have to get a name
for the baby soon...

467
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:26,526
so that she will settle down here.

468
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:29,664
I hope my baby's name...

469
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,656
will be just like your ring.

470
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:37,312
A name that makes you remember
only the good memories.

471
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,543
These days,

472
00:52:23,402 --> 00:52:26,300
both our side
and those over the 38th parallel...

473
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,774
seem to have gotten really quiet,
don't you think?

474
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:36,691
That's not likely.

475
00:53:06,547 --> 00:53:07,921
Haeng Ja.

476
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:13,311
Young Bok.

477
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:16,389
That sound is also coming
from the training, right?

478
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:29,928
Haeng Ja.

479
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:32,704
Haeng Ja.

480
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:35,483
I think the war has begun.

481
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:36,641
What?

482
00:53:46,316 --> 00:53:48,320
Here. It's this way.

483
00:53:48,787 --> 00:53:50,789
- Come this way.
- Hurry up.

484
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:01,600
What's going on?

485
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:05,803
It looks like the North came over
the 38th parallel, right?

486
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,139
Then, we can't be here like this.

487
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,441
Shouldn't we flee to the south?

488
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:13,553
We can't do that when our homes are here.

489
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:16,936
For now, let's see how things go. Okay?

490
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,434
I thought I lost it.

491
00:54:38,137 --> 00:54:40,673
I stole it because you were so cheeky.

492
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:58,521
We'll be okay.

493
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:01,889
No matter what happens in this world,

494
00:55:04,497 --> 00:55:08,092
you and I are both fated
to get through it bravely.

495
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:11,637
You've crossed the sea, and I've been
through Japanese imperialism,

496
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:13,205
so what's there to be scared about?

497
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,561
We're not alone now either.

498
00:55:18,177 --> 00:55:19,678
Isn't that right, baby?

499
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:45,608
Here, baby. This is for you.

500
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:48,707
Young Bok.

501
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:52,311
Hey, you.

502
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:55,296
When will you get a name?

503
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,991
Ask your mom to give you a name soon.

504
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:05,623
A puppet army might be hiding.
Check it now.

505
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:17,405
There are only civilians here.

506
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,504
- Spare us.
- Please spare us.

507
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:20,538
Let's go.

508
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:24,264
Baby. No, don't cry.

509
00:56:24,977 --> 00:56:27,030
Don't cry, baby.

510
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:29,547
Stop crying.

511
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:34,100
You're a Japanese girl.

512
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,357
We were liberated.
Why are you still speaking in Japanese?

513
00:56:39,825 --> 00:56:40,959
Haeng Ja!

514
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,294
- Come with me!
- No!

515
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:45,630
- Haeng Ja! No!
- Please!

516
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:47,032
- Stay still!
- No!

517
00:56:50,194 --> 00:56:51,236
Come!

518
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:54,182
Haeng Ja!

519
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:55,974
Haeng Ja! No!

520
00:57:14,346 --> 00:57:15,365
Oh, no.

521
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:25,304
What do we do?

522
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:26,279
They're in big trouble.

523
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:28,473
- What should we do?
- Come on.

524
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:30,608
Hurry! Go!

525
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,246
You should go ahead with the baby.

526
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:33,003
I'll lose him and join you soon.

527
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:34,683
What are you talking about?

528
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,465
No, it's too dangerous.

529
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:41,579
If not, all three of us will die.

530
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:44,894
Are you going to let your baby die
like this?

531
00:58:49,155 --> 00:58:52,023
You remember the tree we saw...

532
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,824
as we were running away, right?

533
00:58:54,693 --> 00:58:57,795
There were many red and yellow strings
on that tree.

534
00:58:58,797 --> 00:59:00,985
Let's meet in front of that tree later.

535
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:03,528
If...

536
00:59:05,964 --> 00:59:09,083
I'm not there until sundown,

537
00:59:10,735 --> 00:59:12,739
leave for Japan with the baby.

538
00:59:12,807 --> 00:59:14,372
It's too dangerous to stay here
by yourself.

539
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:15,440
I won't go.

540
00:59:15,773 --> 00:59:16,808
I can't go.

541
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:19,777
We promised to stay together
until the end.

542
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,892
I don't know how much it'll cost
to get on the ship,

543
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:31,789
but this ring should be of some help.

544
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,094
Please don't go.

545
00:59:37,321 --> 00:59:40,041
Let's just stay together.

546
00:59:45,026 --> 00:59:46,794
This must be why...

547
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:50,083
my mom gave me this.

548
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:06,276
You saved my life
by hugging me tightly like this.

549
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:08,293
I'm returning the favor now.

550
01:00:08,924 --> 01:00:09,856
I can't go.

551
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:21,958
Goodbye, baby.

552
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:25,888
Get a good name from your mom,
and have a good life.

553
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:35,054
- No.
- Goodbye, Haeng Ja.

554
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:38,921
Haeng Ja, my big sister.

555
01:02:11,987 --> 01:02:13,024
Haeng Ja.

556
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:16,539
You asked me before...

557
01:02:17,054 --> 01:02:20,235
if we could be friends.

558
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,028
Yes.

559
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,630
Let's be friends.

560
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,702
Next time, let's meet as friends...

561
01:02:32,433 --> 01:02:34,849
and go to Cheongju, my hometown.

562
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:40,278
Let's go to the place where I caught
marsh snails with my brother...

563
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,448
and make marsh snail soup.

564
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:50,203
I'll also visit your hometown.

565
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:53,991
I'll go to the catholic church
where you lived...

566
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:57,680
and visit the school
that our husband went to.

567
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,602
When that time comes,

568
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:08,906
let's both be happy.

569
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:12,633
Just like our names.

570
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,050
Mom.

571
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:51,362
Young Bok.

572
01:03:53,284 --> 01:03:54,964
Yes, Mom.

573
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,464
It's your daughter, Young Bok.

574
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:07,732
You must really like it here.

575
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:13,247
Then, should we stop living in Cheongju...

576
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:16,622
and move to this place, Dad's hometown?

577
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:21,708
Yes.

578
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:25,341
You've been looking over there
for some time. What is it?

579
01:04:28,252 --> 01:04:30,560
Did you see a lover from the past?

580
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,219
Young Bok.

581
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:48,873
Wait for me.

582
01:04:51,606 --> 01:04:53,117
Take a look.

583
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:54,828
I made it.

584
01:04:54,969 --> 01:04:56,147
Isn't it pretty?

585
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:01,352
Here.

586
01:05:06,154 --> 01:05:07,122
Geez.

587
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:09,138
What's this? It's so childish.

588
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,451
Give it to me.

589
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:21,439
That's so pretty.

590
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:27,259
I know. How pretty they are.

591
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:34,064
Haeng Ja, my sister.

592
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:50,094
(Special thanks to Son Sook,
Sung Byung Sook, Baek Hyun Joo,)

593
01:06:50,094 --> 01:06:51,562
(and Jo Hee Bong.)
