No Eul, can't you hear me?

10
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,568
What is it? Why are you calling her?

11
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:39,331
No Eul. Open this door.
Go, you're distracting me.

12
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,531

- Move over.

21

It'd be nice if you could unpack

30
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,749
All right.

31

feed the fish and stuff.

Open the glove box.

What did the doctor say?

51
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,776
Is she really okay to get discharged
from the hospital?

(To-do List for No Eul)

53
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,851
She still has anthropophobia,

54
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:59,242
but her depression
has gotten a lot better.

55
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,818

What are you planning to do?

57
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,519
As the doctor advised,

58
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:16,734
our first goal should be for No Eul
to come outside her room.

59
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,484
He said she would get much better...

60
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,773
if her living radius expanded
at least by a little.

61
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:24,421
What if she still doesn't get better?

62
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,609
Meal boxes...

63
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,750
will be delivered twice a day
at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.

64
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,490
It's important to keep things regular.

65
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:37,088
Make sure she takes her medication
at the right time.

66
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:43,796
And come straight home
by 6 p.m. after school.

in front of the door as usual,

69
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,617
She'll put out the trash every Thursday.

70
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,593
And try talking to her from time to time.

71
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:07,523
- Whenever I have time, I will...
- So nothing has changed.

72
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,637
Can't we just tell her to come out?

73
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:28,673
It's already been three years.

74
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,643
She needs to make the effort, not us.

75
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:35,914
She must be frustrated too.

76
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:41,737
If we corner her too much,
she may have stupid ideas again.

77
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:45,136
Let's take some time to approach her.

78
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:49,827
What about me, then?

79
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:55,700
When can I stop with this life?

80
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,987
How's the new house?
Is No Eul getting used to it?

81
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,179
I don't know.

82
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:44,949
At least I'll have more free time
because the school has gotten farther.

86
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,612

87
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:06,404

you're still not over your puberty.

Don't say that.
It'd be nice to get some fresh air.

94
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,430
I'm not telling you to stay long,
so give it some thought.

95
00:09:32,443 --> 00:09:34,265
Okay?

96
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:36,682

00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,567
You're not going to stay there
for the whole three months, are you?

180
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:26,599
I'm not sure if I'll find time
to visit home.

181
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,939
But we need to take No Eul
to the hospital, right?

182
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:32,406
When you come back,

183
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,574
can you stay for two or more days?

184
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,632
Stop talking nonsense,
and just take good care of your sister!

185
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:38,915
You little brat.

186
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,688
Is that all?

187
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,191
Don't you want to know
why I'm asking you that?

188
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,499
What? Why?

189
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:51,566
What do you want now?

190
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,863
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

191
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,764
Hey, Ha Neul, I'm just...

192
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,958
Do you seriously
have to be on my case too?

193
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:33,003
Sorry.

194
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,706
I'm trying to get a job.

195
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,710
I'll cover your hospital bill
once I get paid.

196
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,544
So...

197
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:47,646
Please leave me alone today, okay?

198
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:49,881
Well...

199
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,351
I didn't mean to...

200
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,622
See you tomorrow at school.

201
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:12,389
Hey.

202
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:19,696
Why are you going in there?

203
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,637
I didn't get to tell you this.

204
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,641
But I live on the first floor
of this building.

205
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,525
Come again?

206
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:36,179
You see...

207
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,815
I knew you moved here.

208
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:42,052
But I thought you wouldn't like
the fact that I knew.

209
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:46,650
I didn't want you to find out this way.

210
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:52,929
I'll get going.

211
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,875
Do you want a part-time job?

212
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:15,752
Yang is the homeowner's son? My gosh.

213
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:17,886
By the way,
if you've found a part-time job,

214
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:19,556
does that mean
you're really coming to Jeju Island?

215
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,332
I'm so excited!

216
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,393
How about we hang out with Ju Ri
when you're here?

217
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,307
No Eul, your meal is here.

218
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,212
(What should I compliment her on?)

219
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:43,980
(1. She's kind. 2. She has a nice smile.
3. She's good with her hands.)

220
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,404
I got a part-time job, No Eul.

221
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,077
It's temporary, just on the weekends.

222
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,817
I'm sure you've had plenty of them, right?

223
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,321
You used to be good with your hands.

224
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,624
You would smile a lot too.

225
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,658
I hope I can be like that.

226
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:43,807

230
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,827

232
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:24,181
You should've told me
if we were doing this.

233
00:23:24,182 --> 00:23:26,100
I talked to my mom,

234
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:27,905
so work as long as you want.

235
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,086
My legs are in this state, anyway.

236
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:33,690
You didn't say anything weird to her,
did you?

237
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:36,860
- I told her you were going to be family.
- Hey.

238
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:37,861
Take these.

239
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,233

243
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:18,535
but the detail matters.

244
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,371
I'll have to come in every day
until you get used to it.

245
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:24,774
How is it
that you're always making a move on me?

246
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,577
You might think I'm acting recklessly,
but it's far from it.

247
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:30,547
You need to understand
what exactly they need.

248
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:31,975
Look.

249
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:34,818
You needed a part-time job,
and that's what I offered you.

250
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,586
That's how to make them open up.

251
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:39,956
Hey, I didn't open up to you.

252
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,558
Don't delude yourself.

253
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,211
That's not a shoe rack, you know.

254
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:08,118
Whenever I see the cold floor or you,

255
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:09,719
I can't resist it.

256
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,357
Bye.

257
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:19,062
You need to understand
what exactly they need.

258
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:21,564
You needed a part-time job,
and that's what I offered you.

259
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:23,099
That's how to make them open up.

260
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:28,371
Slice it in half.

261
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:29,738
It's good as it is
if you eat it like this.

262
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:33,313
But if you cut out the edges,
it'll taste softer.

263
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,577
Now, place it on a nice plate,

264
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:39,082
and there's your soft and nutty
egg-mayo sandwich.

265
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:02,272
No Eul.

266
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,676
It seemed like you didn't like
the meal boxes.

267
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,279
So, I made something else for you.

268
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:14,951
It's the egg sandwich
you would make for me.

269
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:16,252
Here it is.

270
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:18,212
- Should I cut it for you?
- Yes. I...

271
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,124
Whenever I went on a school picnic,

272
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:25,128
you would make me sandwiches
even if you didn't get to sleep much.

273
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:28,321
So I wouldn't feel less than the others
because we didn't have Mom.

274
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:31,701
You only picked the pretty ones
to put in there.

275
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,773
To be honest,

276
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:40,777
I wanted to make you a dish
that you liked.

277
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,847
But I wasn't sure what you liked.

278
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:49,786
I realized that was
because you always catered to my taste.

279
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,893
But you were just a kid too.

280
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:03,802
I want to make you a dish you like too.

281
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,970
Tell me anytime you're craving something.

282
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:12,709
Thank you.

283
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,915
You are...

284
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,419
a very reliable person.

I actually...

310
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:30,079
heard about your family from my mom.

311
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:31,991
What?

312
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:37,466
Your father told her
he was going to move in beforehand.

313
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,683
I see.

314
00:30:51,794 --> 00:30:53,126
My sister...

315
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,031
tends to get afraid of strangers.

316
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:00,567

319
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:12,812
I don't remember.

You guys are sisters, so you must be.

321
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:23,523
But can I ask...

322
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:29,363
why your sister won't
come out of her room?

323
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:40,039
I want to know too.

324
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:46,212
I wonder what is keeping her
in her room so long.

325
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,941
My sister...

326
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,465
was brutally bullied at school.

327
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:03,563
No Eul, what happened?

328
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:08,701
I think she felt
there was no one to rely on.

329
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:11,137
I was too young,

330
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:14,340

333
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,058
Why are you doing this?

334
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,324
Please step out and talk to me.

335
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,020
No Eul, I got us a cake.

336
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:42,068
Let's have a birthday party together.

337
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:58,718
And this year,

338
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:02,755
I still couldn't get her open the door...

339
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:05,658
after three years had passed.

340
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:13,399
Frankly,

341
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:18,371
I want to stop trying.

342
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:28,281
And I hate myself for thinking that.

343
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:41,728
I should go to Jeju Island next time.

344
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:45,732
But I want you to go to Jeju Island.

345
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:54,045
I think you deserve to spend a day...

346
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:56,434
just for yourself.

347
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,579
Or...

348
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,983
you can ask your sister directly.

349
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:09,055
Who knows? She might let you go.

350
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,309
No Eul.

351
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,910
On my birthday,

352
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:42,207
I'm planning to visit Jeju Island.

353
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:44,724
Do you think...

354
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:50,254
you can stay alone at home
for about two days?

355
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:01,473
To tell you the truth,

356
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:05,845
there's a friend I really want to meet.

357
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:18,121
You see, she is my only friend.

358
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,894
She's the only one who understands me.

359
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:30,336
She wants to see me on my birthday,

360
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:34,527
so can I go to see her?

361
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:42,262
Right. I know it's too much to ask.

362
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,551
No Eul?

363
00:36:01,237 --> 00:36:03,135
Does it mean I can go?

364
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:14,824
Are you sure?

365
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,988
I really appreciate it!

366
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,422
Do you know that Jeju chocolate?

367
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:29,137
I'll buy every flavor
of those chocolates for you.

368
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,160
And I'll tell you every detail
of how my trip was.

369
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,543
Let's keep it up, No Eul.
I know you can do it.

370
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,078
I believe in you!

371
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:13,143
(For the first time after a while,
No Eul and I talked.)

372
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:25,141
(I couldn't hear her voice, though.
But could this be a positive sign?)

373
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:43,404
I'll be back after the part-time job,
No Eul.

374
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,793
Your advice actually worked.

375
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,785
You knocked, and did it open?

376
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,578
One, two, and swing.

377
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:03,528
One and two.

378
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:05,189
Use more of your energy.
Your hands should go up.

379
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,119
You're heading to Jeju very soon.
How do you feel?

380
00:40:35,652 --> 00:40:37,521
I'm more worried than I thought I'd be.

381
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:40,524
I wonder if it's really okay to go.

382
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:42,560
Just enjoy the moment.

383
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:44,762
Anyway, do you practice dancing
at home too?

384
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:48,733
My mom says she's gotten a headache
from the noise from the ceiling.

385
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,102
Well, that's not me.

386
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,038
What? That's strange.

387
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,806
Or maybe some house is
going through a remodeling construction.

388
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,685
Hey, it's so hot.

389
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:01,846
- Is it hot?
- Yes.

390
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:03,147
Take a seat for a bit.

391
00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:09,754
Have some water first.

392
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:10,988
Thanks.

393
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,792
And...

394
00:41:13,352 --> 00:41:14,552
Here we go.

395
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:16,861
Put your feet in here too.

396
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:22,133
Anyway, why do you go around
with bare feet?

397
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:24,368
Because my insoles are too hot.

398
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:25,936
What?

399
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,340
No one would know how hard it is
for my insoles.

400
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:32,509
I feel bad for them
and want to give them some comfort.

401
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,533
What are you saying?

402
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:39,025
I work part-time because of my mom.

403
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:42,361
She finds it really amusing
to watch me dance.

404
00:41:46,194 --> 00:41:47,692
The truth is,

405
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:53,731
there was a time when she suffered
a broken mind too.

406
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,635
She got a lot better
as she ran her coffee shop.

407
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,810
Oh, I see.

408
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:06,825
I didn't know.

409
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,450
So, to be of help,

410
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:12,215
I'm doing this,
but I doubt she's aware of it.

411
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:14,118
She thinks I'm doing this
to make pocket money.

412
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:17,395
You must feel a little unfair.

413
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,020
Back then, I did.

414
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:21,684
But I'm okay now.

415
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:23,629
Why?

416
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:27,385
Because I know
that I've done the best I could.

417
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:36,840
They are hot because they work hard.

418
00:42:37,552 --> 00:42:39,747
If not, they wouldn't even be hot.

419
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:49,762
You want a break for yourself...

420
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:54,231
because you've tried just as hard
for your sister.

421
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:01,809
What I mean is...

422
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:07,169
Enjoy your time to cool yourself down
on Jeju Island.

423
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:15,786
Hey, it's cold.

424
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:17,184
Is it?

425
00:43:19,652 --> 00:43:20,762
Isn't it refreshing?

426

(Survival Confirmation Log, 2021-1)

427
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,452
(The streets are already filled
with the Christmas vibe.)

428
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:38,919
(I want to do a Christmas tree
with my sister.)

429
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:39,952
(Third week of December)

430
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:41,019
(I totally messed up the final exams.)

431
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:50,219
(Please let me do a lot of things
with my sister next year.)

(A Log to Lead Her Out of the Room)

433
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:20,019
(I want my sister and I to be happy now.)

434
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:24,739
The person you have reached
is not available.

435
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:26,517
You will be directed to a voicemail box.

436
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:29,685
I sent you the itinerary for my trip.

437
00:44:29,685 --> 00:44:30,919
Please check.

438
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:33,020
I'm watching movies with Ju Ri.

439
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:36,614
I see our friendship has grown cold.

440
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:41,932

441

(Unsend)

442
00:44:43,691 --> 00:44:45,019
- (- Do you want to unsend the message?
- Yes.)

443
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:56,885
Anyway, do you practice dancing
at home too?

444
00:44:56,885 --> 00:44:59,762
My mom says she's gotten a headache
from the noise from the ceiling.

445
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,985
(My sister is acting strange.
I'm going to try going into her room.)

446
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:38,889
What is it? How is she strange?

447
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:42,693
I hear strange sounds from her room.

448
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,119
She can't be having
stupid ideas again, can she?

449
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,919
Hey, Hyun Ji.

450
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:51,219
- Hurry up.
- Hold on. I'm on the phone.

451
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:52,752
I'm hungry.

452
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,052
I'm sorry. It's Ju Ri.

453
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:55,272
What did you say?

454
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,585
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

455
00:45:56,585 --> 00:45:58,842
Oh, come on. What is the problem?

456
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:03,447
Of all people, can't you put me first?

457
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,852
(I won't take out any trash
for the time being.)

458
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,082
No Eul.

459
00:46:40,385 --> 00:46:41,919
No Eul, what does this note mean?

460
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:46,245
What does it mean?

461
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:47,636
No Eul!

462
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:51,128
No Eul, tell me what it means!

463
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,937
- Pick up.
- The person you have reached...

464
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:01,438
is not available.

465
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:06,852
(No Eul is acting strange. She won't
even take out the trash anymore.)

466
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:32,369
I told you to take good care
of your sister. What have you been doing?

467
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,708
You'll blame me like this?

468
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:42,513
I'm going to go on a trip.

469
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:43,747
What?

470
00:47:44,345 --> 00:47:45,983
I'm done living like this.

471
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,452
I'll do what I want in life too.

472
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,919
Ha Neul. Are you out of your mind?

473
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:53,457
No, I'm in my right mind more than ever.

474
00:47:53,752 --> 00:47:56,960
So stop calling me,
and deal with No Eul yourself.

475
00:47:57,522 --> 00:47:58,562
Hey!

476
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:01,231
Why you...

477
00:48:01,419 --> 00:48:02,699
Ha Neul.

478
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:04,752
- No Eul.
- Ha Neul.

479
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:06,804
Take Dad's calls yourself from now on.

480
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,285
I'm done with this.

481
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,174
- Got it?
- Ha Neul!

482
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:13,485
- You really...
- You don't know anything.

483
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:14,519
You don't do anything.

484
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:17,147
That is why I can't do anything!

485
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,154
Come out, No Eul.

486
00:48:26,352 --> 00:48:27,852
Come out and talk to me.

487
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:29,426
Come out already!

488
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:42,206
What?
Are you going to end your life again?

489
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:50,447
Why...

490
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:52,917
Why are you so selfish?

491
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:55,851
Do you think everything just ends
if you die?

492
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,785
I'm trying so hard here.

493
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:04,577
Shouldn't you at least make some effort?

494
00:49:21,452 --> 00:49:22,613
Fine.

495
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:26,850
Suit yourself.

496
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,320
Whether you want to end your life or not,

497
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:32,222
I'll take my mind off it.

498
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:41,519
(Dad)

499
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:54,119
(Hyun Ji)

500
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:05,114
Hey! Why didn't you pick up your phone?

501
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:08,117
Did you see the message I sent you?

502
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:11,920
(Ha Neul, I'm sorry.
Did I make you upset?)

503
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:13,253
(No Eul is going to be fine soon,
so don't worry so much...)

504
00:50:13,253 --> 00:50:14,784
(Did you get home? I didn't think
you'd take it so offensively.)

505
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:16,224
(Is No Eul okay? Call me if you see this.
Pick up your phone, Ha Neul.)

506
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:23,488
(Whoever I'm with,
our friendship will never change.)

507
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:24,731
(Please remember that.)

508
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,057
(Then, you'll be able
to feel more at ease.)

509
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:38,781
Are you crying?

510
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:41,050
Hey, why are you crying?

511
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:45,821
I can't come to see you.

512
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,789
Of course, you can. Come on.

513
00:50:49,324 --> 00:50:51,126
What happened?

514
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,073
I told No Eul...

515
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,495
that if that's really what she wanted,
then she should end her life.

516
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:13,347
I shouldn't have said it.

517
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:17,245
What if she actually dies?

518
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:22,835
I hate myself so much, Hyun Ji.

519
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:27,396
Ha Neul.

520
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:31,467
I'm sure she knows
that you didn't mean it.

521
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:34,036
So just hurry to her.

522
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,720
No Eul.

523
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,124
No Eul?

524
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:40,436
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

525
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:53,648
No Eul!

526
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:56,385
No Eul, where are you?

527
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:06,211
Hello?

528
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:32,391
- Are you a family member of Yoo No Eul?
- Yes.

529
00:53:33,021 --> 00:53:35,455
- It's a temporary fainting due to shock.
- I see.

530
00:53:35,456 --> 00:53:37,526
She'll be fine after getting some rest.

531
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,962
And the injury on her leg
isn't so serious.

532
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:43,367
So I'll just dress the wound.

533
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:45,567
Thank you.

534
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,321
I found my sister.

535
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:07,387
Where are you?

536
00:54:07,388 --> 00:54:08,189
(Kim Yang)

537
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:11,326
I'm in the lobby on the first floor.

538
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:13,762
I'll be back with what we need.

539
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:15,464
And...

540
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:19,335
Don't blame No Eul too much.

541
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:22,085
I think she did the best she could.

542
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:24,106
This is the security camera footage
from your house.

543
00:54:46,562 --> 00:54:49,197
(To take out the garbage for Ha Neul)

544
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:55,603
(1: Check the least busy time on Thursday)

545
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:03,624
I got a part-time job, No Eul.

546
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:08,913
I'm sure you've had plenty of them, right?

547
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:10,552
I mean...

548
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:14,188
You used to be good with your hands.

549
00:55:15,257 --> 00:55:16,684
You would smile a lot too.

550
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:22,723
I hope I can be like that.

551
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,801
It seemed like you didn't like
the meal boxes.

552
00:55:27,435 --> 00:55:30,677
So I made the egg sandwiches
you would make for me.

553
00:55:31,573 --> 00:55:33,274
Whenever I went on a school picnic,

554
00:55:33,275 --> 00:55:36,278
you would make me sandwiches
even if you didn't get to sleep much.

555
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:39,514
So I wouldn't feel less than the others
because we didn't have Mom.

556
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:42,884
You only picked the pretty ones
to put in there.

557
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:45,854
But you were just a kid too.

558
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:54,229
Thank you.

559
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:58,734
You are...

560
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:02,203
a very reliable person.

561
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:29,935
(When will I get better? Can I ever
go back to how I used to be?)

562
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,560
(Why am I so weak?
Why am I so unmotivated?)

563
00:56:31,585 --> 00:56:32,802
(How much does Ha Neul resent me?)

564
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,269
(I hate myself
for being a burden to my family.)

565
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:55,756
No Eul!

566
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:58,058
No Eul, are you okay?

567
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:04,505
No Eul.

568
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:08,669
To tell you the truth, there's a friend...

569
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:11,403
I really want to meet.

570
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:16,444
You see, she is my only friend.

571
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:19,414
She's the only one who understands me.

572
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:24,619
She wants to see me on my birthday,

573
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,888
so can I go to see her?

574
00:57:30,912 --> 00:57:32,928
Right. I know it's too much to ask.

575
00:57:43,535 --> 00:57:44,606
No Eul?

576
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:48,944
Does it mean I can go?

577
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,753
Are you sure?

578
00:57:58,302 --> 00:58:01,257
I really appreciate it!

579
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:06,160
Let's keep it up, No Eul.
I know you can do it.

580
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:08,196
I believe in you!

581
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:19,841
Ha Neul...

582
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,878
wants to meet her friend.

583
00:58:26,214 --> 00:58:28,083
What can I do for her?

584
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,187
What can I do?

585
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:37,191
(Garbage Bag)

586
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:42,330
I need to take out the garbage
on Thursdays.

587
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:58,278
(To take out the garbage for Ha Naeul)

588
00:59:11,907 --> 00:59:13,161
One...

589
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:14,763
Two...

590
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,184
If I want to throw out the garbage,

591
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,238
I need to hurry down the staircase.

592
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:27,976
I need to be faster.

593
00:59:30,555 --> 00:59:33,448
Come out, No Eul.

594
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:37,017
Come out and talk to me.

595
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:38,452
Come out already!

596
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,389
I'm trying so hard here.

597
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,992
Shouldn't you at least make some effort?

598
00:59:53,412 --> 00:59:54,410
Fine.

599
00:59:57,373 --> 00:59:58,739
Suit yourself.

600
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:02,034
Whether you want to end your life or not,

601
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:04,235
I'll take my mind off it.

602
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,157
(I'm a very reliable person.
If I say I'll do something, I do it.)

603
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:18,777
I thought you might need these.

604
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,847
Thanks.

605
01:01:23,956 --> 01:01:25,798
Thanks for the trouble.

606
01:01:25,823 --> 01:01:28,019
No, it's this costume
that's doing all the work.

607
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:32,814
By the way,
the floor of this place is really cold.

608
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:34,158
I love it.

609
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,290
No!

610
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:51,209
Don't do it!

611
01:01:54,862 --> 01:01:57,358
I'll come back later
when she's calmed down.

612
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:58,517
Okay.

613
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:06,357
I don't want it!

614
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:14,766
It's me.

615
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:21,839
Everything is okay, so stop crying now.

616
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:37,216
Go and see your friend.

617
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,090
What?

618
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:44,429
You said you missed your friend.

619
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:50,101
I...

620
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:53,304
I also do it too.

621
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,941
I can throw out the garbage.

622
01:02:58,716 --> 01:03:00,311
Have fun with your friend.

623
01:03:08,213 --> 01:03:10,355
Don't become sick like me.

624
01:03:13,975 --> 01:03:15,226
Don't get sick.

625
01:03:28,423 --> 01:03:29,908
Actually,

626
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:35,693
I wanted to run away.

627
01:03:39,523 --> 01:03:43,478
But it's not because
I hated you in any way.

628
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:55,767
I'm sorry for not noticing
that you were...

629
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,538
trying hard.

630
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,756
You can wear this back to home.

631
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:35,873
I'm going in now.

632
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,538
You've worked so hard.

633
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:55,718
You said you could
throw out the garbage, right?

634
01:04:58,402 --> 01:05:00,264
Why don't we do it together?

635
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:06,537
You are a really brave person.

636
01:05:41,529 --> 01:05:44,676
I'll work the schedule around.
Take the trip.

637
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:47,030
I'm sorry, my daughter.

638
01:05:52,896 --> 01:05:53,985
No Eul.

639
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:58,389
Have you been to Jeju Island?

640
01:06:05,803 --> 01:06:07,665
Do you want to go with me next time?

641
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:31,222
Hyun Ji, can I bring my sister
to Jeju next time?

642
01:06:31,475 --> 01:06:32,557
Sure.

643
01:06:33,931 --> 01:06:34,940
Thank you.

644
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:37,728
When we're there,
please introduce us to Ju Ri too.

645
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:39,897
What about me?

646
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,839
It's a family trip, so you're not in.

647
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:46,806
How come? We'll be family soon.

648
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:49,473
Go away, will you?

649
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:51,582
I want in too.

650
01:06:52,153 --> 01:06:53,377
Please?

651
01:06:53,855 --> 01:06:54,912
No Eul.

652
01:06:55,651 --> 01:06:57,682
What do you want to do when we're in Jeju?

653
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:00,952
As for me,

654
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:05,323
the sea is supposed to be amazing there,
so I want to see the beach.

655
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:09,994
I want to take a walk with you
and have delicious food too.

656
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,462
I hope we can do all that.

658
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,239
(We'll get to look at each other
and smile someday.)

659
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:22,239
