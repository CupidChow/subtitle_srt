Tianming,

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Do you see me?

28
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,420
I always see you.

29
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,420
So, that's why he's so worried about you?

30
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
How can he grow up? He's dead.

31
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,420
Dead?

32
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
He's been dead for 12 years.

33
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
How can a grown-up not find his own home?

34
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,420
I ate him.

35
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,420
You ate him? Who?

36
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Louis.

37
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Louis is not a human, but a baby.

38
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,420
He's still hiding in the corner of the folk village.

39
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,420
He can't forget the taste of the baby he ate.

40
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,420
He's looking for the kids to eat when it's time to eat.

41
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Then, the geese that disappeared last year...

42
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
That's right. He must be in the baby's belly.

43
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Yuxuan.

44
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,420
Yes.

45
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Where is my father?

46
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,420
He's on his way.

47
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Okay.

48
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
And...

49
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,420
The wound on my back...

50
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,420
It's a wound from a great foreign minister.

51
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,420
I didn't know, so I started to get angry.

52
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,420
Father, why don't you recognize me?

53
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm not your father.

54
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Father, why don't you recognize me?

55
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,420
I'm Ping Lang.

56
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Tell me about this minister.

57
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,420
How can I know your father's identity?

58
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
No.

59
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,420
If you're Hong Lang, you'll know.

60
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Sometimes, things like this disappear.

61
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,420
There are some thieves in the south.

62
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,420
I don't let them find the people who did this.

63
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Perhaps you'll know some!

64
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Some of them might be some 강이 einigeico.

65
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,920
The name of that man isn't me.

66
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,600
Your Majesty, please go my way.

67
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,360
Is it willing?

68
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,260
How is that?

69
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,540
Does it feel like you're in a dream?

70
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,620
to be a mess

71
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,660
Un Glad to be banished

72
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,000
From the land

73
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,260
to protect those who are dear

74
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,660
For the deaths of those innocent

75
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,300
What a shame

76
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,140
It has taken away myHAMU非

77
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,520
include the kindness

78
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,660
Put the spray

79
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:40,240
Was transformed into a

80
00:09:40,240 --> 00:10:05,380
Mother created all kinds of

81
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,500
Same to you.

82
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,420
I wouldn't dare take you that Karen.

83
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,460
Right?

84
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,560
Yes.

85
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,960
Then I'll go ahead.

86
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
Why don't you

87
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
prepare on the site

88
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,500
where the soldiers before me

89
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,960
are..

90
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,480
It was a bad night

91
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,800
Calm down

92
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,380
We're not stupid

93
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,680
Just bring him back

94
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,720
Tell him

95
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Just lie to me

96
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
If we have to catch that bastard,

97
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
there is a light over there.

98
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Let him go.

99
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Yes.

100
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
We have to catch him.

101
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Search the place.

102
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Yes.

103
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Go.

104
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
There he is.

105
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Catch him.

106
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Go.

107
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Go.

108
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Don't run.

109
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Go.

110
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Go.

111
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Go.

112
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Go.

113
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Go.

114
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Go.

115
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Go.

116
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Go.

117
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Go.

118
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Go.

119
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Go.

120
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Go.

121
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Go.

122
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Go.

123
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Go.

124
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
What's going on?

125
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
I need to see what's inside.

126
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
What?

127
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Did you hide something that I shouldn't see?

128
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Are you going to search the Min Sang Group?

129
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
You don't have any reason to do that.

130
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I don't have any reason.

131
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I have power.

132
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
You killed my wife.

133
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
How can you handle it?

134
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
It's not that.

135
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
I need to find that bastard.

136
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
What do you want?

137
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,840
I also need to pay for the people's

138
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,880
abuse and abuse of the Min Sang Group.

139
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
But first,

140
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
I need to go to the coffin

141
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
and find out who the bastard is.

142
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm sorry.

143
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I was too drunk.

144
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,880
I just want to show off.

145
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
I have to go now.

146
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Let's go.

147
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Let's go.

148
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Yes.

149
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Why did you touch that bastard?

150
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Why are you so indifferent?

151
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I was the first one to see it.

152
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
What would you have done if you had caught him?

153
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Maybe he's making a mistake.

154
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
No.

155
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
He's just a bastard.

156
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,880
He's probably already been taken away.

157
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
I'm just saying that he's alive.

158
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm so happy to see you after three months.

159
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I missed you.

160
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I'm sorry.

161
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Good for you.

162
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
You got rid of all the problems

163
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
that had been happening for years.

164
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I just followed your instructions.

165
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
There will be a meeting with

166
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
the Min Sang Group in four days.

167
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm sorry.

168
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
You'll have to take the lead.

169
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,520
Yes.

170
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,560
You will lead the wedding

171
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,760
and sign the contract.

172
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,920
But the marriage contract is under your command.

173
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
And you are here.

174
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,520
How dare I?

175
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,760
Despite your wife's opposition 12 years ago,

176
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,960
do you know why I made you my wife?

177
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,360
To make you my wife.

178
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,400
You want to make me your wife.

179
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,880
You want to make me your wife.

180
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,320
This is the time when your wife's body and soul

181
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,680
will be at your service.

182
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Show everyone

183
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,320
who you are.

184
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,480
I can't hear you.

185
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,720
You want more.

186
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,680
I was ordered to kill you.

187
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,840
Whose order?

188
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,440
Is there another order

189
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,840
that you want to hear?

190
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,280
Mother, wake up.

191
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
Mother, wake up.

192
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,840
Help me.

193
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Mother, wake up.

194
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,680
Did you see my ugly mother?

195
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,040
Let's go back.

196
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080
I don't want to see you again.

197
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Where can I find

198
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,280
my son?

199
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,800
Mr. Kim.

200
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
Mr. Kim.

201
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
Please help me.

202
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,600
Mr. Kim, where is my son?

203
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Where is he?

204
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,080
Did you really find your son?

205
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,400
How could you fall so easily?

206
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,600
You should have warned me

207
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
that you would be back soon.

208
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,720
You can't even make a living.

209
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You're just wasting your time.

210
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,520
I just wanted to see him.

211
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,720
I wanted to see him.

212
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,120
I wanted to see him

213
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,600
so that I could see him

214
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,400
when I was drunk.

215
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,720
Please let me go.

216
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I'll end this.

217
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,320
Please save me.

218
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Please send my son back.

219
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,120
Please leave.

220
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,920
I'll do whatever I can to convince you.

221
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,160
line

222
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,120
You mustLove Jin Mi

223
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,520
it is a shame

224
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,800
that you are so inferior.

225
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,200
Get out.

226
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Go, go, go.

227
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,520
She was a strong and healthy child.

228
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,920
Your mother gave birth to you.

229
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
You were born with the blood of the great emperor.

230
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
You must have chosen a child.

231
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
But...

232
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,120
You were born with a child.

233
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,720
That's all.

234
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,520
You were born with the blood of the great emperor.

235
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,120
You were born with the blood of the great emperor.

236
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,520
Your father's blood was torn apart.

237
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,320
You did all of that.

238
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
No.

239
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,920
How can you listen to your mother?

240
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,120
You told me not to give birth to your son.

241
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,120
I was trying to be more considerate.

242
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,320
I was trying to be more considerate.

243
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,920
Wait, wait, wait.

244
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,520
I'll show you

245
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,120
what you are.

246
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,120
Look at me.

247
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm your father.

248
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
I'm your father.

249
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,920
The Democratic thunderstorms have reached the Weihun Valley after uma2 night in Dapeng.

250
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:21,260
The

251
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,880
lightning thunder has the power to defeat

252
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,880
it's about to start0

253
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:35,780
Put it in as the 5

254
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,420
1

255
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,620
2

256
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,620
I'm sorry.

257
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,620
I'll be respectful and filial to you.

258
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
What?

259
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,620
Soon, the death penalty will be imposed on the street that you're running.

260
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,620
I'll take all the responsibility.

261
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,620
Today's work and that day's work

262
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,620
will be a great honor to me and my family.

263
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
What about the compensation for the death penalty?

264
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
Father, you should take responsibility.

265
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,620
You've done more than you can.

266
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
I'm sorry.

267
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,620
What's wrong with your face?

268
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Did you...

269
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Is your ankle okay?

270
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
I'm sorry.

271
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,620
You look a little surprised.

272
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
You'll be better soon.

273
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,620
Will I be better if I sleep well?

274
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,620
Why? Where are you going tomorrow?

275
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
Can't you quit?

276
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
What?

277
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Looking for a pet?

278
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,620
No, I'm leaving.

279
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,620
I've been watching what you and those beggars do.

280
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,620
They must have made money from the poor and went out to look for money.

281
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,620
But recently, they've been making a bigger deal.

282
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,620
That's because...

283
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
They're making money.

284
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
They've been running for a long time.

285
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
They've been running for a long time.

286
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
They're running for the position of the leader of the Joseon Dynasty.

287
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,620
That's why they're trying to get to Yeonggyeong.

288
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
You're waking up too.

289
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
You don't have to do that.

290
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,620
I'll do it.

291
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
As soon as I become the leader,

292
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
I'll make you sit in the seat of the leader

293
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
and Yeonggyeong will give you a share.

294
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,620
Then,

295
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,620
let's go together and look for money.

296
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
You're so stubborn.

297
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Then you won't be able to get married.

298
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,620
If you know that I'm such a lowly woman,

299
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,620
how will you like me?

300
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,620
And you should know that I'm not your biological sister.

301
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
If I make a mistake,

302
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
I'll be in a big trouble.

303
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
I don't want to.

304
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,620
I want to see you cry.

305
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
I want to see my nephew too.

306
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,620
The child is three times bigger than the body.

307
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm sure I'll find it.

308
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
I was assured of the donation.

309
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,620
I received the money 12 years ago.

310
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,620
I heard that the order of the Hanpyeong Army's king

311
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
was clearly in my stomach.

312
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,620
I was wondering how to give him a favor.

313
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,620
I found a dead man knowing that.

314
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
How can you say such a sad thing?

315
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,620
I cried when I thought about the years of my life.

316
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
I couldn't find him.

317
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,620
I was wandering around like a crazy man.

318
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,620
I thought I was looking for my nephew.

319
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,620
So you found him?

320
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,620
I found him.

321
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,620
Do you know how the people who were looking for the dead man

322
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
became like this?

323
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Rumor has it that the dead man was a murderer.

324
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,620
He was killed by a knife.

325
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
He was beaten and chopped.

326
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
He was a real murderer.

327
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
They are all cheap people.

328
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Are you sure you can't be a murderer?

329
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Wait.

330
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Do you know what you did?

331
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
It's a little...

332
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,620
It's a little shameful to say it.

333
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
But

334
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
he grew up in a remote place.

335
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,620
He was wandering around like a crazy man.

336
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,620
He was beaten and chopped by a knife.

337
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,620
You haven't found your place yet?

338
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
That's weird.

339
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
I don't know if he knew about the fever.

340
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Or maybe he was shocked.

341
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
He doesn't remember anything.

342
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,620
He thought he was a good man.

343
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Your pal left the photo.

344
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
So I checked all comments,

345
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,620
including my nephew.

346
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Did a detective do something to us?

347
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Why are you asking me?

348
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,620
This is unbelievable.

349
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Officerices have been in charge

350
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
of all of this investigation.

351
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,620
Let's see what they have in store for us.

352
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,760
The

353
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,780
Emperor

354
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,080
Look

355
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,840
OK.

356
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,800
T Roys

357
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:27,220
How's the beautiful blue sky

358
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,140
T Roys

359
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
No!

360
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Jaehee, are you okay?

361
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Yes, I'm fine.

362
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
I knew it.

363
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,140
I was going to sit down.

364
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
Uncle!

365
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Jaehee!

366
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,140
Uncle is back!

367
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
Jaehee!

368
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Shoulder...

369
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,140
This side, left arm...

370
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,140
This side, right arm...

371
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
This side, right arm...

372
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Yes, left arm scar.

373
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
No.

374
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
How's it going?

375
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
I don't know.

376
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
If it was fake,

377
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
we'd have been dragged out.

378
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
But what if it's real?

379
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,140
What if it's fake?

380
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
What do you think?

381
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
You should let them out.

382
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
They're not from the countryside.

383
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
They're not from the countryside.

384
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
But they're still here.

385
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
You're so kind.

386
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,140
Let's go.

387
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Don't be so stubborn.

388
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Let's go.

389
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,140
It's always been like this.

390
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
Whenever people who claimed to be the hooligans

391
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,140
come here,

392
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,140
Jaehee never gets tired.

393
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,140
He always runs fast and desperately.

394
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
He never does that.

395
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
But this time,

396
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I feel anxious.

397
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Do you know that

398
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,140
I'm trying to get back at you?

399
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,140
If you want to regret it,

400
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,140
I'll do it.

401
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,140
It's fake.

402
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,140
It's not fake.

403
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
It's fake.

404
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,140
I've checked the body

405
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
and other features.

406
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Was there anyone who didn't

407
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
have that much of a fake?

408
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Not only that,

409
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
the features of the face and the body

410
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
are the same.

411
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
The combination method that I've tried with you

412
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,140
is also very high.

413
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,140
You're a little weak

414
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
and you're not very strong.

415
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
You're right.

416
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Do you think

417
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
it's real?

418
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
Jaehee.

419
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Father.

420
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
Look again.

421
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
Father, look again.

422
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
What are you doing?

423
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Look again.

424
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,140
You ignored the results

425
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
and the evidence of the test.

426
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
How can you say it's fake?

427
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
It's fake.

428
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Okay,

429
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
let's take a look.

430
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,140
Tell me what you remember.

431
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,140
I don't remember anything when I was young.

432
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
That's easy.

433
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,140
My only memory

434
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,140
is playing with you at the mountain.

435
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,140
That's easy.

436
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
How can a man in the Joseon Dynasty

437
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
not remember that?

438
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
Then you'll remember where you went

439
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,140
and where you stayed, right?

440
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,140
I don't remember.

441
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,140
What about the dog you raised?

442
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
What's its name?

443
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,140
I don't know.

444
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
It's a name you named yourself,

445
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
but you don't remember?

446
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Then what was the thing you were most afraid of?

447
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
What did you hate the most when you teased me?

448
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
What was the scent I gave you?

449
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
You never took it off your arms,

450
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
but you still don't remember?

451
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
Then what about the friends you met

452
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
every time you went out on the streets?

453
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
You don't know the name,

454
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
but you can tell me by the looks.

455
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Just one.

456
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,140
No, you don't know.

457
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,140
You never know. You can't answer.

458
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
It's not that you don't remember.

459
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
It's because you don't have a child.

460
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,140
You're so annoying.

461
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
What kind of a girl are you?

462
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Yes.

463
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I don't think so.

464
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
I was also half-hearted

465
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
throughout the whole time I was in the army.

466
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,140
I thought that if I saw my parents

467
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
and their children,

468
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
I would think of them.

469
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,140
I was looking forward to seeing them,

470
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
but I didn't expect anything.

471
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,140
I'm sure they're not just friends.

472
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,140
I'll be going now.

473
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
A child

474
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
has to go through a lot of pain

475
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
to be with his parents.

476
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
How can he remember everything?

477
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
If he does,

478
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,140
how can he forget all the memories of Yunhyeon?

479
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Enough.

480
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
Get out.

481
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Get out.

482
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,140
You must be tired.

483
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
My son.

484
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
I'm ashamed

485
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
that my mother

486
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:27,140
is so weak and weak.

487
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Please forgive me.

488
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
It's okay.

489
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,140
I'm not your son.

490
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
You're right.

491
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,140
You're right.

492
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
I can't believe you're doing this.

493
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,140
You're my son.

494
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
You're my father.

495
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,140
You know that I'm a useless woman.

496
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,140
You want to take my life.

497
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,140
Fine.

498
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,140
Don't take it too hard.

499
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,140
You're a worse son than your father.

500
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
Don't ever

501
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,140
take my precious son away from me again.

502
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Don't be so upset.

503
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,140
If you keep watching...

504
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,140
How old are you?

505
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
You must be different from when you were young.

506
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,140
No.

507
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,140
I didn't miss

508
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
even a single moment.

509
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
Where are you going?

510
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,140
The chief!

511
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,140
I wonder how much you've grown up.

512
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
Where are you going?

513
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
I'm going to the hospital.

514
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,140
I wonder how much you've grown up.

515
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,140
How you've changed.

516
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,140
I've been drawing you

517
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,140
day after day.

518
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
The face I see when I close my eyes

519
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
is just that face.

520
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Hong Rang was always in front of me.

521
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Then

522
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,140
isn't that face the queen?

523
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Han Ye.

524
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,140
Han Ye.

525
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,140
Cheers.

526
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,140
Hong Rang.

527
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,140
I want you to come back now.

528
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,140
Then I can get rid of that fake guy

529
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,140
and you and I can go back to the way we were.

530
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Open up.

531
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
Up!

532
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
Nu Yi.

533
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,540
Is that a

534
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,020
I have few plans to save him.

535
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,220
Please bring the award to him.

536
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,100
He wants to get himself killed?

537
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,000
If that were true,

538
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I would take that for even more.

539
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,600
Didn't your father

540
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Sit down.

541
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Come on.

542
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
What's your name?

543
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
My name is Lee Nae.

544
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
I can't speak since I was born.

545
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
It's a pity.

546
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
That's why I can't show you well.

547
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Like the blind can't see,

548
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
this child is like that.

549
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,100
The energy that can't be heard

550
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,100
is much more sharp than me.

551
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Especially the vitality

552
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,100
and the sense of hostility.

553
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,100
It's a pity,

554
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
but I've lived without it.

555
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
I'm not short of my body and spirit.

556
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
So don't worry.

557
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,100
Then, what about the birth?

558
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,100
If you want to know,

559
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,100
you should know.

560
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,100
I also don't know the origin of

561
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
the person I am.

562
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,100
If the child's blind identity

563
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
becomes a problem,

564
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,100
I'll send it back and leave with you.

565
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,100
No.

566
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
I was just curious.

567
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
If you like it,

568
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,100
please take it.

569
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Please.

570
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,100
Don't.

571
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Don't laugh.

572
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Stop.

573
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
K Bunun.

574
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,100
Make yourself at home.

575
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,100
So.

576
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
Why is that so?

577
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
I invited you.

578
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,020
Thank you.

579
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,400
After this.

580
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,660
Your hands are my brother's,

581
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,900
while I'm having his repeated duty.

582
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,960
A bit like your brother.

583
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,700
Must be Mald mor Soy.

584
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,140
End experance

585
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,100
between him and General Mo

586
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,780
and the management of executive offices

587
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,480
our contacts of content shed

588
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:56,000
and

589
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,960
other�리

590
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,800
keep this in mind

591
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,120
It's like raising up a wounded soul before it's too late.

592
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,120
Do you actually shooting unjustly?

593
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,340
Is it real?

594
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,200
I think of myself as just a

595
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,740
remnant of those back in the traps.

596
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,200
It could be said that I wascessing death

597
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,280
as a secret entrance to the According's absentee centre.

598
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,080
Why?

599
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,520
Why?

600
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,100
They brought the whole family here.

601
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,540
They even put up a fake family picture

602
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,780
and put up a fake family picture.

603
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,220
But they don't know anything about the fake family picture.

604
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,180
They don't remember anything.

605
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,220
But they're all fake.

606
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,340
What's more,

607
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,140
the news that Hong Rang is back in the country will spread.

608
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,940
Then all the people who were looking for Hong Rang

609
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,300
will let go of their hands.

610
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,500
I'm the only one left.

611
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,260
I have to find Hong Rang.

612
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,700
Don't worry, Hong Rang.

613
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,860
I'll find Hong Rang and tell him that he's a fake.

614
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,060
I'll find Hong Rang and protect you.

615
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,460
The

616
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,820

The

The

625
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,460
The

626
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,460
The

The

The

The

The

00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,460
The

00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,460
The

637
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,460
The

638
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,460
The

The

The

The

The

The

The

The

The

The

The

664
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,460
The

665
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
The

666
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
The

667
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,460
The

668
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,460
The

669
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
The

670
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,460
The

671
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,460
The

672
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,460
The

673
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,460
The

674
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
The

675
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
The

676
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,460
The

677
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,460
The

678
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,620
How'd the oldrophy feeding go?

679
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,980
Who's the old Mia?

680
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,160
You said you remember nothing

681
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,460
and now all this information?

682
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,120
Right, I do remember sometimes

683
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,860
At least it wasn't like this

684
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,040
Like what?

685
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,600
No, I shouldn't

686
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,020
have done that

687
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,060
You really think I'll let it go like this?

688
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,780
Let go of what?

689
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,740
What about me?

690
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,300
I did all this for in my 20th year

691
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,300
I can tell from the sound of the dog barking.

692
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,300
I can tell what you are like in this house.

693
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,300
Son.

694
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,300
Mother, I'm on my way.

695
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,300
I was wondering why you are so late.

696
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300
What were you doing?

697
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,300
I was talking to the dog.

698
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,300
I can't understand what you are saying.

699
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,300
You are talking to the dog.

700
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,300
I don't think you are answering me.

701
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:06,300
Yes, you were playing with the dog when you were young.

702
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,300
I think I can remember it now.

703
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,300
I just saw it in my eyes.

704
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,300
I can understand.

705
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,300
You must have loved the dog.

706
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,300
You tried so hard to take care of it.

707
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,300
You should go now.

708
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,300
Father is waiting for you.

709
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,300
Yes.

710
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,300
I'm here, Dorang.

711
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,300
I'm here for you.

712
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,300
But you can hold it in.

713
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,300
I will kill you.

714
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,300
I will ask you.

715
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,300
I will kill you.

716
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,300
This is the house of the Min Sang family.

717
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,300
You should come and check it out.

718
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,300
Yes.

719
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,300
It's so beautiful.

720
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,300
If I had lived in this house all my life,

721
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,300
would it be different now?

722
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,300
If so,

723
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,300
I wouldn't have known you.

724
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,300
What's wrong with this place?

725
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,300
Is it good?

726
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,300
I don't think it's the first time I've ever seen it.

727
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,300
It's so beautiful.

728
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,300
I'm so happy.

729
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,300
I'm so happy.

730
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,300
I'm so happy.

731
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,300
I'm so happy.

732
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,300
I'm so happy.

733
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,300
I'm so happy.

734
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,300
I'm so happy.

735
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,300
Wait.

736
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,300
Is there a mole in your head?

737
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,300
Was there a mole in my head?

738
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,300
Let me see it again.

739
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
It's a wound.

740
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,300
If you live with your family,

741
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
you can get a lot of wounds.

742
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
Why did you get hurt?

743
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,300
I don't know why or how.

744
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,300
I've lived a life of a fool.

745
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
I'll see if I can get a good one.

746
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,300
Or maybe I'll see how good I am.

747
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,300
What's wrong with you?

748
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,300
Let go.

749
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,300
Let go.

750
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,300
How dare you touch me?

751
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
I have something to say.

752
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,300
Don't you dare do it again.

753
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,300
Don't you dare...

754
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,300
Do it again.

755
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,300
Brother...

756
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,300
That's right.

757
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,300
I should call him that.

758
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,300
I don't have to be so cruel

759
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,300
to him for a while.

760
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Brother...

761
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,300
You've grown old.

762
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
You're stuck in my place.

763
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,300
I'll get you out of here soon.

764
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,300
Just stay here.

765
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,300
Don't try too hard.

766
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,300
You look so easy.

767
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,300
It's been 12 years.

768
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,300
You should be able to do it.

769
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,300
You...

770
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,300
So...

771
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,300
You'll try?

772
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,300
That's right.

773
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,300
It's a name.

774
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,300
It's a symbol of your true identity.

775
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,300
You can give it to a fake daughter

776
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,300
who doesn't even know the origin.

777
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,300
Fake?

778
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,300
What's the difference between fake and real?

779
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,300
She's a fake.

780
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
She's a fake.

781
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,300
Are you okay?

782
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,300
I'm fine.

783
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,300
I'm fine.

784
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,300
I'm fine.

785
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,300
I'm fine.

786
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,300
I'm fine.

787
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,300
I'm fine.

788
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:20,300
For the Turkey

789
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:34,300
Do you still remember me

790
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:08,300
I'm waiting for you

791
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,300
I'm waiting for you

792
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,300
I'm waiting for you

793
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,300
I'm waiting for you

794
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,300
I'm waiting for you

795
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,300
I'm waiting for you

796
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,300
I'm waiting for you

797
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,300
I'm waiting for you

798
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,300
I'm waiting for you

799
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,300
Because it's an inseparable relationship

800
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Even so, the long relationship

801
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Won't break easily

802
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:52,300
The spring breeze is blowing

803
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:56,300
Beyond the cold sky

804
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:01,300
Only the long eyes

805
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,300
Are becoming more and more familiar

806
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,300
I'm looking at you

807
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,300
I'm looking at you

808
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,300
I'm looking at you

809
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
I'm looking at you

810
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,300
Even if the cold wind

811
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,300
Shines on me

812
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,300
I won't forget your heart

813
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,300
I'm looking at you

814
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,300
