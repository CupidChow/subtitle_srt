1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The King of Gyeongsang-do

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The girl we lost, Seol-gi,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
was taken by a merchant.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The merchant market will open soon.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's go there right away.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The merchant market

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, my.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've been looking for it for a long time.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why are you looking for it so quickly?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
When did you get the feeling?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're so annoying.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's something under that.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The baby's gone.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Again?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who's really going to eat the baby?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why is the baby gone?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Which family is this?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When and how did it disappear?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I ate with a man at seven.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I went out to see if the baby was asleep.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I woke up in the morning and there was no baby.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The age of the man in the family who was in the middle of the night.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Even the situation that disappeared.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's similar to when Hong Rang disappeared 12 years ago.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But you know what's really weird?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The body was lying in the mud.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I heard you saw a ghost on the way in.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ghost?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're going to die of something in the child's house.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You should give me an excuse.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's a ghost.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who's going to tell you?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What happened to that body?

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't be so obvious.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not going to die.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is there a baby?

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Find out.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I need to see that body.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Our country's been hit again.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The baby's gone.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The baby's gone.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to give you a baby.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's that?

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're going to give me another baby?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold on.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hold on.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is what it looks like.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's a pretty strong guy.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I didn't investigate it all the way yesterday.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's something that's not important.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm here to see you.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What do you mean it's important?

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Song Gwang-hoon, you have to be guilty of internal affairs.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Internal affairs?

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Internal affairs?

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then there could be something that caught my son.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So please call all the people in this house right now.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And where's the body that was with you when your son disappeared?

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She...

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I did some digging and found out.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then let's look at the body later.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Give me everything that's breathing in this house.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, my.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This time, it's a girl.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A girl.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's going on?

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sit down.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This isn't just a girl.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Here.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Even the back here.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's two.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Two.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wait, wait, wait.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
12.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There are 12.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
13.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
13.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then 15.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
15?

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, there's no more.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, there's no more.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Take out the precious thing.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a girl inside the belly.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How do you know that?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You have to look at it.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Stop.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Even if you take off your makeup.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't want to.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's see if you touch it.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's definitely a girl.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Come on.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Eat meat.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come here.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Five people came out.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Is there no more?

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
18.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
18?

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're a 18.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You do everything.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is this 18 here?

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is there no more?

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If there's no more.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
18.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come here.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Come here.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is he a mole?

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's my feeling.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Just pay five more and take it.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wait a minute.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's wrong with you?

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't think Ju-gi is my blood already.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey, you crazy girl.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong with you?

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hey, can you see me?

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Get a hold of yourself.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you doing?

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you going to take her out now?

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then leave it like this?

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You crazy.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fortunately, there's no blood in the food.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Take a look.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Then.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think I'll be angry from time to time, so dig her out and deal with her.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, sir.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you doing?

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you okay?

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hurry up.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hurry up.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hurry up.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hurry up.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you doing?

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm just talking.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I didn't plan this.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't be so mean.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to take care of the poor son of the Joseon Dynasty.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I left my head and buried it in the ground.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It would have been hard for her to get over tonight.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's okay, kids.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's okay.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't look back.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You'll have to follow her.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Look at this.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll just have to take a long time.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll just have to take a long time.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's my house.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hey, isn't there a smell of the old man?

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, you're counting something in common.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's that smoke?

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hurry up.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hurry up.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hurry up.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hurry up.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Who are you?

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you okay?

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't worry.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I won't send you back there again.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I have something to ask you.

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You said you saw a ghost when your young master disappeared, right?

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can you tell me exactly what you saw?

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Where did you send this kid?

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Where are the kids?

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They're not two.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I heard you were called a vas村ky.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
하�?

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He's a mare skull.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've got two.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why did a monster like you get caught?

182
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Monster?

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Monster?

184
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
I...

185
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I just...

186
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I just look like I'm seven or eight years old.

187
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,200
You're as big and skinny as a horse.

188
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
Your hair is...

189
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,200
I came down this way,

190
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,700
and your hair was as white as an old man's.

191
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,000
But not only your hair,

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
but your arms were as white as snow.

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,800
When I saw your face, I thought you were a human.

194
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,900
You were as white as a white paper

195
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,200
without any blood.

196
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,600
Even my eyes were white.

197
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I told you.

198
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I had a weird dream.

199
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
My hair was white, my face was white,

200
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
and I saw a person with eyes.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It wasn't a dream.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That monster was...

203
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
That monster was...

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The one I heard only through rumors.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was Seol In.

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It was Seol In.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Seol In...

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know where she came from and where she went?

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know.

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't do this anymore.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't do this anymore.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't do this anymore.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can't do this anymore.

214
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:21,200
But why are you looking for that monster?

215
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I need to know

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
who made me like this.

217
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I need to know

218
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Three months before Hong Rang disappeared,

219
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I think it was about three months ago.

220
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Hong Rang disappeared for a while.

221
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Madam!

222
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
The person who slept well in the room

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
was found outside the door the next morning.

224
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
What is this?

225
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Let's go and call Madam.

226
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Madam!

227
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Madam!

228
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I called the members and asked them,

229
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
but they couldn't find the reason.

230
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
They thought Hong Rang, who went out at night,

231
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
would have lost his mind.

232
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
But someone said,

233
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
he had a phobia.

234
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
He was caught in a ghost disease

235
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
that moved his body while he was sleeping.

236
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
He thought he was dreaming when he got caught in that disease.

237
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,200
He ran into water or fire and eventually died.

238
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
He dreamed.

239
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,200
In his dream, his face was white

240
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
and his eyes were white.

241
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Since then, Hong Rang has been talking about his dream.

242
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,200
That white person took me to a dark place.

243
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
But he doesn't even think about that dream anymore.

244
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Hong Rang said that,

245
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
but I didn't even listen.

246
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
I didn't even think about it.

247
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
This is not the time.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
We need to find the white guy who knows something about the ghost.

249
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
You know what?

250
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
If you do as you say, he took Hong Rang.

251
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Seorin.

252
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I heard about it once.

253
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,200
There's a white and long monster.

254
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
If you shine a light, it disappears.

255
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
It only appears at night.

256
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Smile.

257
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
It's white like snow

258
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
and melts when it sees the sun.

259
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Seorin.

260
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Let's find him first.

261
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I was with Seolgi and me.

262
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
What?

263
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
When?

264
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,200
A big white person took Seolgi and me somewhere.

265
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Where?

266
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,200
It was a dark room with a lot of ink smell.

267
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Someone told me to send him back because he didn't need me.

268
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
So I came back here

269
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
and Seolgi stayed there.

270
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Oh, my.

271
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Is there a man who drew on that?

272
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I don't know.

273
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I saw his eyes.

274
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I saw his eyes.

275
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I saw his eyes.

276
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
I don't know.

277
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
He covered his eyes like this.

278
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Yeah.

279
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah, thank you.

280
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,200
As expected, Seorin started moving again.

281
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I think that's it.

282
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
The firework started to draw again.

283
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
There will be children who disappeared later.

284
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Let's look around.

285
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
After the death of the president, I hope you look back at the reports of the Gwangtong Bridge.

286
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
There is a gap between the current and the current leaders,

287
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,200
but thanks to that, the quality is improving and distribution is also accelerating.

288
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
It seems that it is better for the king to be careful than to be neutral.

289
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
That's right.

290
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
You came after half a season.

291
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Do you have anything else to say?

292
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I hope you know the past actions of Hongrang.

293
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Soon, the spies who are trying to get in touch with Hongrang will be shown.

294
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
How Hongrang lived and what kind of people he was in contact with.

295
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Yes, you have to know if there is anything to be caught,

296
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
so that you can follow up properly.

297
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Please eat.

298
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Where is your son?

299
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Did Hongrang plan to come here?

300
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I can't see where you went.

301
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Hongrang is no longer a child.

302
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
He should have been here.

303
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Where is your son?

304
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Are you still discussing this and the upper part?

305
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Stop pulling it out.

306
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Pull out this stick first and find my son a place.

307
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,680
There is no man who can carry out a grand act as much as a

308
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,200
man at the top of the state.

309
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
It is impossible to do anything without a man,

310
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
including running and running the company,

311
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
and even giving Hongrang what his wife wants.

312
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
How is it impossible?

313
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
And most of all, the personnel and management are also my subordinates.

314
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
The person who gave me the personnel and management's subordinates is my father.

315
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,200
The private company that should know all the details of the personnel and management is mine.

316
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Do you want to build a branch and put a big house and a big house at the same time?

317
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
And you think this company will be healthy?

318
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,200
What are you going to do with the company that has grown up?

319
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
What?

320
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
You don't have a son, so don't you worry?

321
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Bring Hongrang here.

322
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Yes.

323
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Mother is looking for you.

324
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
You found it?

325
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Son.

326
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Where have you been?

327
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I was in the West Coast.

328
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I'm going to the West Coast to see Hongrang.

329
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Then I'll wait for you there.

330
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Where are you?

331
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Where are you?

332
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Where are you?

333
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I want to think of something when I look at the book I saw when I was young.

334
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
What happened?

335
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
No, it's not.

336
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I want to keep it in my eyes even once more because the years I lived for are similar.

337
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't worry anymore.

338
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm back like this and I won't disappear again.

339
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Our God Man.

340
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
He's a returner.

341
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
He's the one who made me have a son.

342
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Do you know this person?

343
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm going to the West Coast.

344
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Your son recognized you.

345
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
He saw your portrait and remembered the old memories.

346
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Yes.

347
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
What did he remember?

348
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I remember that he didn't even look at me, but he sat on my lap and cried.

349
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,200
And every time I did that, I think I had a small amount of money.

350
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Your father has a creative mind.

351
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,200
You've been eating pine leaves all the time.

352
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Yeah.

353
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Yeah, right, Hongrang.

354
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Do you know anyone who doesn't know the face of Min Sang-dan's big hit, Min Banyu?

355
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Even if you didn't see it, you'd know it by just listening to it.

356
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
And what else?

357
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Knee?

358
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
There's no Haribi who doesn't kneel to his grandson.

359
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
He had a creative mind.

360
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
That's why he used pine leaf extract.

361
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
That's...

362
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I didn't know that.

363
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm sure Daebak's disease was not leaked out.

364
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Hongrang, do you know that?

365
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Do you know that?

366
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:05,200
There's a mole in your head.

367
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Yeah.

368
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,200
So how do you know that?

369
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:22,200
How meticulously prepared you are, what your real purpose is, and what the reality is.

370
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,200
It's getting more and more unusual.

371
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Start from the base where the goblin's water boat found him and look for the past.

372
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Be careful not to stand out to the people involved.

373
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Yes, sir.

374
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Eat more.

375
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
You have to kill this cat by bursting its stomach.

376
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,200
If the stomach is empty, the heart is empty.

377
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Even if it's hard, just hold on a little longer.

378
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I've found a way to face it.

379
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Just hold on a few more days here.

380
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
But you really have to be careful.

381
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,200
The people in the gang are all over the place.

382
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Wow, that's crazy.

383
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,200
He's looking for his son and he's looking for him.

384
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Don't worry.

385
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I'll make sure you can go back safely.

386
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Thank you.

387
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,200
When Daegamtaek's son disappeared, there was a body that was with him.

388
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:48,200
There were people disguised as joints who appeared and took out the body and ran away.

389
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Why did they take out the body?

390
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Why?

391
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Did you just try to save him or find out something?

392
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:14,200
If not, do you already know something?

393
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
It's okay.

394
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
It's okay.

395
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
I'm just writing a number.

396
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
I'll take care of it myself.

397
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I'm going to go in.

398
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Did you see everything?

399
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm going to wrap it up and go in.

400
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I don't think you're in the Minsangdan to steal drugs.

401
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I don't know what you're dreaming of, but don't ruin his name.

402
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Don't do anything bad with my name.

403
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,200
But why did you lose it?

404
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,200
And why couldn't you protect Ki-hwan?

405
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
And what did you say?

406
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
What the hell did you do?

407
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I couldn't protect it, I couldn't find it, and if I were real, I wouldn't even recognize it.

408
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
What are you talking about?

409
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I'm not going to do anything.

410
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Give it to me.

411
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Try it on.

412
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
See if it's your baby.

413
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Give it to me.

414
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm you.

415
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm...

416
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Look, you're not.

417
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,200
This won't happen to me.

418
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Everyone's going to kill me.

419
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Even if you bite me to death, I'm not like that.

420
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:18,200
He didn't save his dying heart.

421
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Wow, this Minsangdan is good at everything.

422
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
That's a good thing.

423
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I made it myself.

424
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,200
You're my brother-in-law.

425
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,200
You've been eating a lot since you were a kid.

426
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,200
And you don't like to eat something sticky.

427
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I made sure to eat it like that.

428
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I put it in your mouth.

429
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
I don't think it's there.

430
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
There?

431
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
You're the man?

432
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
You're not even talking.

433
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
You talk too much.

434
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,200
If you call me that, I'm going to kill you.

435
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
How can you do that?

436
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
You've been working so hard for too long.

437
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Can't you feel it?

438
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Is your temper that bad?

439
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,200
What?

440
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Even a grasshopper gets angry when it's grown up.

441
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:12,200
It even hits the thorns.

442
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Do you know what day it is today?

443
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:30,200
It's the day 12 years ago.

444
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,200
How dare you make my son bow?

445
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You're a good girl, but you're making him bow?

446
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
There was no such thing.

447
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,200
It's dirty, dirty, and dirty.

448
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,200
It's the only thing left in Asia.

449
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,200
You tore that thing apart.

450
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:20,200
It's you.

451
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:50,200
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:20,200
I'm sorry.

453
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Mother.

454
00:36:50,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Mother, if you're going to give up there, even if you're going to cross the gate, even if you're scared and stuck, send it back.

455
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm trying to get over it, too.

456
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Even if you're scared and stuck, send it back.

457
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,200
You can't do that.

458
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Hong Rang has to send it here.

459
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Mother, I'm sorry I left you here alone.

460
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Please send my son back to me.

461
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Please.

462
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Oh, my.

463
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Oh, my.

464
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Oh, my.

465
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Those bastards are catching people.

466
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:28,200
So he's going to eat me up and kick me out of the government.

467
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,200
I'll use any means to catch that bastard and kick him out.

468
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Wait a minute.

469
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Who are you?

470
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm here.

471
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Catch him.

472
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Get up.

473
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,200
What's going on here?

474
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:23,200
What's going on?

475
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
What's going on?

476
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
You're the daughter of this house.

477
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
What?

478
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,200
That woman is the daughter of the new president?

479
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Yes.

480
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,200
How can you handle my wife?

481
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,200
What did you do with your hair burned in the night?

482
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,200
And I'm sure it's my wife.

483
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
You heard that, too, right?

484
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I heard it for sure.

485
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,200
If you're in a relationship like that,

486
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,200
you'll be in trouble.

487
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Isn't it a matter of time before the new president gets out of it?

488
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
You.

489
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,200
You watch the most important person of that woman.

490
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Find out where she and Mujirong are going to do business.

491
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Find out if there's a sign or something.

492
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Find out what you can't even do.

493
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Yes, sir.

494
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Is it true that the audience found it?

495
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Did you see the body?

496
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:41,200
I don't know where it went.

497
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
That's a good one.

498
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I made it myself.

499
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:56,200
This is for the Minsang Party.

500
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Sim Jae-hee.

501
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
I'm sorry.

502
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Sim Jae-hee.

504
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Hello.

505
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Give me a room.

506
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Who's coming?

507
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Oh, my God.

508
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
The security officers will be here by the time the sun rises.

509
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Follow them.

510
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I'll take you to Naju.

511
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Take care.

512
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Oh, I...

513
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Actually, I thought of something more.

514
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Something was written on the white ghost's neck.

515
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
There was a letter written on it?

516
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Yes.

517
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:46,200
It was two letters.

518
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:54,200
I don't know how to read the letters, but the first letter was the same as the first one.

519
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I don't know the first letter.

520
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,200
No.

521
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:13,200
I was going to tell you earlier, but I was afraid that the ghost would come and kill me if I knew I saw something.

522
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
I'm sorry.

523
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
It's okay.

524
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Thank you for telling me now.

525
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,200
I'm more grateful.

526
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,200
If it weren't for you, I would have died earlier.

527
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Goodbye.

528
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:03,200
I found someone who can talk.

529
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:33,200
Come on in.

530
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Come on in.

531
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:46,200
I'd like to talk to you.

532
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:56,200
I'm sorry.

533
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Do you know this man?

534
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,200
You told me to get rid of you or you came to get my remaining four.

535
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,200
No, I didn't come to hurt you.

536
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,200
It's not what this man sent.

537
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,200
How do you know this man?

538
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,200
We worked together.

539
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,200
When you were a non-protein?

540
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,200
Or before that?

541
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,200
He's not just a non-protein.

542
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
Then?

543
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,200
He's not a human.

544
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,200
He's a man who will kill, kill, and protect his life.

545
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:06,200
When I cut this arm, I already cut off his life.

546
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,200
No.

547
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,200
No.

548
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:21,200
I'm a non-protein.

549
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Avoid it.

550
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Just avoid it.

551
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,200
Never get in the way of his eyes.

552
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Everything that touches his eyes is torn apart.

553
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:49,200
Did you leave him with that man?

554
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Jaehee!

555
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Why are you here?

556
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Why?

557
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,200
I'm on my way to hear what your identity is.

558
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Wheesu.

559
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,200
You know that and you're holding a knife?

560
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:42,200
This is a pretty vague and desperate answer to a question that hasn't been mixed with a single drop of blood.

561
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,200
You're curious about what's inside.

562
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,200
But, brother.

563
00:48:50,200 --> 00:49:02,200
There's your father coming.

564
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Can I show you this?

565
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Brother, go ahead.

566
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:33,200
I was asking you about the death certificate.

567
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:43,200
I think it would be good for you to go to the grave when the next fire is set.

568
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,200
If you see the work or work of the painter, it will help you raise your eyes.

569
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
Yeah.

570
00:49:52,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Do this.

571
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Don't forget.

572
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:17,200
I saved you.

573
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Don't face him anymore.

574
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
I'll take care of it.

575
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Brother, what's wrong with you all of a sudden?

576
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
Tell me you will.

577
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,200
Please.

578
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Yeah.

579
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:55,200
I didn't ask.

580
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,200
I don't think I'll answer even if I ask.

581
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,200
But I'm sure I saw the murder.

582
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,200
He was writing down the words that start with the Korean alphabet on the floor.

583
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,200
I saw the writing on my neck.

584
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:24,200
The writing that starts with the Korean alphabet.

585
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
What?

586
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Seol-in?

587
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Hey, I'm looking for a guy who doesn't even know if she's a ghost called Seol-in.

588
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,200
There are two letters that start with the Korean alphabet on his neck.

589
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Oh, my God.

590
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,200
I heard something.

591
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,200
There's a guy with a white hair.

592
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,200
The monster was standing with his nails up and started to dig the ground.

593
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,200
I just saw it.

594
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,200
He opened his eyes wide and...

595
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,200
The blood of the white hand was on the grave.

596
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:31,200
After my father saw that, he said he was going to faint if he saw the white hair.

597
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,200
He even gave me white rice.

598
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Really?

599
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Really?

600
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,200
It's not easy to see.

601
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Here in the field.

602
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,200
The children are here.

603
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
The meat is here.

604
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Seodang's kid is here.

605
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,200
Then?

606
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Here.

607
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,200
The children disappear when Seol-in appears.

608
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
The room where Seol-in was seen on the floor.

609
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,200
The baby grave.

610
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
It's a grave with only children buried.

611
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,200
The day Seol-in was seen?

612
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,200
It's raining.

613
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,200
But when we tried to find out, there was no one who saw Seol-in.

614
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,200
How did the rumors suddenly spread?

615
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
What do you think?

616
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,200
How did the people who entered the house run?

617
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Then we just have to wait for it to rain?

618
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
The weather is moist.

619
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,200
I think it'll rain in a few days.

620
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,200
Let's go to the baby grave when it rains.

621
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,200
But we're going to be like ghosts and monsters.

622
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Will we be able to do it?

623
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,200
I'll tell my brother.

624
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,200
What are you going to do with Sangseonbi?

625
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Sangseonbi fights a little.

626
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Something was written on the neck of the white ghost.

627
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,200
It was a drawn-up pair.

628
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:53,200
I saw a person with a white face and white eyes.

629
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Rainbow.

630
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,200
Mom.

631
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Mom.

632
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Let's go.

633
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:20,200
I think I should go first.

634
00:56:40,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Seol-in.

635
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
My nephew.

636
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,200
My nephew.

637
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
My nephew.

638
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,200
No.

639
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,200
My nephew.

640
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Who did this to you?

641
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,200
My nephew, get up.

642
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:26,200
My nephew.

643
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,200
What's wrong with Jae-hee?

644
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Let's go first.

645
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:36,200
I'll take care of it.

646
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,200
Who is it?

647
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Who did this to you?

648
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:55,200
My nephew.

649
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,200
Did you kill your nephew?

650
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Why?

651
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,200
Why?

652
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,200
Because it's over.

653
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,200
What you're thinking about, what you're looking for.

654
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,200
It was the uncle of that poor girl.

655
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,200
But you're going to have a lot of money even if you die.

656
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,200
When your aunt was lucky,

657
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,200
When I was lucky, the money I got was 500.

658
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,200
I killed your daughter and took the money.

659
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:35,200
I took the money and tried to find you.

660
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
How do you kill me?

661
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,200
First, reveal the face of the woman and the man.

662
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,200
No.

663
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Then you don't know if the god of death is my daughter.

664
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,200
How do you step on it and kill it?

665
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Try it.

666
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:07,200
Try it, you dirty bastard.

667
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:30,200
You bastard.

668
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,200
How dare you?

669
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:46,200
My sister.

670
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:18,200
No, do you still know me?

671
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:27,200
I'm hoping for tomorrow with an unforgivable heart.

672
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Do you know that I'm re-sinking my hope that I can't come back?

673
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:45,200
If you like the sad disaster, I'll run all night.

674
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,200
The wind blows.

675
01:00:50,200 --> 01:01:03,200
I'm waiting for the day when the flowers bloom again.

676
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:13,200
Do you know that I can lose my life?

677
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:22,200
It would be nice if I could call it fate.

678
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:29,200
A lonely season without even a wave of sadness.

679
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,200
Did you leave me?

680
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,200
I don't need a sigh.

681
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,200
If it's a life that can't rest.

682
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:49,200
I'm waiting for the day when the flowers bloom again.

683
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Do you know that I can lose my life?

684
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:08,200
I'm waiting for the day when the flowers bloom again.

685
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:17,200
If I wet the sun with my hands and melt all my longing.

686
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,200
Even if the moon that falls over shines on me.

687
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,200
This heart that doesn't cool down.

688
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:35,200
Even if I stay up all night, I can't break up.

689
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:46,200
Even if I break up, I can't break up easily.

690
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:51,200
The spring breeze blows.

691
01:02:51,200 --> 01:03:14,280
Beyond the

692
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,280
Even if the moon that falls over shines on me.

693
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,280
This heart that doesn't cool down.

694
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:57,280
I'm waiting for the day when the flowers bloom again.

695
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:10,280
Do you know that I can lose my life?

696
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:22,280
I'm waiting for the day when the flowers bloom again.

697
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:33,280
Even if I wet the sun with my hands and melt all my longing.

698
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:43,280
I'm waiting for the day when the flowers bloom again.

699
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:13,280
Thank you for watching.
