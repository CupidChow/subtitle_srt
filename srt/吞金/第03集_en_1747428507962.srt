1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
T AH YEON

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Did you dare

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to do it casually?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You have to do what I told you

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
You're so stupid.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,420
You think I'd come alone?

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,200
Get up.

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,860
Stay still.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,780
Hey.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let go of me.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let go of me.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You bitch.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's all because of you.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's all because of you.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's all because of you.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's all because of you.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Go, go.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't come.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to push you.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to throw you.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Change it.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell me.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll pay you much more to change that life and this life.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you talking about?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm going to be a

29
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,000
I need some money, too.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't have any money.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't hurt yourself.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you okay?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
As you know, it's a precious body.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You stupid bastard.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's wrong with you?

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's wrong with you?

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's always like that.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's been bleeding once, and it's been bleeding again.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's been deep.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't have any completely healed wounds.

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hold on to this clothes that you don't like.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You don't like this, either.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, then don't touch it.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you doing?

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let go.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let go.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Stay still.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Before she throws it away.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let go.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let go.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I said let go.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey!

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Jaehee!

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Jaehee!

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I found it.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What?

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's wrong with you?

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My brother...

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Say nothing.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Nohwi.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If I get in trouble, no one will let you do it.

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What are you doing?

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let go.

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Stay still.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Before she throws it away.

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's as expected.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Jo Bang-soori even made a false rumor to lure him.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now we can't catch the real thing about the murder that's going to happen at the entrance.

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm dead because I saw the murder.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There's no other clue.

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There's no other clue.

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:11,180
If we catch the

75
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,180
You and I are trying to make someone's life difficult.

76
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Let's start over from the beginning.

77
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:28,180
As I expected before, if Hwang Wooyoung is with my father in the Minsang Group,

78
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:38,180
I have to check it from him.

79
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,180
Somehow it looks like it has an interesting SR deferense.

80
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,180
The guy in red employ a face mask in person.

81
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,940
It looks like they all got injured

83
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,780
and ran away after checking the traces.

84
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,420
Did you just

85
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,980
let Hwi-soo to live at sea or something?

86
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,500
I didn't x-ray to see

87
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:42,540
how Xe Hang Un's

88
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:49,540
true existence is.

89
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,340
It struck a ton of death when

90
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,660
Gosh.

91
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,840
Why is he so rustling?

92
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,340
How about we tap into the danger.

93
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
Will we try to drive away each other?

94
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Hey, you! What are you doing?

95
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Hey, where are my parents?

96
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Are you home alone?

97
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Then, will you go with me?

98
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Hey, you!

99
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Boss, Han Pyeongdae's mother is back.

100
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
How can she be here?

101
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
She was already here the other day, so she's already here.

102
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Let's go. I need to send her a message right away.

103
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Make Hong-nam prepare.

104
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Yes, sir.

105
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:59,340
The last time I was here, Han Pyeongdae was a hard worker.

106
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,340
He even helped me with the horse-drawn carriage.

107
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
You must never forget that favor.

108
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Yes, sir. I'll be on my way to you.

109
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Yes, you should.

110
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,340
But why are you so serious about this?

111
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,340
You say there's no place like this to draw.

112
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,340
I don't know the face of the painter, but I know how to draw.

113
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,340
If it's the picture he drew, I can see it with one eye.

114
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,340
The picture is in the picture.

115
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,340
I'll go to the picture.

116
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,340
I'll go to the picture.

117
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,340
I'll go to the picture.

118
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
I'll go to the picture.

119
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,340
I'll go to the picture.

120
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,340
I'll go to the picture.

121
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,340
I'll go to the picture.

122
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,340
I'll go to the picture.

123
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,340
I'll go to the picture.

124
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,340
I'll go to the picture.

125
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,340
I'll go to the picture.

126
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,340
I'll go to the picture.

127
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,340
I'll go to the picture.

128
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Is it you?

129
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,340
It's you.

130
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,340
You're the one with no honor.

131
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
You're the same as before.

132
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,340
Your aunt took your nephew away.

133
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,340
The energy that you release is from your bed.

134
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,340
I greet Your Highness the Great.

135
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,340
I greet Your Highness the Great.

136
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,340
How deep was the regret after losing this precious thing?

137
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,340
It's late, but I'm glad to see you.

138
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,340
It's the grace of Your Highness the Great.

139
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,340
It's the grace of Your Highness the Great.

140
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
That's right.

141
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
It's not a firework.

142
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
It wasn't a left-hander.

143
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,340
The picture is different.

144
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,340
The kid who took me from Gwangtong Bridge is doing well there.

145
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

146
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

147
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

148
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

149
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

150
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

151
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,340
If I were a royal in front of the fire, I would have been complicated.

152
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
I know.

153
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,340
You walk first.

154
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm a little disappointed, too.

155
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,340
How was your stay in the neighborhood?

156
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Did you have any trouble?

157
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Not at all.

158
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,340
I think I'm a useless thing.

159
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
How can you say that?

160
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,340
More than that, I was in Gwangtong Bridge on my way here.

161
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Duryong.

162
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,340
His reputation was very low.

163
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,340
It's not a reputation. It's a fief.

164
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,340
What about the fief?

165
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,340
He said he lived in the world of wine and alcohol on a poor day.

166
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,340
He said he enjoyed the dead animals' dead bodies.

167
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:50,340
But he even said that even the body of a person is a model.

168
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,340
But he said he had a strange ability in his picture.

169
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,340
He said he would save the dead and kill the living.

170
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm scared.

171
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,340
I'll draw you a picture of me escaping.

172
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:53,920
Because of his ridiculous

173
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,340
You're not even aware of the subject and you're ruining the art.

174
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
What should I do?

175
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
What should I do?

176
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
What?

177
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
I'll just leave it.

178
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,340
I'm building my own business.

179
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,340
No matter how much I try to imitate,

180
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,340
I won't be able to make a single move.

181
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,340
No one can capture a good adult.

182
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
I'm going to go.

183
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm sick of walking slowly.

184
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,340
Why are you doing this on that day?

185
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Who are you talking about?

186
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,340
Sim Jae-hee, a colleague of Minsangdan.

187
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Why are you stepping behind me?

188
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
You stepped behind me, too.

189
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
That's why I could come there that day.

190
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
That's why you're so fine.

191
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Why did you save me?

192
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
What?

193
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,340
You're going to buy my heart and make me believe you're real?

194
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Yeah.

195
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,340
It's not worth it.

196
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,340
I have something for you.

197
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
What?

198
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:28,340
To me?

199
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
This.

200
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Oh, no.

201
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
What are you doing?

202
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Is this it?

203
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,340
No, it's this.

204
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
This?

205
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,340
No, this!

206
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
Why?

207
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
You don't like it?

208
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Are you scared?

209
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,340
You're a human being, and you're scared of bugs?

210
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Oh, my God.

211
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,340
Not this desert?

212
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,340
No, bite me.

213
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
What's so scary about it?

214
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
Don't do that.

215
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Don't come.

216
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
How about raising it?

217
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:34,340
What do you get if you give it honey?

218
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Mom.

219
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:52,340
Mom.

220
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
What are you doing?

221
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Come on in.

222
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
It's late to say hello.

223
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,340
What's the matter with a half-baked cow like me?

224
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,340
You're looking for a job.

225
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,340
I heard that you and Hong-ran went to Dongmun-su when you were young.

226
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
That's enough.

227
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm a year younger than you, so I've been eating together since I was a baby.

228
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,340
I've been stuck together for a day without walking.

229
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
I'm sick of it.

230
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,340
I know what you mean.

231
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,340
I didn't like Hong-ran.

232
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
It's not good.

233
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,340
I hate to see him get too excited about it.

234
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,340
Do you know any features and skills of Hong-rang that you know?

235
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,340
He?

236
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,340
He's just...

237
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,340
He's gentle and scared.

238
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
But why all of a sudden?

239
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Actually, I'm still suspicious of his intentions.

240
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Then it could be a fake Hong-rang sitting in the back.

241
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,340
I heard that all the members of the committee looked into it and even went to the vote.

242
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,340
But it's weird.

243
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,340
I remember it all when I was young.

244
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
And Jae-hee.

245
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
You said it wasn't Jae-hee.

246
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,340
He can't recognize his own name.

247
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,340
He doesn't know anything about Hong-rang.

248
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Why didn't I think of that?

249
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,340
It's so gross.

250
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Did you think of something?

251
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Taeyong, Hong-rang's birthday is coming up soon.

252
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,340
I'm going to gather my relatives and have a party.

253
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,340
There's a way.

254
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:41,340
There's a way to find out if he's fake or real.

255
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:51,340
Hong-rang.

256
00:24:51,340 --> 00:25:01,340
Can you see me?

257
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,340
Can you see me?

258
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:14,340
I can see you.

259
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Hong-rang.

260
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Jae-hee.

261
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,340
Are you still uncomfortable with this?

262
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,340
It's not because of my brother.

263
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:30,340
I'm just a little dizzy.

264
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,340
There's nothing more to be dizzy about.

265
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:40,340
Soon, in front of everyone, the fact that he's fake will be revealed.

266
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:50,340
Huh?

267
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:20,340
I'm sorry.

268
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:50,340
I'm sorry.

269
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Hey, Bong Nam-ah!

270
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
You're Hong-rang, right?

271
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,340
It's me, Hong Sik-hee.

272
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:26,340
You're a coward.

273
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,340
I don't know if I can remember it yet.

274
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I'm not sure if I'm real.

275
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Nice to meet you.

276
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:44,340
Hey, you and I were never together.

277
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Jae-hee!

278
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,340
Are you here?

279
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
Oh, my.

280
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
We can't recognize this.

281
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Why did you get so pretty?

282
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Wait a minute.

283
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
I'm getting a lot of women these days.

284
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,340
You're crazy about me.

285
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
Oh, my.

286
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,340
You're still the same.

287
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,340
I like the rough girl more.

288
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,340
Let's see.

289
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,340
We're from the same family.

290
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,340
I'm not going to eat this.

291
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:44,340
You can't do it.

292
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,340
Hey.

293
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Me.

294
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Get in.

295
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:07,340
It's noisy.

296
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Hey, you've changed a lot.

297
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
I'm not this rough.

298
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
It's weird.

299
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Even if it's a few years,

300
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:26,340
I wonder if my natural growth has changed.

301
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,340
You must have had a hard time.

302
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:39,340
I'm going to eat something else.

303
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Congratulations.

304
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Congratulations.

305
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Congratulations.

306
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,340
Congratulations.

307
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Congratulations.

308
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Congratulations.

309
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Please cheer up.

310
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:24,340
This is General Manager Kyung-hwa.

311
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
I'm so happy.

312
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:32,340
You prepared such a precious gift.

313
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,180
It seems that the meaning of the

314
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,340
heroes has been combined.

315
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,340
But I think the great heroine

316
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:52,340
didn't have a great time.

317
00:31:52,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Is that why?

318
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm sorry.

319
00:32:52,340 --> 00:33:02,340
I'm sorry.

320
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:12,340
It's not a strange stationery store or a jewelry store.

321
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:21,340
I think I'm used to that stuff.

322
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Which beast did you make this from?

323
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
It's made from the blacksmith's clothes.

324
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,340
You're a precious thing.

325
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Then let's go somewhere.

326
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:50,340
I'm sorry.

327
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:16,340
I need to give you some advice.

328
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,340
I think I should be my master.

329
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
I'll have to see if you'll be the master.

330
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,340
The blacksmith's horns are quite thick, so it's not easy to tame them.

331
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:32,340
What are you doing now?

332
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:42,340
Hurry up and give me the award.

333
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:12,340
I'm sorry.

334
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:22,340
I'm sorry.

335
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Here, have a drink.

336
00:35:52,340 --> 00:36:02,340
This is pomegranate juice.

337
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,340
What if you drink this?

338
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,340
Why are you so excited?

339
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm in trouble.

340
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Please call the hospital.

341
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,340
What are you talking about?

342
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:21,340
I was playing with the blacksmith and stole this pomegranate juice.

343
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:32,340
But as soon as I took a sip, I felt a lump on my neck and almost died.

344
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:42,340
I was lying to you that I was afraid I'd be in trouble if I found out I drank it.

345
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Don't you remember?

346
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Didn't you say the doctors said you drank something like a smudged?

347
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,340
I remember.

348
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
Have you ever seen a tiger eat pomegranate?

349
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
Have you ever seen it?

350
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
Have you ever seen a wolf?

351
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
I don't think so.

352
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
I almost died.

353
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Have you ever seen a tiger eat pomegranate?

354
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Have you ever heard of it?

355
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:22,340
What is it?

356
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,340
What should I do?

357
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,340
I drank two glasses.

358
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,340
How can I not feel anything?

359
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:42,340
If it's a real wolf, I can't hate it.

360
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:12,340
I'm going to die.

361
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:42,340
I'm going to kill my father.

362
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
Bring me a revenge tree.

363
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,340
I'm going to give her a new instrument.

364
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
Tell me.

365
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:57,340
What are you doing?

366
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Yes.

367
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,340
Why?

368
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:08,340
No one believed it was fake.

369
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:20,340
You crazy.

370
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
Madam.

371
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Move.

372
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
Move.

373
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Move.

374
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:35,340
It's not a crime.

375
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:44,340
I did it.

376
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
You?

377
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:52,340
I did it.

378
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,340
I was supposed to leave, but I was too drunk.

379
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,340
But I think I didn't do enough, so I changed it to pomegranate juice.

380
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
No, madam.

381
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
It's me.

382
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,340
I did it.

383
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Really?

384
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
I see.

385
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Okay, then.

386
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:21,340
I'll show you what happens when you take over the house later.

387
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:31,340
No.

388
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,340
Son.

389
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,340
I don't want to.

390
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,340
What?

391
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:08,340
I feel strange to see my mother like this.

392
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Are you okay?

393
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Yes.

394
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Don't worry.

395
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,340
I knew you'd be better off there.

396
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:51,340
It'll be better sooner than that.

397
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,340
So please forgive me.

398
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:06,340
It's good to get over the house-wrecking prank on your birthday.

399
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Go back to your room.

400
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:36,340
I'm sorry.

401
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:14,340
No, it can't be.

402
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:19,340
I knew it first and I wrote the letter.

403
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,340
You wrote the letter, didn't you?

404
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,340
What?

405
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,340
If Hong Rang had such a disease, I wouldn't have known.

406
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:40,340
I'm not sure, but I think I had a baby with Hong Rang when I was a kid.

407
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,340
If I'm right, it's fake.

408
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:50,340
If I remember correctly and Hong Sik is right,

409
00:43:50,340 --> 00:44:00,340
I almost hurt Hong Rang.

410
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:30,340
The gangsters are heading for Hong Rang.

411
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,340
If this continues,

412
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:44,340
I think the location of the young master will be in danger.

413
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:54,340
I'll be right there.

414
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:00,340
Get the goods ready in the signal room.

415
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:10,340
Yes.

416
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,340
Oh, it's a half.

417
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,340
Let's share.

418
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Just half.

419
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:32,340
Just half?

420
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:38,340
Oh, my.

421
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,340
I got it.

422
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,340
Oh, my.

423
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,340
Why did you do that?

424
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,340
Hurry up and throw it on the roof.

425
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,340
That's what I'm doing.

426
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,340
No, give it to me.

427
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,340
Give it to me.

428
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,340
Hurry up.

429
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,340
It's precious.

430
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,340
What's so precious about it?

431
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,340
You don't know?

432
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
There was a man in the past.

433
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,340
He cut his nails and threw them away.

434
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,340
Then I saw him with his nails.

435
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,340
He had the same tattoo as that man.

436
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,340
He didn't even know who his wife was.

437
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
I wish you were two.

438
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,340
One is for my mother and one is for me.

439
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,340
But if you don't understand,

440
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:42,340
What am I supposed to do if you don't even know me?

441
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:50,340
Oh Myung.

442
00:46:50,340 --> 00:47:00,340
I can't breathe.

443
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,340
I don't like what's in front of you.

444
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,340
I'm here.

445
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,340
You're there.

446
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Have a drink.

447
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,340
You drink?

448
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:24,340
Are you crazy?

449
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:34,340
I guess you're worried about me.

450
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,340
Are you upset?

451
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,340
I'm upset.

452
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,340
If I didn't know it would be out of the question,

453
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,340
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

454
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,340
I'm sorry.

455
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,340
I'm sorry.

456
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,340
I'm upset.

457
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,340
If I didn't know it would be out of the question,

458
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,340
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

459
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,340
It's not me, is it?

460
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,340
To you.

461
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,340
It's okay.

462
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:14,340
I didn't try to be out of your way.

463
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:20,340
It's a little funny and ridiculous to admit.

464
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,340
That's okay, too.

465
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,340
I'm used to it.

466
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:32,340
Trying to be something.

467
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,340
Trying to be something.

468
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,340
Why?

469
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Everyone has been something since they were born.

470
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,340
Someone's son.

471
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,340
Someone's child.

472
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
Or someone's relative or colleague.

473
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,340
Even if it's a reason.

474
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,340
But I wasn't anything.

475
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,340
I was always alone.

476
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,340
As if I had fallen.

477
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,340
That's why I tried.

478
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,340
I tried to be someone's colleague.

479
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,340
I tried to be someone's sword.

480
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:14,340
So I became someone's enemy.

481
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,340
I've lived like that.

482
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,340
Suddenly I became someone's son.

483
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,340
That's also the greats of the Minsangdan.

484
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:28,340
That greats of someone.

485
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,340
So I thought I'd be someone's out of control.

486
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:40,340
I guess I wanted you to be.

487
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,340
I'll try harder.

488
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:50,340
Does it hurt a lot even now?

489
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,340
No.

490
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,340
It's okay.

491
00:49:54,340 --> 00:50:00,340
You said you didn't have any complete wounds.

492
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,340
I hope you don't get hurt anymore.

493
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,340
Whether you're real or not.

494
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:20,340
I hope it doesn't hurt anymore.

495
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:40,340
I hope it doesn't hurt anymore.

496
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:46,340
I hope it doesn't hurt anymore.

497
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:52,340
You were worried a lot.

498
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,340
But...

499
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:02,340
How did you know that you had a heart attack?

500
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:06,340
There will be no more situations like today.

501
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:20,340
You can't be caught being fake until it's done.

502
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:46,340
I'm sorry.

503
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:56,340
I'll be careful not to let Hwa Young get hurt.

504
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:26,340
I'm sorry.

505
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:56,340
I'm sorry.

506
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:06,340
I'm sorry.

507
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:16,340
I'm sorry.

508
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:26,340
I'm sorry.

509
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:36,340
I'm sorry.

510
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:46,340
I'm sorry.

511
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:56,340
I'm sorry.

512
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:06,340
I'm sorry.

513
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:16,340
I'm sorry.

514
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:46,340
I'm sorry.

515
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:16,340
I'm sorry.

516
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:26,340
I'm sorry.

517
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:36,340
I'm sorry.

518
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:06,340
I'm sorry.

519
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:36,340
I'm sorry.

520
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:06,340
I'm sorry.

521
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:36,340
I'm sorry.

522
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:06,340
I'm sorry.

523
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:36,340
I'm sorry.

524
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:06,340
I'm sorry.

525
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:36,340
I'm sorry.
