1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,631
(Kotaro) On the head of a dead Fuso ⸺

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,133
There are two wounds

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:13,388
(Kotaro) The first shot was lifted up the candlestick of the murder weapon with both hands and swing it down.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,852
The second shot was my uncle holding the same weapon and punching me from the side.

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,646
Why did your uncle hit the second shot?

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,232
That's because I won't make you a murderer

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,735
Let's go to the police together

8
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,570
(Leo) Thank you

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,697
(Kotaro) It's possible to hide the truth⸺

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,198
I don't think it's a family happiness

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,825
(Nerla) I can think of it!

12
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,328
Protecting Leo was the truth behind my family!

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,956
If this happens...

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,625
I would have preferred to be the culprit

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,419
Why?

16
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:49,340
Met you, everything's broken

17
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,470
Please divorce

18
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,975
(Kotaro) Suzuki Kou is ⸺

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,770
He was arrested as the perpetrator of the murder of Fuse Yuto

20
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,022
...But that crime is

21
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:08,943
With Leo's appearance, he switched from murder to inpi's crime.

22
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,946
Regarding the crime of damage to the body ⸺

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,450
The statute of limitations has already been reached and it has been notified

24
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,243
(Prosecutor) Defendant in this case

25
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,413
He appeared as a so-called scapegoat

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,541
Repeated false statements disrupted the investigation.

27
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,586
Knowing that the perpetrator is his own nephew ⸺

28
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,839
He led the destruction of evidence of a deadly weapon.

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,385
Suitable for serious cases of murder...

30
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,640
(Hayashi) What motive did the accused commit this crime?

31
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,936
I thought about the future of my nephew, who was 11 years old at the time.

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,564
In other words, it is due to parental feelings

33
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,652
Be prepared to be charged with a serious crime

34
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:56,950
Extensive circumstances are recognized in the feelings of the accused who committed the crime.

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,496
(Judge) Defendant Is there anything you would like to talk about?

36
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,082
(Thoughts)

37
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,627
(Judge) Defendants must return to the defendant's seat

38
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,796
(Secretary) Please stand up

39
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,607
(The sound of the door closing)

40
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,786
(Kotaro) It's been a month since me and Nerla divorced

41
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,460
(Kotaro) 15 years ago

42
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,214
Leo, who fatally injured Fuse Yuto in an attempt to save Nerla

43
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,675
Although he was questioned by the police ⸺

44
00:02:55,758 --> 00:03:01,139
He was not charged with criminal law, protected by Article 41 of the Criminal Code.

45
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,767
But as the real culprit of the incident

46
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,937
Appeared by some malicious netizens

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,191
I had to quit being an idol stylist

48
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,485
I'm leaving the Suzuki family's apartment now

49
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,821
Apparently he's working part-time in delivery

50
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,783
Speaking of me...

51
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,913
"The cursed family of lawyer Harada Kotaro."

52
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,205
 Article has been spread

53
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,791
Television return has completely disappeared

54
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,045
Nerla's father also comes from this article

55
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,465
One new job plan has disappeared

56
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,636
(Aucksonia) This is Fuse Yuto's "Challenging Time"

57
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,182
(Kotaro) On the other hand, ironically, the work of Fuse, who was murdered ⸺

58
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,353
The value of the work has risen after the attention of the wealthy Chinese people

59
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,479
6.2 million yen

60
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,397
(Kotaro) The Suzuki family has been increasingly criticized.

61
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,899
(The sound of the wood shavings)

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,568
-(Usui/Imaizumi) Thank you for your hard work-(Kotaro)

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,196
(Usui) Did you see the wife who broke up with you today?

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,199
He left without even trying to look at me

65
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,825
(Usui) I'm angry

66
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,202
Haha...

67
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,330
(Usui) He protected me so much and found out the real culprit

68
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,750
What kind of thought do you think you've been relieved of the incident?

69
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,463
That house is a special house so I don't know what happens.

70
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,090
This too is a lawyer

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,093
The only way to reveal the truth was

72
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,427
Well, it's no choice

73
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,305
(Imaizumi) There are so many things in the world

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,391
That's why I need a lawyer

75
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,227
Oh... you've grown

76
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,648
He was a highly eye-catching lawyer, but now he's gone down to us.

77
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,941
That's great

78
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,276
I had a lot of things too, so

79
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,071
(Mobile phone ringtone) (Kotaro) Yes?

80
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,616
(Mobile phone ringtone)

81
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,411
yes

82
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,204
Ah, hello

83
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,331
Huh?

84
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,833
I'm below! ?

85
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,793
Ah, that's fine but...

86
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,713
Ah...please

87
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,839
(Usui) What? Who is it?

88
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,215
Producer of "Newshop"

89
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,800
Ah that sexy person

90
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,509
ah…

91
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,552
Is it finally time to return?

92
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,095
No no no

93
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,099
No no no

94
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,813
(Chika) Actually, I came here with a request

95
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,649
Huh... what is it?

96
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,402
Commentator for "Newshop"

97
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,238
I want to ask

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,742
To the Otaku Imaizumi Sensei

99
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,784
Heh?

100
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,371
The other day I saw you here

101
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,125
I thought it was beautiful

102
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,627
Father of the Supreme Court

103
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,589
The mother of the head of the Tokyo High School Public Prosecutors' Examination Trial Department

104
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,674
The lawyer's brother

105
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,676
Youngest child, Imaizumi Sensei

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,513
I think the spectacular family will be delighted by viewers too.

107
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,015
Haa...

108
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,477
The eyes are sharp and the camera face is good too.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,730
Would you like to receive your permission to perform?

110
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,777
Please wait a moment

111
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,446
- (Kotaro) Imaizumi-kun- (Imaizumi) Yes

112
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,198
(Kotaro) The producer tells me...

113
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,616
(Chika) Imaizumi Sensei

114
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,659
This is Kurasawa from "Newshop"

115
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,744
It's Imaizumi

116
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,079
- (Kotaro) Listen to the story - (Imaizumi) Yes

117
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,872
(Chika) Ah, come on here

118
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,626
(Usui) What's wrong?

119
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm a past person...

120
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,133
(Nerla) Prosecutor's argument was strict and painful

121
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,260
(Kan) I see...

122
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,223
(Nerla) Compared to that, Ko-chan's lawyer is ⸺

123
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,766
It wasn't impressive

124
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,856
(Hiroshi) It's quite influenced by the lawyer's skill.

125
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,110
(Nerla) Yes, I thought so today too

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,821
(Hiroshi) Whatever thought might say...

127
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,949
I think I should have asked Kotaro after all.

128
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,410
Don't talk about that person anymore

129
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,622
He was a good husband though

130
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,375
There will be a probation

131
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,044
Then Ko-chan will be back here too

132
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,507
Thinking will not live here anymore

133
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,300
Why?

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,512
I'll come and pick up my luggage...

135
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,808
I don't know what's going on

136
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,143
(Nerla) That's not...

137
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm the only one who's dad and me

138
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:23,317
If Leo and his thoughts don't come back, I'll lend him the first and third floors to others.

139
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,696
Since it's an accident property, you can only get cheap rent.

140
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,323
There wasn't a murder here

141
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,449
There's no problem

142
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,035
About Leo and Ko-chan ⸺

143
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,205
All photos of this apartment building have also been spread.

144
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,957
(Hiroshi) I see...

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,210
Is Leo okay?

146
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,589
(Nerra) Like in the past ⸺

147
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,841
Everyone wants to live here

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,219
Then what would the world say?

149
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,597
We can work together to stand up

150
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,475
Times are passing

151
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,854
Everyone lost all sorts of things in this incident ⸺

152
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,399
That's why the next one can open

153
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,280
What will Nerla do about his work now?

154
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,449
That's strange though ⸺

155
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,619
Tokyo Museum of Culture and Culture has received a request for restoration.

156
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,829
Look, look! Isn't it good?

157
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,833
It's really strange, but the museum that asked me to do it ⸺

158
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:25,254
I know my circumstances and I know my achievements in Italy.

159
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,132
He said, "That's fine, please."

160
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,884
(Hiroshi) Isn't that good?

161
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,429
Nerula had a re-departure waiting

162
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,473
It was good It was good

163
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,852
It's been a while since I haven't repaired it

164
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm not sure if my skills will be recognized...

165
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,859
Go the path you want

166
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,070
(Nerra) Yes

167
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,366
"Madness is like a jealous rope."

168
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,924
(Tsubasa) Bonsoir!

169
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,344
(Kotaro) Thank you so much for this time

170
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,013
(Tsubsa) I don't want to watch it, people

171
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,139
(Kotaro) Ah...

172
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,934
Sorry for keeping me waiting

173
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,769
The client talks for a long time

174
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,771
Ah, I'm thirsty

175
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,897
Please champagne

176
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,023
I've already ordered it

177
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
(Tsubasa) As expected!

178
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,235
(Garcon) Excuse me

179
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,405
It's Saint-Couture des Neun's 2012

180
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,245
Thank you so much for the Tokyo Museum of Culture and Culture

181
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,538
I'm so grateful

182
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,416
I really think people are good too

183
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,835
For your ex-wife

184
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,423
Bow your head to the museum where you are an advisory lawyer and talk about the situation.

185
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,591
It's praised in Italy and spoke

186
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm going to make you sign

187
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,678
Cheers to your skill

188
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,346
(Tsubasa) Cheers!

189
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,311
(Kotaro) Oh...

190
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,354
(Tsubsa) Haa!

191
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,690
delicious

192
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,194
That's it...

193
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,487
(Kotaro) Yes?

194
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,532
If you like me so much that you'll worry after breaking up ⸺

195
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,117
Why did you get divorced so easily?

196
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,121
He's a skilled lawyer so he could have held back at all.

197
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,831
(Kotaro) Hmm...

198
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,044
(Kotaro) It's not like I didn't stick either

199
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,173
Please divorce

200
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,680
Huh? Huh?

201
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,605
Haa...

202
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,275
(Kotaro) Good morning!

203
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,401
(Nerla) Good morning

204
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,237
(Kotaro) Wow, you made it for me!

205
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,990
(Nerla) If I eat this, I'll go to the ward office to get my divorce papers.

206
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:58,699
Huh?

207
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,742
I'll eat it first

208
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,327
Slowly... Slowly... Wait

209
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,038
Is there anything I can do about that feeling?

210
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,914
Not going to

211
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,207
Ah...

212
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,583
Even if you think differently⸺

213
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,585
I think we can live together

214
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,836
That's right

215
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,046
(Kotaro) Yes

216
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,423
But I can't stand in this regard

217
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,884
So you don't have to cuddle anymore

218
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,804
But it's only one night to come to a conclusion

219
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,138
Don't you think it's too early?

220
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,139
I don't think so

221
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,475
(Kotaro) Hmm...

222
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,812
Kotaro can't work unless he eats something.

223
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,939
What if you wash your face?

224
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,399
(Kotaro) Yes...

225
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,858
(Kotaro) Nnn!

226
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,030
(Kotaro) Good luck Kotaro

227
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,333
(Kotaro)

228
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,189
After all, I don't want to divorce

229
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,445
I want to be with you

230
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,622
Ah, it's tasty

231
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,209
Instant... Pickled

232
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,420
Ke... Did you pickle it this morning?

233
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,379
yes

234
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,589
Oh...

235
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,217
The egg fried noodles are also pretty good for me

236
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,135
Woooo...

237
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,262
(Kotaro) I laughed!

238
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,645
(Kotaro) It's tasty!

239
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,607
Ah, it contains eels, isn't it?

240
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,108
Huh... Right?

241
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,196
- (Kotaro) Ah, eel? - (Nerra) Eel

242
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,824
Already! It's tasty, very

243
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,867
it was good

244
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,452
So you won't get divorced, right?

245
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,328
I'll do it

246
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,497
(Kotaro) Regarding Nerula ⸺

247
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,876
His skills he has refined as a lawyer were not at all applicable.

248
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,461
(Tsubasa) That's...

249
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,505
About me⸺

250
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,965
Why not hire Harada Kotaro Law Firm?

251
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,674
Huh?

252
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,928
The current office manager doesn't match up.

253
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,429
I don't think it suits me either

254
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,972
I won't say "married" anymore

255
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,932
Of course

256
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,017
That's it...

257
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,145
Today is a thank you dinner party, right?

258
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,816
Oh, I am so grateful for that matter

259
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,526
It's fine though

260
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,985
The next red...

261
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,570
Romanee Conti?

262
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,280
(Kotaro) La Tash from the next field

263
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,324
(Tsubasa) Hehe... It's fine to have it next to me, it's great!

264
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,242
(Kotaro) I've already asked

265
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,284
Wow!

266
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,369
Hehe...

267
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,996
We understand this much

268
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,249
Don't you think that even at work, you can do well with a simplicity?

269
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,876
Haha... I'll think about it

270
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,628
(Tsubasa) Yes

271
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,263
Haa...

272
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,560
Woo...

273
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,079
Ah...

274
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,205
Ah...

275
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,666
Haa...

276
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,892
Haa...

277
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,781
footsteps)

278
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,366
- (Repairman) Thank you for your hard work - (Chief Curator) Thank you for your hard work

279
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,784
(Repairman) Thank you for your hard work

280
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,328
(Chief Curator) This is done soon too

281
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,454
(Nerla) Ha...

282
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,999
If you need to continue repairing or restoring it ⸺

283
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,377
I'll ask you so please

284
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,878
thank you

285
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,881
Do your best a little more

286
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,341
(Nerla) Yes

287
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,425
(Chief Curator) Please

288
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,718
(Repairman) Please

289
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,228
(Ringtone)

290
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,146
Ah, what if?

291
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,067
The recruitment process started today...

292
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,612
Yes it is

293
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,033
yes

294
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,121
(Judge) Defendant goes ahead

295
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:51,719
(Judge) "The defendant of the main sentence will be sentenced to custody for October."

296
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:02,396
"The execution of that sentence will be suspended for three years from the date this trial is finalized."

297
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:09,570
Now, what exactly is the correct thing to do now?

298
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,655
Think again ⸺

299
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,159
I hope you will live sincerely

300
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,746
yes

301
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,003
(Judge) Now, I will close this

302
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,422
(Secretary) Please stand up

303
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,881
(Door opening and closing sound)

304
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,382
footsteps)

305
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,638
(Kotaro) Ah... Did Nerla get up first?

306
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,893
(Kurokawa) No, I think I was there until the end

307
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,608
Apparently he got divorced

308
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,822
It seems that everything went smoothly.

309
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,911
In this case, the Otaku Criminal Director approaches the favourite of the Police Commissioner Race.

310
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,746
Security chief has been demoted

311
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,041
You're perfect for being in first class

312
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,086
It's perfect though...

313
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,838
It's boring

314
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,800
It's the one that's vain

315
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,805
That's how life is

316
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,518
It may be futile but ⸺

317
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,770
If you're going to be even better, then

318
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,147
well

319
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,570
(Caster) In a murder case 15 years ago

320
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
To the man who appeared in place of his nephew⸺

321
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,115
 Convicted

322
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,202
The Tokyo District Court today states defendant Suzuki Kou⸺

323
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,455
He was sentenced to 10 months and suspended for three years.

324
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,957
(Imaizumi/Usui) Welcome back

325
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,459
(Caster) Meanwhile, it was held today⸺

326
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,336
Myers Best auction

327
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,215
The work of painter Fuse Yuto, who was the victim of this incident, is

328
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,759
It reached a high of 10 million yen

329
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,806
Fuse's works have recently become popular among foreign enthusiasts...

330
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,932
What is it? this

331
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,851
There are people who like things

332
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,768
(Sound of TV silence)

333
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,855
Van Gogh was praised after he died.

334
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,440
I don't know this guy either

335
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,109
It doesn't feel right

336
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:18,550
(Mobile phone ringtone)

337
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,510
yes

338
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,679
(Hi) Nerla doesn't come back for the second day

339
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,597
What! ?

340
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,890
Have you gone there?

341
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,642
I haven't come

342
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,143
Have you tried calling?

343
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,895
Does not respond to mobile phones

344
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,439
(Furu) It seems the power supply hasn't been turned off

345
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm heading over there now

346
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,368
(Kotaro) Nerla is missing

347
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,454
It appears he just disappeared from the courtroom.

348
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,289
From lunchtime the night before to this morning ⸺

349
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,625
Could you please check if there were any unidentified accidents?

350
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,960
Understood

351
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,879
First, we will track the steps from the Tokyo District Court.

352
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,657
(The sound of the door opening)

353
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,035
Sorry for coming

354
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,748
(Kotaro) Ah...

355
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,548
(Kotaro) Um... I contacted the police⸺

356
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,552
There are no traffic accidents or cases where the victim is unknown.

357
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,851
It's likely that he left with will

358
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,896
I was also on a new job and was doing well.

359
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,357
(Kotaro) Tokyo Museum of Culture has not retired.

360
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:02,487
However, he has completed the restoration of his work and has not been to work for the past two days.

361
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,073
How do you know about Nerla's workplace?

362
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,325
Ah...

363
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,368
(Leo) This guy can see anything

364
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,953
(Kotaro) Ah...

365
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,415
Have you ever had any problems like what she was doing?

366
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,293
(Hiro) It's the second and fourth floors, so I don't really understand.

367
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,170
(Kotaro) Are you not eating?

368
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,257
(Hiroshi) Since they were alone, they've shown their faces once a day.

369
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,509
I didn't care about anything

370
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,721
Rather, he resumed his repair work and became more lively.

371
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,014
is that so…

372
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,060
If so, I might want to see a little more

373
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,855
I have asked the Metropolitan Police Department to send you a message, but please send a message.

374
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,608
I've got divorced so I'll post it in my dad's name

375
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,525
Is that okay?

376
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,693
please

377
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,656
Ah...

378
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm late but thank you for your hard work in detention

379
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,749
Sorry for causing trouble

380
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,629
Are you doing well?

381
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,633
(Leo) I'm fine... not

382
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,052
is that so

383
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,846
So let's take a look at the second floor.

384
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,367
(Thinking) What are you looking for?

385
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,804
(Kotaro) Nerla's birthday...

386
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,642
(Error sound)

387
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,645
When is your dad's birthday?

388
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,439
December 24th

389
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,400
(Error sound)

390
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,360
What about your uncle?

391
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,237
(Thinking) Well, I don't think it's me...

392
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,697
April 5th

393
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,366
(Error sound)

394
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,079
(Leo) Me May 14th

395
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,999
(Error sound)

396
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,794
(Kotaro) Wedding anniversary...

397
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,632
(Error sound)

398
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,436
(Startup sound)

399
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,898
What is it now?

400
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,274
Isn't this person's birthday?

401
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,942
(Thinking) No, then that's it from the beginning.

402
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,360
(Fuku) Yes

403
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,862
(Thinking) Sorry, I say something unnecessary

404
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,001
They only interact with museums.

405
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,342
(Kotaro) 1 draft

406
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,344
(Enter key press sound)

407
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,887
It's an email addressed to me!

408
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,806
But there's only an address

409
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,192
I'll borrow this

410
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,276
Where are you going?

411
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,112
If I had written something after this and deleted it ⸺

412
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,948
Maybe it can be restored

413
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,870
That this is still there ⸺

414
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,915
It's possible that you wanted to say something to me

415
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,209
(Kotaro) is missing

416
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,712
If there is a possibility that there is a problem, you can restore your data.

417
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,881
(Kurokawa) It's too forceful, it's not that easy

418
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,591
(Kotaro) I haven't got home on the 2nd

419
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,301
It doesn't respond to mobile phones either

420
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,095
Is it okay for Nerra to die?

421
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,890
Please screw it into the SSBC

422
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,101
SSBC can do it!

423
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,317
(Tezuka) The data has been erased, but this is just superficial

424
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,238
Using digital forensic technology, we are lifting it from the deep side

425
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,157
(typing sound)

426
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,495
(typing sound)

427
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,006
(typing sound)

428
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,100
(Kurokawa) There was...

429
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,226
Ah...

430
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,229
(Tezuka) All restored successfully

431
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,358
(Nerla) Kotaro

432
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,696
It's weird to say something like this now ⸺

433
00:26:56,072 --> 00:27:00,994
The person who gave me the job of restoring the Tokyo Museum of Culture and Art ⸺

434
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,454
It must be Kotaro

435
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,166
The name of the museum's legal counsel⸺

436
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,252
I found the name of Naito Tsubasa and realized it

437
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:15,759
Thank you for keeping me in mind

438
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:21,598
But I'm sorry for being rude in court

439
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,770
I thought Ko-chan's trial would have to be overlooked

440
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,273
It's hard to feel you up close...

441
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,526
I took that attitude

442
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:39,074
But now, when I try to say something ⸺

443
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,912
Only your face appears on my head

444
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,920
I was planning on getting a conclusion when Ko-chan's verdict came out.

445
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:57,467
There was another secret at the beginning of the Fuse incident.

446
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,179
(Kotaro) Does that mean the incident wasn't over?

447
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,599
(Nerla) A little before that incident

448
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:11,064
I drew a painting that imitates the style of fabric painting with a playful feel.

449
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,649
(Fotoshi) It must be a lie...

450
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,150
It looks like my picture!

451
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,780
(Nerra) This brushwork, color scheme, and balance of composition, etc.

452
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,449
I've been watching it since I was a student so I know it

453
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,411
Oh no, but it's amazing

454
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
-(Nerla) Really? - (Fuse) Yes

455
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,788
thank you

456
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,457
(Nerla) The Fuso is interesting ⸺

457
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:34,963
I showed the art dealer Misugi to the art dealer's picture that I drew.

458
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,508
Then Misugi-san had no doubts.

459
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,011
I put more prices on the picture than ever before

460
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:50,562
I will also draw the next work after going on.

461
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:55,567
Before long, the Fuso stopped taking paintbrushes.

462
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:02,615
After that, I had no choice but to draw some paintings under the name of Fuse.

463
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,828
(Kotaro) Is Fuse's painting a painting by Nerla?

464
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,290
(Nerla) I was busy with restoration work too ⸺

465
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,877
It's tough to work with his substitute.

466
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,753
I'm exhausted...

467
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,263
(Foto) Nerra...

468
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,396
Sorry

469
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,233
I was being spoiled and relied too much on Nerla

470
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,028
I'll draw it myself from now on

471
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,532
I'll try my best without relying on you too

472
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,242
it was good…

473
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,872
You can do anything

474
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,334
When the next piece is finished...

475
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,295
Let's get married

476
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,883
The next picture is...

477
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,928
What are you drawing?

478
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,099
I'll draw you

479
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,728
(Nerla) But in the end...

480
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:17,482
The new painting of Fusae was not completed

481
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,903
You can't draw unless your soul commands you

482
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,696
Do copying, fakes, anything

483
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,367
It's good to get past the winter era of talent

484
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,035
(Nerra) Is Fusei's impatience ⸺

485
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:34,624
I think it gradually became hatred for me and my family.

486
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:39,462
And Fuse disguises Leo's kidnapping.

487
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,506
That incident happened

488
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,508
Let's die together

489
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,385
Why should I die?

490
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,470
(Nerra) Nn...

491
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:58,731
(Nerla) We parted ways with Kotaro and our house fell apart

492
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,777
I had given up thinking there was nothing I could do about it anymore ⸺

493
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,530
The only thing that bothers me is

494
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,173
(Kurokawa) I stopped writing here and deleted the text.

495
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:29,012
Is the reason why you disappeared because you wanted to say something up ahead?

496
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,937
(Caster) High priced at 10 million yen

497
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,900
Prices are expected to rise further in the future.

498
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,957
(The sound of the door closing)

499
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,134
(Staff) Please take a closer look at the third one from the back.

500
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,594
(Acoustic Staff) More Upload More Upload

501
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,803
Ah...

502
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,639
Ah, more up aaa...

503
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,765
Ah, sorry, down more... down

504
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,975
(Staff) Please push the end

505
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,269
‪ＯＫ！

506
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,647
(Organizer) Thank you for your hard work

507
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,148
(Staff) Thank you for your hard work

508
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,735
(Organizer) Please meet tomorrow at 9am.

509
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,862
It's an auction that's attracting attention ⸺

510
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,614
Let's tighten our mind

511
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,907
(Staff) Yes

512
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,579
(Staff Nerra) Thank you for your hard work

513
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,513
(The sound of the door opening)

514
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,518
what are you doing…

515
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,774
Shall I put that down a bit

516
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,031
He used those scissors to cut my hair for me...

517
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,451
Have you come to cut this picture this time?

518
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,916
Did you want to be charged with hurting this picture?

519
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,506
If I hadn't done that kind of thing in a playful way...

520
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,052
That person could have walked his true path with confidence

521
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,728
I think I was still alive today

522
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,188
(Kotaro) I think so, so what is it?

523
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,858
Don't say good things

524
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,612
That's just self-satisfaction

525
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,325
you…

526
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,537
You should keep everything in your heart until you die

527
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,457
If you do that ⸺

528
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,544
Fuse will be spoken forever as a genius painter of Yosetsu.

529
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:53,049
That is to protect the pride of the fabric.

530
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,517
This picture will be priced even higher tomorrow

531
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,060
That's fine

532
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,566
Nerula, who seemed to be "I'm in my fault" ⸺

533
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,984
It's not Nerula

534
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,034
It's pointless to regret what happened 15 years ago now

535
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,994
What has passed is past

536
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,873
Cherish the present...

537
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,085
You should live strong

538
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,338
You're a hip girl

539
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,971
"Women who open their hips and live strong are wonderful"

540
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,389
Didn't you say it?

541
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,853
If so...

542
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,274
If there is any pain you carry on your shoulders, I'll carry it along with you too

543
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,323
that's why…

544
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,911
So let's get married again

545
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,291
‪♪～

546
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,878
If you want to divorce, you can get a divorce again

547
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,130
I'll chase you again and say "I'll get married"

548
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,302
Why are you saying that much?

549
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:23,014
Haha... I fell in love with you so much, so I can't help it

550
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,605
You're persistent

551
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,608
Don't be persistent, you're persistent

552
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,111
I was hoping he would come again.

553
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,239
(Nerla) Why did we meet?

554
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,866
(Kotaro) It's probably because they're destined to be the two of them

555
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,951
Let's do our best to live together

556
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,578
Let's do our best, Nerra

557
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,498
We are husbands and wives

558
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,084
If anything, let's join forces

559
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,086
That's what Nerula and I are ⸺

560
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,671
I think it means you're married

561
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,759
I won't make my life or your life a mess

562
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,344
Isn't it amazing? I

563
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,261
cry)

564
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,554
Amazing...

565
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,265
It's so amazing

566
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,936
Kotaro is...

567
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,231
I'm glad you're persistent

568
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,567
Haha...

569
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,488
(Kotaro) Hey... Let's put that down a bit

570
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,628
(Kotaro) Well, that's fine

571
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:52,103
‪～♪

572
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,939
It came into effect from September this year.

573
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,984
Revised Bird and Animal Protection Management Act is here

574
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,237
(Imaizumi) Eh, what is the major change in this revision?

575
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,115
Four new requirements

576
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,117
The four requirements are...

577
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,827
(Nerla) This person is not funny at all

578
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,953
(Kotaro) Haha...

579
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,580
TV needs a little more service-oriented spirit

580
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,792
(Imaizumi) Eh, this is already

581
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:19,547
Um, it's not just a problem with wildlife, but rather a way of living in society as a whole.

582
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,008
This guy has big eyes

583
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,093
I wish Kotaro would do it after all.

584
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,721
Haha... I'm not calling you anymore

585
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,639
Haha...

586
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,349
(Leo) Sorry for keeping you waiting

587
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,475
(Male) Hello

588
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,519
(Leo) Thank you very much

589
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,440
(Thinking) If Yamashita's swing speed is ⸺

590
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,649
The 7 iron is just right

591
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,443
(Yamashita) Ah, thank you

592
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,279
(Kotaro) Leo and Tada have not returned to the apartment.

593
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,615
Family dinners are still being held today

594
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,161
It's once a week, once a month...

595
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,245
(Playing sound)

596
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,248
Night Show!

597
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,626
(Thinking) Okay

598
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,753
A bit Nerla This is a bit...

599
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,879
(Nerla) It's okay

600
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,672
-(Thinking) Really? delicious? -(Nerla) Yes, it's so tasty

601
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,883
(Thinking) Yes, it's tasty

602
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,803
(The sound of the door opening) (Kotaro) Sorry for the delay!

603
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,929
(Thinking) Ah thank you for your hard work

604
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,347
(Nerla) Welcome back

605
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,141
- (Kotaro) Good evening - (Hiro)

606
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,060
With Zuikaken's cream puffs

607
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,519
(Thoughts) Oh thank you

608
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,688
(The sound of a bell)

609
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,160
It's my birthday next week

610
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,870
Today it's a stewed hamburger

611
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,371
Eh!

612
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,584
(Kotaro) Stewed... It's not my image of hamburger stew

613
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,712
It looks delicious stewed hamburger!

614
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,507
(Hiroshi) I've opened the champagne too

615
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,674
(Kotaro) That's good!

616
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,592
(Nerla) Kotaro

617
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,303
Do you remember saying that hamburgers are good for birthdays?

618
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,888
(Kotaro) I remember it!

619
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,849
Leo is Ebigratan and father-in-law is Gyoza

620
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,519
It's the day my uncle doesn't cook

621
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,897
I can only memorize the complete books of Six Laws, so I have an outstanding memory.

622
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,525
Well then...

623
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,487
Celebrating Kotaro's birthday to a toast

624
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,738
(Everyone) Cheers!

625
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,744
Congratulations

626
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:14,954
Congratulations

627
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,872
(Thoughts) Congratulations

628
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,335
(Nerla) Leo doesn't come after all

629
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,632
(Hi) I was worried when Nerula disappeared

630
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,592
(Thinking) No, but that was surprising

631
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,888
(Kotaro) You let me know about today by email, right?

632
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,682
(Furu) Ah, I'm letting you know

633
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,269
I'm sure Leo has his own ideas.

634
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,777
(Hiroshi) Even though we had a toast, we were so moved, isn't it?

635
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,155
(Kotaro) Ah... haha... I'll eat it

636
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,990
(Everyone will be served)

637
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:51,907
(Kotaro) So good...

638
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,033
Ah!

639
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,410
Lotus root!

640
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,327
Hehe...

641
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,372
Lotus root is the most delicious from autumn to winter.

642
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,498
It's time for now

643
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,167
As expected, he knows

644
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,544
The hamburger texture with lotus root is great

645
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,628
(Thinking) Ah

646
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,382
(Hiroshi) You have to think about this kind of labour food.

647
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,385
Come back

648
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,762
You're probably more secure here too

649
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,310
I'm very popular at the golf course I'm currently in.

650
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,480
I was called a caddy waiting for 3 months

651
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,398
So I can't go back soon

652
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:28,152
Even I could not be irrelevant at the golf course that I hired.

653
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,159
There is a period of probation in mind, but...

654
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,662
Is there no end for Leo?

655
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:48,422
It's legally free because of his mental issues.

656
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:54,011
Leo has too many allies in this house.

657
00:41:54,887 --> 00:42:00,100
Maybe if you don't try hard on your own, you won't be able to open up the next path.

658
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,062
I think so too

659
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,688
Wow! Woooo...

660
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,066
- (Kotaro) Ah, again- (thinking)... do it

661
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:07,858
Wow!

662
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,943
(Kotaro) It's time for you again

663
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,861
(Slap sound)

664
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,154
(Kotaro) Hey...

665
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,781
Is it okay to hit it so hard?

666
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,074
- (Fuku) Ah! -(Thinking) Yes Vacuum Cleaner

667
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,992
(Hiroshi) Ah, okay

668
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,577
(Kotaro) That's fine

669
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,828
(Hiroshi) Ah, I was surprised

670
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,121
What did you get stuck?

671
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,248
Maybe lotus root?

672
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,668
(Hiroshi) I was just surprised that you were coming all of a sudden.

673
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,795
Maybe it would have been better not to come?

674
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,213
(Thinking) That's not possible

675
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,339
(Furu) Sit quickly

676
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,465
(Thinking)

677
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,217
There's also some stewed hamburger leo

678
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,426
Sit down

679
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,891
(Kotaro) This house is really tiring

680
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,434
My family is not good

681
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,731
 (Kotaro) Haa...

682
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,234
I'm tired from the dinner party for the first time in a while

683
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,820
Next week, we'll have a birthday party together.

684
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,864
 It's fine, it's not particularly happy anymore

685
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,449
That's not true

686
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,745
Kotaro was born

687
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,414
It was really good

688
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,374
Ah...

689
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,960
 So I want to celebrate that

690
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,255
 Ah yes

691
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,384
 Ah, I'm full

692
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,469
Tomorrow, I'll go to bed early

693
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,239
 (the sound of the door closing)

694
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,541
