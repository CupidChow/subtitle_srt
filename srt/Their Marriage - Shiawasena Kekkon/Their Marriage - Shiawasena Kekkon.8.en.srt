1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,630
Leo!

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,299
Leo!

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,969
Leo!

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,680
Leo!

5
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,527
You didn't do it. Listen to me.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,989
The one who killed him was me.

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>Okay?</i>

8
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,297
What time is it?

9
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,466
Three o'clock.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,179
It's okay now. You can go home.

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,557
I don't have to go to school anyway,
so it's fine.

12
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,976
Staying here won't change anything.

13
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,646
Once they do all the tests,

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,609
and they don't find any issues,
I can go home tomorrow.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,528
When did you hear that?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,199
Just a second ago.

17
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,658
Oh really?

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,827
Are you sure <i>you're</i> okay?

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,746
You have a point.

20
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,082
I might be going crazy.

21
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,964
I'm sorry for causing a fire.

22
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>Ko Suzuki isn't the culprit?</i>

23
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,267
<i>He fully admits that he did it.</i>

24
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,773
However…
We believed that the candlestick found in

25
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>the victim's painting</i>
<i>was the weapon that was used,</i>

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,989
<i>but the shape of the weapon that</i>
<i>Ko Suzuki drew…</i>

27
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,699
<i>didn't match it.</i>

28
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,911
Ko Suzuki is hiding something.

29
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,664
There was probably
just another candlestick there.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,585
What you need to do right now,

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,089
is solidify evidence
proving that Ko Suzuki is the culprit

32
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,758
and have prosecution indict him already.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,219
Make sure this reinvestigation succeeds.

34
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,139
Yes.

35
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,645
Leaving an iron unattended
can lead to a massive fire.

36
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,564
So please be careful in the future.

37
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm sorry for the trouble.
Thank you very much.

38
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,484
Well then, goodbye.

39
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,492
I'm glad it was just a little fire.
But I'm so puzzled.

40
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,244
What's puzzling?

41
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,914
Ever since Leo was small,
he never made mistakes.

42
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,878
We used to be worried about how
meticulous and orderly he is.

43
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,341
He's not the type to leave the iron on
and go to sleep.

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,762
He's probably shaken up about his uncle.

45
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,811
Is Nella back?

46
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,439
- Yes. I'll go back too then.
- Okay.

47
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,861
You were a lifesaver again, today.

48
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,375
Welcome back.

49
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,962
I'm glad there was nothing wrong with Leo.

50
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,881
So it was the iron after all, huh?

51
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,551
The firefighter said there were no signs
of a fault current.

52
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,973
It's almost morning,
but should we go back to bed?

53
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,149
Did something happen at the hospital?

54
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,777
I don't think Ko

55
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,821
killed Fuse after all.

56
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,202
When I saw Leo lying down in the smoke,

57
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,831
I got another flashback from that time.

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,168
<i>When I woke up,</i>

59
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,545
<i>I saw a man's feet…</i>

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,341
You didn't do it.

61
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,720
Listen to me.
The one who killed him was me.

62
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,099
That was Ko's voice.
There's no doubt about it.

63
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,517
Wait a second.

64
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,479
The other day,
you said that you saw a man's feet

65
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,815
when you regained consciousness, right?

66
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:38,736
So this time, you remembered the voice
you heard during that time?

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,737
Right.

68
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,241
He said, "You didn't do it."

69
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,451
Who did he say that to?

70
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,705
- Me.
- Huh?

71
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,834
I think Ko took the blame for me.

72
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,629
So, in the end,

73
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,758
I think I was the one who killed Fuse.

74
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,640
I'll go tell the police now.

75
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,726
Hey, hey, wait!

76
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,690
Tell me what happened, in more detail.

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,567
More details?

78
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,945
More details…

79
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,241
That day,

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,745
Fuse and I got into a heated fight,

81
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,455
<i>and I hit my head</i>

82
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>and lost my memory.</i>

83
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,544
That's what I thought.

84
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,757
But maybe I killed Fuse after all,

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,094
and I just don't remember what happened.

86
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,806
The police aren't going to
take you seriously if it's just a "maybe."

87
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,018
But if Ko was protecting somebody

88
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,395
in that moment and that situation,

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,606
it could only be me.

90
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,442
Even if that's true,
it won't be that easy.

91
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,486
- Why?
- Calm down.

92
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,780
As I've said before,

93
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,657
your memory alone is not evidence,

94
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,327
and your uncle will not be
released right away.

95
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,664
But Ko isn't the one who did it.

96
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,376
No matter how you look at it,

97
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,505
it was me.

98
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,736
<i>What Nella is saying is probably right.</i>

99
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,697
<i>Nella killed Fuse</i>

100
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,660
<i>and her uncle saw it</i>
<i>and took the blame for her.</i>

101
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,791
<i>If you think about it that way,</i>
<i>the fact that he kept quiet for 15 years</i>

102
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,504
<i>and turned himself in at this moment,</i>
<i>all makes sense.</i>

103
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,053
<i>If you really did kill someone,</i>

104
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,474
<i>what am I supposed to do,</i>

105
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,645
<i>as a lawyer</i>

106
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,108
<i>and as your husband?</i>

107
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,501
I heard there was a fire yesterday.

108
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,587
News travels fast, doesn't it?

109
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,386
You haven't been to the office in a while?

110
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,724
The reporters aren't here anymore,
so I can come in every day now,

111
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,393
but all of my big jobs were canceled.

112
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,520
What is wrong

113
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,815
with this world and its cancel culture?

114
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,656
That detective is handsome.

115
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,784
It's my first time meeting someone
better looking than you.

116
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,953
I'm not competing with anyone
with my looks.

117
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,457
- Right…
- Yes.

118
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,628
How is Ko Suzuki doing?

119
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,381
He answers all of our questions
without reservation.

120
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,091
To the point that it's unnatural.

121
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,718
Are you saying

122
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,264
that you think that
Ko Suzuki is not the real culprit?

123
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,101
The moment we reopened the case,
your wife regained her memories,

124
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,523
Ko Suzuki turned himself in,
and there was a fire.

125
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,900
It's all too timely.

126
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,029
This string of events
doesn't sit well with me.

127
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,573
Coming to see me
isn't going to solve anything, though.

128
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,742
You won't get anything
out of shaking me up.

129
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,454
Even if Ko Suzuki confesses to everything,

130
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,041
without conclusive evidence,
the prosecution can't indict him.

131
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,086
If you can't indict him
after reopening a case that

132
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,837
the police already misjudged once,

133
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,215
the police will completely lose face.

134
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,428
The superintendent general campaign
won't go as you planned.

135
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,930
Is something irritating you?

136
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,224
How am I not supposed to be
irritated right now?

137
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,977
I'm glad I came.

138
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,566
You can be really annoying, you know?

139
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,984
Is that right?

140
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,819
I'll try to be careful next time.

141
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,779
Thank you for your time.

142
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,865
I was able to learn a lot.

143
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,342
Welcome home.

144
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,766
I'm glad you're okay.

145
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,852
Want barley tea?

146
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,271
- It's okay. I'll get it myself.
- Yeah?

147
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm sorry, Dad.

148
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,651
No need to apologize.

149
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,820
It definitely could have been worse.

150
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,239
I'll go clean up the first floor.

151
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,033
- I'll help.
- It's okay.

152
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,953
Stay here until you're done
cleaning up downstairs.

153
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,456
I've kept your room here the way it was.

154
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,257
It's so messy.

155
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,217
You should be a little more organized.

156
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,386
It's hard, considering his job.

157
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,683
Everything smells like smoke.
All the fabric is ruined.

158
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,769
Let's clean this up for now.

159
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,858
You didn't do it.

160
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,030
The one who killed him was me.

161
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,328
What's wrong?

162
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,709
You didn't get any sleep last night.
Go to the second floor and rest.

163
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,878
Yeah, I'll do that.

164
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,100
- Dad.
- Huh?

165
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,186
You didn't rummage through this room
after I went to the hospital, right?

166
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,063
What do you mean, "rummage"?

167
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,817
What am I supposed to rummage through
when all you've got is idol costumes?

168
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,719
- Can I go home now?
- Yeah.

169
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,099
Are those the ones Tomobe
from the National Police Agency sent?

170
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,434
Yeah.

171
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,770
You're still looking into it?

172
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,609
Don't tell me…
Do the police suspect your wife again?

173
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,405
That's why the detective came?

174
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,158
I don't know what
the detective came here for.

175
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,827
The killer wasn't the uncle

176
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,913
but your wife, after all?

177
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,793
If I put my all into investigating
this case right now,

178
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,380
I might find that my wife is the killer.

179
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,674
That's why I told you to get divorced!

180
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,969
- You'll really lose everything this time.
- I know!

181
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,765
But I want to find out the truth
with my own hands.

182
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,478
I can't stand feeling so unsure.

183
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,105
You're a lawyer
and not a prosecutor anymore.

184
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,857
Stop acting like a prosecutor!

185
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,570
And get away from that family.

186
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,951
Jeez!

187
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,127
This is going to be the end
for Harada Kotaro Law Office.

188
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,172
I'd better look for another job.

189
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,590
Sorry.

190
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,763
If you need anything, I'll help.

191
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,360
Sorry for making you come out here.

192
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,570
What happened?

193
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,741
I wanted to talk outside, since being
in the house feels a little suffocating.

194
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,332
What a beautiful sunset.

195
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,588
About yesterday…

196
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,178
Up until now, I've done what I could
to look into the case and get information.

197
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,308
But I was scared of
finding out the real killer,

198
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,811
so I held back from
diving into the truth myself.

199
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,608
But I'm changing that mindset from today.

200
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,406
I want to find the truth myself,
without waiting for the police.

201
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,496
I knew you’d say that,
since you're a lawyer.

202
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:22,004
But when you find the truth,
that will be the end for us.

203
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,089
Why?

204
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,677
Because I'm the one who did it.

205
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,319
Even if you are the one who did it,
I will accept that fact.

206
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,993
I will love you, no matter who you are.

207
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,503
Kotaro, your life will be ruined.

208
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,423
I won't let anything ruin my life,
or your life either.

209
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,222
Aren't I amazing?

210
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,561
You're amazing!

211
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,565
You're really amazing.

212
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,045
You're bigger than me, huh?

213
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,300
I've always thought the same thing.

214
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,646
Do you have any intention
of dropping the reinvestigation?

215
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,440
I do not.

216
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,150
You're at a standstill, right?

217
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,945
The statements of the person you arrested,
Ko Suzuki, are faulty,

218
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,573
and you haven't found new evidence,
I've heard.

219
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,367
At this rate, you can't indict him.

220
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,082
The fact that you even tried to
overturn a case

221
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,211
that the police already deemed
an accident was out of line.

222
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,922
Just give up.

223
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,593
Even Criminal Investigation Director Sasao

224
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,804
is just using you to
boost his chances of getting promoted.

225
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,057
I already know the real killer.

226
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
Stop talking nonsense.

227
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,564
I won't let you get in my way again,
Security Director.

228
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,652
Beware of becoming a lapdog
for the criminal investigation director.

229
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,698
There's a chance that I will become
the superintendent general.

230
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,619
If you'll excuse me…

231
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,670
{\an8}Please accept this.

232
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,257
{\an8}Oh, how unfortunate…

233
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,551
But I'll hold onto this.

234
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,306
Ms. Suzuki, do your best.

235
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,100
Thank you for everything.

236
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,024
Nell-nell!

237
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,903
You're quitting?

238
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,491
You were so much better
than our new teacher.

239
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,869
Our new teacher looks like she's wearing
a bowl on her head and it's creepy.

240
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,081
Wearing a bowl on her head?
That's very nice.

241
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,791
Take care.

242
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,546
- You think it's nice?
- I don't know.

243
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,590
MEIHO MEDICAL UNIVERSITY

244
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,681
PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

245
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,266
Yes? Come in!

246
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,601
Hello. Excuse me.

247
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,272
Oh! Long time no see!

248
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,566
I brought your favorite <i>mizu yokan.</i>

249
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,986
You know me so well. Thanks, Harada.

250
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,697
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

251
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,116
But this place still gives me goosebumps.

252
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,201
I just had them purify this place
last month.

253
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,244
Last month?

254
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,203
Will you eat with me?

255
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,038
I'm fine.

256
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:32,212
Remember how I asked for a second opinion
from the perspective of forensic medicine?

257
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,797
- Oh, that.
- Yes.

258
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,051
I looked at the files for that case,
but it's tricky.

259
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,471
We don't even have the body anymore.

260
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,764
I see…

261
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,185
But quite a few things
caught my attention.

262
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,352
What?

263
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,316
The two depressed skull fractures
on the victim's head were,

264
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,610
just as the police concluded,

265
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,071
not likely to have been a result
of falling from the stairs.

266
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,202
But, putting that aside,
there is something else that stands out.

267
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,244
What is it?

268
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,122
These two…

269
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,251
It's hard to see,
but the shape of the wounds are different.

270
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,381
This one has a vertical
and horizontal line. Look closely.

271
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,884
You're right.

272
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,469
The other one doesn't.

273
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,262
What?

274
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,348
So they are different weapons?

275
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:29,186
Or it's the same weapon
but it was used differently.

276
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,359
Hitting like this

277
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,696
and hitting like this result in
different areas contacting the victim.

278
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,740
That's true.

279
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,992
If you hit differently,
the wounds will look different.

280
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,412
I don't know why, but he may have
changed the way he held the weapon.

281
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,960
No, but he said he frantically hit him
in order to save his niece.

282
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,754
Would he really reposition the weapon
in that situation?

283
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,757
- True.
- Yeah…

284
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,635
- What?
- Huh?

285
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,847
It might be more than one killer.

286
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,307
What?

287
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,022
- I'm Harada. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Kazuo Hayashi.

288
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,358
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

289
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,277
Who is that?

290
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,695
A public defender.

291
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,030
He's meeting
his relative's public defender?

292
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,490
Seems like it.

293
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,660
He's a young lawyer, so maybe he came
out of respect for his senior?

294
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,956
He is saying
that the weapon was a candlestick.

295
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,543
Candlestick? A metal one?

296
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,502
Yes.

297
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
Was it long?

298
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,465
<i>He said they made him</i>
<i>draw it during questioning.</i>

299
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:45,554
To me, he explained it as
one single, long candlestick.

300
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,056
It was at Fuse's atelier,

301
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,560
and he grabbed it without thinking
and frantically hit him.

302
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,477
Frantically…

303
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,272
It hasn't been found yet, right?

304
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,941
They searched the river,
but couldn't find it.

305
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,068
It's been 15 years, after all.

306
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,738
Ko Suzuki said that
he threw it in the river?

307
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,655
That's right.

308
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,074
Do you think
he really threw it in the river?

309
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,912
He turned himself in
and confessed to the crime,

310
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,957
so I don't see any reason why
he would have to lie.

311
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,625
Right.

312
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:22,758
<i>Almost all of the candlesticks in Japan</i>
<i>are made to be used on Buddhist altars.</i>

313
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,759
TOKUICHI METALS

314
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,262
<i>But when it comes to Western style</i>
<i>candlesticks, Tokuichi Metals</i>

315
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,430
<i>has the largest domestic market share.</i>

316
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,389
TOKUICHI METALS FACTORY

317
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,894
We specialize in metalworking
and creating molds for metal parts.

318
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,315
But since I'm a Christian,

319
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,943
churches from all over the country
order candlesticks from us.

320
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,738
Sometimes we get orders
from prop makers too.

321
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,115
There are so many kinds.

322
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,034
What type are you looking for?

323
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,831
I'll be working over there,
so take your time and look around.

324
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,083
Thank you.

325
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,346
President!

326
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,722
Yes?

327
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,519
Um, do you still have products
that you made 15 years ago?

328
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,312
Here it is.

329
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,732
Fifteen years ago,
we were only making this design.

330
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,529
You can fold this one, like this.

331
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,451
<i>Just as you suspected,</i>

332
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,080
{\an8}this logo matches the wound.

333
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,874
So the first time he hit like this,

334
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,960
and the second time he went like this?

335
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,628
The second one might be another weapon.

336
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:46,049
No, the suspect is saying that
he hit him with a candlestick.

337
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,259
I don't think he's lying.

338
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,593
I see.

339
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,139
So the fatal wound with the "T" mark on it

340
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,561
was made by swinging the candlestick
from the top, like this.

341
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,522
What an interesting way to hit.

342
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,611
No, like this.

343
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,784
So the killer held it up with both hands?

344
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:17,747
<i>There was a reason why</i>
<i>the killer had to do that.</i>

345
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,961
It might be more than one killer.

346
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,965
That was Ko's voice.
He said, "You didn't do it."

347
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,052
The moment we reopened the case,
your wife regained her memories,

348
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:36,725
Ko Suzuki turned himself in,
and there was a fire. It's all too timely.

349
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,964
- What is it?
- Do you have a moment?

350
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,431
It smells burnt doesn't it?
What did you want to talk about?

351
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,646
The night there was a fire here,

352
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,857
Nella went into your bedroom to save you,

353
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,318
and regained her memory.

354
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,321
Memory of what?

355
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,990
The incident 15 years ago.

356
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,246
She has been remembering bits and pieces,

357
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,998
and it happened again that night.

358
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:49,256
When Nella fought with Fuse and fell,
she lost consciousness.

359
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,636
But after that, she woke up once,
although she was still hazy.

360
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,224
<i>When she did,</i>
<i>she says she heard her uncle's voice.</i>

361
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,185
You didn't do it. Listen to me.

362
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,647
The one who killed him was me.

363
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,360
Apparently, he said,
"The one who killed him was me. Okay?"

364
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,698
Nella heard that voice

365
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,536
and assumed that
he was taking the blame for her.

366
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:24,082
That's because she thought that she
and her uncle were the only ones there.

367
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,962
But that's not true, right?

368
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:38,638
On Fuse's body there were wounds
right here and right here.

369
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,769
He died from this wound. And it was
not the same as this wound here.

370
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:50,358
During questioning, your uncle supposedly
said that he frantically hit him.

371
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,946
But would he really reposition the weapon
when he's "frantically" hitting him?

372
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,284
Also, if he was "frantically" hitting him,

373
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,746
wouldn't he hit him over and over again?
But there are only two wounds.

374
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,332
As a former prosecutor,
that also seems strange to me.

375
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,920
But it will make sense
if you think about it like this…

376
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,301
The first wound was made by raising

377
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,429
the candlestick with both hands
and swinging down.

378
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,726
Most likely, someone who isn't very strong
used two hands to hit him.

379
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:30,565
For the second wound, your uncle hit him
from the side with the same weapon.

380
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,404
The first blow should have
killed Fuse already,

381
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,907
so why did your uncle
hit him the second time?

382
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,163
He did that to not make you a murderer.

383
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,754
Nella heard him say, "You didn't do it."

384
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,549
"Listen to me.
The one who killed him was me. Okay?"

385
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,302
But your uncle was speaking

386
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,806
to you, wasn't he?

387
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,105
He hit a person who was already dead

388
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,148
in order to convince you

389
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,983
that you didn't kill anybody

390
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,237
and that he was the killer, right?

391
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,202
He raised you with so much care,
and he wanted to protect you.

392
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,749
Even though you were only 11 years old,

393
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,835
you understood that, didn't you?

394
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,062
I did.

395
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,363
I guess you weren't
a prosecutor for nothing.

396
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,334
Wait here for a second.

397
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,030
Here.

398
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,493
Open it up.

399
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,906
When Nella brought Yuto Fuse over,

400
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,618
<i>both Dad and Ko took a liking to him.</i>

401
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,745
But I

402
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,542
hated him from the first day
he came to our house.

403
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,629
I sensed that something bad
was going to happen.

404
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,674
But…

405
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,845
Nella was so in love with him

406
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,304
that

407
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,890
I had no choice but to give up.

408
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,268
But

409
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,565
soon enough,
both of them started to fall apart.

410
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:01,901
That day,

411
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,823
I felt like something bad
was going to happen to Nella.

412
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,285
Oh, Leo?

413
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:16,082
Ko, can I take these
to Mr. Fuse's atelier?

414
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,002
Sure, you can. Put them in a bag.

415
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,424
Hello.

416
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,302
Nella! Nella!

417
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,514
Nella…

418
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,933
Let's die together.

419
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,853
Why do I have to die?

420
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,313
Let's die together.

421
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,695
NELLA IS IN A FIGHT. HELP

422
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,946
SENDING

423
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,864
SENT

424
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:57,874
I wanted to save Nella,
but my legs were shaking from fear.

425
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,087
But on the second floor,

426
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,633
<i>I saw Fuse</i>

427
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,801
<i>straddling Nella…</i>

428
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,264
It's okay now.

429
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,394
It's okay.

430
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,063
You protected Nella, right?

431
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,656
Close your eyes.

432
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,304
You didn't do it.

433
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,725
Listen to me.

434
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,730
The one who killed him was me.

435
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,190
Okay?

436
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,111
Get a hold of yourself, Leo!

437
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,910
Take this

438
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,787
and go home.

439
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:05,168
You'll pass by a river,
so throw this in there.

440
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,421
Once you throw this away,

441
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,134
forget about what happened today
as you walk home.

442
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,221
Okay?

443
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,188
<i>Ko</i>

444
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,232
<i>sent me home</i>

445
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,319
<i>before dropping that man down the stairs,</i>

446
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,696
<i>making it seem like it was an accident.</i>

447
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,993
Why didn't you throw this into the river?

448
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,287
I don't remember.

449
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,291
I was so scared that I rushed home.

450
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,544
So I probably forgot to throw it away.

451
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,506
Did your uncle know about that?

452
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:55,968
He doesn't know.

453
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,138
I couldn't tell him.

454
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,892
Soon enough,

455
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,897
they started suspecting Nella
and questioned her every day.

456
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,440
And I

457
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,193
couldn't throw it away anymore.

458
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,196
When your uncle turned himself in,

459
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,282
why didn't you try to speak up
about the truth?

460
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,582
You thought you could carry on with life
while your uncle took the blame?

461
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,042
I did not!

462
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,879
But…

463
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,219
when I heard Dad reading Ko's letter,

464
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:44,392
<i>it felt like a strict order from Ko</i>
<i>telling me,</i>

465
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,895
"Don't you dare tell the truth."

466
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,986
Ko is

467
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,866
like a mother to me.

468
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,956
I spent more time with him than anyone,
since the day I was born.

469
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:15,756
I felt like I had to respect Ko's wishes
in my own way.

470
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,053
You might think that I'm a coward,

471
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,516
but it's the truth.

472
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,351
I know

473
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,480
very well that you are
this family's treasure.

474
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,691
But

475
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,321
you can't make your uncle
take the blame for murder.

476
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,245
<i>When you came to our house,</i>
<i>I felt the same kind of</i>

477
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,540
<i>uneasiness as when Fuse came.</i>

478
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,505
I felt like you were going to
mess up our family.

479
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,304
That's why I was

480
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,807
always scared.

481
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,773
And, lo and behold,

482
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,276
you found out.

483
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,701
I know it's scary to admit to it,

484
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,620
but you can't

485
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,666
let your uncle go down as a murderer.

486
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,172
Let's go to the police together.

487
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,223
Thank you.

488
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,021
Now I can feel better.

489
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:46,282
The law says, "An act of a person less
than 14 years of age is not punishable."

490
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,118
So you won't be charged for it.

491
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:53,831
But you will have to
come clean about the truth.

492
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,960
That is the right thing to do
as a human being.

493
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,229
We'll be in your care.

494
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,280
Was it the family's decision
to make him turn himself in?

495
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,117
No, I didn't tell anyone.
He chose to come himself.

496
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,541
This way, please.

497
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,385
After you.

498
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,767
Please wait here.

499
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,499
{\an8}I'M HUNGRY, SO I'M GOING TO EAT ON MY OWN.
MISSED CALL

500
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,111
{\an8}I'm home.

501
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,948
{\an8}Where have you been?
I even called Mr. Usui.

502
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,117
{\an8}Sorry I couldn't call you.

503
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,247
{\an8}I didn't want to tell you over the phone.

504
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,343
{\an8}I'm sorry, Dad.

505
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,556
I'll tell you once you wake up.

506
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,361
You took him to the police?

507
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,656
Yes. I thought that would be the best.

508
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,951
I was with him during questioning
as his lawyer.

509
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,373
You did what you were supposed to do
as a lawyer, huh?

510
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,087
You stuck to your principles
as a lawyer, huh?

511
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,426
But was that really the right choice

512
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,887
as a member of this family?

513
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,431
Sure it is.

514
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,602
I don't think hiding the truth will
lead to this family's happiness.

515
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,521
I think it will!

516
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,232
That is how we have worked things out

517
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,150
for the past 15 years.

518
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,863
Ko was prepared to
put his life on the line

519
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,658
in order to protect Leo and the family.

520
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,326
And you messed it all up!

521
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,827
Messed it up?

522
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,039
Ko would not have
wanted you to do this either.

523
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,252
You just changed his charge from

524
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,089
murder to harboring a criminal.
There's no point!

525
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,343
Leo said that he can feel better now.

526
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,887
I can't believe you!

527
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,765
I feel like this was the right choice.

528
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,811
From an outsider's perspective,
it might seem wrong,

529
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,398
but protecting Leo
was our family's "truth."

530
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:53,404
It's not the same as the "truth"
you see from a legal perspective.

531
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:58,867
I thought it was the best thing to do
for the family and for you as well.

532
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,036
That's why I took Leo to the police.

533
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,707
I wanted to close this case for your sake.

534
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,252
You said you wanted to
find out the truth too, didn't you?

535
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:14,592
But I didn't want it to end like this.

536
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,514
If this was going to happen,

537
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,311
I wish I had been the killer.

538
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,274
I don't want you to be the killer!

539
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,735
Your family is important to me too,

540
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,864
but we can't find happiness
in our marriage unless we overcome this.

541
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,157
You get that, right?

542
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,408
I don't get it!

543
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,038
I was more than happy
with how things were.

544
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,919
I can't anymore…

545
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,880
Why?

546
00:43:55,883 --> 00:44:00,095
Everything has fallen apart
because I met you.

547
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,976
We weren't supposed to meet each other.

548
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,030
Please divorce me.

549
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,211
<i>It has been one month</i>

550
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,337
<i>since Nella and I got divorced.</i>

551
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,632
<i>If you like her that much,</i>
<i>why did you divorce her so easily?</i>

552
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,342
<i>Nella hasn't come home in two days.</i>

553
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,551
<i>Are you going to let Nella die?</i>

554
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,428
<i>There was one more secret</i>

555
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,264
{\an8}<i>that led to this incident.</i>

556
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,099
{\an8}THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
