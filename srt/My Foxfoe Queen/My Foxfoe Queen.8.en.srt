=My Foxfoe Queen=

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,740
Your Majesty...

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,100
Xin'er.

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,500
I love you so much.

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,340
Xin'er.

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,980
Lord Yi...

8
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,700
What's the matter with you?

9
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,620
Is Lord Yi...

10
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,340
Could Lord Yi be secretly
watching somewhere?

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,740
(She found out about it.)

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,900
How could that be?

13
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,500
It's just the two of us here.

14
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,339
That's not it.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,740
After everything that's happened lately,

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,259
I keep seeing

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,260
Lord Yi's face in my mind.

18
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,019
(This fox demon
is stirring trouble again.)

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,899
Xin'er.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,299
I know you've been frightened
these past few days.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,299
Don't worry.

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,979
I shall punish Lord Yi accordingly,

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,740
so he'll never hurt you again.

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,659
But...

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,659
But why do I feel like

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,140
Lord Yi is

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,940
standing right at the door,

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,340
as if he might barge in any second.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,459
Your Majesty.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,220
Don't be afraid, Xin'er.

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,540
(She's no ordinary demon.)

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,460
(Looks like
I'll have to play the long game.)

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,659
Afraid not.

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,780
Don't be scared.

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,100
I'm afraid

36
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,020
I can't serve Your Majesty
in this condition.

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,580
Forget it.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,260
You should rest well today.

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,020
I'll come to visit you another day.

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,579
Let me feed it to you.

41
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,019
It's all right. I wouldn't
trouble Your Majesty with that.

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,820
I can manage it.

43
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,100
(This smells)

44
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,579
(exactly the same
as that medicine I had before.)

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,179
Your Highness,
this is the calming tea I prepared.

46
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,459
Having a cup of it before bed

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,380
will help you sleep better.

48
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,779
Your Majesty, why are you here?

49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,540
Didn't you ask me to come here?

50
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,580
I didn't.

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,740
(It's Liusu.)

52
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,500
(It turns out
she was planted by Xiling Xuan.)

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,059
(She wants my soul
to leave my body in front of Xiling Heng,)

54
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,660
(so he can catch me red-handed.)

55
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,859
(It seems Xiling Xuan)

56
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,500
(is watching from nearby.)

57
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,140
If that's the case...

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,700
Liusu.

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,140
Your Highness.

60
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,060
Did you call for me?

61
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,780
Someone tampered

62
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,940
with the tea I was drinking.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,580
Your Highness.

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,019
I...

65
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
Don't be afraid.

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,940
I didn't say it was you.

67
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,100
It was Xiling Xuan.

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,460
He's tried to harm me again and again.

69
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,859
This time he even tampered with my tea,

70
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,460
almost making me expose myself
in front of Xiling Heng.

71
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,380
How despicable!

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,380
Since he tried to kill me,

73
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,500
I won't show mercy either.

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,419
Do you know

75
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,740
where the disaster victims

76
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,260
have been relocated?

77
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,520
Have you heard?

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,560
Those victims from the downtown
in the east of the city

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,379
have disappeared overnight!

80
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,379
They say a demon cast a spell at night

81
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,659
and killed them all.

82
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,819
Ah! No wonder there was
thunder and lightning last night.

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,379
I was scared to death!

84
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,459
Do you think Lord Yi did it?

85
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,900
He is a demon after all.

86
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,620
Shush.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,380
Watch your tongue if you want to live.

88
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,860
Your Lordship!

89
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,580
This is bad, Your Lordship!

90
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,900
What happened?

91
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,019
Before dawn today, Jiang Xin'er took
all the disaster victims in the city

92
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,220
and led them away.

93
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,060
Be specific.

94
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,019
After I showed her
where the victims were,

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,379
she suddenly got worked up.

96
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,540
She wouldn't let me follow her anymore,

97
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,139
and I don't know where she took them.

98
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,819
I have no idea what she's going to do.

99
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,900
So I rushed back to report to you.

100
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,900
Did she say anything else?

101
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
She...

102
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,819
She said you tried to get her killed,

103
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,379
so she wouldn't show mercy anymore.

104
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,500
She must be planning revenge.

105
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,580
After that snake demon incident,

106
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,780
the city's been spreading rumors
that I'm a demon.

107
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,500
Could it be that she plans
to kill the victims with magic

108
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,380
and pin the blame on me?

109
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,180
Take me to her.

110
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,140
She's right ahead.

111
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,220
She's actually

112
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,860
cooked them?

113
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,500
That vile demon...

114
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,900
I must kill her!

115
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,700
Your Lordship.

116
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,579
It turns out

117
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,380
she's been helping the victims
rebuild their homes.

118
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,500
Miss.

119
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,699
Hey, Niu.

120
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,699
Miss.

121
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,019
Those people had their eyes
on those pots.

122
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,760
They've been staring at them
the whole time.

123
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,259
Got it.

124
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,300
Go.

125
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,819
Madam Zhang.

126
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,539
Why is nobody watching those pots?

127
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,139
My goodness, how forgetful I am!

128
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,600
When I get busy, I forget everything.

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,939
Then hurry and go check on them.
Don't let them burn.

130
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,060
Sure!

131
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,939
Everyone, keep it up!

132
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,819
We're having wild boar for dinner!

133
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,340
Great!

134
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,939
Your Lordship.

135
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,900
She doesn't look like
an evil demon to me.

136
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,300
She's just putting on an act.

137
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,740
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,700
Of course I'm here to catch a demon.

139
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,579
I don't know
what nonsense you're spouting.

140
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,139
If you're not here to help,

141
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,459
step aside and don't get in my way.

142
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,140
Drop the act already.

143
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,660
I bet these people

144
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,900
have all been bewitched by you, right?

145
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,819
Indeed.

146
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,379
I bewitched them.

147
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,580
I'm a demon. I'm a fox spirit.

148
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,579
Not only did I bewitch these people here,

149
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,139
I also bewitched His Majesty.

150
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,940
So you finally admit it.

151
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,379
I'll kill you right now.

152
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,179
Hey, what are you doing?

153
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,019
If she's a demon,

154
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,939
that makes me one too.

155
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,339
Go ahead and kill me too.

156
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,819
All of us here are demons.

157
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,339
Kill us all, then!

158
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,779
Hey, everyone, come over!

159
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,139
Look at this man.

160
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,779
Look at this man.

161
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,579
He calls our life savior a monster.

162
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,260
Look. This is it!

163
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,299
- What nonsense are you talking?
- What nonsense is this?

164
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,419
If it weren't for our life savior,

165
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,299
would we all be able to gather
and rebuild our homes here?

166
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,539
Indeed.

167
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,139
There, there.

168
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,779
Stop talking nonsense. You know nothing.

169
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,100
Don't be afraid, miss.

170
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,380
I once suffered from losing my home,

171
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,539
so I can truly empathize

172
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,260
with their plight.

173
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,500
But like I said,

174
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,739
even if I am a demon,

175
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,740
there are good and evil demons.

176
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,860
I'm doing all this to make you
stop targeting me in the future.

177
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,019
Do not harm her!

178
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,740
She is our life savior!

179
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,219
Niu.

180
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,219
Look.

181
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,660
This one's for you.

182
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,940
Wow, it's so nice!

183
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,980
What is this?

184
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,979
This

185
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,059
is the lucky bird I wove.

186
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,179
It can bless you
with good fortune and health,

187
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,580
a peaceful and smooth life.

188
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,260
Why were you crying just now?

189
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,219
They don't want to play with me.

190
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,179
They call me a crow

191
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,459
and an unlucky bird.

192
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,539
You're more like a crybaby bird to me.

193
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,459
I am not.

194
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,619
I wasn't crying at all.

195
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,779
It's just the sand got in my eyes.

196
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,419
Okay.

197
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,900
You weren't crying.

198
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,859
Actually, they don't get it.

199
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,579
Crows aren't unlucky birds.

200
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,819
They're auspicious birds.

201
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,819
Really?

202
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,859
Of course.

203
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,819
Crows feed their parents,

204
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,099
showing filial piety.

205
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,979
They eat pests.

206
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,059
They symbolize righteousness.

207
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,979
Since ancient times,
they've been a symbol of good omen.

208
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,979
Tu Shanyue, you sure know a lot.

209
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,419
Here, this is for you.

210
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,500
What is this? It's pretty.

211
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,300
This is the lucky bird I wove for you.

212
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,579
It can bless you
with good fortune and health,

213
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,060
and a peaceful and smooth life.

214
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,859
Look. Doesn't it look like you,

215
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,939
crybaby bird?

216
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,900
It does.

217
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,660
(What are these memories about?)

218
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,739
(I can't help)

219
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,060
(feeling connected to her.)

220
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,820
