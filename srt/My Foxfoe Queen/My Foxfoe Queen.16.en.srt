=Episode 16=

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,180
(It's late.)

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,500
(Xiling Heng is not in his bedchambers.)

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,700
(What is he still doing
in the imperial study?)

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,220
Your Highness.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,739
His Majesty is handling state affairs
in the imperial study.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,220
No outsiders may intrude.

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,300
Am I an outsider too?

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,539
His Majesty has given orders.
This is a matter of utmost secrecy.

11
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,379
No one is to disturb,

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,740
including Your Highness.

13
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,700
(Never mind.)

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,460
(I'll ask him another time.)

15
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,579
I've slain

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,340
586 Mount Yao rabbit demons.

17
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,060
Their inner cores are all here.

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,620
Please examine them.

19
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,260
That's such a small number.
It's not nearly enough.

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,100
Have you wiped out

21
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,460
all the demons in Mount Yao?

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
Why won't you answer me?

23
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,299
Aren't you curious

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,420
why I specifically ordered you
to kill the Mount Yao demons?

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,100
Because that's your old home.

26
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,979
You and your filthy mother

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,860
both came from there.

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,060
Only if you kill those demons

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,020
will I feel satisfied.

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,740
Don't you feel the same?

31
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,020
Why won't you answer me?

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,060
Answer me!

33
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,140
I've slain

34
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,060
586 Mount Yao rabbit demons.

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,900
Their inner cores are all here.

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,460
Please examine them.

37
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,779
If only your filthy mother

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,660
could see you like this.

39
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,900
Too bad you already killed her.

40
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,260
By any means necessary,

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,539
slaughter all Mount Yao demons

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,499
within three days.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,620
Understood.

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,820
(What happened at Mount Yao?)

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,659
(Has something happened?)

46
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,740
Your Highness.

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,740
Did you find him?

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,339
I've searched all the places Lord Wing
has been these past few days.

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,700
No sign of him.

50
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,979
It's like he vanished into thin air.

51
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,500
(What in the world is going on?)

52
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,700
(I have a bad feeling about this.)

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,819
Seize that demon!

54
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,939
Don't let it get away!

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,260
Search over there!

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,740
What's going on?

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,579
Your Highness.

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,419
A demon suddenly burst into the palace.
We're trying to capture it.

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,179
It's dangerous here.

60
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,619
Please return to your palace.

61
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,539
Is that demon injured?

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,059
Yes.

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,340
Did Your Highness see it?

64
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,540
I saw it head that way.

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,660
Let's go.

66
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,820
Your Highness, we should head back.

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,740
We'll be fine.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,179
Your Highness.

69
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,260
We shouldn't go there, Your Highness.

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,660
Your Highness.

71
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,140
It's all right.

72
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,740
Youyou?

73
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,020
Do you know her?

74
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,659
She's a friend from my old home.

75
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,259
Come on.

76
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,739
Help me carry her inside.

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,860
Yes.

78
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,579
Your Highness,
here's the medicine you wanted.

79
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,020
I've brought it for you.

80
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,660
Good.

81
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,179
Go get some rest.

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,940
I'll manage.

83
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,299
Don't worry.

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,580
I'll be fine.

85
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,380
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,340
Youyou.

87
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,340
Youyou!

88
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,739
(Youyou, Deer Demon)

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,660
(Youyou, Deer Demon)
You... You're...

90
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,500
It's me.

91
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,860
Tushan Yue.

92
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,100
Tushan Yue?

93
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,980
Isn't she already...

94
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,700
I drank the fox clan's holy water

95
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,580
and only a wisp of my soul remained,

96
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,900
so I possessed this body you see now.

97
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,219
Easy there.

98
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,500
Yue.

99
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,220
Yue.

100
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,340
Is it really you?

101
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,180
Yue...

102
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,580
Youyou.

103
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,100
Youyou, don't cry.

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,339
Tell me,

105
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,980
what happened at Mount Yao?

106
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,980
How did you get injured so badly?

107
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,179
Yue,

108
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,500
three days ago,

109
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,739
a man appeared at Mount Yao

110
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,460
and went on a slaughtering spree.

111
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,139
His body heals itself.

112
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,580
None of us could stop him.

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,940
(It's Xiling Xuan.)

114
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,660
In the end,

115
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,700
he killed many demons.

116
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm the only survivor

117
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,900
of the deer demon clan.

118
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,380
It's all right.

119
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,100
It's all right now, Youyou.

120
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,059
Tell me,

121
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,100
how did you end up here?

122
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,540
I followed that man all the way here.

123
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,660
I wanted to take revenge,

124
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,380
but the guards caught sight of me,

125
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,300
so I hid.

126
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,979
I was wounded too badly

127
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,900
and passed out.

128
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,899
I must kill him

129
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,299
to avenge my clan.

130
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,179
Youyou, listen to me.

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,419
Calm down.

132
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,380
You've been severely wounded.

133
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,739
You need rest.

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,140
I will take care

135
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,740
of the revenge.

136
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,019
No.

137
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,259
He killed my entire clan.

138
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,979
I have to finish him myself!

139
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,859
You're hurt badly at the moment.

140
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,460
If you go,
you'll just be walking to your death.

141
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,659
You know where he is, don't you?

142
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,219
Take me to him!

143
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,219
Calm down,

144
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,420
Youyou...

145
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,859
Youyou!

146
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,140
Lie down.

147
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,700
Lie down. Slowly.

148
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,179
Youyou,

149
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,859
listen to me.

150
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,579
Rest and heal now.

151
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,900
I promise

152
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,780
I will avenge all the demons.

153
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,220
You're safe.

154
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,660
Wait here.

155
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,340
I'll get you some more medicine.

156
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,740
I'll be right back.

157
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,340
Youyou?

158
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,660
Youyou?

159
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I'll kill you!

160
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,140
Youyou!

161
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
