=My Foxfoe Queen=

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,460
So you really are a fox demon.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,339
This is the Demon-locking Rope.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,860
It will lock any demon tightly
once it senses demonic power.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,219
Then you are a demon,

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,419
why doesn't it lock you?

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,700
Stop quibbling.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,580
Show your true form at once.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,540
You want to see my true form?

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,739
Sure.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,540
Then you can strip me naked.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,660
I don't have hands right now,
it's inconvenient.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,419
What did you say?

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,740
I said,

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,380
you're dressed so provocatively,

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,179
and you've hung me up like this.

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,460
You wouldn't be trying
to do something to me, would you?

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,780
You really have some nerve.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,380
Not afraid of being seen here
by outsiders.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,100
Ah.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,260
You're fainting already?

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,260
Can you not?

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,780
Something's wrong.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,539
I only have a fragment of my soul now.

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,860
I have no demonic power either.

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,860
Why would
the Demon-locking Rope lock me?

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,660
Could it be...

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,619
So it really is because of this.

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,620
I don't need magic then, right?

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,739
Use this.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,660
It can still take your inner core.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,020
Why is

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,340
his heart chamber so hard?

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,300
So cold.

37
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,620
Where am I?

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,860
I went to the wrong place.

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,539
(Xiling Xuan's Heart Chamber)

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,060
Why is his heart

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,100
wrapped in solid ice?

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,780
The inner core.

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,060
It's so hard.

44
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,500
Looks like to take his inner core,

45
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,260
I have to melt all this ice first.

46
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,380
What are you doing?

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,660
Doing what?

48
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,660
Of course, to make you pay
for what you've done.

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,620
What?

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,860
You...

51
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,340
Your Lordship, you're awake.

52
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,259
You demoness!

53
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,660
Dared to burn me!

54
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,500
I never burned you!

55
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,219
Your Lordship.

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,260
Did you have a nightmare?

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,980
A nightmare?

58
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,539
This morning,

59
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,059
I was walking in the rear garden

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,739
and saw you collapsed in the grass.

61
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,940
So I helped you back up.

62
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,139
You kept shouting about catching demons.

63
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,539
Had a nightmare, right?

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,460
But last night in Xuantian Cave,

65
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
you were clearly locked
by the Demon-locking Rope.

66
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,940
I was in the palace hall all night.

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,539
Besides, I drank the Emperor's
Demon-revealing Potion.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,900
So why are you still calling me a demon?

69
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,780
Sorry, Your Highness.

70
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,660
I was not in my right mind.

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,259
(Yes.)

72
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,140
(Luckily you weren't
in your right mind.)

73
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,380
(Otherwise I really couldn't have fixed it.)

74
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,580
It's okay.

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,619
What happened yesterday was so scary.

76
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,260
Anyone would be shaken.

77
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,700
It's normal that you reacted this way.

78
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,700
How could I blame you?

79
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,140
(Can't even burn through it.)

80
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,140
(Looks like I need another way.)

81
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,419
Rest well for now.

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,300
I will visit you another day.

83
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,460
Why is there a burnt smell?

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,019
Your Lordship.

85
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,860
His Majesty summons you to the study.

86
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,620
Understood.

87
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm coming right away.

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,300
Your Highness, you should take medicine.

89
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,939
I'm fine.

90
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,060
No need to take it.

91
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,539
That won't do.

92
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,379
His Majesty specifically instructed it.

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,779
Your Highness, you caught a cold
some days ago,

94
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,900
and you must take some
warming medicinal soup.

95
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,260
(Warming medicinal soup?)

96
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,940
(Exactly.)

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,579
(Since the fire can't get in,)

98
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,900
(why not let him warm himself
from inside?)

99
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,219
Do you have any medicine

100
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,060
that makes a man's whole body warm
after drinking?

101
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,660
Makes a man's whole body warm?

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,260
A warmth that comes from deep inside.

103
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,380
(Isn't that the Hehuan Powder?)

104
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,779
(The Empress must be grateful
for His Majesty's care,)

105
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,980
(wanting to bear His Majesty
a little prince.)

106
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,260
(The Empress is just too shy
to say it directly.)

107
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,419
I understand, of course I have it.

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,260
I'll get it for you right away.

109
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,860
Why is she laughing?

110
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,860
Killed 306 Yao Mountain snake demons.

111
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,499
All their inner cores are here.

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,940
Please take a look.

113
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,260
As a demon,

114
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,060
you slaughtered your own kind.

115
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,900
You really are a bastard.

116
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,740
No.

117
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,500
You're a beast.

118
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,460
After all, back then,

119
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,780
you personally killed your own Mother.

120
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,780
Your Majesty.

121
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,180
Brother.

122
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,980
You're finally awake.

123
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,060
Why am I here?

124
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,180
I lost control again.

125
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,180
It's okay.

126
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,219
It's all over now.

127
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,700
All over?

128
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,300
It's all over now.

129
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,900
This time,

130
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,100
how many people did I kill?

131
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,980
A whole village.

132
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,220
No.

133
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,060
That village never really existed.

134
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,700
You did nothing.

135
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,220
You did nothing.

136
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,940
You're fine.

137
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,900
You're fine.

138
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,459
Your Majesty.

139
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,700
It's okay.

140
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm a demon.

141
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,980
I killed so many people again.

142
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,859
I deserve to die.

143
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,100
I really deserve to die.

144
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,060
It's okay.

145
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,900
My inner core is gone.

146
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm going to die.

147
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,260
I don't want to die.

148
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,780
Wait a moment.

149
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,019
With my half core protecting you,

150
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,459
even if you face great danger
in the future,

151
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,860
you will not die.

152
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,779
Thank you.

153
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,180
I'll remember you.

154
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,060
