00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:23,700
(Xiling Kingdom Palace)

4
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,350
(Xiling Kingdom's Lord Wing,
Xiling Xuan)

5
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:07,420
(Xiling Kingdom's Empress, Jiang Xin'er)

6
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,540
Go.

7
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,740
Invite His Majesty to bathe with me.

8
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,340
Yes, Your Highness.

9
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,220
Your Highness?

10
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,940
Your Highness?

11
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,620
You're not her.

12
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,820
I…

13
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,070
(Xiling Kingdom's King, Xiling Heng)

14
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,060
Your Majesty.

15
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,499
Your Majesty.

16
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,059
I was bathing.

17
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,660
He suddenly jumped into the pool
and tried to bathe with me.

18
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,499
Such humiliation,

19
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,060
I'd rather die.

20
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,980
I was chasing a fox demon.

22
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,780
I caught it in the pool,

23
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,740
but when I surfaced,
it had taken her form.

24
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,220
Please, investigate clearly.

25
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,219
The Empress and I were newly wed.

26
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,660
We haven't shared a bed yet.

27
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,860
If you like her,

28
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,340
she can accompany you tonight.

29
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,099
You jest, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,260
I wouldn't dare.

31
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,260
Your Majesty.

32
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,460
Don't worry.

33
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,060
No one will know.

34
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,620
Your Majesty.

35
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,220
I chased the demon here

36
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,420
and bumped into her by accident.

37
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,140
Please punish me.

38
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,140
If it's a misunderstanding,

39
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,860
why would I punish you?

40
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,619
Here, wear this.

41
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,140
Don't catch a cold.

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,660
I can't wear your dragon robe.

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,340
I'll take my leave.

44
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,420
There's another demon.

45
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,740
Yue! Run!

46
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,340
There seems to be a fox demon
in the palace.

47
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,419
Please,

48
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,620
be cautious.

49
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Did he do anything to you?

50
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,340
No.

51
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,419
Nothing.

52
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,580
Good.

53
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,980
You belong to me.

54
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
No one else may touch you.

55
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,780
(I came from Mount Yao)

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,100
(My fox clan never harmed humans.)

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,980
(Two days ago,)

58
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,139
(we were slaughtered by Xiling Xuan)

59
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,580
(to the last one.)

60
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,339
(My family and friends)

61
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,820
(all died by his hand.)

62
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,580
(He dug out my inner core)

63
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,380
(and I reverted to fox form,)

64
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,980
(my soul was about to fade away.)

65
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,580
(But Heaven had mercy,)

66
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,420
(the holy water of the fox clan
saved my soul.)

67
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,180
(Looking at the corpses of my kin,)

68
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,780
(I realized)

69
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,420
(I am the last survivor of Mount Yao.)

70
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,340
(I must avenge my clan.)

71
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,580
(Xiling Xuan.)

72
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,020
(I, Tushan Yue)

73
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,700
(will tear you to pieces)

74
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,220
(for my people's revenge.)

75
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,980
Fox demon!

76
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,660
I will catch you!

77
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,660
(Five petals)

78
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,500
(mean I can only
use my power five times.)

79
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,180
(After that,)

80
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,580
(my soul will vanish.)

81
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,580
(Before that,)

82
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
(I must kill Xiling Xuan.)

83
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,579
Your Higness.

84
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,060
Lord Wing seeks audience.

85
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,980
Let him in.

86
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,220
Yes.

87
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,379
Lord Wing.

88
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,899
What brings you here so early?

89
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,660
I was rude last night and startled you.

90
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,980
I came today to apologize.

91
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,460
Please accept these gifts.

92
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,979
We're family,

93
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,780
no need to be so formal.

94
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,659
Yue.

95
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,820
This lip balm color suits you perfectly.

96
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,459
Yue.

97
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,500
These roasted drumsticks are all yours.

98
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,219
Yue.

99
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,699
I've just brewed lots of plum wine.

100
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,180
Come taste it with me.

101
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,020
(It's them.)

102
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,580
Does Your Highness
not like these furs?

103
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
I'm not interested in furs.

104
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,260
But haven't you always loved them?

105
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,220
Why the change now?

106
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,100
It's not that I dislike them.

107
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,620
It's just that it's midsummer,

108
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,659
they're a bit too heavy and warm.

109
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,780
Then why were you crying just now?

110
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,139
Because it was only
a small misunderstanding

111
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,820
between us.

112
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,939
Yet you sent such precious gifts.

113
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,020
I was truly touched.

114
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,299
Put them away quickly.

115
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,179
We can wear them in winter.

116
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,500
Yes, Your Highness.

117
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,860
These three are just ordinary quality.

118
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,300
Tonight when I execute
the other fox demon,

119
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,700
I'll skin its pelt

120
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,020
and bring it to you.

121
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,699
You mean,
there's still one fox demon alive?

122
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,820
Yes.

123
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,259
That fox has fiery red fur,

124
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,860
especially bright in color.

125
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,019
I believe

126
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,379
you'll surely like it.

127
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,620
(Fiery-red fur…)

128
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,380
Yue!

129
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,980
Run!

130
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,860
(It's Tongtong.)

131
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,339
Where is she now?

132
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,739
You may not know,

133
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,339
but every captured demon

134
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,380
is imprisoned deep beneath the palace,
in the Soul-Suppressing Prison.

135
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,780
Would you like to come see it with me?

136
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,099
I'd like to,

137
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,700
but knowing it's a demon,

138
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,420
I feel a bit afraid.

139
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,980
Better not.

140
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,979
Very well.

141
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,700
Then I'll take my leave.

142
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,979
Once I've skinned it,

143
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,420
I'll bring the fur to you.

144
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,780
Mm.

145
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,780
(I can't let another clansman be killed.)

146
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,220
(I must rescue Tongtong.)

147
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:52,420
(Soul-Suppressing Prison)

148
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
(My powers won't work here.)

149
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,980
(No wonder they lock demons
in this place.)

150
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,700
(There's a barrier!)

151
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,580
(Whatever it takes,)

152
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,380
(I must save Tongtong first)

153
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,860
(Tongtong.)

154
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,980
It's you.
