00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,459
Your time

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,540
has come.

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,180
Assassin! Protect His Majesty!

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,539
Liusu!

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,859
She has help.

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,699
Kill her!

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,900
Yes, Your Majesty!

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,739
Tushan Yue!

12
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,900
Get out of there!

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,380
Liusu!

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,580
Go...

15
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,540
To protect His Lordship's beloved...

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,980
I've completed my mission.

17
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,540
Liusu.

18
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,140
I will avenge you now!

19
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,539
(I will use
my last bit of power to kill you.)

20
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,740
Fret not.

21
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
From this day forward,

22
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,100
he will never wake up again.

23
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,700
(But after using my last power, I'll die.)

24
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,940
(Then, there will be no one left
to save Yaya.)

25
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,980
(He'll be controlled by the Gu forever
and will never awaken again.)

26
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,859
Beast!

27
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,940
I'll kill you!

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,660
I'll kill you!

29
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,340
Don't even think
about hurting her again.

30
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,539
Yaya...

31
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,580
Come on.

32
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,940
Let's go home.

33
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,460
(He knows I've been controlling him.)

34
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,140
(Why didn't he kill me?)

35
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,420
Yaya.

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,380
Yue, you're awake!

37
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,940
I'll help you.

38
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,500
Slowly.

39
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,180
Youyou.

40
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,740
Am I

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,220
back home?

42
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Yes.

43
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,940
My body...

44
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,259
Shouldn't it...

45
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,019
Yes.

46
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,139
Yue.

47
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,300
You were dying after using

48
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,940
your last bit of power.

49
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,940
It was

50
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,580
Yaya.

51
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,060
Yaya saved you with his inner core.

52
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,340
Yue,

53
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't know
what the underworld is like.

54
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,100
I don't know if it's a scary place.

55
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,060
You are kind

56
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,140
and warm-hearted.

57
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,780
What if you offend those evil spirits

58
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,300
and they band together to target you?

59
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,086

Before returning your inner core,

91
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,380
he dug new graves for the demons he killed.

92
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,780
I think

93
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,219
it's his way of repenting

94
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,340
for what he did.

95
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,180
Yaya...

96
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,180

would turn out like this.

Yue,

98
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,300
Yaya will surely watch over you
from the other side.

99
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,700
All of this is because of Xiling Heng.

100
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,260
If not for him,

101
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,500
none of this would have happened.

102
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,660
I will kill Xiling Heng

103
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,460
and avenge everyone.

104
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,339
What's happening?

105
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,419
Why is it glowing?

106
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,419
What's going on?

107
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,700
What's happening?

108
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,700
What is this?

109
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,860
He's resurrected!

110
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,100
Yaya.

111
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,700
Yue.

112
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,580
I've returned.

113
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,300
Yaya,

114
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,099
you're alive!

115
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,219
This is wonderful!

116
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,700
Reborn from the flame of purgatory!

117
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,340
He's

118
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,099
a phoenix!

119
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,219
What?

120
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,020
I recognize him now.

121
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,899
He's the son of A'Luan,

122
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,500
the guardian phoenix of Mount Yao.

123
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,859
He's A'Luan's child.

124
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,540
No wonder he looked familiar.
But after everything he did to us...

125
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm sorry to everyone.

126
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,740
As the son of a phoenix,

127
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,860
I will take responsibility
for what I did.

128
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,099
He was controlled.

129
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,339
But he's done so much for us now.

130
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,259
I believe in him.

131
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,180
I believe in him too.

132
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,180
Sir,

133
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,860
do you know where my mother is buried?

134
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,300
Follow me.

135
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,780
She was Mount Yao's guardian phoenix,

136
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
yet only an unmarked grave
stands for her.

137
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,540
Sir,

138
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,700
how did my mother die?

139
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,099
You killed her.

140
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,539
What?

141
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,140
How is that possible?

142
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,539
I witnessed with my own eyes

143
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,099
how your mother sealed
the wicked demon Ying Zhao,

144
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
gravely injuring her core.

145
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,140
She used the last of her power
from her phoenix rebirth.

146
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,379
You killed her

147
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,979
when she was

148
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,780
at her weakest.

149
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,619
At that time,

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,500
your eyes glowed red.

151
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,660
It was the Gu.

152
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,059
The phoenix A'Luan

153
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,219
helped the world rid itself
of the wicked demon Ying Zhao

154
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,419
and protected
both the human and demon realms.

155
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,900
Yet, in the end,
she died by her own son's hand.

156
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,100
Such a tragedy indeed.

157
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,900
I'm sorry,

158
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,460
Mother.

159
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,300
I will find the true mastermind

160
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,060
and make her pay the price she deserves.

161
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,380
But isn't

162
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,420
the mastermind Xiling Heng?

163
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,140
At first, I thought so too.

164
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,700
Until that night when I saw
the Former Empress's portrait,

165
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,780
I realized
there might be more behind this.

166
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,300
The Former Empress?

167
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,460
What happened?

168
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,580
The Former Empress Duanmu Jin

169
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,060
is Ghost Granny,
the masterful Gu practitioner.

170
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,300
Ghost Granny?

171
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,780
How could it be her?

172
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,900
Looking back
on your previous assessment,

173
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,859
I suspect the Former Empress

174
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,060
was the one who put the Gu
in the glutinous rice cakes I often ate.

175
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,940
Once,

176
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,180
after eating,

177
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,659
I noticed that glutinous rice cake

178
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,139
tasted different from before.

179
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,219
I felt unusually excited afterward.

180
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,140
After that, I remember nothing else.

181
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,460
That's probably

182
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,500
when I was poisoned with the Gu.

183
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,659
But...

184
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,379
As you said,

185
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,620
the Former Empress should have
held no enmity towards you.

186
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Why would she do such a thing?

187
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,019
And why

188
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,180
has she hidden her identity

189
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,460
all these years?

190
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,100
I'm afraid

191
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,020
only Ghost Granny knows the full truth.

192
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,980
Mother,

193
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,740
I will get to the bottom of this.

194
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
You won't have died in vain.

195
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,220
This is my mother's
Divine Phoenix Sword.

196
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,300
She used it

197
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,580
to defeat Ying Zhao.

198
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,580
Look!

199
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,780
So, your father is...

200
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
That gives her

201
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,700
even less reason to hate you.

202
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,620
Do you remember the last two sentences
Ghost Granny told me?

203
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,300
Driven mad by love,

204
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,460
heaven's mandate defied.

205
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,140
I get it now.
