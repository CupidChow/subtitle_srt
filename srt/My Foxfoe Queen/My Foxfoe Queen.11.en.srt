3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,900
Xiling Xuan.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,020
I've warned you time and time again.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,420
But you never seem to have any remorse.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,179
You've crossed the line
with your sister-in-law.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,140
What you've done is beyond decency.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,300
Do you really think
I can't deal with you?

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,940
Xiling Xuan.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I never wanted things to come to this.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,580
I've given you plenty of chances.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,900
But you keep making the same mistakes.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,700
You've truly let me down.

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,300
I know this punishment won't change you.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,100
But, I want you
to remember how it feels.

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,580
You must be feeling

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,500
a lot of pain.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,180
If you dare go near
your sister-in-law again,

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,100
I won't hesitate
to let her share your pain.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,340
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,020
You have my word

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,980
that I'll never
approach Her Highness again.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,220
That's my good brother.

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,020
(Yue.)

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,180
(To keep you safe,)

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,180
(I can never let you find out)

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,820
(that I am Yaya.)

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,500
Your Lordship.

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,300
Are you all right?

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,700
Liusu.

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,100
Take good care of the Empress.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,300
She's still weak.

33
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,499
She needs time to recover.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,700
But what about you, Your Lordship?

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,500
I'll be fine.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,340
I'll be fine.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,500
Your Lordship.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,100
I don't understand.

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,139
Why did your attitude toward her

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,900
change so suddenly?

41
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,980
Just remember this.

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,380
She matters more than anything to me

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,500
in this life.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,300
Understood, Your Lordship.

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,139
From this day on,

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,419
she will also be

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,700
the one I cherish the most.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,180
Keep her safe.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,700
Do everything you can for her.

50
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,660
Don't let anyone hurt her.

51
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,100
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

52
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,540
I'll remember that.

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,180
That can't be right.

54
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,779
Last night,

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,020
I clearly...

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,179
Your Highness,

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,700
you're finally awake.

58
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,419
Wasn't I injured
by Xiling Xuan last night?

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,900
Why am I all healed now?

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,899
It was His Lordship.

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,940
He used the blood
from his wrist to save you.

62
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,780
(Why would Xiling Xuan save me?)

63
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,100
(Hasn't he always wanted me dead?)

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,780
Where is he now?

65
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,740
His Lordship is...

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,579
You shouldn't go looking for him.

67
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,619
How could I not?

68
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,779
That vile demon hurt
so many people last night.

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,579
I have to find him.

70
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,700
Your Highness.

71
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,300
His Lordship isn't a demon.

72
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,540
Liusu.

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,700
Wasn't he the one
who murdered your family?

74
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,900
Do you not want me
to avenge your family?

75
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,219
Your Highness,

76
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,059
I...

77
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,419
I only wish what's best for you.

78
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,979
And for His Lordship too.

79
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,740
Please don't go to him.

80
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,500
Liusu, get up.

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,500
Sit down.

82
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,700
Liusu,

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,300
you're a good girl.

84
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,660
But I really don't get it.

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,500
Why would you still serve him?

86
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,500
So, you already knew.

87
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,300
I saw through

88
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,980
your little tricks.

89
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,140
I grew up with His Lordship
since we were little.

90
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,779
He's gentle by nature.

91
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,100
He's no demon.

92
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,379
But he's hurt so many people.

93
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,539
His Lordship has been ill
since he was a boy.

94
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,139
Sometimes he loses control
for no apparent reason.

95
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,139
During those times,

96
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,619
he's done things he shouldn't have.

97
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,500
But it was never his intent.

98
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
He told you all that, didn't he?

99
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,100
Your Highness.

100
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,739
Please believe me.

101
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,900
He's not what you think he is.

102
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,100
I know exactly
what kind of person he is.

103
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,580
Better than you ever could.

104
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,579
Your Lordship.

105
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,900
It's me.

106
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,700
Your Lordship.

107
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,419
Liusu told me

108
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,059
that you saved me last night.

109
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,180
So I came to express my gratitude.

110
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,980
There's no need for that.

111
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,460
Please, go back.

112
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,140
Why won't you even let me see you?

113
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,100
If you dare go near
your sister-in-law again,

114
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,540
I won't hesitate
to let her share your pain.

115
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,540
Your Highness.

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,460
You and I are bound by family ties.

117
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,660
You should go back.

118
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,059
But you saved me.

119
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,340
I can't just leave
without thanking you properly.

120
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,940
(Yue.)

121
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,340
(I'm sorry.)

122
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,740
(I can't see you again.)

123
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,980
(Why won't he see me all of a sudden?)

124
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,579
(If this keeps up,)

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,980
(how can I kiss him?)

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,779
You hurt some people last night.

127
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,259
No one can treat them now.

128
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,979
They're waiting outside the city.

129
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,459
If you really think all this

130
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,900
has nothing to do with you,

131
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,540
then stay locked in this room forever.

132
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,499
Look.

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,539
The scar's gone.

134
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,780
He's like a living divine.

135
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,139
Our savior!

136
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,379
You saved our lives!

137
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,539
Thank you, kind spirit.

138
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,859
You saved our whole village.

139
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,500
Thank you, heavenly one.

140
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,900
Please wait, divine one.

141
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,419
Thank you for helping us.

142
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,419
There are still children
who need treatment.

143
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,379
Would you come with me to help them?

144
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Lead the way.

145
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,379
You've saved so many people today.

146
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,260
Looks like Liusu was right.

147
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,340
Your Lordship truly has a kind heart.

148
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,340
So, you already knew it was me.

149
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,140
Isn't this place beautiful?

150
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,340
It is.

151
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,140
Why did Your Highness bring me here?

152
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,940
Well, you refused to see me.

153
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,900
I just want to ask.

154
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,180
Why did you save me last night?

155
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
The wounded are healed now.

156
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,740
I should be going.

157
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,259
Don't tell me you saved me

158
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,580
because you like me.

159
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,979
Yue.

160
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,579
Why do you always like playing with me?

161
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,779
Because you're fun.

162
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,459
That's not it.

163
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,579
You like me, don't you?

164
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,419
Silly boy.

165
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,779
You do like me.

166
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,339
When I grow up, I'm going to marry you.

167
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
We'll talk about that
when you've actually grown up.
