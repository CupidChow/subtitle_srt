00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:13,525
=My Foxfoe Queen=

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,179
Doctor Zhang.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,099
I read in this book

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,299
about a kind of gu worm
called the Mother-Child Gu.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,459
It says it can control a person's mind.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,180
I find it quite interesting.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,579
But in this book,

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,779
the methods of casting
and removing the Gu

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,700
are not described in detail.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,219
So I wanted to ask you, Doctor Zhang,

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,020
are you familiar
with the Mother-Child Gu?

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,499
Your Highness,

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,019
I know nothing at all

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,780
about the art of Gu.

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,660
However...

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,940
However what?

18
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,419
But I do know

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
of a woman on the outskirts of the city.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,899
It's said she's well-versed in Gu arts.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,179
But she's moody and unpredictable,

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,899
and loves using Gu on people.

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,699
Anyone who's dealt with her

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,020
has been more or less afflicted.

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,979
I advise Your Highness

26
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,900
not to seek her out.

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,659
I am the Empress.

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,620
She wouldn't dare use Gu on me.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,340
Well...

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,020
Even the late emperor was afflicted
by her Gu a few times.

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,419
But the late emperor did not punish her.

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,899
Instead, he built her a residence

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,700
on the outskirts.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,419
Is that so?

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,700
Why was that?

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,779
I heard

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,020
she once saved the late emperor's life.

38
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,060
What's her name?

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,819
No one knows her real name.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,299
People just call her

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,740
Ghost Granny.

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,939
Ghost Granny?

43
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,980
Yes.

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,419
I was just curious.

45
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,619
It was a casual question.

46
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,220
Thank you, Doctor Zhang.

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,100
I take my leave.

48
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,420
Yue,

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,700
do you think the one who cast the Gu

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,300
could be the Ghost Granny?

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,419
Impossible.

52
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,979
The book says

53
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,179
the Gu caster must stay within five li

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,300
of the person being controlled.

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,700
So the caster must be inside the palace.

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,180
Ghost Granny lives on the outskirts,

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,500
dozens of li away from the palace.

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,900
It shouldn't be her.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,179
Never mind.

60
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,779
I'll have to ask her myself.

61
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,900
No.

62
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,579
She loves using Gu on people,

63
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,740
it's too dangerous.

64
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,940
Let me go instead.

65
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,019
You stay here and wait.

66
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,140
I'll be back soon.

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,940
Alright.

68
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,260
Is anyone there?

69
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,139
If you want to die,

70
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,580
open it.

71
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,219
I mean no offense.

72
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,460
My apologies.

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,739
I've come to see Ghost Granny.

74
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,180
May I ask if she's here?

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,019
Your eyes and brows

76
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,260
look just like your father's.

77
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,620
So you are Ghost Granny.

78
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,419
I am Xiling Xuan.

79
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,260
I heard you're skilled in Gu arts,

80
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,100
so I've come to ask you a few things.

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,140
There are thousands of Gu.

82
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,180
Which kind are you asking about?

83
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,100
The Mother-Child Gu.

84
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,180
Mother-Child Gu.

85
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,100
Mother-Child Gu,

86
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,379
Mother and child connected,

87
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,620
bound through life and death,

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,219
love leads to madness,

89
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,860
fate has been defied.

90
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,100
Please, could you be more specific?

91
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,419
Before I change my mind
about killing you,

92
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,580
you'd better leave now.

93
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,020
Looks like Lord Yi has begun
to suspect something.

94
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,940
So what?

95
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,059
This Gu cannot be undone.

96
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,620
There's nothing he can do.

97
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,539
But His Majesty's had a headache

98
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,180
since last night.

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,779
If no cure is found soon,

100
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,020
I'm afraid

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,660
something bad will happen.

102
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,540
Heng has fallen under
a demon's Charm Spell.

103
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,339
The only way to break it

104
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,460
is to sever all feelings of love.

105
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,940
Sever all love?

106
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,059
From this day on,

107
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,780
he will never love anyone
in this world again.

108
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,419
But if so,

109
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,339
wouldn't His Majesty...

110
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,860
Heng is an Emperor.

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,820
He cannot let love weaken his will.

112
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,419
Grind this insect into powder,

113
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,300
and brew it into medicine for him.

114
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,019
He'll recover soon enough.

115
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,380
Yes, Your Grace.

116
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:44,979
(Former Empress, Duanmu Jin)

117
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,699
This title

118
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,180
feels like something from a past life.

119
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,700
Don't call me that again.

120
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,180
Yes.

121
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,499
But I don't understand,

122
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,019
after all these years,

123
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,540
why won't you acknowledge His Majesty?

124
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,340
Just take good care of Heng.

125
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,540
Yes.

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,779
(Only if Heng believes I was killed
by demons,)

127
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,580
(will he bear an unshakable hatred
toward them,)

128
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,860
(so he won't repeat
the late emperor's mistake)

129
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,659
(of falling in love with a demon.)

130
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,540
(Only then can he destroy them
without mercy.)

131
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,380
You useless physicians
of the Imperial Medical Court!

132
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,500
If my Mother were still alive,

133
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,660
my headaches would've been cured long ago!

134
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Get out!

135
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,100
All of you, get out of my sight!

136
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,660
Your Majesty,

137
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,260
I have found a divine healer hidden
among the people.

138
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,579
You're afflicted
by a demon's Charm Spell,

139
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,659
which is why you're so obsessed
with the Empress.

140
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,220
Nonsense!

141
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,820
My love for Xin'er

142
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,579
is true and from the heart!

143
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,340
It is not true love, Your Majesty.

144
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,899
It's because you've begun to doubt

145
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,219
the reality of that love,

146
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,939
that your head aches so painfully.

147
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,860
The Charm Spell is tormenting you!

148
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,979
You...

149
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,140
If you dare deny my love
for the Empress again,

150
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,859
I'll kill you!

151
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,980
Your Majesty!

152
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,740
Your Majesty!

153
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,420
I brought two elixirs
from the divine healer.

154
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,419
The blue one will make you sever
all feelings of love,

155
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,699
cut every emotional tie

156
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,339
and cure the headache completely.

157
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,379
The red one only relieves the pain,

158
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,660
but cannot heal it.

159
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,180
Your Majesty.

160
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,980
What did you give me to drink?

161
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,740
Why does my head hurt even more?

162
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,339
Your Majesty.

163
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,859
Actually, the red one is the potion
to sever love.

164
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,780
You...

165
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,940
How dare you deceive me?

166
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,299
I didn't dare, Your Majesty.
I did it for your own good!

167
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,219
Only this way

168
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,179
can your illness truly be cured.

169
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,780
Only then will the demon's spell
leave your heart!

170
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,259
I'll kill you!

171
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,500
I'll kill you!

172
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,979
(Your Majesty.)

173
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,380
(You will one day understand
the Former Empress's intentions.)

174
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,100
So that's all she said?

175
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,660
That old witch truly is unpredictable.

176
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,340
After saying just those four lines,
she drove me out.

177
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,420
Yue,

178
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,820
what do you think

179
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,300
she meant by those words?

180
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,219
Mother and child connected,

181
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,420
bound through life and death.

182
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,620
Could it mean

183
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,940
the parasite is divided
into mother and child worms?

184
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,739
There are thousands of child worms

185
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,459
living inside the controlled person.

186
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,700
And the mother worm

187
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,740
is held by the controller.

188
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,740
If the mother worm dies,

189
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,860
the child worms should vanish too.

190
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,979
Then what about "love leads to madness"

191
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,580
and "fate has been defied"?

192
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,740
Could it mean

193
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,300
that the controlled one

194
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,579
deeply loves the controller
who holds the mother worm,

195
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,420
to the point of losing all reason?

196
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,580
That's impossible.

197
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,900
I just can't make sense of it.

198
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,259
But

199
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,099
I think

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,379
the time you were cursed

201
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,899
was probably when you came
from Mount Yao to the palace.

202
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,979
Think carefully.

203
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,020
Who approached you back then?

204
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,620
When I came from Mount Yao
to the palace,

205
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,260
no one dared to approach me.

206
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,339
It was said
that the Former Empress Duanmu Jin,

207
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,620
my Brother's mother gave that order.

208
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,980
Why would she do that?

209
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,539
Maybe she feared demons.

210
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,419
So even until her death,

211
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,940
we never met.

212
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,580
But,

213
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,219
my Brother wasn't afraid.

214
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,780
He would always sneak to see me,

215
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,979
and even brought

216
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,620
my favorite glutinous rice cakes.

217
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,659
Glutinous rice cakes?

218
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,780
Mm.

219
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,580
The parasite larva looks
like glutinous rice.

220
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,379
It could've been hidden
in those rice cakes!

221
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,100
Could it be Xiling Heng...

222
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,020
Impossible.

223
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,099
He was just a child back then.

224
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,780
How could a child do such a thing?

225
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,260
Besides,

226
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,259
he's always treated me so kindly.

227
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,459
All these years,

228
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,580
he's cared for me like a father.

229
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,660
How could he ever harm me?

230
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,180
Anyway,

231
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,660
it can't be him.

232
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,060
(Yaya is pure by nature,)

233
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,580
(maybe he hasn't seen
through everything yet.)

234
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,820
(Since Xiling Heng
often visited him as a child,)

235
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,620
(even if it wasn't him,)

236
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,580
(he must've seen something.)

237
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,899
Your Majesty,

238
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,380
how do you feel?

239
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
That miracle doctor's medicine

240
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,860
really works.

241
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,219
Then, Your Majesty,

242
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,579
how do you feel now

243
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,860
when you think of the Empress?

244
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,179
A mere woman,

245
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,700
what else could I feel?

246
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,299
What I want to know now is

247
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,580
which demon cast that Charm Spell on me?

248
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,100
Your Majesty,
you're finally clear-headed!

249
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,259
I've always thought
the Empress was a demon,

250
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,300
she must be the one who bewitched you.

251
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,659
But she already drank
the Demon-revealing Potion.

252
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,259
She didn't show her true form.

253
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,139
But if she's just a remnant soul

254
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,979
attached to the Former Empress's body,

255
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,780
then of course she'd have no form.

256
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,299
Your Majesty,

257
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,859
do you still remember
what Lord Yi said?

258
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,139
The Empress is a demon,

259
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,060
a remnant soul of a white fox.

260
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,460
Your Majesty,

261
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,139
are you saying the Empress?

262
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,619
She really is a fox demon.

263
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,819
Your Majesty, she really is a demon!

264
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,699
Your Majesty,

265
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,259
this is the fox's body.

266
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,419
Once her soul returns to it,
you'll understand everything.

267
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,059
Out of respect for our marriage,

268
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,460
I'll give you a proper burial.

269
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,820
Your Majesty.

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,859
I'll listen to you.

271
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,899
Reward him.

272
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,939
I'll listen to you.

273
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,980
Let her go.

274
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,260
Very well.

275
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,820
It seems

276
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,300
I've misunderstood Lord Yi.

277
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
That fox demon

278
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,340
truly deserves to die.

279
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,859
Your Majesty.

280
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,540
The Empress seeks audience.

281
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,860
Let her in.
