2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,379
There are boundaries.

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,020
We shouldn't meet again.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,940
(Xiling Xuan.)

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,820
(You really think
I have no way of seeing you?)

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,060
Your Highness.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,220
Here's what you asked for.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,220
Good.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,499
You may rest now.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,339
Unless I call for you,

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,620
don't come in.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,140
Your Highness, it's already so late.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,740
What are you still doing up?

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,899
In a while,

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,699
two of my friends are coming over.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,619
I plan to give them a proper welcome.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,819
Your friends?

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,940
Mm.

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,979
Off you go.

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,779
My friends don't have the best tempers.

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,939
If they see a stranger,
things might get messy.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,819
Oh.

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,940
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,700
(Xiling Xuan.)

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,420
(You may have saved me with your blood,)

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,619
(but the blood feud of my clan)

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,900
(will not go unavenged.)

29
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,179
Your Lordship.

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,579
Something's wrong.

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,699
What happened?

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,539
The Empress said

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,060
two of her friends are
coming to see her tonight.

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,539
But aren't her friends

35
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,020
all demons?

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,420
(What is she up to this time?)

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,339
It's fine.

38
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,820
Just keep an eye on her.

39
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,860
As long as she doesn't
come looking for me.

40
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,140
Yes, Your Lordship.

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,579
Who's there?

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,820
Who's out there?

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,620
A demon!

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,980
A demon!

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,539
Why are you so late?

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,299
Carp and I are starving.

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,979
There was a small delay.

48
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,939
Thank you for waiting.

49
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,099
So, the palace is really as you said?

50
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,939
Full of delicious things to eat?

51
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,939
Don't worry.

52
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,899
I know this palace inside and out.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,420
Tell me, White Tiger and Carp,

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,820
what would you like to try?

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,059
It's true, Your Lordship.

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,539
We really saw demons!

57
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,299
When I walked through the corridor,

58
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,699
I saw a tiger.

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,939
When I drew water,

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,659
the entire well turned red with blood.

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,859
And inside that well,

62
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,700
there seemed to be a huge fish.

63
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,700
(Could it really be true?)

64
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,579
Your Lordship!

65
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,059
I saw them!

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,220
I really saw them!

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,179
There were two!

68
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,939
A tiger demon

69
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,979
and a carp demon.

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,099
I even heard them say

71
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,940
they're going to eat humans tonight.

72
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,979
Where are they now?

73
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,460
Over at the old palace.

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,499
Stay here.

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,820
Lock all the doors and windows.

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,979
Don't go out.

77
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,100
Yes, Your Lordship.

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,300
(Could this be a summoning circle?)

79
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,700
Got you.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,859
Yue, aren't you supposed to be smart?

81
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,499
How did you walk straight into a trap?

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,899
You were crying so hard just now.

83
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,579
Humans are terrible.

84
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,500
They are even more cunning than foxes.

85
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,659
A trap that can make
a little fox cry like that

86
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,739
needs a special name

87
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,379
that really stands out.

88
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,339
How about

89
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,539
"The Little Fox's Tears"?

90
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,900
Stop making fun of me!

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,499
"The Little Fox's Tears"?

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,499
You crybaby bird!

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
I'll show you who's laughing!

94
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,620
"The Little Fox's Tears"?

95
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,540
You...

96
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,500
You are actually

97
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,020
Yaya?

98
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,620
You are mistaken.

99
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,739
I'm not Yaya.

100
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,020
But you just said
"The Little Fox's Tears".

101
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,060
Only Yaya would know about that.

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,620
Your Highness.

103
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,220
You're holding a knife.

104
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,220
Are you going to kill me?

105
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,700
If you don't explain yourself,
I'll kill you right now!

106
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,620
Go ahead.

107
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,220
Kill me.

108
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,820
What I said earlier was about

109
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,580
the tiger and the carp.

110
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,220
What?

111
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,500
I heard that tonight,

112
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,299
a tiger and a carp demon

113
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,980
plan to devour people in the palace.

114
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,300
So, I came here to catch them.

115
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,779
As for what you said

116
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,460
about the Little Fox's Tears,

117
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,780
Your Highness,

118
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,420
you must have misheard me.

119
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,060
Perhaps this Yaya means a lot to you.

120
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,820
But I am truly not him.

121
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,820
You really misheard.

122
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,299
Since there are no demons here,

123
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,460
then I

124
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,060
will take my leave.

125
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,100
(Yue.)

126
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,220
(Maybe it's better this way.)

127
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,380
(At least we can live in peace.)

128
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,020
(Could I really be mistaken?)

129
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,419
(But he and Yaya)

130
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,300
(have so many things in common.)

131
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,539
Ten Directions Heavenly Venerates.

132
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,260
All beings are like grains of sand.

133
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,780
Yue.

134
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,700
(But if he really were Yaya,)

135
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,540
(how could he have slaughtered
my entire fox clan?)

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,619
(He even took
the last half of my inner core)

137
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,699
(from my body.)

138
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,420
(His Lordship isn't an evil demon.)

139
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,819
He's been ill since childhood.

140
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,220
At times, he loses control for no reason.

141
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,460
During those moments,

142
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,899
(he's done many things
he shouldn't have.)

143
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,740
(But it was never his intention.)

144
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,980
(Could it be)

145
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,420
