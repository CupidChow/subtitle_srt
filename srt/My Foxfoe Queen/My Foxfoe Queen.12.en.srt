00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:13,525
=My Foxfoe Queen=

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,099
(My brother.)

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,260
(I swear I'll never
go near your wife again.)

5
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,300
You kissed me and just left?

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,940
What a jerk.

7
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,700
Could it be

8
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,500
that he actually likes me?

9
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,540
Heng.

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,540
Mother.

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,300
You're here.

12
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,220
Heng.

13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,900
Matters of the court are important,

14
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,179
but you must also beware

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,779
of trouble brewing at home.

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,460
Trouble?

17
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,100
Don't worry, Mother.

18
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,180
Xin'er

19
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,500
belongs to me alone.

20
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,220
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,700
You wanted to see me?

22
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,619
I intend to share chambers
with the Empress.

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,940
What do you think of that?

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,620
That's between you and Your Highness.

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,340
How could I possibly comment?

26
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,540
Then, I'll give you a task.

27
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,699
Go tell your sister-in-law

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,420
to attend to me tonight.

29
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,939
You

30
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,300
must personally bring her to me.

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,059
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,179
This

33
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,820
might not be appropriate.

34
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,900
What's inappropriate about it?

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,540
She's your sister-in-law,

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,540
not your lover.

37
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,180
I'll bring her right away.

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,140
Don't take too long.

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,500
I won't wait all night.

41
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,460
(Is he doing this out of lust)

42
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,100
(or because he actually likes me?)

43
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,579
Your Highness.

44
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,100
His Lordship requests to see you.

45
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,739
Let him in.

46
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,700
Yes, Your Highness.

47
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
(What is he doing here now?)

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,020
(Is he here to apologize
for what happened earlier?)

49
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,820
What brings you here so late?

50
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,780
I'm here by His Majesty's order.

51
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,220
He wants you to attend to him tonight.

52
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,060
I've come to escort you.

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,459
(It seems I was just imagining things.)

54
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,180
(He didn't even bother to apologize.)

55
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,379
(Xiling Xuan,)

56
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,900
(you are heartless.)

57
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,420
Fine.

58
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,179
Then take me there, quickly.

59
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,179
I can't wait any longer.

60
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm ready to give His Majesty a prince.

61
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,100
(She's not even refusing.)

62
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,780
(She's actually happy about it.)

63
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,500
You're not the real Empress.

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,659
The true Empress is already dead.

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,579
That's right.

66
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,299
That's why I took over her body

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,339
to become the Empress.

68
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,739
Why her?

69
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,860
Why possess her?

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,379
Because I wanted to grow old

71
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,180
with the man I love.

72
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,819
Yaya.

73
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,499
Let's stay together forever.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,660
Alright?

75
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,299
Alright.

76
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,859
Yue.

77
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,539
We'll always be together.

78
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,700
What was that phrase again?

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,660
Grow bold together?

80
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,779
Silly.

81
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,739
It's grow old together.

82
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,739
Oh, right.

83
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,020
Grow old together.

84
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,060
Do you really want to grow old with him?

85
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,659
He's the ruler of a kingdom.

86
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,899
As his Empress,

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,979
I'll hold power over the realm.
What's wrong with that?

88
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,100
You're lying!

89
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,260
Xiling Xuan.

90
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,420
You think you know me so well?

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
Do you even know who I really am?

92
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
Of course I do.

93
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,179
You're the Lord Wing of Xiling Kingdom.

94
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,779
My dear brother-in-law.

95
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,420
Xiling Xuan.

96
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,579
What are you doing?

97
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,220
His Majesty ordered you to serve him.

98
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,699
I'm taking you there.

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,940
Let go.

100
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,060
Let go.

101
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,980
Let me go!

102
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,099
Your Majesty.

103
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,220
I've brought the Empress to you.

104
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,900
You've done well.

105
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,459
If Your Majesty wanted me
to attend to you,

106
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,700
you could have sent a servant
to deliver the message.

107
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,179
Why send such a brute instead?

108
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,220
He nearly dragged me to pieces.

109
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,500
Xin'er.

110
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,740
When it comes to
sharing chambers with you,

111
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,179
I feel more assured when Lord Wing

112
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,539
delivers the message.

113
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,579
Your Majesty.

114
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,380
I'll take my leave.

115
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,100
Xin'er.

116
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,700
Tonight,

117
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,060
let's enjoy some time together.

118
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,020
Your Majesty.

119
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,979
Just now,

120
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,539
His Lordship dragged me
all the way here.

121
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm covered in his sweat.

122
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,900
If it pleases Your Majesty,

123
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,460
I'd like to bathe first.

124
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,500
I wouldn't want to spoil your mood.

125
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,700
Very well.

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,620
Then, we'll bathe together.

127
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,500
Xin'er.

128
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,100
Why are you so nervous?

129
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,220
I have

130
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,379
never bathed with Your Majesty before.

131
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,460
It's only natural to feel nervous.

132
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,860
Then join me more often.

133
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,540
You'll get used to it soon enough.

134
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,420
(I need to find a way out of this.)

135
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,460
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,900
Look.

137
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Aren't these flowers beautiful?

138
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,220
Xin'er.

139
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,700
What's wrong, Xin'er?

140
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,420
Your Majesty.

141
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,020
Xin'er.

142
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,780
I can't breathe.

143
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,179
Xin'er.

144
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,420
Don't scare me.

145
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,299
The flowers...

146
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,620
the petals...

147
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,019
Xin'er.

148
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,140
Petals...

149
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,820
Xin'er.

150
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,260
Xin'er.

151
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,499
Hang in there.

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,539
I'll call for help.

153
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,579
Guards!

154
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,379
Someone, hurry!

155
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,579
(This feeling...)

156
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,099
Quick!

157
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,139
(Something's wrong.)

158
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,980
Xin'er!
