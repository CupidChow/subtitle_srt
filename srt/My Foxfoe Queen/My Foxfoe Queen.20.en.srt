00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,459
If you move again,

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,420
I won't hesitate to whip you even more.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,100
(His scent.)

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,140
(It's him.)

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,900
(He killed those people.)

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,180
I want to see His Majesty.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,220
His Majesty?

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,540
You are so naive.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,179
The evidence is conclusive.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,259
Tomorrow morning,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,459
His Majesty will publicly announce
your death sentence

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,419
in front of everyone.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,300
I didn't kill them!

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,500
His Majesty will believe my innocence.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,380
Fox demon.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,020
Do you think His Majesty is still
under your Charm Spell?

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,579
(The Charm Spell has been broken.)

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,140
No wonder my brother
never believed what I said.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,660
It turns out you cast
the Charm Spell on him.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,820
Your Lordship.

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,300
I have already lifted
the demon's Charm Spell on His Majesty.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,220
That's good to hear.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,140
Now,

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,820
he won't blame me

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,100
no matter how much I torture her.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,540
What are you planning to do to me?

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,820
Recently,

30
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,700
I've been studying Gu poisons.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,820
I discovered a certain insect

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,300
that loves to suck demon blood.

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,059
Once the blood is drained,

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,980
it starts feasting on the bone marrow.

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,620
In a moment,

36
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,020
I'll smear this honey

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,300
all over you.

38
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,220
The insects will crawl

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,700
up your legs, bit by bit,

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,580
covering your wounds entirely.

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,220
But don't move a muscle.

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,699
If you shake them off,

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,100
even more will come

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,180
until you're covered

45
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,740
from head to toe.

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,819
Xiling Xuan,

47
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,379
how cruel can you be?

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,180
Cruel?

49
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,179
My brother was far crueler

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,219
when he cut into my flesh

51
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,180
under your influence!

52
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,900
What?

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,940
No...

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,060
No!

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,100
Commander Huang,

56
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,140
join me!

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,900
I won't

58
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,740
disturb Your Lordship any longer.

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,779
Your Lordship, be careful not

60
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,899
to kill the demon.

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,780
Tomorrow, she will be sentenced
in front of all the ministers.

62
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,500
Don't worry.

63
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,580
She's in good hands.

64
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,900
I take my leave.

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
No...

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,500
No...

67
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,539
No...

68
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,500
No!

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,739
Stay away!

70
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,179
No!

71
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,980
Don't come any closer!

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,340
That's enough.

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,620
He's gone.

74
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,140
He dared do this to you...

75
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,660
It must have hurt terribly.

76
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm fine.

77
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,900
But you really scared me.

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,139
I thought Xiling Heng actually

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,820
cut you with a blade.

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,619
You must be hungry.

81
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,100
Have some honey.

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,340
Here.

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,299
Slowly.

84
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,500
I don't want you to choke.

85
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,380
Easy there.

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,380
I remember now.

87
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,419
That scent.

88
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,980
It was Huang Gou'er.

89
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,500
That explains everything.

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,700
After the Charm Spell was lifted,

91
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,859
my brother realized you were a demon.

92
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,300
But you're the Empress.

93
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,259
He needs the world to know
you're a demon

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,579
so he can get rid of you.

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,540
That's why he had Huang Gou'er
do all those things to frame you.

96
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,740
But

97
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,340
who poisoned you with the Gu?

98
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,580
Maybe

99
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,900
we'll have our answer tomorrow.

100
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,259
The urgent matter

101
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,779
is to clear your name

102
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,900
and get you out safely.

103
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,700
Xiling Heng knows I'm a fox demon now.

104
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,820
He'd never let me go.

105
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,940
Don't worry.

106
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,620
I'll figure out a way.

107
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,300
All right.

108
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,499
You wicked demon!

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,100
You've been lurking beside me
all this time

110
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,419
and used sorcery to charm me!

111
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,900
You almost

112
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,900
caused my downfall.

113
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,100
You've killed
all those people in the palace.

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,900
Your crimes are grave!

115
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,500
Your Majesty,

116
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,179
I was framed.

117
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,300
How dare you still say that!

118
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,859
You must've killed the Empress too!

119
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,059
Huang Gou'er!

120
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,500
You know full well

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,740
who the real murderer is.

122
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,779
Your Majesty.

123
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,619
This wicked demon

124
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,979
should be burned alive immediately

125
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,420
to appease the Empress's spirit.

126
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,460
What do

127
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,340
the ministers think?

128
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,979
Kill her!

129
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,819
Your Majesty, the fox demon must die!

130
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,800
Kill the fox demon!

131
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,139
- Your Majesty, you mustn't hesitate.
- She must not be spared!

132
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,139
- Absolutely not!
- You must order her death!

133
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,420
Wait.

134
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,180
Lord Wing.

135
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,500
What's he doing here?

136
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,940
The true killer is you,

137
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,500
isn't it,

138
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,780
Huang Gou'er?

139
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,859
Commander Huang?

140
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,900
How could it be Commander Huang?

141
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,180
Your Lordship,

142
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,660
what...

143
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,300
what nonsense are you spouting?

144
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,780
Lord Wing.

145
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,580
What is this about?

146
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,740
Huang Gou'er,

147
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,740
you disguised yourself in pelts
as a white fox

148
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,940
to frame the fox demon for the murders

149
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,540
and misled the maid Hupo
and eunuch Jing Gai'er

150
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,460
into believing the Empress
was the heart-ripping fox demon.

151
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,060
I found this pelt

152
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,780
and the murder weapon in your quarters.

153
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,620
The wounds match perfectly

154
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,420
with the victims.

155
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,659
Is there more to this case, after all?

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,100
What's going on here?

157
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,460
How can you verify your claims?

158
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,739
What's to say
you didn't forge the evidence?

159
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,460
You don't have to admit it now.

160
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,460
Let's keep going.

161
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,580
You also decapitated maid Hupo
and eunuch Jing Gai'er,

162
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,540
didn't you?

163
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,939
- What?
- Surely Commander Huang did that?

164
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,140
How could it be him?

165
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,300
Xuan'er.

166
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,340
Have you also been bewitched

167
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,539
by this fox demon?

168
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,179
Huh?

169
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,980
I just don't want
the real culprit to go free.

170
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,700
I'm sure no official here

171
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,179
wants a miscarriage of justice

172
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,939
on Xiling Kingdom's court.

173
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,259
That's right.

174
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,780
Lies and slander!

175
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,579
I led the people

176
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,740
who found those two heads
on the demon's bed.

177
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,379
They all saw it.

178
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,300
She's the culprit!

179
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,340
Then, what about

180
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,180
this bloodstained uniform?

181
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,019
I found this commander's uniform

182
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,100
in your residence.

183
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,580
The emblem on it is custom-made
by the Imperial Household Department

184
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,260
and belongs exclusively
to you as commander of the guards.

185
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,060
Well?

186
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,660
Will you say

187
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,979
I forged this as well?

188
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,100
This...

189
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,339
This got stained when I found
the two headless bodies this morning.

190
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,339
If you ask me,

191
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,380
it must have gotten on you accidentally
during your nighttime murders.

192
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,619
Your Majesty, I can testify.

193
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,499
It was Huang Gou'er
who decapitated Jing Gai'er.

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,619
I saw it all.

195
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,660
He was wearing this same uniform then.

196
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,939
So the real murderer is him!

197
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,579
Then, the Empress was innocent?

198
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,179
He framed her as a demon!

199
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,660
This is a crime punishable by death!

200
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,460
After murdering,

201
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,100
you placed the heads
in the Empress's bed.

202
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,419
When she woke,
you barged in to arrest her,

203
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,300
claiming she killed
to silence the victims.

204
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,340
Think carefully, everyone.

205
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,100
If one wanted to silence someone,

206
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,819
would they leave their bloody heads

207
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,579
on their own bed

208
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,100
and then sleep peacefully?

209
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,459
His Lordship makes a good point.

210
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,179
It seems the Empress really was framed.

211
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,100
I wondered

212
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,859
how she didn't notice

213
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,340
someone put heads in her bed.

214
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,340
Then, I found this.

215
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,100
Your Majesty.

216
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,500
This is Sleep-Inducing Gu.

217
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,500
Huang Gou'er,

218
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,940
as commander of the guards,

219
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,340
you even know how to use Gu poisons.

220
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,740
Quite a hidden skill you have.

221
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,500
Besides the Sleep-Inducing Gu,

222
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,460
did you use other types of Gu

223
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,460
on anyone else?

224
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,260
Huang Gou'er,

225
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,060
will you admit your guilt?

226
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,300
It's all true.

227
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,539
I killed them.

228
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,419
I used Gu poisons. I plead guilty.

229
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,539
Guards.

230
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,979
Take Huang Gou'er away.

231
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,219
His execution is to be arranged.

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

233
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,340
Come on.

234
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,180
Your Majesty.

235
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,580
Huang Gou'er knows Gu poisons.

236
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,059
If he secretly used Gu
on others in court,

237
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,979
executing him now

238
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,100
means the poisons won't be lifted.

239
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,700
Why not

240
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,179
hand him over to me first

241
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,019
for thorough interrogation

242
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,179
to ensure everyone's safety

243
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,059
before executing him?

244
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,379
- That makes sense.
- That's reasonable.

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,339
Indeed.

246
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,140
His Lordship is right.

247
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,700
Very well.

248
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,780
I entrust this matter to you, Lord Wing.

249
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,300
