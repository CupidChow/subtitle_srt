=Episode 10=

3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,500
Why is she still bleeding?

4
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,100
(I have self-regeneration.)

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,300
(Maybe my blood can help her.)

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,819
Your Lordship.

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,020
What are you doing?

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,900
Your Lordship.

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,220
Her wound is healing!

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,980
It really worked.

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,539
So cold.

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,300
Cold...

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,260
So cold...

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,100
Cold...

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,780
Hot...

16
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,140
It's so hot...

17
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,700
Liusu,

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,979
go get a physician, now!

19
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,100
Yes, Your Lordship.

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,659
Yaya.

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,100
Why do you look so down today?

22
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,420
Yue, I'm leaving Mount Yao.

23
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,179
My father has come to take me home.

24
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,179
He is waiting for me
at the foot of the mountain.

25
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,179
Then, go on.

26
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,100
Don't keep them waiting.

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,379
But once I leave,

28
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,260
I might not see you again
for a very long time.

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,620
Really?

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,699
Yue.

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,579
Come with me.
We'll leave Mount Yao together.

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,379
I heard the world outside is huge.

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,900
It's full of amazing things.

34
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,339
No, I can't.

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,299
I'm the Fox Demon Saintess of Mount Yao.

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,820
I can't leave this place.

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,700
But I don't want to leave you.

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,699
Crybaby bird.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,779
Go on, hurry.

40
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,340
You can come visit me
when you have time.

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,260
Go now.

42
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,979
Go.

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,900
Don't keep them waiting.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,859
Tushan Yue!

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,819
When I grow up,

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,860
I'll come back and marry you!

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,819
Silly boy.

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,259
We'll see when you grow up.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,700
Now go, go on!

50
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,140
Don't go...

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,700
Don't go...

52
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,300
I never left.

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,100
I've been here all along.

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,300
Strange.

55
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,340
How can one person have two pulses?

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,539
One is so faint, it's almost gone,

57
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,300
like the walking dead.

58
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,859
The other still shows a hint of life,

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,180
but only the last of her three souls
and seven spirits remains.

60
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,179
Her yin and yang are in chaos.

61
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm afraid

62
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,540
there's little hope left.

63
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,260
Is there any other way to save her?

64
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,860
It will take a miracle.

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,379
Her yang energy is floating
on the surface,

66
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,180
and her yin energy has
collapsed within.

67
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,739
She must be placed
by a spring under the moonlight,

68
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,779
then fed with the Pure Yin Blood,

69
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,500
to balance yin and yang.

70
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,939
But the problem is,

71
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,100
where can one possibly
find such blood now?

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
What is the Pure Yin Blood?

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,180
The heart's blood of a demon.

74
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
I'm sorry, I can do no more.

75
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,980
I'll take my leave.

76
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,019
Cold.

77
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,780
So cold.

78
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,580
Hold on.

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,100
Just hang in there a little longer.

80
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,940
I missed you so much.

81
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,300
Yaya.

82
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,979
Yaya.

83
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,819
Wake up.

84
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,980
The sun's already up, Yaya.

it's my favorite.

89
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,580
Yaya, look! We're flying so high.

90

91
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,340
Yaya, you're such a crybaby bird.

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,459
