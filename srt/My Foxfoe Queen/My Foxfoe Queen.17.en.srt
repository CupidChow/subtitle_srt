3
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,983
I've finally taken my revenge.

4
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:49,343
With this half
of my inner core protecting you,

5
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,663
no matter how great the danger,

6
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:52,983
you'll never die.

7
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:54,943
Thank you.

8
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:56,103
I'll never forget you.

9
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:57,743
(Tushan Yue.)

10
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:00,063
Lotus Core.

11
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:03,543
This...

12
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,863
This is my inner core.

13
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:12,623
Yaya?

14
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,183
Are you Yaya?

15
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,623
Are you really Yaya?

16
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:26,943
The Gu...

17
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:31,943
Yaya,

18
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,423
are you really being controlled
by someone?

19
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:35,903
You can't die, Yaya!

20
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,023
You can't!

21
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:38,543
I won't let you!

22
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:39,543
Wake up

23
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,343
and tell me what happened!

24
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:42,063
Yaya!

25
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:43,423
Wake up!

26
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:44,303
Wake up.

27
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:45,823
Don't die.

28
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:48,703
Tell me what happened to you.

29
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,063
Yaya.

30
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:53,943
Wake up!

31
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,743
I finally found you, Yaya.

32
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:24,343
But...

33
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:31,143
I killed you with my own hands.

34
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,463
Yaya? Yaya!

35
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:57,423
You're awake.

36
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,223
Where am I?

37
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:06,863
Why are you crying?

38
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:10,343
I'm so glad you're alive.

39
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:12,103
Xiling Xuan,

40
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:15,143
you killed all those demons
on Mount Yao.

41
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:17,703
I'll kill you to avenge them!

42
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:21,520
Youyou, wait! Hear me out.
Someone might have been controlling him.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,143
Let me get those answers
out of him, please.

44
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,023
Move!

45
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:25,423
He has to die now!

46
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,423
Youyou, wait...

47
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:34,463
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:36,343
she's the demon.

49
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:37,543
Kill her.

50
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:38,823
No!

51
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:41,663
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:44,503
She's gravely wounded.
She doesn't have long to live.

53
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:46,423
There's no need
for you to sully your hands.

54
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:47,223
Xin'er,

55
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:48,823
all demons are wicked.

56
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,663
I am merely serving justice.

57
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,063
Your Majesty,

58
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:53,623
I understand.

59
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:57,103
But she's still a living being.

60
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,343
A while ago,

61
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:02,743
I went to the temple to pray,

62
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,183
hoping the heavens

63
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,663
would help me recover soon

64
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,743
and give you a prince.

65
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:15,063
If you decide to kill it,

66
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,303
it won't be good for our child.

67
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:20,503
Very well.

68
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:21,983
As you wish, Xin'er.

69
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:22,903
She shall be freed.

70
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,063
Good.

71
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:24,903
Your Majesty.

72
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:28,943
You dare defy my will?

73
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:30,703
Let her go.

74
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:33,343
Let her go.

75
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:40,863
Xin'er,

76
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,423
I'll take you back.

77
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:43,903
All right.

78
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:24,983
Don't worry.

79
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,023
She's fine.

80
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:34,943
Yaya.

81
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:39,703
I'm not Yaya.

82
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,423
You've got the wrong person.

83
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,223
You knew it was me,

84
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,023
didn't you?

85
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,543
That's why you saved me
time and time again.

86
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,343
You knew it was me.

87
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,463
Why didn't you tell me?

88
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:12,023
I didn't want you to get hurt.

89
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,343
You didn't want to hurt me?

90
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:20,303
Yesterday,

91
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:24,943
306 deer demons
were slaughtered on Mount Yao.

92
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:27,863
Three days ago,

93
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:31,543
586 rabbit demons
were massacred on Mount Yao.

94
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,023
15 days ago,

95
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:38,823
the entire fox clan on Mount Yao

96
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,663
was wiped out.

97
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,303
Do you know who did it?

98
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,023
It was me.

99
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:01,943
That's right.

100
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:03,943
It was you.

101
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,423
That means

102
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,623
I killed you.

103
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,823
That's why your last wisp of soul

104
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,543
came here.

105
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,143
You came seeking revenge.

106
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,143
Yaya.

107
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:30,543
Why was it you of all people?

108
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,863
We were...

109
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:35,263
We were...

110
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:41,183
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:43,183
Yue,

112
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:47,743
kill me.

113
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:12,743
If I kill you,

114
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:15,623
I'll never be able to find

115
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:17,223
the true mastermind

116
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,703
controlling you with the Gu.

117
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,343
Controlling me

118
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:27,143
with the Gu?

119
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:38,995
Tell the Imperial Medical Court

120
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:41,075
to restore the Empress's health
as swiftly as possible.

121
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:44,075
I want to have an heir with her
as soon as possible.

122
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,195
Yes, Your Majesty.

123
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,875
Go on, then.

124
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:53,275
Your Majesty,

125
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:55,795
do you remember the rule you once set?

126
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:57,755
Of course.

127
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:00,595
No matter what the obstacles,

128
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,555
all the demons on Mount Yao
must be slain.

129
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,675
Then why did Your Majesty
spare that demon today?

130
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,435
You dare question me?

131
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:09,675
I dare not.

132
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,155
I just feel

133
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,875
that Your Majesty has changed recently.

134
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,240
You've shown tremendous care

135
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,218
for Her Majesty and you seem
to grant her every wish.

136
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:18,618
I love Xin'er.

137
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:20,338
Why shouldn't I do what pleases her?

138
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,378
But today, because of her,

139
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,138
you spared your most hated demon.

140
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,063
You've never shown
this much concern for her before.

141
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,263
Do you remember when you started

142
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,623
caring so much for her?

143
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:35,623
I...

144
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,343
I've loved her since birth.

145
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:42,263
But she's the princess
of the neighboring kingdom.

146
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,143
You only met on your wedding day.

147
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,143
How can you say
you've loved her since birth?

148
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,143
Your Majesty.

149
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:56,103
Silence!

150
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:56,883
Get out of my sight!

151
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:06,535
What...

152
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,263
What's wrong with me?

153
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,630
(Yue,)

154
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:22,143
(I've returned to Mount Yao.)

155
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,343
(There are many)

156
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:25,503
(severely injured demons there)

157
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,423
(who need care.)

158
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
(They don't know that Xiling Xuan)

159
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,863
(is being controlled by the Gu.)

160
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,063
(They wish
they could tear him to pieces.)

161
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:33,943
(After I return to Mount Yao,)

162
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:35,943
(I'll try to explain everything
to everyone.)

163
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,823
(Be careful and take care of yourself.)

164
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,463
(If you ever need help,)

165
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,063
(send word to Mount Yao.)

166
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,823
(I'll always come to your aid.)

167
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,543
(Youyou.)

168
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,503
(I will find the mastermind)

169
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:49,903
(behind this as soon as possible)

170
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:51,663
(and avenge everyone.)

171
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,943
Your Majesty!

172
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,063
Something's wrong, Your Majesty!

173
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,343
What happened?

174
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:01,303
His Lordship...

175
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,143
His Lordship...

176
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,743
He went to Mount Yao last night.

177
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,863
He drained himself almost dry

178
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:11,743
to save the injured demons.

179
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,983
I... I fear he may not survive.

180
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,463
Where is he now?

181
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,583
Yue...

182
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:46,143
Yaya...

183
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:57,543
Let's join forces.

184
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:02,143
We'll find the true mastermind
that's controlling you together.

185
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:07,383
All right.
