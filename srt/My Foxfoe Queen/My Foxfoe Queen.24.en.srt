00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,587
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,100
Really?

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,180
Yes.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,380
Of course.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,260
Mother.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,060
Heng.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,980
Come to me.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,660
Don't cry, Heng.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,860
Mother.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,580
Mother.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,860
Heng.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,540
Mother.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,460
Heng.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,860
Hold me, Mother.

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,140
After all these years,

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,620
I can finally hold you again, Mother.

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,140
Heng!

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,700
Heng!

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,100
Heng!

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,340
Xuan.

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,539
Come.

23
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,860
Xuan.

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,580
I wish we could go back

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,380
to when we were young and carefree.

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Your Majesty.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,300
We must face the mistakes

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,060
we've made.

29
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,660
Yes.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,220
I am sorry.

31
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,460
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,500
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,300
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,980
Heng.

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,380
Heng.

36
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,820
I offer my soul as sacrifice.

37
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,500
Let the dark spirits return.

38
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,820
Let the evil demon descend.

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,460
Let all living beings turn to ash.

40
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,940
This entire world

41
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,019
will become my Heng's

42
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,660
burial ground.

43
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,620
Yaya!

44
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,060
Yaya!

45
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,380
Yaya...

46
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,420
So this is

47
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,860
what it feels like to have a body again.

48
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
It feels incredible.

49
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,619
You...

50
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,459
What...

51
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,660
Who are you?

52
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,339
It seems the Phoenix
kept me sealed for too long.

53
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,140
The world has forgotten my name.

54
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,779
You...

55
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,020
You are...

56
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,660
Ying Zhao.

57
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,099
You actually know my name.

58
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,300
Then, you're not
as ignorant as I thought.

59
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,460
What do you want?

60
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Why are you taking over his body?

61
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,460
His body?

62
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,740
No.

63
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,300
This is what the Phoenix owes me.

64
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,539
I'm only taking back what was mine.

65
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,660
Yue.

66
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,580
Yue!

67
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,820
He still carries
so many unfulfilled obsessions.

68
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,260
But that doesn't matter now.

69
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,820
This body belongs to me.

70
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,180
And I'll use it

71
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,460
to shake heaven and earth.

72
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,099
I won't let you succeed.

73
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,060
Do you even know what you're facing?

74
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,179
Your weak demon power

75
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,660
is nothing but dust before me.

76
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,420
As I am now,

77
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,460
I could crush you in a heartbeat.

78
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,180
I...

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,260
I'll never let you win.

80
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,780
Your courage

81
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,900
surprises me.

82
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,300
Then, show me.

83
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,860
Let's see how long you can survive

84
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,260
in this world of chaos.

85
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,620
(The Phoenix used the Divine Phoenix Sword
to defeat Ying Zhao.)

86
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,260
(Maybe I can use it)

87
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,860
(to bring Yaya back.)

88
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,860
What's this?

89
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,179
Not a single living soul around.

90
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,620
Feeling lonely?

91
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,220
Is that why you came to talk to me?

92
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Ying Zhao,

93
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,900
after all the lives you've destroyed,

94
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,220
don't you feel any remorse?

95
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,460
Remorse?

96
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,100
That's nothing
but the hypocrisy of the weak.

97
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,300
I abandoned
such worthless feelings long ago.

98
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,660
Listen.

99
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,380
Do you hear this silence?

100
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,700
This is what the world truly looks like.

101
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,140
This is what real

102
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,700
harmony and nature sound like.

103
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,420
Yaya.

104
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,339
I know you're still in there.

105
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,339
Wake up, please.

106
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,659
Don't let Ying Zhao control you.

107
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Save your breath.

108
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,420
He's long gone.

109
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,220
This body

110
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,020
belongs to me.

111
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,739
I'm taking a nap.

112
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,420
Not in the mood to kill.

113
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,420
Now get lost.

114
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,740
Yaya.

115
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,179
Yaya!

116
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,660
Wake up, come on, wake up!

117
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,220
You are too noisy.

118
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,700
Huh.

119
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,420
So it's the Divine Phoenix Sword.

120
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,220
No wonder you're feeling confident.

121
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,180
But do you really think

122
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,420
you can defeat me with that sword?

123
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,060
If I don't try,

124
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,700
how will I know?

125
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,660
Yaya.

126
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,820
Wake up.

127
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,420
It's me.

128
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,659
It's me, Yue.

129
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,019
Yaya!

130
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,580
(Yaya, please wake up!)

131
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,460
(It's Yue!)

132
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,500
(Yaya!)

133
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,380
Yue...

134
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,820
Yue?

135
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,260
Yue?

136
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,700
Yue?

137
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,100
Where am I?

138
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,699
(This is the cage I created)

139
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,620
(for your consciousness.)

140
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,899
(How is it? Do you like it?)

141
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,099
Who are you?

142
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,059
(Who am I?)

143
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,940
(Who am I?)

144
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,579
(Have you remembered now?)

145
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,060
You're Ying Zhao.

146
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,139
I won't let you use me
as your instrument of destruction!

147
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,019
(Destruction?)

148
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,259
(No.)

149
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,380
(I intend to rebuild it.)

150
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,139
(To rebuild this world
that's been rotted and weakened.)

151
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,499
(And you,)

152
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,660
(you will be my vessel.)

153
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,899
(But don't worry.)

154
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,859
(I'll give you power.)

155
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,099
(You'll become the undying ruler)

156
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,860
(of this new world.)

157
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,300
I know the two of you tried your best.

158
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,699
But this is where it ends.

159
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,820
All that effort means nothing.

160
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,020
Now die.

161
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,380
Yue.

162
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
I won't let you die.

163
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,220
(How can this be?)

164
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,939
(How do you possess such power?)

165
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,379
Because

166
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,620
there's someone I have to protect.

167
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,420
Die.

168
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,420
Yue.

169
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,979
Yaya.

170
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,100
It's me.

171
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,180
I've taken back control for now.

172
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,500
Yaya.

173
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,100
Kill me.

174
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,460
Hurry, kill me.

175
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,899
No, Yaya.

176
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,099
You have to kill me.

177
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
It's the only way to end this.

178
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,660
I can't.

179
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,700
Yue.

180
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,379
My hands

181
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,220
are already stained with sin.

182
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,660
Now

183
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,260
so many innocent lives
have died because of me.

184
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,139
Only my death

185
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,060
can atone for that.

186
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,459
No, Yaya, don't.

187
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,380
Do it.

188
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,260
Before Ying Zhao takes my body again.

189
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,260
Hurry.

190
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,580
Do it!

191
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,500
Yaya!

192
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,180
Yue.

193
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,060
You've done this before.

194
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,220
This is the only way.

195
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
For all living beings,

196
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,620
