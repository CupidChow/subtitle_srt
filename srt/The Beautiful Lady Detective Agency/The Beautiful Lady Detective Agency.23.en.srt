00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,040
One day

2
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
I received a call from a stranger.

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,370
Hello. Feiyu Corporation.

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,040
Who would you like to speak to?

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm looking for a girl named Zhao Xiaohan.

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Who are you?

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,600
Never mind who I am.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,040
Get Zhao Xiaohan.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
I can make her wishes come true.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,000
I am Zhao Xiaohan.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,280
No need for pranks.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,200
Who are you?

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,680
I know you don't like your boss's child.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,320
You'll be living together in the future.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,800
Who are you exactly?

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,640
Never mind who I am.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,880
I'll call you regularly.

18
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,840
You just need to tell me your boss's schedule.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,120
I'll make that child

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,640
completely disappear before your eyes.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,640
Later on,

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,600
that person called again.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,200
I told the person on the phone

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,479
about my boyfriend and his daughter's whereabouts.

25
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,000
But I was just playing a prank.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,479
I never thought it would be real.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,800
The tickets have already been purchased.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Once I finish my current work in a few days,

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,440
I'll go there.

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,200
Don't worry.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,440
Good, that's right.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,320
We'll need your help with many things over there.

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,040
Okay.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
Alright.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Fine.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Xiaohan.

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,079
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,000
I...

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you doing?

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,040
I brought my child here to play.

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,120
I just answered a phone call,

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
and then the child disappeared.

43
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,320
Since then,

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,280
I unwittingly became an accomplice.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,850
I've been anxious all the time.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
Because I know I've betrayed my boyfriend.

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Why haven't you left yet?

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,640
Because the child is missing,

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
our plans have been delayed.

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,920
This is your chance.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,079
Convince your man to leave immediately.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,640
You two can be alone abroad,

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
without any child bothering you.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,240
But...

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,320
I really didn't mean to.

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,880
I thought it was just a prank by your ex-wife,

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,400
so I wanted to play along with it.

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,480
I never thought a third person was involved.

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,400
If I had known,

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,600
I would never have told him your whereabouts.

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
What's the point of saying this now?

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,250
Who's your accomplice?

63
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,240
Tell me,

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
or I'll kill you.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
I really don't know where the child is.

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,720
I swear to God.

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
That's enough, Zhao Xiaohan.

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,610
You can explain the rest to the police.

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,000
As for your actions,

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,720
whether they constitute a crime

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,579
will be determined by the police.

72
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,640
Let's go.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,640
I just remembered something.

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,320
Wait a moment.

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,650
I need to get something.

76
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,840
This radio was dropped

77
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440
by the kidnapper that day.

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,280
Is it safe now?

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Maybe I should stay here for a few more days.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
It's okay.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,400
I can handle it.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
This way we can find out

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,280
who actually kidnapped the child.

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
We're just one step away from the truth.

85
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,880
Come on.

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
We're about to close this case.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
There's nobody here.

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,900
Where are we supposed to look now?

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,640
Listen.

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,920
Seems like a forgetful old person.

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
We're done for.

92
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,240
We celebrated too soon.

93
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,960
Now

94
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,420
we've lost the lead again.

95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
Why do I feel like

96
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,370
this neighborhood looks so familiar?

97
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
I know who the suspect is.

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,120
Let's go back.

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,380
We can also draw the snake out of its hole.

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,320
Boss.

101
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,400
Do you think our method will work?

102
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Don't worry.

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,000
Whether it works or not,

104
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,900
I already know who the suspect is.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,060
I just want to use this method to find the child quickly.

106
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,720
He's coming.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,200
This radio is mine.

108
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,400
Sir,

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
is this radio yours?

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,680
Yes,

111
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
it's my radio.

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
Did you also kidnap the child?

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,840
What are you talking about?

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
I don't understand.

115
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,880
Sir,

116
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,440
how about I run with you?

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,320
No need.

118
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,080
Don't chase me.

119
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,320
Then why are you running?

120
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's stop and talk.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,480
Talk my ass!

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,040
Fine,

123
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,640
we won't use our mouths.

124
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
I'll run with you.

125
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,640
Please just let me go.

126
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
The child has been found.
