1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,160
Excuse me, parent,

2
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
please calm down.

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,440
How can I calm down?

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,040
My son was grabbed like this.

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
How do you expect me to calm down?

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,120
Whose child is this?

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,040
So smug after grabbing someone.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,840
Wu Xiaoming,

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,040
apologize right now.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,400
He deserved it.

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,000
How do you raise your child?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
So arrogant.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm sorry, teacher.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,250
What trouble has my son caused now?

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
How is it you?

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,560
It's you.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,239
Well done, son!

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Xiaoming's father, what are you saying?

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,039
Is this how you teach your son?

20
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,400
You're no saint either.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,000
For all I know,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,320
your son provoked mine first.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,760
You!

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,480
What's wrong with me?

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,360
Let me tell you,

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
this isn't our company.

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,880
You can't throw your weight around here.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,960
Fat woman!

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,840
We will pay for your child's medical expenses.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,100
Please don't be upset.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,640
Your husband is crazy.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,370
Teaching your child like that.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,600
Just a few months ago,

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,600
he was reported by a female customer at the store.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,860
He's been depressed since his demotion,

37
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,880
and it's affected the child too.

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Female customer.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,880
Dad, I want Sprite.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
Dad, that's a bottle of beer.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,640
Are you blind?

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,100
Who are you calling blind?

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,040
You're a stupid pig.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
I'll teach you some respect.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,079
Who's a pig?

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,640
Are you blind?

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
What did you say?

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
Why are you barging through such a wide hallway?

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Are you a pig?

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,920
I think you need a beating.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,160
If that's the case,

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,920
everything makes sense now.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,079
Parents' emotions

54
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,140
have a huge impact on their children.

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
I see now.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
History

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,320
really does affect our own lives.

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,240
What did you say?

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,500
Where's your husband?

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
He might be in the car.

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,440
What are you doing?

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,860
I need your son to apologize to my son.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,000
Forget it, let's just go home.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
What do you mean go home?

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,640
You were bullied,

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
and Mom needs to get justice for you.

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,060
You have the nerve to talk about justice?

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
Then I'll stand up for

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
that young girl you harassed.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
Or I could wait for your wife

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,840
and tell her all about it.

72
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,440
Sis,

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,000
it's not what you think.

74
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,520
Apologize to my son.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Everything else

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,610
will be water under the bridge.

77
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,240
Go apologize to him

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
or I'll smack you.

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,640
Yes.

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
Son, let it go.

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,720
Be forgiving when you can.

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,800
Besides,

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
they're all your own children.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,600
Don't take your anger out on them.

86
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Son.

87
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,680
Go.

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,680
What's wrong with you?

89
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Behave yourself from now on.

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,120
The sun must be rising from the west today.

91
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,320
You're here so early.

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,360
Hey, beautiful.

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,240
What's making you so happy?

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,480
Yesterday,

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,840
I got some revenge for my son.

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,800
I looked good in front of my son.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,520
However,

98
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,640
we really can't change history.

99
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
My son was beaten up yesterday.

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,680
And it was Wu Liangxin's son who did it.

101
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,280
You never listen to your elders.

102
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,280
I knew you would break the rules.

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
Seems like when we time travel in the future,

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,980
we need to be more careful.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,960
By the way,

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,480
after you two left yesterday,

107
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,080
I did some research on Mr. Lin's competitor,

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
Ruiya Jewelry.

109
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,700
Let's see if we can find any clues.

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
That's strange.

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,880
Yesterday when I argued with Wu Liangxin,

112
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,920
I saw this logo too.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,240
Could it be...

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,890
Wu Liangxin has connections with this Ruiya Jewelry store.

115
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Let's not make wild guesses.

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,880
Seeing is believing.

117
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Let's go back in time and take a look.

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,920
Why are we on the street again?

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,120
How are we supposed to find anyone here?

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,060
He went inside.

121
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
Be careful not to get caught.

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
Let's go.

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,280
What is he doing?

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
Selling blueprints.

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,010
I can't see clearly now.

126
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,010
Who is that man across from him?

127
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,730
Why don't we go over and ask?

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,500
You're going to cause trouble again.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,400
This design looks good.

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,920
These designs are pretty good, aren't they?

131
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,440
Indeed.

132
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
This is our second collaboration.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
Let's work together more in the future.

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,920
Absolutely.

135
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,320
With such great designs,

136
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
you can come to me anytime.

137
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Great.

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,920
Has your company's new product launch started?

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
Not yet.

140
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,210
We're waiting for your design, aren't we?

141
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
We're running out of time.

142
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Let's discuss this when we get back.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Mission accomplished.

144
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,240
Let's call Boss Lin directly.

145
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,800
We can catch this Wu guy.

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,920
No.

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
That's too hasty.

148
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,880
We don't have any substantial evidence.

149
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,480
What if we go back in time again

150
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,280
and try to get the documents?

151
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
Getting the documents

152
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,720
would change history.

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,800
We must find a way to get the documents

154
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,659
and return them to their rightful place.

155
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,480
Then after Wu Liangxin leaves,

156
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,120
that four-eyed frog sitting across from him,

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
we'll use a strategy

158
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,039
to separate him from the documents for a while.

159
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
That's right.

160
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
It seems.

161
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll have to use my special skill now.
