1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,040
The case is solved,

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,880
but why don't I feel happier?

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,240
Because we witnessed

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,100
the ending we least wanted to see.

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,520
Xiao Li said

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,780
she's taking Wang Mai to turn himself in.

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,480
After it's over, they'll leave this city.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,720
The good thing is

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
they can finally

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,440
be together openly.

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,680
The sad part is

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,120
they can never again do

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,440
the things they love.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,539
Love can destroy everything.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,460
Love can embrace everything.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,320
Look at you,

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,120
getting all philosophical now.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,000
Anyway,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,160
our Beauty Detective Agency's first case

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,760
has finally been solved.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,360
Let's go.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Let's celebrate.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,840
It's on me today.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,280
Son

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
you're home!

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Let's do homework together.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,080
The art teacher assigned us homework today

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,320
to draw our mothers.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Sure.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,330
Where should I draw?

31
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,720
Mom will strike

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,600
a pose for you.

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Isn't it cool?

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
What grade are you in?

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
So late.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Mom,

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,640
you're home.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,300
Did you expect me not to be?

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,440
No, no.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,360
My son will be off work soon.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
I need to make dinner.

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,680
Okay.

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
About having a child,

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,040
I don't want to discuss it now.

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,200
No way.

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
That's too blunt.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
Honey,

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm at a critical point in my career right now.

50
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
About having a child,

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,280
can we discuss it later, please?

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,200
No, no.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,440
Honey,

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,920
I still have a lot to do.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
You should rest first.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,800
Honey,

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm home.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
I passed by a children's clothing store

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,680
and bought this because it looked cute.

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
What do you think?

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
Honey,

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,840
I still have a lot of things to do.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,240
Why don't you rest first?

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,440
Don't misunderstand.

65
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,079
I just thought it was cute,

66
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,120
nothing more.

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,720
Excuse me, ma'am,

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
can I help you?

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,840
Excuse me,

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,040
is this the Beauty Detective Agency?

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Bingbing.

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,440
Hello.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,920
May I ask,

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
how can I help you?

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,440
I'd like you to help me find

76
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
my father.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
He was abducted by aliens.

78
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
Aliens?

79
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,040
Come in.

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,570
Sit down and tell me slowly.

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,400
I'd like to confirm with you again.

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
Go ahead.

83
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
Your father

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,120
was abducted by aliens?

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,080
Is this...

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Absolutely true.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,360
In real life,

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,640
how could aliens possibly exist?

89
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,040
This premise is way too far-fetched.

90
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,320
Dameili,

91
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
you're such a hypocrite,

92
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,880
we can time travel

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,010
but you won't accept aliens exist?

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,010
If I hadn't experienced it myself,

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,300
I wouldn't believe aliens exist either.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,970
Did you see them with your own eyes?

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,960
No.

98
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
My father has

99
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,210
mild Alzheimer's disease.

100
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,040
Although he's sometimes lucid

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
and sometimes confused,

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,720
but that night,

103
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,900
my father's disappearance was extremely bizarre.

104
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,480
I see you've come.

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
What's wrong?

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,490
Dad, please don't be angry with me.

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,640
I've been extremely busy with work these past 3 months,

108
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,570
so I haven't been able to visit you.

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
But every week,

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,640
I call your caretaker Xiao Guo

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
to ask about your condition.

112
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,840
Where's the caregiver?

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
The AC is set so low.

114
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
No wonder you have so many blankets.

115
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
Dad, I'll turn off the AC.

116
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,880
Use fewer blankets.

117
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
So you don't sweat too much

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,200
and catch a cold.

119
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,900
Dad, what's wrong?

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,640
Aliens are coming to take me home.

121
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
Dad, don't joke with me.

122
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Aliens are coming to take me home.

123
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,500
Aliens are coming to take me home.

124
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
Dad, I'll get you some water.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,810
Dad, have some water first.

126
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,970
Where have you been?

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Nurse.

128
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,080
Nurse!

129
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
My father is missing!

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Please calm down.

131
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,080
Patient from Room 1105 is missing.

132
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
All floor staff please be alert.

133
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
Patient from Room 1105 is missing.

134
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,440
All floor staff please be alert.

135
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
Let me take you to check the security footage.

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay.

137
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
Did you find him?

138
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,340
No. Let's split up and search.

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Based on the surveillance footage,

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,200
your father was not seen leaving the room.

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,250
And what's more important,

142
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
the moment I turned around,

143
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
my father disappeared.

144
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,770
No matter how agile he might be,

145
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,000
he couldn't just vanish before my eyes.

146
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,760
So,

147
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
it's true.

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,880
He was taken by aliens.
