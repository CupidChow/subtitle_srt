1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,880
Son.

2
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,880
My dear son.

3
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Just one day apart

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
and I've missed you so much.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,200
Did you miss Mommy?

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,760
Ouch!

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,280
You're so strong!

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,840
You're almost crushing my bones.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
Okay.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,320
Sweetie, do your homework properly.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,440
Mommy will go make dinner for you, okay?

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,770
Be good and do your work.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Good boy.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm sorry

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,320
I...

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,440
If you feel this family can't accommodate you,

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,970
you don't have to come back.

18
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,170
I'll go make dinner.

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,800
You're back.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,080
How's the new job?

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,720
Don't ask.

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,520
I was exhausted on the first day.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
By the way, honey.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,520
About that thing

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,400
I mentioned to you about having a child.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,460
Have you thought about it?

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,880
I just remembered

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,480
I have some unfinished work.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,500
I need to go take care of it.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,040
I haven't asked what job you're doing.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Just like before, looking at stock charts and stuff.

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,100
You wouldn't understand anyway.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm going inside now.

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,079
Meili.

35
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,680
Are you going time traveling

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,520
or mourning the dead?

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
I'm just praying for the three of us.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,720
What if we go back in time

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
and I get lost?

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,680
That's actually possible.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,610
With how scatterbrained Meili is,

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
we might not solve the case

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,490
and end up becoming cold cases ourselves.

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,320
Teacher Cang.

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,120
I need to tell you again.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,400
This watch

47
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,000
has conditions for use.

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,920
Every time you travel back,

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
you only have one hour to stay there.

50
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,079
That is,

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,320
the time it takes for the minute hand to make one full rotation.

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,040
Also,

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,610
after each time travel,

54
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,160
the spring in the pocket watch

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,320
needs 24 hours

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,100
before it can be wound counterclockwise again.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,320
This means

58
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,120
you can only travel once per day.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,840
In less than an hour,

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,880
we could travel back to the day of the crime

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,600
and just catch the killer. Wouldn't that be better?

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,660
That's exactly the biggest problem.

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,600
We cannot change the past.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,440
If we alter history

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
or influence the perpetrator's thoughts,

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,000
the future will change in unfavorable ways.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,080
It might even

68
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,600
affect ourselves directly.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,920
Let's begin then.

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,159
Over there.

71
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,020
I'll go first. You guys follow later.

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,320
Excuse me,

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,600
can we share this table?

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,930
There are no seats left.

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
Thank you.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Hello, may I sit here?

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,400
Please, have a seat.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
Thanks.

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,810
There's an empty seat here. May I sit down?

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,200
Yes, please sit.

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,040
Isn't she just a receptionist at the jewelry store?

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,300
Why is she studying professional books?

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,720
Who said receptionists can't study?

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,040
I'm eating right now.

85
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
I have an exam next month.

86
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
If I can

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,440
get the gemologist certification this time,

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,440
my salary should increase a bit.

89
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,280
So this young lady is planning to enter the professional field.

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Studying even while eating.

91
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,680
Young people these days are so competitive.

92
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,600
Does my brother have enough money for living expenses?

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,880
I can send him more next month.

94
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,240
She's definitely obsessed with supporting her brother.

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,600
A sister like that could be easily tempted by money.

96
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,640
Ai Meili, that's enough.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,040
Have you been watching too many TV dramas?

98
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Next month,

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,640
our company is launching a new jewelry design.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,480
I think it's called

101
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,900
Summer Night Star.

102
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,080
They say it will shock the entire industry when it's released.

103
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,800
I really want to see what kind of design it is.

104
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,600
See that?

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
She already has a motive.

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Excuse me,

107
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,440
do you three know each other?

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,280
Then why are you communicating by text messages?

109
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,120
Thank goodness the time is up.

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Otherwise, facing that little girl's questions

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,660
would have really put me in an awkward position.

112
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's have a meeting.

113
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,080
Wait.

114
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,400
School's out now.

116
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
I need to pick up my child.

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,880
Meili.

118
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
Forget it.

119
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
You know very well

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,000
how important her son is to her.

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Alright.

122
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,840
But

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,370
if Xiao Li wants to be a jewelry appraiser,

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
why

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,600
has Mr. Lin never mentioned it to us?

126
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Hello, Mr. Lin.

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
We'd like to talk to you about Xiao Li.

128
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,520
What?

129
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,240
She has already resigned?
