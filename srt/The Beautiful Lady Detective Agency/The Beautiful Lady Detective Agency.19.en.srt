1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,440
What's wrong?

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,570
Do you find something inappropriate?

3
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,200
The house

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
and savings, I can take half of everything.

5
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,519
I'm giving you everything now.

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
You should understand what I mean.

7
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,040
Impossible.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,400
The child is mine.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,460
You'll always be the child's mother.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
But if the child stays with me,

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,440
they'll have better education and living conditions.

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,039
A cheating father,

13
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,280
a shameless mistress.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,340
What kind of good environment could she possibly have?

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,520
You can say whatever you want about me.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
But for the child's sake,

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,120
this is the last time I'm consulting with you before the court hearing.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,450
Rest assured, the judge will be on my side.

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,160
I've been waiting for so long.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,000
Come out now.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Why were you talking for so long?

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Did she just say I have no shame?

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,640
Don't stoop to her level.

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
You scared me to death.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
I thought we almost got caught.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,130
She's the mistress, isn't she?

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,610
Look at her flirting. It's so obvious.

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,240
He's such a jerk.

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,720
Maybe we should let her have the child.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
When we get abroad,

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,840
I'll give you another child.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,530
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,840
I won't give up my daughter.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,100
I can't believe

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,680
that ex-husband has a mistress.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,640
Now we have another suspect.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,840
You mean the mistress?

38
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,600
From their conversation,

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,040
this mistress

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,040
doesn't want the child to go abroad with them.

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,120
Of course.

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,720
After all,

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
it's not her own child.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,000
I really don't understand

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
why people insist on having children.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,340
Being alone is so much better.

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Once you have children,

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,770
you'll understand.

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,920
If I had a child,

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
if I had a child,

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,320
Qiu Min wouldn't be with me all the time.

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,840
Actually,

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,680
I do like children.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,300
But I'm afraid to have one.

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,170
I'm afraid I won't raise them well.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,200
Before I had my child,

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
I had the same anxiety.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
But once the baby was born,

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,120
that feeling at that moment...

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,480
Whether it's easy or difficult,

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,720
you'll want to raise them to adulthood.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Bingbing,

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,480
go back and have a good talk with Qiu Min.

64
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,000
Qiu Min.

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,640
What are you doing?

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,240
There's a meeting the day after tomorrow.

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
I need to go on a trip.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
Qiu Min.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want a divorce.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,840
Until we're divorced,

71
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm still your wife,

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,000
and you're still my husband.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,860
Chen Bingbing.

74
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,440
What's the point of all this?

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
I know.

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,680
Getting you to admit you're wrong

77
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
is harder than climbing to heaven.

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
It's fine.

79
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm done.

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
Well,

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
let's talk about our child.

82
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,520
At a time like this,

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,320
you want to talk about children?

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Do you think I married you

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,120
just to have children?

86
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,400
Where is this?

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,520
Ms. Zhou's ex-husband's company.

88
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
What are we doing here?

89
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,880
Although I suspect he staged this himself,

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,440
Ms. Zhou said

91
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
he has

92
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,180
a video of his child being kidnapped.

93
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,320
So we're here today to find out what's really going on.

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's go.

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you three here to...

96
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
I want to see your general manager.

97
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,200
Do you have an appointment?

98
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,000
We're here to catch a cheating spouse.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,930
Do we need an appointment for that?

100
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
I don't understand what you mean.

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
You'd better call him out yourself.

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
Otherwise I'll do it for you.

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
Who are you three?

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
We're here about your child.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,659
Haven't we met somewhere before?

107
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,200
No, we haven't.

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,370
The video is on my phone.

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,840
You can take a look first.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,920
Xiaoru,

111
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,440
what would you like to eat today?

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,360
What do you want to buy?

113
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,760
Daddy will get you anything you want, okay?

114
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,280
I want to go to Grandma's house.

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
What's so fun at Grandma's house?

116
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
What would you like to play today?

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,720
Daddy will play with you, okay?

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
Okay?

119
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,920
Daddy needs to take a call.

120
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,200
Sit on the chair

121
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
and don't run around.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Go ahead.

123
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,040
It's me.

124
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,240
I've already bought the tickets.

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Once I finish my work in the next few days,

126
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,900
I'll come over.

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,800
Thank you.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,040
When I get there,

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,100
I'll need your help with many things.

130
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,840
Okay.

131
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Don't worry.

132
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,920
Xiaoru

133
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Stop playing hide and seek with daddy.

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
Let's go watch a movie.

135
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,720
Xiaoru

136
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,440
I thought in the mall I invested in,

137
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,700
my child would be safe.

138
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,620
Even if she was out of my sight,

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,600
but I was too naive.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,160
Xiaoru

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,760
I believed my ex-wife must have taken my child,

142
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,840
so I went to her place immediately.
