1
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,840
But

2
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,040
my mother passed away two years ago.

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
What?

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,440
Oh, right.

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,360
Today is my mother's birthday.

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,160
Could it be...

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,970
When your mother was alive,

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
was there any place she used to visit often?

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,850
My mother rarely went out in her lifetime.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
She once said

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,400
she loved the courtyard of our old house the most.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Is that old house still there?

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,060
The old house is long gone.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,920
It's now a construction site.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,640
But we don't have any other leads right now.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,840
Let's go check it out.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,520
Come on.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,520
Oh my God!

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,840
There's nobody here.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,800
This place is so creepy.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,920
Given my father's condition,

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,300
he wouldn't come to a place like this.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Be careful!

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,680
Look over there.

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
I think I see someone.

26
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,880
My dear wife,

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm not confused at all.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,800
I know you've been gone for a long time.

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,730
You didn't even wait for me.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Leaving this old man behind

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,280
all alone in this world.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
I miss you so much.

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,560
Today

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,079
is your birthday.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,480
I want to give you a gift.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
It's also been my regret for many years.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,880
But

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,240
this gift...

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,160
I don't know

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,690
if you can still receive it.

41
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm back from grocery shopping.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,760
You're back.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,320
After I finish this episode,

44
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
I'll go cook dinner for you.

45
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,240
What are you doing?

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,880
I was enjoying that.

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,240
How old are you now?

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,000
Still watching all these romantic shows.

49
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm making up for

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,200
the romance we missed when we were young.

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,400
Making up?

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Listen, dear.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,360
Are you saying

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,440
I wasn't romantic when I was young?

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,920
When you were young,

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
you never even said those three words

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,320
to me.

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,680
I thought

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,500
you didn't want to hear it.

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,840
I do want to hear it.

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,440
Say it to me now.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,720
I love...

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,360
I love...

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,960
Go wherever you want!

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
You stubborn old man!

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
You're just teasing me, aren't you?

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,680
No,

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,000
I just think

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
those three words

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,640
are too important.

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,360
I wanted to

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
wait for a special day to tell you.

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,240
I think

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,040
you're just too scared to say it.

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,640
But that's okay.

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
You said you wanted a special day.

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,480
Just wait until my birthday this year.

78
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,570
I'll be waiting for you.

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
Darling.

80
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
But while you were waiting,

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,320
it never came to pass.

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,920
And those words

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,320
have been stuck in my heart for three years.

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,840
Let's go home.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,300
I'm not going back.

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,280
Mom has been gone for two years.

87
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,500
You can't see her by staying here.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll see her soon.

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
Dad, what are you doing?

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,080
Don't stop me.

91
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,320
Let me go to your mother.

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,640
Dad, please don't do this.

93
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,880
Life has no meaning.

94
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,680
It's completely pointless.

95
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
Mr. Li,

96
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
we have a way

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
to let you see your wife again.

98
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
Do you really have a way?

99
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
Boss,

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
you're not thinking of...

101
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh my god.

102
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Boss,

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
you're not serious, are you?

104
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,480
Old Mr. Cangmo

105
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
never said this pocket watch

106
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,800
could only be used by the three of us.

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,440
But

108
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
have you forgotten what happened to me?

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,640
If we change history,

110
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,420
then reality will change too,

111
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,920
and it will affect the people involved.

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,520
I believe

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Mr. Li won't care about any of that.

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
Mr. Li,

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
we have a way

116
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,740
to let you see your wife again.

117
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,680
However,

118
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,210
there will be a price to pay.

119
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,080
What exactly that price will be,

120
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,600
we're not entirely sure.

121
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,600
Are you willing?

122
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,920
I am.

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,280
Child.

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,640
If...

125
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
If there really is such an opportunity.

126
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,280
I'd like to give it a try.

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Otherwise,

128
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
living with regrets

129
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,040
would be meaningless.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Then let's start now.

131
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,440
No,

132
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,040
give me one night.

133
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,080
Let me...

134
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,200
Let me prepare properly.

135
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Mom.

136
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,320
I'm home.

137
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,480
Have a seat.

138
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,520
Let's talk.

139
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,159
Recently

140
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,960
your performance has been poor.

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
You come home late every day after work.

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,680
The taste of your cooking

143
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,240
isn't as good as before.

144
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
Look at these windows,

145
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,330
they haven't been cleaned for a while.

146
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
How much do you pay me each month?

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,010
What did you say?

148
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,680
Are you treating me as your daughter-in-law or as your maid?

149
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
If you're treating me as a maid,

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,200
that's fine.

151
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
Just pay me a monthly salary.

152
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,840
Once you entered our family,

153
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,080
you must obey me.

154
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Fine.

155
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
This is a market economy now,

156
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,840
not a feudal society.

157
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm your son's wife,

158
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,040
not a servant you purchased.

159
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
How dare you talk back!

160
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,570
Servants wouldn't dare talk back.

161
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Make your own dinner tonight.

162
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm done serving you.

163
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,400
When I was young,

164
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,640
serving my mother-in-law,

165
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I was never as disrespectful as you.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,260
Then think about this:

167
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
When you were young,

168
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,040
you probably swallowed just as many grievances as I have.
