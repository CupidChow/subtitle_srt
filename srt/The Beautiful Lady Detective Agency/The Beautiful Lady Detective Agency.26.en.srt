1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,680
Qiu Min,

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,720
why are you here?

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,400
Bingbing.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
Are you okay?

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,800
Qiu Min.

6
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
Qiu Min.

7
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,840
Boss.

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,700
Have something to eat.

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,240
Boss.

10
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,320
This isn't helping anything.

11
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
Hey, Mom.

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm here,

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,450
do you know what day it is today?

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
Today.

15
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,340
Come back quickly.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
But I'm here...

17
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,680
Boss.

18
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,290
All of you should go home first.

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
You've been here

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,480
keeping me company for too long.

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,370
I need to wait for Qiu Min to wake up.

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Boss.

23
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Who knows what chaos might happen

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,240
at your homes if history changes.

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,300
Go home and check quickly.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,900
Remember to eat something, okay?

27
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,120
Mom, I want ice cream.

28
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,240
Thief!

29
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
Son, wait here for me.

30
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,360
My mom isn't gentle,

31
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
but she's brave.

32
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,840
I still love her just the way she is.

33
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Mom?

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Honey,

35
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
is nobody home?

36
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,120
Happy birthday to you.

37
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,920
Happy birthday to you.

38
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,800
Happy birthday to you.

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,400
Happy birthday to you.

40
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,640
It's not Mom's birthday today,

41
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
nor my husband's birthday,

42
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,720
and definitely not our wedding anniversary.

43
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
This is...

44
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,640
You forgot.

45
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Today is your lunar calendar birthday.

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,440
Thank you, Mom.

47
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
Thank you, honey.

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,060
Qiu Min.

49
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,180
Qiu Min.

50
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,160
Qiu Min.

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,440
Qiu Min.

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,080
What happened to me?

53
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,440
I thought you'd never wake up again.

54
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
Honey,

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm glad you're not hurt.

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,760
I'm fine.

58
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Honey,

59
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,840
let's have a baby.

60
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,010
Let's just let nature take its course.

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,330
This is the story of the Beauty Detective Agency.

62
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,560
Of course,

63
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
the story isn't over yet,

64
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,240
because more and more clients

65
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
are finding us

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,040
and need our help.

67
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,640
Excuse me,

68
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,400
how may I help you?
