1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,560
So

2
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,960
it's true.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,680
He was abducted by aliens.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,440
If it really was aliens,

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,440
then you're my only hope.

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,800
I heard

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,720
your club

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,450
has mysterious powers.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,200
From what we can see,

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,520
this is a locked-room disappearance case.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,080
We cannot determine

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,800
Mr. Li's safety at this point.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,360
Ms. Li,

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,400
do you have any photos of your father

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,720
or any of his personal belongings?

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm really sorry.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
My father and I aren't close.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,200
So when I came here...

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I only found this.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,240
Good.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,280
This is enough.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
Let's get started.

23
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,080
Start what?

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,120
Mrs. Li.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,490
We've already accepted your commission.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
You can go home now.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,880
Thank you then.

28
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,039
I'll be going now.

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Miss Lin,

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
why didn't you go?

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
My mother-in-law called me.

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,970
I need to go back right away.

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Get out!

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
I don't have a daughter like you.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,400
Dad.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm really busy with work,

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
but all the money I earn,

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
I give it all to you.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,760
You said you wanted the best room.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
I've chosen the best for you.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
You're getting the most expensive package.

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
I did choose the most expensive one for you.

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,170
This isn't even the best nursing home.

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,400
To be honest,

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,760
you're still too stingy to spend money.

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
Let me stay at the best place.

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,920
How am I being stingy?

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,360
Your monthly expenses

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
are almost as much as my salary.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
What more do you want?

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,160
What's wrong?

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,640
That's because you're incapable.

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,500
You can't even support an old man.

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,250
You're a failure as a daughter.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,570
What's wrong with this old man?

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,530
No wonder his daughter doesn't want to visit him.

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,000
Where's Yuechu?

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,320
Mom.

59
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,200
What's wrong?

60
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,640
Why did you call me back so urgently?

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,040
Think about it yourself.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
It's not time to cook yet.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,600
Think harder.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,640
The house cleaning?

65
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,970
I already cleaned up before going to work.

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Think again.

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
What did I do wrong?

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,680
Your husband is on a business trip.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,410
He just left.

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,079
I know.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,130
He'll only be gone for two days.

72
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,000
Did you pack his luggage for him?

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
Have you fulfilled your duty as a wife?

74
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,840
I wanted to help him.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,880
But he said it wasn't necessary.

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,400
You should have packed some extra clothes for him.

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,860
Just in case he needs them.

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,010
I'll go answer the door.

79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
Lin Meimei.

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
What's going on?

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
If Mr. Cang hadn't told us,

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,780
we thought you got lost time-traveling.

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
No wonder your mind isn't on your home.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,850
Chatting with these good-for-nothing friends all day.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,600
You've got quite a sharp tongue for an old lady.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm really fed up

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,920
Yuechu,

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,400
with such a mother-in-law.

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,060
How have you managed to put up with her until now?

90
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
Actually, she used to have a good personality,

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
but ever since my father-in-law passed away,

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,010
her temper has become increasingly strange.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Let me tell you,

94
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,000
you can't spoil someone like her.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
The weaker you are,

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,900
the more she'll walk all over you.

97
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
She's already so old,

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,080
so don't argue with her anymore.

99
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,520
By the way,

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,800
did you find anything when you went back in time?

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
I can't believe you have the nerve to ask,

102
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,100
when you didn't even say goodbye.

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
The Empress Dowager's text came at such a critical moment.

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
I was in such a hurry

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
that I forgot.

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
You're still calling her the Empress Dowager?

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,210
You really think you're a palace maid now.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
Anyway, this time when we went back,

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
we didn't find anything significant.

111
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
But that old man Li's temper

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
is truly awful.

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Even worse than your mother-in-law's.

114
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
We saw how unreasonable he was

115
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,840
and how he offended many people.

116
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,880
That caretaker

117
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,680
doesn't seem to like him either.

118
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,840
This old man is so difficult to deal with.

119
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,120
Whoever takes care of him is in for trouble.

120
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
Yeah, exactly.

121
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,170
What are you two talking about?

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm his caretaker.

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,840
Hey buddy,

124
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,880
no offense,

125
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,240
but you've got it rough.

126
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,320
That's the job we signed up for.

127
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
But you know,

128
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,280
I have ways to handle him.

129
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,400
Such a stubborn old man.

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,520
Even his own daughter can't manage him.

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,650
What methods could you possibly have?

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,240
He's just

133
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,400
a bully at home.

134
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,720
Just showing off in front of his family.

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
You guys,

136
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,900
once his daughter leaves,

137
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,520
making him behave

138
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
will only take a minute.

139
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,250
How can a caregiver be so arrogant?

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,400
So,

141
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,400
between him and old Li,

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
something must have happened

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
that we don't know about.

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,400
Then tomorrow,

145
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,860
we'll start investigating this caregiver.

146
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,840
Mr. Li.

147
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,160
It's over.

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm doomed now.

149
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,240
That old man has ruined me.

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,960
No.

151
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,240
Lin.

152
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Why are you in such a rush to grow old?

153
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Dressing so outdated.

154
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,240
Are you in a hurry to become a middle-aged woman?

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
Really?

156
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
I think it's fine.

157
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,640
It looks quite mature.

158
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,800
Even Meili thinks you're outdated.

159
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
Just imagine how unfashionable you must be.

160
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Exactly.

161
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,250
Why do I feel something's a bit off?

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Maybe I'm just trying to go for a retro look.

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Come on.

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,440
This isn't retro at all.

165
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
This is more like archaeological style.

166
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,370
Like something from the 60s or 70s.

167
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,240
I bet

168
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,640
your mother-in-law suggested this to you.

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
We rarely talk about clothes.

170
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
She insisted I wear her clothes.

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,800
I think it's a small step toward improving our relationship.

172
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
This is

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,280
a huge compromise on your part.

174
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,680
She's controlling you.

175
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,160
Bullying you, don't you see?

176
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,640
Meili, watch out!

177
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,800
Be careful!

178
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,370
What a coincidence.

179
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
You fat idiot! You're asking for trouble!

180
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,640
Can you afford to pay if you scratch my car?

181
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,680
Who do you think you are?

182
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
Just because you drive a luxury car doesn't mean you can be arrogant.

183
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

184
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,520
We weren't paying attention.

185
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,980
Be more careful next time.

186
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Forget it.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
That temper of yours.

188
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
So what if you're rich?

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
So what if you drive a luxury car?

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,520
Fancy car.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Boss.

192
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,040
Is that the caregiver we saw yesterday?

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

194
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm certain.

195
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
It's 100% him.
