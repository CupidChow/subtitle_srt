1
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,760
Mom.

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,720
Come on, son. Let's go home.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,680
Come here.

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,960
Mom.

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,680
What's wrong?

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm sorry, baby.

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,720
I was too busy with work.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,320
Can you pick me up earlier next time?

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,400
The other kids went home long ago.

10
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
This Li girl,

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,440
she's quite bold.

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,120
Getting old man Cangmo to pretend to be a delivery man,

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,480
and easily tricking out the address.

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,400
Only you could come up with such a sneaky plan.

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,440
Such a harmless-looking girl,

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
how could she possibly be a suspect?

17
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,039
Look,

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,479
isn't that Li?

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,280
It's only been three months,

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,810
how has she changed so much?

21
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,920
Look up.

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
Ruiya Jewelry

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,880
I told you there was something fishy about this little vixen.

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,639
She's working for our competitor now.

25
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,479
How dare she?

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,700
She must have traded our design blueprints.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
If you were Xiao Li,

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,240
and you got the blueprints,

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
what would you do?

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,520
I'd use them as leverage at the competing company.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
Exchange them for what?

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,640
For a job

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
that pays well

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
and gives me less stress.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,400
And then?

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
Then I'd happily go to work every day.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
Living comfortably.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
That's exactly the problem.

40
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,640
Would someone who goes to work carefree every day

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
be this conspicuous?

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,640
Just because

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,040
she went to work for our competitor, Ruiya Jewelry.

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,170
That's why she has a clear conscience.

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,600
So that means

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,079
we've been tracking the wrong person.

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
But

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,660
why did she resign in the first place?

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,540
Could she have some secret she can't talk about?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
Why don't

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,010
we try investigating from another angle?

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,640
It's simple.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,920
Let's investigate her direct supervisor, Wu Liangxin.

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm preparing to go back.

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,530
What are you guys doing?

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,880
If you keep this up,

57
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll be exposed sooner or later.

58
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,000
That Lin person won't spare me,

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,570
and certainly won't spare you either.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,600
If we die,

61
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,210
we all die together.

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,760
Go.

63
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,459
Hello, Manager Wu.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Manager Wu.

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,200
Hello, miss. What would you like to order?

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,440
Morning, Li.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
Good morning, Manager Wu.

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,480
This doesn't seem appropriate.

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,610
This won't work.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Why don't we go to my office to discuss work?

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,010
Manager Wu, I'm still very busy right now.

72
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,360
This Wu Liangxin and Xiao Li

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,730
Are they in a relationship?

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
Flirting during work hours

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
shows such a lack of professionalism.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Judging by the girl's reaction,

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,700
this looks more like workplace harassment.

78
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
I can't stand by anymore.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,200
Leave it to me.

80
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,040
Excuse me,

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,600
are you in charge here?

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,040
Hello.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm the manager here.

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
How may I help you?

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,820
I'd like to see this piece of jewelry.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,460
You have excellent taste.

87
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,159
Are you blind?

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,040
I meant this one.

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,640
Do you mean this one?

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,560
Well,

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,040
I see you're not only blind,

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,000
but also brainless.

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm talking about this one!

94
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Could you please point to it precisely?

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,760
Which one exactly?

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,960
You have no idea

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,560
what kind of manager you are.

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you getting paid for doing nothing?

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Are you here just to cause trouble?

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,800
I'm here

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
to buy jewelry.

102
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,200
But...

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,960
I only see a pig here.

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,440
Who are you calling a pig?

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,160
You have some nerve.

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,200
Emily, stop it!

107
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,200
Hitting people is illegal.

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Let me tell you, the customer is always right.

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,370
I'll file so many complaints against you.

110
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Oh no.

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Does this count as changing history?

112
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,250
Impossible.

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,520
Teaching a jerk a lesson is nothing.

114
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,760
But I was too impulsive.

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,480
I really need to work on my temper.

116
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
Luckily he doesn't dare to make a big deal out of this.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,960
Otherwise,

118
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,000
you'd end up in detention.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,330
Wait a minute, you guys.

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Thank you all.

121
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,960
I know you were just trying to help me out.

122
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
Even if he's your boss,

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,120
you shouldn't let him bully you like this.

124
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
Silly girl.

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
I know,

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,960
but I don't have any choice.

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Because...

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,760
Look at this.

129
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Just look.

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,620
Nothing's changed in the real world.

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,800
Did you hear that?

132
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
Xiao Li said

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
she has no choice.

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,720
Could it be

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,480
that Wu Liangxin has something on her?

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,680
Let's have a meeting

137
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,810
and figure this out.

138
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,120
Oh no!

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm out of time.

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
I need to pick up my kid from school.

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,520
Let's go.

142
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,840
Oh no.

143
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,440
I promised my mother-in-law I'd be home by now.

144
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Sweetie.

145
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,880
I'm sorry,

146
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
Mommy's late again.

147
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm so sorry.

148
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
Son,

149
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,280
what's wrong?

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,120
Oh my God!

151
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,560
Huang Lou.
