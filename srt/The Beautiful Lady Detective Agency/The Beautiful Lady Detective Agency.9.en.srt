1
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,440
Xiao Li means more to you

2
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
than your work.

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Am I

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,600
wrong about that?

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,060
Yes, I switched the design drawings.

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
But that's because

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,000
Manager Lin stained it.

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,400
I wasn't wrong about you.

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,039
You're truly an artist.

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,080
So talented.

11
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,240
I really love

12
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,600
this design of yours.

13
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,840
Wang.

14
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,810
You're about to become famous overnight.

15
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,840
Initially,

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
I just wanted perfection.

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,840
Xiao Li,

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
do you have a boyfriend?

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm talking to you.

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,050
Do you have a boyfriend?

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,920
Manager Wu, please don't do this.

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,579
I'm still a bit busy right now.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,640
I was just joking with you.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,200
Your face is all red.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,720
The great Designer Wang, you're here.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Manager Lin will be here soon.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,700
You can wait for him in the office.

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,760
Director Lin, I think

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,040
this area should be dark blue,

30
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,280
to better capture the feeling of stars.

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,520
Not bad.

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
I agree with your idea.

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
Mr. Lin, we're done.

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,640
Very good.

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
Let's wrap up for today.

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,079
See you next week.

37
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,680
Yes, Mr. Lin.

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
See you next week.

39
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,640
That night,

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,780
I snuck into Mr. Lin's office.

41
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,720
By analyzing the intensity of the fluorescent marks,

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,250
I quickly determined the password sequence.

43
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I just wanted my work to be flawless.

44
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,040
What's wrong with that?

45
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,560
But you still sold those rejected drafts

46
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
to a competing company

47
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,320
using Wu Liangxin's name.

48
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
Because you discovered

49
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,840
he had been selling your discarded work.

50
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,640
Why not use his betrayal?

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,080
To help Xiao Li

52
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
get rid of a harasser.

53
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,440
Hey!

54
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,400
What are you guys doing?

55
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
If you keep this up,

56
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,600
I'll be exposed sooner or later.

57
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,840
That Lin person won't let me off,

58
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,040
and certainly won't spare you either.

59
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,900
If we go down, we go down together.

60
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,050
Add me on WeChat.

61
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,720
We'll do it again.

62
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,320
Wang Mai

63
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Is everything she said true?

64
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Stay back!

65
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Nobody move!

66
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,240
Wang Mai,

67
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,200
don't do anything stupid.

68
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
This has nothing to do with Xiao Li.

69
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll take responsibility

70
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,410
for everything myself.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Mr. Lin,

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,370
I broke the industry rules.

73
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
If you're not satisfied with my actions,

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,920
do whatever you want with me.

75
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,080
Wang Mai.

76
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Li.

77
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Since

78
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
we've done wrong,

79
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
let's turn ourselves in.

80
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,010
Hurting yourself like this is pointless.

81
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Li.

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,040
I've let you down.

83
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,680
I know.

85
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,440
I mean so much to you.

86
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
That already makes me happy.

87
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,000
I've failed you.
