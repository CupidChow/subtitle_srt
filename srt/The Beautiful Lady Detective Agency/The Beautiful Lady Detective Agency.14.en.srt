1
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,880
Before Old Mr. Li disappeared,

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,640
Mr. Hai from our courtyard

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,440
would often go into his room.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,400
But one time,

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,880
I was really scared.

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,770
Why are you here?

7
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,880
What are these two old geezers up to?

8
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,880
Room check.

9
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,640
Open up.

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,120
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

11
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,050
Can your body handle it at your age?

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,039
What was Mr. Hai doing in your room,

13
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,160
Brother Hai?

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Nothing.

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
Were you gathering to drink together?

16
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
No, no.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,960
Get out of the way!

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,180
Where is everyone?

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
What the hell?

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,039
Where did they all go?

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
According to that caregiver's description.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Old Mr. Hai

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,970
also disappeared in that room before.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,320
This means

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,240
that Mr. Hai must be an alien.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
It means there's something fishy about that room.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,120
But

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,410
we don't have the authority to inspect that ward.

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
We can find a breakthrough

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,320
through this Mr. Hai.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Get ready to travel back tomorrow

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,240
to meet this doorkeeper.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
You're back.

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,450
I'll go make dinner.

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
If you don't want to do it, forget it.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,480
I want to do it.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,080
I can see it.

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,680
You think I'm a burden.

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,940
You don't want to take care of me anymore.

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
You're overthinking.

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
I don't think you're a burden.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm just living my own life.

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,920
You're just a part of my life.

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Let me go.

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
You can't leave.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
Are you going to help me or not?

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,880
I can't help you.

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,440
Why can't you help me?

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,200
What's going on here?

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,079
What happened to being close?

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Stop watching.

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,440
Let's break up the fight first.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,370
Please stop fighting, gentlemen.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Mr. Li,

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,900
you're playing with fire.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,130
If you won't help me,

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,680
then stop bringing me food every day.

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
Just let me die.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,120
I don't want to live anyway.

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
You're making trouble for nothing.

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Cut the crap.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
Will you help me or not?

63
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,200
I can't help you.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,480
Mr. Hai

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,399
What's going on here?

66
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,730
Chinese security guard

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,399
Old Li was

68
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,680
insisting on it.

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
Why is this so awkward?

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,370
I tried to mediate for nothing.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
There's something between them.

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
Old Li asked Mr. Hai

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,640
to do something for him.

74
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,120
What could it be?

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
Stop guessing.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,080
Why don't we go to the nursing home

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
to find Mr. Hai

78
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,200
and try to get him talking

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,860
to see if we can get some clues?

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,240
That's our only option.

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,920
Let's go.

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,880
You must be

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,460
friends of Old Li's daughter, right?

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,680
Mr. Hai,

85
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,840
you recognize us?

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,480
Why are you so happy today?

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
You probably don't know,

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
but

89
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Old Li's caretaker

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,140
turned himself in at the police station.

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
This guy

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,000
scammed several elderly people's families

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,400
and embezzled care funds

94
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,800
of 2 to 3 million.

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,040
So

96
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,880
you misunderstood Ms. Li before?

97
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,000
If Old Li knew about this,

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
he'd be thrilled.

99
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you know where Old Li is?

100
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
How would I know?

101
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
Mr. Hai,

102
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
are you

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,260
also doing repair work for the nursing home?

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,000
I was a welder when I was young.

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,360
Now I'm old

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,240
and retired.

107
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,880
I don't want to lose my skills.

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
When I have free time,

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
I practice to keep my hand in.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
In that case,

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,660
Old Hai doesn't have any suspicious points.

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
It's clear that

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,720
his relationship with Old Mr. Li

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
is quite good.

115
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
If they had an argument,

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
it was because Old Li

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,520
asked Old Hai to do something for him,

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,120
but Old Hai didn't want to do it.

119
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,800
So,

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,280
what's his value?

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,260
Delivering meals.

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,100
Of course it's Old Hai's cooking skills.

123
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
I contacted Ms. Li the day before yesterday.

124
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,920
When I asked her to get me the visitor records,

125
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,040
she also obtained

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
Old Li's room transfer records.

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,640
I didn't pay much attention at the time,

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
but now,

129
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,400
this should be a breakthrough.

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,600
Room transfer.

131
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Why did he

132
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
insist on changing from a shared room

133
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
to a private one?

134
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Unless he was doing something in the room

135
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,520
that no one else could see.

136
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,200
And

137
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,920
he needed Old Hai's help too.

138
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
That's right.

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,000
Then we can pretty much

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,040
figure out who the suspect is.

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,040
I got it.

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
So,

143
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
the suspect,

144
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
who is it exactly?

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,400
Hello, Ms. Li.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,600
I think we've figured out

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,480
who kidnapped your father.

148
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,080
It's Old Hai, the doorman at the nursing home.

149
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,360
Ming Hong Huang
