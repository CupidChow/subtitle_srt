1
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Something's up.

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,240
What's wrong?

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,040
I think I just saw Qiu Min.

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,680
What for?

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Isn't he

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,080
supposed to be having dinner with friends?

7
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,810
Then why are you overreacting?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
Besides,

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,720
do those two look like they're here for dinner?

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,840
There's obviously something going on.

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,520
Bingbing,

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,600
you're here.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,050
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,440
What are you doing, sister-in-law?

15
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,720
Who's your sister-in-law?

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,080
You shameless woman!

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,440
She's my cousin.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,880
She.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,440
She's my cousin.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
She studies psychology.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,280
I

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,330
asked her to help me with my condition.

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,460
What's wrong with you?

24
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,800
Qiu Min wants children.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
But you don't.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,320
The elders are putting so much pressure on him.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,280
He doesn't want to affect your career.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,740
He's keeping everything bottled up inside.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,800
Then why didn't you

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,000
tell me all this, Qiu Min?

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,800
Let me tell you.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,680
You don't even know my cousin.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
We've been married for over 3 years.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
There have been at least 20 family gatherings.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,720
You always make excuses to avoid them.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,400
You can't even recognize all my relatives.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,640
Let me tell you.

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Do you ever care about my feelings?

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,720
Cousin.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,360
Enough.

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,079
Stop pretending, will you?

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,440
I see right through you.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,900
Chen Bingbing.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,880
Let's get a divorce.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
It's all my fault.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Boss.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,600
You shouldn't always blame yourself in front of us.

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,640
These words

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,770
you should say to the person involved.

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
But I can't bring myself to do it.

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Boss.

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,840
That means you haven't fully

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,440
recognized your mistakes.

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
I already know I was wrong.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,600
Then go apologize!

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,200
I told you I can't face it.

57
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
Excuse me, is this the Beauty Detective Agency?

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,480
Madam, how can we help you?

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,399
I'm begging you,

60
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,640
please help me find my daughter Xiaoru.

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
Your daughter is missing?

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
Can you tell us more details?

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
My daughter

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
was taken away by my husband.

65
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,880
That's easy to handle.

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,440
Just give me your ex-husband's address.

67
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,040
But...

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
He claims

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
that I kidnapped the child.

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
What?

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,280
Tang Dingchao, what do you want?

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,980
Are you some kind of gangster?

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
I'm just here to pick up my daughter.

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Take a good look at the divorce agreement.

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Are you blind?

76
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,570
Our daughter stays with me.

77
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,440
But I have visitation rights.

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,500
But you have no right to take her away.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
You think I don't know

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
what you're really up to?

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,840
People from your company told me everything.

82
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,700
You've applied for immigration.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,320
You're about to leave.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,090
You want to take our daughter with you, right?

85
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,900
Take my daughter away!

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,720
What are you doing?

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,600
What do you want?

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
In broad daylight,

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
What are you doing?

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
have you no shame?

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
You're bullying us because we're outnumbered.

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
Let me go!

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,580
What's all the fuss about?

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
I'll bring the child back in a few days.

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,220
Isn't that enough?

96
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
What a hassle.

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,970
Mom, please eat something.

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
I have no appetite.

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,200
Mom, don't worry.

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
I've consulted a lawyer.

101
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,610
If he doesn't return the child,

102
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,240
that's illegal.

103
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,460
By the time you act,

104
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,940
he'll have already taken the child away.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Can the law still restrain him?

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,440
Why are you so weak?

107
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Xiaoru.

108
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,080
Xiaoru.

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320
Xiaoru.

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
Xiaoru.

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
What else do you want?

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,440
Xiaoru.

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Zhou Han.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,400
Give me back my child.

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
What do you mean?

116
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,000
Isn't our daughter with you?

117
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,440
I know.

118
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,480
You must have had someone take my child away.

119
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,040
Didn't you?

120
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,440
Give her back to me now.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
You actually lost our child.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
You bastard!

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,680
It really wasn't you?

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,260
I'll go look for her again.

125
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
So you're saying

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,480
you suspect your husband

127
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,080
is staging this whole thing?

128
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,320
Because I still have feelings for him,

129
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
so I didn't call the police.

130
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
You said your husband is about to emigrate?

131
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
In four days.

132
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,400
I suspect he's stalling for time,

133
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,340
but I really hope that's the case.

134
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
Why?

135
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
At least I'd know my child is safe.

136
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
But if

137
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,120
my child was really kidnapped by strangers...

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Then...

139
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Ms. Zhou,

140
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,240
please don't worry.

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,680
I don't know if you've seen

142
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,520
our consultation notice?

143
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
I brought it.

144
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,800
This is her favorite toy.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
What do you need this for?

146
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,570
You don't need to worry about that.

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,680
We will help you find your child.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,240
Please don't be Dad.
