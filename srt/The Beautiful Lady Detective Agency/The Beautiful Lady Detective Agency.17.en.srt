1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,370
You're here quite early today.

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Today is when Mr. Li visits his wife.

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,400
He'll be here soon.

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,440
It's right here.

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
They're here.

6
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,280
Daughter.

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
What are we doing here?

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
You're going to see Mom today.

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,840
Isn't she at home?

10
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,680
Why do we need to come here?

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,400
Excuse me, everyone.

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,640
My dad's episodes are becoming more and more frequent.

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,240
It's okay.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,520
So

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,920
let's get started.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm back from grocery shopping.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
Welcome back.

18
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,120
I'll cook for you later.

19
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,880
After I finish this episode.

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,050
What's going on?

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,380
Why are you dressed like this just to buy groceries?

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,640
Honey.

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
I love you.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Did you take the wrong medicine today?

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
I love you.

26
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,440
You're both getting on in years.

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
I love you.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,600
Do you know

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
how long I've been waiting

30
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,840
to hear those words?

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
Darling,

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,320
I want to

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,640
give you all of me -

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
my past,

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,040
my present,

36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
and my future.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
Darling,

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,920
I love you.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,840
I love you too.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
We were worried the old man wouldn't remember what to say.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
But at that moment, when he saw his love,

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,520
he became lucid instantly.

43
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Perhaps this is the power of love.

44
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,120
Where are Mrs. Li and Mr. Li?

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
What Mrs. Li and Mr. Li?

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,079
Where have you all been?

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
It seems

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
the reality timeline has truly changed.

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm really worried about Mr. Li's health.

50
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,640
Let's go check on him.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,079
Who are you?

52
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Is Mr. Li feeling better?

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,400
He's sick.

54
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,920
Please follow me.

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,440
Hello everyone.

56
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,520
Mr. Li,

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,210
how are you feeling?

58
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm fine.

59
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,240
I've recovered a bit.

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Do you remember everything that happened?

61
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
I remember.

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
I saw my wife.

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
Changed history.

64
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,720
But none of that matters.

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,640
I want to thank you all.

66
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,240
For letting me say what I wanted

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
to her.

68
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
I thought

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,240
those three words

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
would never leave

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,920
my lips in this lifetime.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,080
But the moment I said them,

73
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,840
I realized

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,720
I could never say them enough.

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Since you're doing fine,

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,610
That puts our minds at ease.

77
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,320
Thank you.

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,800
We won't disturb you anymore.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Get some rest.

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Thank you.

81
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,200
Thank you.

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,920
Daughter,

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
see them out.

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,600
After the old man recovers,

85
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,440
will he return to the nursing home?

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,040
We'll visit him regularly.

87
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,080
That won't be necessary.

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,840
My father has a difficult temperament.

89
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,600
I later realized he was just too lonely.

90
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
Since my mother passed away,

91
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm his only family left.

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
I want to stay by his side

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,880
through his final journey.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,240
Oh, by the way,

95
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Old Mr. Hai often comes to visit him too.

96
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,760
It seems

97
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,600
no matter how history changes,

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Old Mr. Hai

99
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,640
will always be Old Mr. Li's good friend.

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,520
Thank you all.

101
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,260
Although I don't know what happened,

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,120
when I first met you,

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,640
I felt that you've helped me tremendously.

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,280
Thanks.

105
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,680
You're too kind.

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
We'll be going now.

107
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,280
Goodbye.

108
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,320
What a pity,

109
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,840
such a shame.

110
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,520
What's a pity?

111
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
Old Li and Ms. Li's relationship

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,840
isn't as tense as before.

113
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,200
Old Li

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,860
was brought home from the nursing home by Ms. Li.

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,320
Then Old Li

116
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
wouldn't have been lured away by Old Hai.

117
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,800
Ms. Li

118
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,760
wouldn't have come to our detective agency

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,320
to hire us for the case.

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Our payment

121
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,840
is down the drain.

122
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
That's right.

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,080
I was waiting for that money to buy health supplements for my mother-in-law.

124
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,600
All gone now.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
But

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
I don't regret it at all.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,659
What about you?

128
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,040
No regrets.

129
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,280
Seeing someone live without regrets

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
for me

131
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,200
is the greatest reward.

132
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,000
No way.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm still a bit upset.

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,080
Upset, huh?

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,040
Then tonight,

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,680
how about I treat you all to a feast?

137
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,000
Great!

138
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,240
Consider it compensation for our hard work these past few days.

139
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,200
I get to decide what we eat.

140
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
No problem.

141
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
Let's go.

142
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Cheers!

143
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,400
To successfully solving another case!

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,640
Something's up.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,440
What's wrong?

146
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,240
I think I just saw Qiu Min.
