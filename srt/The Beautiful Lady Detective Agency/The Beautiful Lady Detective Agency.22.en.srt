1
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,720
Dameili

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,680
Found you!

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,440
Good girl.

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,240
What's going on?

5
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Let go!

6
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,200
It's you three again.

7
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,600
What are you three up to?

8
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,240
Now we've caught you red-handed.

9
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
What do you have to say for yourself?

10
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,610
What do you mean?

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
Go.

13
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,280
This is ridiculous.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,880
Excuse me.

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,580
What were you just saying?

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,240
You suspect I kidnapped a child?

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Why would I kidnap my own daughter?

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,720
We thought

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
you were taking your daughter away.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,120
Let's drop this.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
That foreign child is...

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,520
I have a client from abroad coming over.

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,240
They wanted their child to come to China a few days early.

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I went to the airport today

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,079
to pick up their child.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
So

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,720
all those things you bought for a child

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
were for that foreign kid.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
What did you say?

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,240
Nothing.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,640
We were wondering,

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,700
aren't you going abroad in a few days?

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,280
How could you have foreign clients coming here?

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,010
What's the connection between these two things?

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
The child was frightened today.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
Xiaohan,

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
go keep the child company.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,700
I've canceled my flight tickets.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,920
I've decided not to emigrate for now.

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,800
What?

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Until I find my daughter,

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
I won't leave China.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
That's a relief.

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
What?

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,200
Nothing.

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,200
There's one more thing

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to update you on.

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,920
I suspect

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,400
the person who took my daughter

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
is my girlfriend.

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
What did you say?

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,680
I suspect my current girlfriend, Zhao Xiaohan,

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,700
was involved in kidnapping my daughter.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
Why would you think that?

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,660
My girlfriend doesn't like my daughter.

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,610
I know this better than anyone.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,329
So this is what they call a rational, successful man -

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
suspecting even those closest to him.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
This might be my intuition

61
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
from years of business experience.

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,120
But your so-called intuition alone

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,600
cannot be considered as evidence.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,920
Of course I know.

65
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,899
Because on the day my daughter disappeared,

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,100
I found out my girlfriend was also there.

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,280
This couldn't be a coincidence.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Xiaoru.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Xiaoru.

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,320
Xiaohan.

71
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,040
I...

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,050
What's going on?

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,080
I brought my child here to play.

75
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,320
I took a phone call and then she disappeared.

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll help you look for her.

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Let's check with the information desk.

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,200
What's there to consider?

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
Isn't it obvious?

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,240
The suspect is clearly Zhao Xiaohan.

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,600
It could just be a coincidence.

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,460
That's too much of a coincidence.

83
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,240
We don't have absolute certainty.

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,770
We can't confirm Zhao Xiaohan is the suspect.

85
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Then we'll have to travel back in time.

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
To uncover Zhao Xiaohan's secrets.

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm telling you.

88
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Her ex-husband is really devious.

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,260
Even providing us with props.

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
On the surface,

91
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,740
he still acts so lovingly with Zhao Xiaohan.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,920
That's called not alerting your target.

93
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,880
But when he pulled out those shoes,

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,460
I got chills down my spine.

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Let's call it a day.

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,450
We'll time travel again tomorrow.

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
You're back!

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,600
Come eat dinner.

99
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,100
I've been waiting for you.

100
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
You actually cooked?

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
Sit down and try it.

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Try this one.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,840
This?

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
Have some more.

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,640
How is it?

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,880
It's pretty good.

107
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,320
You've learned cooking before, right?

108
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,400
I just learned it.

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,060
I wanted to cook a meal for you.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
You've

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,320
changed a lot.

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
I hope

113
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,400
I can share some of the burden

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
of what you've done for me before

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
for this home.

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,850
Let's not talk about this anymore.

117
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,320
Eat more, please.

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,440
Oh no!

119
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,600
I can't find my treasure again.

120
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,000
If they find it,

121
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
will they know it was us?

122
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,280
Boss.

123
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,200
Why are we dressed like this for time travel?

124
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
We've time-traveled so many times.

125
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
It's good to disguise ourselves occasionally,

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
isn't it?

127
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,000
Stop talking and get to work.

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,530
Hello, who are you looking for?

129
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
It's you.

130
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,680
We haven't gone abroad yet.

131
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm not sure when we'll leave.

132
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,520
What do I care if the child suffers?

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,610
Finally showing your true colors.

134
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,640
It's you.

135
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,840
We haven't gone abroad yet.

136
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm not sure when we'll leave.

137
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,800
What do I care if the child suffers?

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
You vixen!

139
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,440
Give me back my daughter!

140
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,799
I never thought you could be so vicious.

141
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,080
Where is my daughter?

142
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,240
I really don't know where your daughter is.

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,000
Zhao Xiaohan,

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,130
it doesn't matter if you won't tell us.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,840
The evidence is conclusive now.

146
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
You can explain it to the police.

147
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
Let's go.

148
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,240
Darling,

149
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,600
I really don't know where your child is.

150
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Then why were you

151
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,000
at the scene when my daughter was kidnapped?

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,920
Because...

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
Because I knew that day

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,000
someone would kidnap a child.

155
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,840
What?
