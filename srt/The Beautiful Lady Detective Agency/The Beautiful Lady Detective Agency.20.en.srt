1
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,160
Thank you.

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,400
When we get there,

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,460
I'll need your help with many things.

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,560
Okay.

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Don't worry.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
It looks like a man.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,120
Judging from his movements,

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,400
he seems to be a man around 60.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,400
Then it's possible the mistress sent him

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,640
to kidnap the child.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,080
Something's strange.

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,440
What is it?

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,800
Wait a moment.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,080
I have children of my own.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,920
Usually when children meet strangers,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
they're very cautious.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
But Ms. Zhou's child,

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,840
why

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,880
didn't show any resistance?

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,080
That's right.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,080
If he were really the suspect,

22
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,080
he would have grabbed the child and left immediately.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,479
Why did he kneel down to comfort her?

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,880
This indicates...

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,600
It means the child knows him.

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,720
If the child knows him,

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,560
then

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
this person must be connected to Ms. Zhou

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,400
or her ex-husband.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,280
What should we do next?

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
Let's ask Ms. Zhou

32
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,720
about the people

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,250
her child is familiar with.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Where are we?

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,240
The child's maternal grandmother's home.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
Why are we here?

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,240
Ms. Zhou is too busy with work

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,600
and doesn't have time to meet us.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,560
She asked us to come here first

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,690
to talk with the child's grandmother.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
Her child is missing and she still focuses on her career?

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
In my opinion,

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,640
this couple

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,900
are completely irresponsible parents.

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
Remember this very carefully.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,600
The child's grandmother

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,800
doesn't know about the kidnapping yet.

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Don't slip up and mention it.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
Is anybody home?

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
Get out of here!

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,120
Ma'am?

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
Please open the door.

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,040
You've already taken my granddaughter away.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
What more do you want?

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Are you going to take me away too?

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,880
To some foreign country?

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,560
Ma'am,

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,040
there's been a misunderstanding.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
We're friends of your daughter.

60
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,000
We're here to ask you.

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Does your granddaughter

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,840
know any other adults

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,680
besides you and her parents?

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,480
Why are you asking this?

65
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,240
We're private investigators hired by your daughter

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
to find out where her ex-husband

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,640
has hidden your granddaughter.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,650
At least she's taking some action.

69
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Speaking of her ex-husband,

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,200
I hate that homewrecker even more.

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
If she hadn't interfered,

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
we would still be a happy family.

73
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,079
Grandma,

74
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,200
we're talking about the child right now.

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,329
Don't interrupt me.

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,240
I just don't understand.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
If he could abandon his wife and daughter

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
to be with that homewrecker,

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,880
why does he want his daughter?

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,360
Besides,

81
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,420
that homewrecker doesn't even like my granddaughter.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
So you mean

83
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
you're aware that

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
that vixen

85
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,240
doesn't like your granddaughter?

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,040
My granddaughter told me so.

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,620
Are you having fun visiting the company?

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
Sweetie.

89
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,360
This is Aunt Xiaohan.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,159
Say hello.

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,290
Where are the manners your dad taught you?

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,420
It's okay. She's just a little child.

93
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,640
Xiaohan.

94
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,620
I need to go inside and make a call.

95
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
Watch her for me for a moment.

96
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,520
And bond with her a little.

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
You'll be her mother soon.

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,240
Oh my! Don't let others see us.

99
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,900
What are you afraid of?

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
Everyone in the company already knows.

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,300
They're just pretending not to know.

102
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
Listen to auntie.

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,320
Would you like some snacks?

104
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
No thanks, you vixen.

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,170
What did you say?

106
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
You're the homewrecker.

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,760
You're nothing but a vixen.

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,600
I saw your photos

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
on my mom's phone.

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You can't blame me for this.

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
Who else should I blame?

112
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,159
Fine, I understand.

113
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,560
Okay.

114
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,160
Listen carefully, you little brat.

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
I don't want to see you either.

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
And I definitely don't want to be your mother.

117
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,320
Try to stay out of my sight from now on.

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
Or I'll have someone kidnap you and take you to the mountains

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,400
to be someone's wife.

120
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,880
So

121
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
there's really no need.

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,320
You mean

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,840
that mistress

124
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,560
even threatened your granddaughter?

125
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
That's right.

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,880
When I heard about it,

127
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,040
I was furious.

128
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,800
If my daughter hadn't stopped me...

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,200
I...

130
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Boss.

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
I think we're getting off track.

132
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Right.

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
We just want to know

134
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,120
if the child knows

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,760
any other acquaintances in the neighborhood.

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
Our child

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,760
is very popular in our neighborhood.

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,520
All these elderly folks

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,680
adore her.

140
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,770
She's even the mascot of our cultural center.

141
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,320
Is that so?

142
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,760
That's quite a broad range then.

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
So

144
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,400
this mistress

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,060
could still possibly have kidnapped the child.

146
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,120
Kidnapped!

147
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,520
My granddaughter has been kidnapped!

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
Grandma!

149
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
Grandma, are you okay?

150
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,600
Grandma!

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
Yuechu, call an ambulance quickly!

152
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,160
Okay.

153
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,850
Grandma!

154
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,650
Grandma!

155
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
Ms. Zhou.

156
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,820
How is my mother doing now?

157
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,850
The doctor is still examining her.

158
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,320
Fine.

159
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
I hereby announce

160
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,160
that I'm terminating our contract.

161
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
Ms. Zhou,

162
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,160
it's our fault,

163
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,660
but it's not that serious.

164
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,400
We can still-

165
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,659
It's been so many days.

166
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,000
Have you made any progress?

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,760
My ex-husband is about to leave the country,

168
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,320
and you haven't found any leads about my child,

169
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,520
and now my mother is in the hospital too!

170
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,290
Are you actually helping me

171
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,090
or trying to destroy my family?

172
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,560
Doctor, how's my mother?

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
Don't worry.

174
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
The elderly lady is in stable condition now.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,060
She doesn't need to be hospitalized.

176
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,980
It's that mild?

177
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,360
According to the cardio-cerebral monitor results,

178
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,200
she didn't faint from being frightened.

179
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,360
It's likely due to recent insomnia and anxiety.

180
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,320
You can take her home shortly.

181
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Make sure she gets plenty of rest and sleeps well.

182
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,880
She doesn't need any medication.

183
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Okay, thank you, doctor.
