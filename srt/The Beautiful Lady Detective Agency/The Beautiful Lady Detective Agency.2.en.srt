1
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,180
Is this the Detective Agency?

2
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
I have a matter

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,580
that I'd like to entrust you with.

4
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,850
Here's the payment.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,080
Please come in.

6
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,970
Let me introduce myself first.

7
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,720
My name is Lin Yongsheng,

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm the owner of Xingyao Jewelry in this city.

9
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,039
Lin Shengsheng Jewelry?

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,400
Could it be

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,530
the largest jewelry store in the city?

12
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,840
Yes.

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Since you're so financially powerful, Mr. Lin,

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
what brings you to us today?

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,479
So beautiful.

16
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,360
Is this a new design?

17
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,770
It is indeed beautiful.

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,560
This jewelry collection

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
is called Summer Night Star.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,280
It was created by me and my designer Wang Mai

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,800
over the course of three years

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,520
of design and production.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,320
However, what I never expected was that

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,560
yesterday...

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,160
I understand.

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,880
Go ahead with your work.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, no problem.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,130
Let's do it that way.

29
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,880
What's wrong?

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
The Ruiya Jewelry store across the street

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,380
is having a new product launch today.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
Such a small competitor,

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
what is there to worry about?

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,160
The name of their new product at the launch

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,020
is also called Summer Night Star.

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,280
What?

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,760
Today,

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,480
the Summer Night Star released by Ruiya Jewelry

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,080
will be a revolutionary jewelry design.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,440
It will lead a new fashion trend.

41
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
Its exquisite craftsmanship

42
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,920
will certainly exceed everyone's imagination.

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Now,

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,200
let's witness together

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,640
this exciting moment.

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,120
This can't be happening!

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
How is that impossible?

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
It's simple.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,960
I'll solve this case for you right now.

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,240
Your designer

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,120
sold the design blueprints to two companies

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,180
and designed them.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Impossible.

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,200
Because of this matter,

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,440
this designer yesterday

56
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,320
almost committed suicide

57
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,890
in my jewelry store.

58
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
Could it be that

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,760
someone leaked

60
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,320
the design?

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,730
That's impossible.

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,160
To ensure absolute confidentiality,

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,120
the designers worked under my direct supervision

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,840
in my office

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
to create the designs.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,880
In other words,

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,520
this design blueprint

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,080
has only been seen by me

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,520
and my designer.

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,240
Before the design was leaked,

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,360
did you notice anything unusual?

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,280
There is something a bit strange about it.

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
I think it's already perfect.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
No.

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,159
I feel it's still not finished.

76
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,920
Wang,

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,400
with your pursuit of excellence

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
and your talent,

79
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
you'll definitely

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
achieve great things in the future.

81
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,400
Thank you for your praise, Manager Lin.

82
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,770
I'll go wash my face.

83
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
I wasn't wrong about him.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
He's truly an artist,

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
so talented.

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh my!

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,640
My fault.

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,720
But what puzzles me is

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,720
when I got

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,280
this design drawing again.

91
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
This is really strange.

92
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,680
Could you have washed it off last time?

93
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,500
This type of design paper,

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
for more natural coloring,

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,920
no matter what color stains it,

96
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
will always leave a mark.

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,320
Then,

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
could someone have replaced it?

99
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,680
Such an exquisite design -

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
going to all that trouble to draw another one

101
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
makes no sense at all.

102
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm certain this is the same one as before.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,200
But the coffee stain

104
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
has disappeared.

105
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,159
So do you have

106
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,760
any suspects in mind?

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,080
These are the main suspects among my company employees.

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,280
This matter could be serious or trivial.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,080
But I don't want to cause any damage to the company.

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,760
So I'm counting on you.

111
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Goodbye.

112
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
Take care.

113
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,840
Alright.

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,980
Let's call it a day.

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,920
We've had too much information today.

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Tomorrow,

117
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,800
we'll use this girl again

118
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
to travel back in time.
