1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
Why is Xiao Li here too?

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,240
These two seem so close.

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,200
Good colleagues.

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,040
But

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,920
we can't hear what they're saying.

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
What should we do?

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,600
I have an idea.

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,520
Boss,

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,860
three cotton candies.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Sure!

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,810
Help yourself here.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
I think that restaurant has a very romantic atmosphere.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,320
You'll definitely like it.

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,240
Really?

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,440
By the way.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,120
My jewelry designer certification

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,240
I finally got it.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,120
Really?

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,780
Congratulations!

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,520
But...

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,330
I'm planning to quit my job.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,200
I want to work at a different jewelry company.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
What's wrong?

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,680
Is it that Mr. Wu

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,880
harassing you again?

26
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,320
Li.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,180
About your situation,

29
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,800
I couldn't help you.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
But if

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Manager Lin finds out about our relationship,

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,440
then all my previous efforts

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,120
would be wasted.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Li.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,200
Can you

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
bear with it a little longer?

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,600
It's okay.

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,560
For you,

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
I'd do anything.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,520
The police station just called.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Wu Liangxin

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,200
confessed everything.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,440
Really?

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,040
But Wu Liangxin

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,480
denies that he

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,210
leaked the Summer Night Star design blueprints.

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
The police

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,600
don't have enough evidence

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
to prove he's the leaker.

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,440
Insufficient evidence.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Maybe Wu Liangxin

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
really isn't the leaker.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,120
Could it be

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,640
Li after all?

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,940
Seeing that designer is such a coward

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,120
makes me angry.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Why don't

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,440
we just go talk to Li

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
and get to the bottom of this?

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,800
How did you find this place?

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Please come in.

63
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Please have a seat.

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,440
I'll get you some water.

65
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
No need.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
We came today

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,200
to talk about your boyfriend.

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm still here.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,040
Is Wang Mai, the chief designer at Starlight Jewelry,

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
your boyfriend?

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,800
Since

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,840
you already know everything,

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
why are you still asking me?

75
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,640
Xiao Li.

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,079
Were those design drawings

77
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,880
leaked by you?

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
So you're still suspecting me.

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
I did see the drawings,

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,480
but I didn't leak the designs.

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Has Wang Mai ever suspected you?

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,120
If Wang Mai suspected me,

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
I guess

84
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,440
he would want to kill me.

85
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,320
After all,

86
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,040
those designs are much more important than I am.

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
Men are all the same.

88
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,600
I extracted samples from the design drawings

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,530
and found a short-acting fluorescent agent on them.

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,810
Fluorescent agent.

91
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,880
Yes.

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,440
But the effect is very brief,

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,800
lasting only a few minutes.

94
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Could it be an intentional design feature?

95
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,040
Based on the composition, the materials are easily available.

96
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,320
When the two ingredients come into contact, they create a flash effect.

97
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,200
But they're not typically used in drawings,

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,730
since there's no point once the short-term effect evaporates.

99
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
Thank you, Lin.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,440
What about me?

101
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Meili,

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,080
you don't understand anything.

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,159
You just like to join in the excitement.

104
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,890
It's all about participation!

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,600
Alright.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
That's it for today.

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,130
Everyone get some rest.

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,280
Bye-bye.

109
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
Bye-bye.

110
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Have some water.

111
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,640
You must be thirsty after talking so much.

112
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
Thank you, honey.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
You really are a career woman.

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,680
Your career is more important than your husband.

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,000
How could that be?

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,660
No matter how important work is, people always come first.

117
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
No work is more important than people.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,040
No design draft, no matter how important,

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
is more important than my loved one.

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
Mr. Lin, you wanted to see me?

121
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,320
Wang Mai,

122
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,680
there are some matters

123
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,440
I need to ask you about.

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
You

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,460
don't have to answer if you don't want to.

126
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,840
It's fine.

127
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,100
Ask whatever you want.

128
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Wang Mai,

129
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,800
was it really you

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,480
who leaked the design drawings?

131
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh my!

132
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,240
Sis, you're so blunt.

133
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,200
Not even a bit of lead-in.

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
My work is more important than my life.

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,580
Why would I leak it to anyone else?

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Is something wrong with your brain?

137
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,440
You value your work

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
more than your own life.

139
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,800
But...

140
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,000
There's something more important than your work.

141
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,240
What is it?

142
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,800
It's Xiao Li.

143
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,120
Xiao Li means more to you

144
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,000
than your paintings.

145
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,920
Am I

146
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,400
wrong about that?
