1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,970
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
Nothing.

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
Xiao Li, you've got quite an eye.

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,440
I haven't even seen these design drawings.

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,720
But you have.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,879
Tell me about it.

7
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,600
How is it?

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,040
Manager Wu.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
Well...

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
I...

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,660
What's with all this stammering?

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I...

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,800
I just want to be friends with you.

14
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,640
I...

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,200
prefer to help my friends.

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,520
Keep secrets.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
After that.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
He became more and more outrageous.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,600
He harassed me relentlessly at the company.

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,039
Until you all showed up.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,400
I couldn't take it anymore and decided to quit.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,320
But he still wouldn't leave me alone.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,640
He called and threatened me.

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,780
He said I had stolen glances at the design plans.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,930
He accused me of being a corporate spy.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,850
You could have refuted him.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
And you're innocent.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,919
How exactly did he threaten you?

29
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,759
Enough.

30
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,480
The situation is clear now.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,120
Get Wu Liangxin in here.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,720
Boss.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,440
Boss.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,930
You wanted to see me?

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Boss.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,120
I was wrong.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,600
I betrayed your trust.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,100
Could you give me another chance?

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Is kneeling going to help?

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
Wu.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,640
Save it for the police.

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,160
See?

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,040
My intuition was right.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,640
I told you all along.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,840
That Wu guy

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,240
is no good.

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
But

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,840
he hasn't admitted

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
that he stole the Summer Night Star.

50
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,040
Boss,

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,680
don't be so stubborn.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,320
If he won't confess, let's hand him over to the police.

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,180
The police will make him confess.

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Yes.

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,640
Who would confess everything right from the start?

56
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,040
Confess.

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600
Exactly.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,079
Who would tell the whole truth immediately?

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,360
Does Xiao Li have anything else to confess?

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
For example?

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,040
Oh no!

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm going to be late again.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,720
You should go back to prepare medicine for your mother-in-law.

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
How did you know?

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
The schedule your mother-in-law set for you.

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
We've all become conditioned to it.

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,040
You'd better hurry back.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
I'll head back now.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,640
Go ahead.

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Bye.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's go.

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,920
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Let's go then.

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Your fire is way too high.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
You've ruined the medicine.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
How many times have I told you

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,240
to use low heat?

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,940
Are you doing this on purpose?

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
I should

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,800
remember what Mom says.

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,920
Come on, boss.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,570
The case is closed. Why are you still unhappy?

84
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
I just feel

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,920
this case was closed too hastily.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
You're overthinking it.

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,240
It's actually quite simple.

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,520
The face reveals the heart.

89
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,400
Look at these

90
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,240
employee photos from Starlight Jewelry.

91
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,800
This guy Wu

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
has a shifty face.

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,640
Wang Mai.

94
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,180
That's the designer who attempted suicide.

95
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
I heard he's obsessive

96
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
and a perfectionist.

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,280
No.

98
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,680
The suspect

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,040
is someone else.

100
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,120
Lin, what are you looking at here?

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
A chemistry research forum.

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,530
I wanted to look up chemicals that can remove coffee stains.

103
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,120
The pure substances in coffee can be neutralized,

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
but the pigments cannot.

105
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,840
So

106
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,370
it just doesn't make sense.

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,250
I didn't understand a word of that.

108
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,680
If the pigment cannot be removed,

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
there's only one possibility.

110
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,880
That design blueprint

111
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,530
was actually switched.

112
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,600
Someone who can duplicate

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,120
an identical blueprint

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,840
must be a real expert.

115
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,400
Could it be...

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,480
That's right.

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,320
No.

118
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,240
What are you two talking about?

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,240
I don't understand a thing.

120
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,560
If you don't understand, I'll show you.

121
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
Let's take a walk around.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,080
Why are we here?

123
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,800
You don't get it, do you?

124
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,240
It's a perfect spot for dating.

125
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
Found it.

126
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Why is Xiao Li here too?

127
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,760
Memorial Arch
