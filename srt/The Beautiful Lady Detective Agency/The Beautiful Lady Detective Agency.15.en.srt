1
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,200
Li, what brings you here?

2
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,840
Any news about your father?

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
I should be asking you that, Mr. Hai.

4
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,440
What do you mean by that?

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,600
Ms. Li's father's disappearance

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,860
has something to do with you, doesn't it?

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Don't make false accusations!

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,400
We checked the surveillance footage from the past 20 days

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,800
and found that you visited Old Li's room

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
much more frequently than before.

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,120
China Security

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,039
I was just bringing him meals.

13
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,440
What does that prove?

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,680
Unfortunately,

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,120
we also investigated the past 20 days

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,180
of electricity usage in Old Li's room

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
which was significantly higher than before.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,640
China Security

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
You were using high-powered appliances

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,800
in his room, weren't you?

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Such as

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,840
your welding machine and cutting tools.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,560
Could it be that China Security

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,440
you did something to Old Li?

25
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,360
Ms. Li,

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,440
my condolences.

27
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,200
Stop talking nonsense!

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,440
I didn't kill him.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,800
He's still alive.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,600
How do you know he's still alive?

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
Because...

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,320
China Security

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm too old now,

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,700
and you've still managed to outsmart me.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,200
So where is my father?

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
He's in a very safe place,

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,080
don't worry.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,640
But why did you take him away?

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,440
We hit it off right away.

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,699
How could I possibly have kidnapped him?

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,039
To be precise,

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,320
he asked me to take him away.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Asked?

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
Just eat this.

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
This is good,

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
healthy,

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,520
helps lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Your daughter didn't put money on your meal card?

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,400
It's not easy for kids out there.

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,840
But it's okay,

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,240
once a week

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,770
I can have instant noodles.

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,440
I can't finish this anyway,

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
let's share it.

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,320
This is delicious.

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,200
Thank you.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,900
If you like it, have some more.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
Since then,

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,120
I would bring him food from time to time.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,800
Every day,

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,000
we would have deep conversations over tea and meals,

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,460
and it was quite pleasant.

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,280
Until one day,

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,840
Brother Hai.

65
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,000
You're here.

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,760
Why so many instant noodles?

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,000
Why so many instant noodles?

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,680
I've been saving them up for three months.

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,480
What are you trying to say with this?

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,560
Thank you

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
for taking care of me this past year.

72
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm leaving.

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,280
If you want to sneak out,

74
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
you'll have to go through me.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,120
My wife and I made a promise,

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,320
which I haven't fulfilled yet.

77
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,050
I need to keep that promise now.

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
You can't leave through here.

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
If you leave through here,

80
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,480
I'll lose my job.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Unless your daughter comes to pick you up.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,240
I know

83
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,000
my daughter is so busy

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,920
she can't possibly take me out.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Darling.

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,960
It seems

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,400
we'll never see each other again in this lifetime.

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Wait.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,000
Based on what I know about nursing homes.

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
I might have a solution.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,760
I've made an escape plan for old man Li.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm about to be abducted by aliens.

93
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm about to be abducted by aliens.

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm about to be abducted by aliens.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
Really?

96
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
Mr. Hai.

97
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,370
Am I really going to be abducted by aliens?

98
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,000
You're confused again.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,460
What you're doing now is just a distraction.

100
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
What happens next?

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,920
Then you'll go back to your ward.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,240
Wait for me there.

103
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,280
Take these wooden sticks inside first.

104
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,800
I'll show you my craftsmanship from when I was young.

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,080
But old Li's condition is getting worse.

106
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Whether he can escape

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,159
is really hard to say.

108
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,040
It's been three months and you've only just remembered to visit me.

109
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,680
Fine.

110
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,920
If you want to see me, just come quickly.

111
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,240
I need to rest.

112
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,540
But the opportunity has finally come

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
while he's conscious.

114
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
My daughter is coming to see me.

115
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
I think

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
we should start executing the plan now.

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Dad, stop joking around.

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
Aliens are coming to take me home.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,320
Aliens are coming to take me home.

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,240
Let me get you some water.

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,970
Dad, have some water first.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,520
Dad, where did you go?

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,880
Did you find him?

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,280
No. Let's split up to search.

126
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,600
You go that way.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
Change your clothes and leave first.

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll clean up here.

129
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,200
This process

130
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,940
whenever he has an episode

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
would never succeed.

132
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,640
But he still managed to escape while lucid.

133
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,680
It shows his determination.

134
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,640
I'm getting senile too.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,330
I don't know if what I'm doing is right.

136
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,200
But nobody was helping him.

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,200
I just wanted to help him.

138
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
In this nursing home,

139
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,000
he is my

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,720
only friend I can talk to.

141
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
I understand.

142
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
But it's okay.

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,560
At least

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,440
we know

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
the old man went to find your mother.

146
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,640
But

147
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,159
my mother passed away two years ago.

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
What?
