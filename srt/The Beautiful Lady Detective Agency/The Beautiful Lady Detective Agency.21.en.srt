1
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,800
Ma'am,

2
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,600
you don't need to entertain us.

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
Please get some rest.

4
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,690
Let's go sit in the living room.

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,260
Everyone, please have a seat inside.

6
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,650
Have some water.

7
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,520
Thank you.

8
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,039
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,240
I was at the hospital earlier

10
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,800
and got too emotional.

11
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,880
We completely understand.

12
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,479
After all, it's your own mother.

13
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,210
Anyone would react the same way in your position.

14
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,640
About this case...

15
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
Don't worry about that.

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,370
We will definitely investigate thoroughly.

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
We promise you

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,520
we will find your child.

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Thank you all.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
However, I have

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,720
some questions about the results

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,250
the doctor just presented.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Has the elderly lady

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,480
been suffering from insomnia

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
and anxiety recently?

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
I just found out about this myself.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,639
I think

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,600
it might be because

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,730
her child was taken away by the father.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,730
I still feel something is strange about this.

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
So the old man was cooking inside.

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
So much food.

33
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,840
Lin.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,370
How did you figure that out?

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,920
The rice is all burnt.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Although it's burnt,

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
judging from the volume of the burnt food,

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
there must have been quite a lot.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
You must have burnt food at home before.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
You caught me.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,880
The biggest problem now is

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,640
we still haven't figured out

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,440
the suspect's motive.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,600
So

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,920
we're running around like headless chickens.

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,200
The motive?

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
Exactly.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,660
First, we need to understand that

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
since Ms. Zhou and her ex-husband

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
didn't receive any ransom calls,

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,840
and

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,079
the kidnapper is familiar with the girl,

53
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,000
this indicates that

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,079
the suspect's motive

55
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,720
isn't about money.

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,920
That's right.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,000
If that's the case,

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
we need to consider a new motive.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
For example,

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,079
does this person

61
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,040
want the ex-husband to take the child away

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
or prevent him from taking the child?

63
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,400
In that case,

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,920
we can deduce there are two suspects.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,800
If someone wants the child taken away,

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,000
then it's the ex-husband's own scheme.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,240
If someone doesn't want the child taken away,

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,440
it could be the ex-husband's mistress.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
Wow, Meili!

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,920
How are you so smart?

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Don't underestimate me.

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,520
I'm an experienced detective too, okay?

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Then tell me,

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,080
how should we distinguish between these two suspects?

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,600
That's easy.

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
When the ex-husband is ready to go abroad,

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,370
won't we know everything then?

78
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,440
What?

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,920
Isn't my method

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,960
any good?

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
I really praised you for nothing.

82
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,560
By that time,

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,720
our chances are only 50%.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,399
For all we know,

85
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,330
the child might already be abroad.

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
So

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,200
the first person we need to investigate

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
is still the ex-husband.

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
This is my ex-husband's assistant.

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,640
We're planning to go back in time.

91
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,680
They don't know us.

92
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
No need to be so sneaky.

93
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
We've been to their company before.

94
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
Better not alert them.

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
What are they doing here?

96
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,840
Look.

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
Two grown men shopping in the supermarket.

98
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
So weird.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,680
Have you noticed

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
where they're shopping?

101
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
The children's section.

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
So this must be

103
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,920
after they took the child.

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,850
Let's get closer

105
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,200
and see if we can find anything.

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Why do you think the boss asked us to buy so many things?

107
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,370
They'll expire easily.

108
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Just buy what you're told to buy.

109
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,700
Stop complaining.

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,840
If all these things are for his child,

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,600
could they be planning to flee?

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
What do you mean?

113
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,300
All these food, drinks, and supplies

114
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,440
are enough for his child to stay indoors for two weeks.

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
Let's go.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,880
Did you hear that?

117
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,540
They mentioned the child.

118
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,720
They bought supplies for the child that would last over two weeks.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,980
They must be hiding the child somewhere.

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,680
If that's the case,

121
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
I can confront him directly.

122
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,900
We've had a situation.

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Yes.

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm really sorry.

125
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
What?

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
Tomorrow's flight?

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Okay.

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
No problem.

129
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
That's strange.

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,480
That little vixen didn't come to work today.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Let's go.

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
Is the boss in today?

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,460
I'm sorry, our boss isn't here today.

134
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,520
Where did they go?

135
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,570
They probably went to the airport.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh no.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,640
They've run away.

138
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,400
Let's go.

139
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,360
Driver, to the airport.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,000
Hurry up!

141
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,000
Xiaohan

142
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,600
Let's go.

143
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,000
Security check.

144
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,440
It's too late.

145
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,480
We were so close.

146
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,800
I see there's another flight to Canada

147
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,280
in two hours.

148
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,600
Let's keep looking.

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,080
What if

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,340
they haven't left yet?

151
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
Let's split up.

152
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,919
Dameili!

153
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,440
Found her!
