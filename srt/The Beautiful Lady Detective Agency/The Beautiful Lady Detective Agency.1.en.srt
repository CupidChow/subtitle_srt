1
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Let the prime years return.

2
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720
Let one day have two dawns.

3
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
Let time be rewritten.

4
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,240
Let moments come again.

5
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,050
Let the prime years return.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,639
Let one day have two dawns.

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
Let time be rewritten.

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
Let moments come again.

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
Let the prime years return.

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
Let one day have two dawns.

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Let time be rewritten.

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Let moments come again.

13
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
Catch that female hooligan!

14
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't run!

15
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
How did we end up here?

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,520
I might have grabbed the wrong prop.

17
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,720
Emily, you've gotten us into trouble.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
That's right.

19
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,960
This is just another day at the Beauty Detective Agency.

20
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
My name is Chen Bingbing.

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
I'm 30 years old.

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,180
I'm a career-oriented woman.

23
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,460
Women should have their own careers.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,600
Not be constrained by family.

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,320
Although I have a considerate husband,

26
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
I still have to deal with

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,760
him constantly pressuring me to have a baby.

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
It's truly giving me a headache.

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
Her name is Emily,

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,040
my high school classmate.

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,920
During college,

32
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,040
she was a well-known judo athlete in the city.

33
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,760
With her excellent physical condition,

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,360
she easily won the city's women's judo championship.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,160
After getting married,

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,240
because she wasn't gentle enough,

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,560
she became estranged from her child.

38
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Dad.

39
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,760
I have a wish.

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,720
I wish my mother

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,079
was a gentle woman too.

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Son,

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,300
I've had that same wish

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,240
for over 10 years.

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
This is my other high school classmate, Lin Yuechu.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,440
She's delicate and dependent,

47
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,960
but a total academic genius.

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,720
She went straight to a top university

49
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,960
for her bachelor's and master's degrees.

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,920
But in her old-fashioned mother-in-law's eyes,

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,600
she's just a highly educated maid.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,840
The main ingredient in cleaning agents is surfactant.

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,800
Surfactants are molecules

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,680
that contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups,

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,120
forming organic compounds with these two parts.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
So...

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,279
So...

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,279
Not having detergent

59
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,610
is your excuse for not washing the dishes?

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,280
No.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,200
Clean them all

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
within 5 minutes.

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,200
Okay.

64
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,560
As detective enthusiasts,

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,000
we enjoy creating mystery stories together

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,860
with a touch of fantasy elements.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,290
Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
The clothes in that store we just passed.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,560
When I was young and wore things like that,

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,920
I had men falling at my feet.

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,890
Stone Fashion Kingdom.

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,840
This store has an interesting name.

73
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,300
Let's go in and take a look.

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
This store

75
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,720
sells quite a variety of things.

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,080
This hat is nice.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
My son would look really handsome wearing it.

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
Not for sale.

79
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,240
That's strange.

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,400
You open a shop but don't sell anything.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
What's the point of having a store?

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,760
These are all other people's memories.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,840
That's why they're not for sale.

84
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Memories.

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,760
If you want to travel

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
back to the past,

87
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,560
you can give me something.

88
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,040
I can

89
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,120
help you.

90
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,640
Boss,

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
let's go somewhere else.

92
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
I think this old man has dementia.

93
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,680
What if

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,360
we go back to when you were thin?

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,200
I don't think this old man has dementia at all.

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,560
He's hitting me right where it hurts.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,080
What's going on?

98
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
Oh my!

99
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,960
It actually has teleportation function!

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh my god!

101
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,120
Human physics will need to be rewritten.

102
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,920
Is this quantum teleportation?

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,960
Meili,

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
isn't that your husband?

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,640
Well, well,

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,640
cheating behind my back.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,960
Meili,

108
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
doesn't that girl look familiar?

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
Could she be our classmate?

110
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,880
Could it be my

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,080
long-lost twin sister?

112
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,280
No,

113
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,240
this is you seven years ago,

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,700
before you gained weight.

115
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
We've really traveled through time.

116
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,760
That's amazing.

117
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,440
Let's go

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,700
and take a closer look.

119
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,440
No,

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,010
don't go over there.

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,040
I just want

122
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
to watch from a distance

123
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,760
looking at myself from seven years ago.

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,690
I was really beautiful.

125
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,000
Meili,

126
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,920
so

127
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,880
your husband used to love you so much.

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,920
So

129
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,040
you used to be so sweet and gentle.

130
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,920
What do you think?

131
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm not exaggerating here.

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,800
This is Old Master Cang Mo.

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,720
He accidentally acquired this pocket watch when he was an antique dealer.

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,760
Since then, he's been using this watch for time travel.

135
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,020
Helping others solve mysterious cases.

136
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,080
Now he's getting old.

137
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,200
About to retire.

138
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,520
We've decided to continue the old master's work.

139
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,890
Starting our second business venture as three sisters.

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
And that's how the Beauty Detective Agency was born.

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,280
Sisters.

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you still want to continue being housewives?

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm tired of my husband and son calling me

144
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,240
a shrew.

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't want to be treated like a servant by my mother-in-law anymore.

146
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
I'm also tired of my husband pressuring me

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,160
to get pregnant every day.

148
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
From today on,

149
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,120
we'll have our own business.

150
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,740
Yes!

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't worry about making money yet.

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
The important thing is to take action first.
