1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,840
She drives a Mercedes.

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,130
Is the caregiver industry so profitable now?

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,260
I'm even tempted to try it myself.

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,640
You never know.

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,200
Maybe she's from a wealthy family.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,720
Would a rich kid do this kind of job?

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Exactly.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,720
There must be something fishy going on.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,800
Let's head back to the office.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,040
And get ready to go back.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,800
Let's go.

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Due to time constraints,

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,680
we'll split up this time.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Meili.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,120
You go ask other patients

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,240
about the old man's caretaker's daily routine.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,720
I'll check the visitor records

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
to see if anyone besides Mrs. Li

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,320
has visited the old man.

20
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,880
Lin,

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,320
you go visit the old man

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,920
and see

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,680
if you can get any other useful information out of him.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,800
What should I say?

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,440
Who am I?

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,360
Just say

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,000
you're Mrs. Li's classmate.

28
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,440
The old man is confused now.

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,960
Maybe

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
he might even mistake you for his daughter.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,560
I hate old people the most.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Hello.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,240
I am.

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,600
It's you.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,759
You know me?

36
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,600
You're my wife!

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
What the hell?

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,840
Honey,

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,120
why did it take you so long to visit me?

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,440
What are you doing?

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,840
Acting like a pervert at your age.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,560
Let go!

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
Just eat your food properly.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
Honey,

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,560
you haven't visited me for so long.

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,400
I've missed you.

47
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,800
Why are you eating this?

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,840
It has no nutritional value.

49
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,400
This is actually the good stuff.

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,650
They only let us have it once a week.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Old Li.

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,880
Look what delicious food I brought for you.

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
You are

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,360
This is my wife.

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
Isn't your wife already...

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,130
I'm his daughter's classmate.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,210
He must have made a mistake.

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,440
Delicious.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
Really delicious.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,079
Do I really look that old?

61
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,880
He called me his wife right away.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
Lin.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
I think

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
this issue.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,640
It must be because of your outfit.

66
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,340
Maybe that old man was just trying to take advantage of you.

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,079
Come on.

68
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,280
Let's review

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,810
the clues we've each found.

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,520
At least this old Mr. Li wasn't completely friendless.

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,600
He had another good friend who's also an old man.

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,120
I checked the visitor records.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,840
I found that this old Mr. Li

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,880
really didn't have many other visitors.

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,600
I looked into the caretakers.

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
Many people said he was two-faced.

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,440
When family members came to visit the elderly,

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,120
that caretaker would be much more gentle.

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
But when the family left,

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,840
the caretaker would treat

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,320
the elderly poorly.

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
So,

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
the old man's disappearance

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,440
might be closely connected to this caretaker.

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,080
My father seems to be in good spirits.

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you for your continuous care.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Not at all.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,000
I've been

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,060
taking care of him like my own family.

90
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm usually quite busy with work.

91
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,440
Finding such a dedicated caregiver like you

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,600
is truly fortunate.

93
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
I understand.

94
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,840
You just

95
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,400
focus on your work without worrying.

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,080
Your father

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,320
is in good hands with me.

98
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,240
Alright.

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,280
Dad, I'm leaving now.

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,240
Take care.

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,780
You've been sitting all morning.

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,480
Isn't it time to get up and exercise?

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,400
Just do as I say.

104
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,560
This way,

105
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,420
your health will keep improving.

106
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,360
Mrs. Li,

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
we're here today

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
to ask you

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,240
about your father at the nursing home.

110
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,720
Has he shown any unusual behavior?

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,200
Unusual?

112
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Besides getting more bad-tempered,

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,640
is that considered unusual?

114
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,600
For example, his daily habits.

115
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm not really sure about that.

116
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,580
We don't get to spend much time together.

117
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
Have some snacks.

118
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Sorry I can't offer more.

119
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,450
There is one unusual thing though.

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
Tell me about it.

121
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
I remember when my father was younger,

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,800
apart from his three meals a day,

123
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,520
he never ate any junk food.

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,300
But after he went to the nursing home,

125
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,970
I noticed he became a bit...

126
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Became what?

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,240
He became sweet-toothed like a child,

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,770
especially fond of snacks.

129
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
Sister Li, you're here!

130
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
This old man talks about you every day.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,440
Really?

132
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,200
Thank you for your hard work.

133
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
It's my duty.

134
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,080
Dad, I'm here to see you.

135
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,300
How have you been feeling lately?

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,440
This is the food I bought for you.

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
He is

138
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,970
It's like this, Mrs. Li.

139
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,520
Besides the old man's regular three meals,

140
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,200
I use some of the leftover money

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
to buy him some snacks.

142
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,120
I guess I've spoiled him,

143
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,200
and now he's developed a sweet tooth.

144
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
I see.

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
How come you've gotten old

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,280
but still act like a child?

147
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
So,

148
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,800
Old Mr. Li suddenly likes snacks,

149
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,600
there are two possible explanations.

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,450
Either he's being fed too well,

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
or

152
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,480
he's actually starving.

153
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Starving.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,240
I think so too.

155
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Also,

156
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
we need to confirm that

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,320
Old Mr. Li's personal caregiver

158
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,400
desperately needs this job.

159
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
From his work attitude,

160
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,200
we can tell

161
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,460
he's someone trying to take advantage of his position.

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,300
Yet he drives a car worth over a million yuan.

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
So where

164
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,100
did his money actually come from?

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
I have a thought.

166
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Go ahead.

167
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,920
Can we leave on time today?

168
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,200
My son has homework

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
that parents and children need to complete together.

170
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,160
Alright.

171
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,220
Let's all go home early today.

172
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,800
Tomorrow we'll go back in time

173
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,260
to verify our suspicions.

174
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm leaving.

175
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,880
Let's go.

176
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,370
I'll head home early today too.

177
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Qiu Min.
