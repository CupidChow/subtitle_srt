1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,400
That's right.

2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,560
It seems

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,200
I have to use my secret weapon now.

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,120
The beauty trap.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,720
I'll use my charm

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
after Wu Liangxin leaves.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Sister,

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,570
are you sure about this?

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,200
Don't worry.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,480
When we go back tomorrow,

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,940
I'll show you what I can do.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,640
Let's go.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
So,

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,000
isn't my makeup stunning today?

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,320
It's a bit too heavy, don't you think?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,260
You don't understand.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,200
This is the trendiest look right now.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,039
Beauty queen.

19
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,640
Are you sure this will work?

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
If you two hadn't insisted on starting a detective agency,

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,600
I would've been a beauty livestreamer by now.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,440
Relax.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm a professional.

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,759
Go.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,400
Are you alone, handsome?

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm sorry, ma'am.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Who are you calling ma'am?

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
Who are you calling ma'am?

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,520
Stop!

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
Don't hit him!

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
This four-eyes called me ma'am.

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Do I look like a middle-aged woman?

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Let me help you clean up.

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
No.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
Who are you people?

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,600
She's my friend.

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,660
She wanted to help me get your WeChat.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,840
You want my WeChat?

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
Let me take you to clean up.

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,640
Follow me.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,010
Okay.

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,200
Just leave your bag here.

45
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,930
My friend will watch it for you.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,680
Okay.

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
I can't believe this.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
How bad is his eyesight?

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,560
I rarely put on makeup,

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
and he called me 'ma'am'.

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,480
Just stop obsessing over your makeup skills,

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,400
will you?

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,120
With all your fussing,

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,800
the blueprints fell out.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
Hurry up.

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,600
Quick,

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,320
hurry up.

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,960
I need to go now.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,760
I'm really sorry.

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,820
Please have a seat.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Didn't you say you wanted to

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,980
add me on WeChat to get to know each other?

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,160
Look.

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,840
Maybe next time.

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,100
I'll add you next time.

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,400
Next time?

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Bye-bye.

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Adding on WeChat?

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,120
There has to be a next time?

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,560
So you're saying

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,080
that Wu Liangxin sold all these to Ruiya Jewelry?

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
That's right.

73
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,880
These are all evidence.

74
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
I can't believe it.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
Surprising, isn't it?

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,079
I never liked that Wu guy.

77
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,680
I can't believe

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
he would sell these rejected drafts.

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,480
What?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Rejected drafts.

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,520
There are no design drafts for Summer Night Star in here

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,080
and besides...

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I understand now.

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,760
Sorry, everyone.

86
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,240
Thank you for your hard work.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
The company just called

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,600
saying the suspect has confessed.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,560
This Wu Liangxin is quite sensible,

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
turning himself in was the right move.

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,980
It has nothing to do with Wu Liangxin.

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,320
The one who turned themselves in

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
is Xiao Li.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
What?

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Mr. Lin.

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,920
The person involved has already turned herself in.

97
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,640
Why did you come all this way

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,120
to see us?

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
Because we don't believe

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,780
Xiao Li is a corporate spy who stole the designs.

101
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,120
The designs

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
were indeed leaked by me.

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,080
That's why I got the opportunity

104
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
to work as a jewelry appraiser at Ruiya.

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
You became a jewelry appraiser

106
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,540
because you earned your certification.

107
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,080
How did you know that?

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,600
You don't need to worry about that.

109
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,130
But we believe you're not that kind of person.

110
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,800
Thank you for your trust.

111
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,320
But the designs

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,680
were truly leaked by me.

113
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
I think

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,000
you have your reasons, don't you?

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,860
Although we've only met briefly,

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
during these few meetings,

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,640
I can see that

118
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,600
you're a hardworking, studious person

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
who has made her own way in life.

120
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,280
I don't believe

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,200
you're someone who would trade company secrets for opportunities.

122
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,600
Xiao Li,

123
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,020
someone forced you to do this, right?

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
This is so beautiful!
