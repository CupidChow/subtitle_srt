1
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,920
Honey,

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,240
you're home early today.

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
It wasn't busy today,

4
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,920
so I thought I'd come home early.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,300
You're home quite late today.

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
Have you been

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,240
coming home this late recently?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,960
No,

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,340
I've just been quite busy lately.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
Okay.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm going to rest in the bedroom.

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,560
Let's go.

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,440
Why is he cleaning by himself?

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Don't the caregivers come to clean?

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,600
It's already lunchtime.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,500
And no caregiver brings him food.

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
He's making

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
instant noodles.

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,200
I saw him making noodles

21
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,320
and got a bit hungry.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,920
How pathetic.

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Just eating it like that.

24
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,320
This is too much.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,440
No wonder when I saw the old man last time,

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240
he was eating instant noodles

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,240
and said it was a delicacy he could only have once a week.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,440
So in his daily meals,

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,240
instant noodles are actually the best food he gets.

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,079
And even this is irregular.

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,000
Who are you people anyway?

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,410
We're...

33
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
Whoever you are,

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
if any of you know his daughter,

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,320
tell her

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
to send the old man more money.

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,600
Her own father is nearly starving.

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,680
Mr. Li.

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,240
Look what supplies I brought you.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,760
Smells so good.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,940
Really delicious.

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm telling you,

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
are you crazy or something?

44
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
Is this your car?

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Of course it is.

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
I should have hit you last time

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
to teach you a lesson.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
I don't think

49
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
this is your car.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,040
Not my car?

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
If it's not mine, is it yours then?

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Perhaps

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,440
you bought it with shady money from the nursing home.

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,040
I bet

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,120
it was paid for by some

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,520
elderly residents who pooled their money.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,720
How did you know?

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
You should ask

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,600
what else we know.

60
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,840
No, please.

61
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,240
Have mercy, please.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
Now you know to call me grandaunt.

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
What took you so long?

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,920
You.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Whatever you want,

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,680
I'll give it to you.

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:32,960
Money.

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,920
I'll give you all my money.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,520
Just let me go.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,640
Just tell me the truth.

71
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,680
How did you get so rich?

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,880
I'll talk.

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,480
I'll confess. I'll confess.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
Our nursing home

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,770
operates on a responsibility system.

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
One caregiver

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
has to take care of ten elderly people.

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
But these elderly people don't get along well with the children,

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
they don't even communicate.

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,720
You've been working hard too.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,480
It's nothing.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,400
I treat them as if they were my own parents.

83
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,530
It's not hard at all.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,200
By the way,

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
I'd like to discuss something with you.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,260
Just a moment, please.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Take it easy.

88
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,810
Please go ahead.

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,460
Take this card.

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
It's for our elderly family members' expenses.

91
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,010
I'll transfer money to this card every month.

92
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Brother.

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,920
This won't work.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,640
It violates staff regulations.

95
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,960
If neither of us talks about it,

96
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,680
nobody will know.

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,610
If I pay directly to your hospital,

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I'd be wasting 10% on administrative fees.

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Why should I?

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,659
I see you as my own little brother.

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,040
Do your brother this favor.

102
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
Take it.

103
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,960
That's it.

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,840
The ten family members I was responsible for

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,200
all started sending me money privately.

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,280
The money passing through my hands

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,340
grew more and more.

108
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,240
If I can save this money

109
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
somehow

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,040
it's like earning extra.

111
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,200
But

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
to save it

113
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,640
I can only cut corners on the elderly.

114
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,570
Dinner's ready.

115
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
No yogurt today.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
Too much yogurt

117
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,120
puts strain on your digestive system

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
and causes diarrhea.

119
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Fine.

120
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
Gradually...

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,260
I found that when I lowered their living standards,

122
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,720
they didn't object.

123
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,040
As long as I boiled the frog slowly.

124
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
Later on,

125
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,520
I became increasingly greedy.

126
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
I was wrong.

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,120
Please forgive me.

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,160
Don't tell anyone.

129
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
Please keep it quiet.

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,000
Forgive you? No way in hell!

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
The families worked so hard to earn money,

132
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,840
gave it all to the elderly,

133
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
and you had the nerve

134
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,840
to skim off layer after layer

135
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,040
and line your own pockets.

136
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,600
You even caused misunderstandings between the elderly and their children.

137
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
Don't hit me!

138
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
I hope

139
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,280
you'll turn yourself in at the police station.

140
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,040
You should know

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,640
that surrendering yourself

142
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,960
will result in a lighter sentence than being reported.

143
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,280
I...

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
You have no choice.

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
Greed comes with a price.

146
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,080
One last question.

147
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Old Li,

148
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,400
where is he?

149
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know.

150
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,159
Are you going to talk?

151
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,040
Stop hitting me!

152
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
I really don't know!

153
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,600
I make money from them.

154
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
Why would I hide him?

155
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm truly innocent!

156
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,900
On the day old Mr. Li disappeared,

157
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,640
was there anything unusual?

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,680
I remember

159
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,480
before Mr. Li went missing,

160
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,240
Mr. Hai from our courtyard

161
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,000
would often go into his room.

162
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,920
But one time,

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
I was really scared.
