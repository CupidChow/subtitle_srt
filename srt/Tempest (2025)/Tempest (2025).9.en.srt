How long have you been Stella Young?

[chuckles]

61
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,487
Since 1983.

62
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,742
My family was exiled to the US
because of my husband's bribery scandal.

63
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,953
[person] A few days ago,
I was at some charity art auction,

64
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,206
sticking my hand in the air
to win this beautiful piece,

65
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,044
but lost out.
So I turned around to see who'd won

66
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,379
and was blinded by a knockout.

67
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,506
Then three days later…

68
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,344
Would you believe it?
That painting showed up at our front door.

69
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,681
And to think we'd meet again this way,
and me without my sunglasses…

70
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,933
[Okseon] That's when
I discovered my hidden talents,

71
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,354
talents for socializing, secrecy,
and conspiracy.

72
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,732
As the wife of a corrupt politician,

73
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,569
I was exactly the kind of contractor
the CIA needed.

74
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,824
Someone to report on Korean politicians
and collect dirt on them.

75
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,286
We need to drive him out slowly
without him even realizing it.

76
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,874
While supporting pro-American politicians,

77
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,753
our company thrived with US backing.

78
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,052
Then we started helping
American defense contractors

79
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,846

to the South Korean government,

80
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,848

and surface-to-air missiles they can sell.

84
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,236
But I thought about how many hearts
the bullets I sold would pierce,

85
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,572
how many tanks
the rocket launchers would destroy,

86

and how many fighter jets
the missiles would take down.

87
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,913
From then on, submarines became my dream.

could launch ballistic missiles

You're plotting something, aren't you?

181
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,955
But you won't live to speak with
the president ever again. You understand?

182
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,249
I will make sure of it.

183
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,503
And your grandmother?

184
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,882
She died two days ago,

186
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,220

187
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:33,015
I told you to lose that woman
and leave with your grandmother.

188
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,643
You brought this on yourself, you bastard!

190
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:55,121
I built my reputation by quietly handling
problems for troubled countries.

191
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,082
Becoming the world's top arms dealer
wasn't simple,

192
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,252
even so,
I could always keep shipments moving,

193
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,922
and I had good relationships
with dictators.

194
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,593
Then one day, it hit me.

195

[journalist speaking on television]

196
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,306
[Okseon] I had the power
given by the United States

197
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,017
and the privilege
of accessing North Korea.

198

199
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,854
[Okseon] The most secretive land on earth

200

where high-quality weapons could be
produced at any time.

[♪ ominous music playing]

202
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,449
I built factories there,
developed technology,

203
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,659
and sold weapons to sanctioned countries,

204
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,995
all under complete secrecy.

205
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,709
Because my power came from the fact
that no one knew who I really was.

206
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,838
However, I know
this business won't last forever.

207
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:51,719
That's why I had to create the weapon
of my dreams while I still could.

208
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:57,141
Nuclear weapons are actually
a blessing for small countries.

Mutually assured destruction.

210
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:05,608
If I have a weapon that can
annihilate my opponent even if I die,

211
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,235
in the final judgment,

212
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:13,950
that puts me on equal footing
as our biggest and strongest enemy.

213
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,912
The great powers always think
they're the only ones

for nuclear weapons.

what if you had a nuclear submarine,
Your Majesty?

217
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,388
Idisha would be unbeatable in any war.

Before the submarine is yours,

Oh, I'm all ears.

I beg your pardon?

It's what Proust would've said,
Mr. Hughes.

Please slow down a bit. Otherwise,
we'll miss the most important things.

00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,745
But, Munju,

Mmm.

251
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,674
They believe that the most important thing
is the one true sentence.

Didn't you know?

253
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,388
That is quite true. However, today,
in honor of Munju,

00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,890
I shall attempt a Proustian explanation.

I need to go to the restroom.

[Munju] China has
just persuaded North Korea.

259
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,867
They're asking us to get the US
to shift its position.

260
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,662
The US won't want
to be pressured three-against-one.

261
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,580
So tell him that
if they back off a little,

262
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,501
we can turn it around and
pressure North Korea three-against-one.

263
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,961
[Kyungsin] The plan succeeded.

264
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,590
And the next day, the four countries
agreed to issue a joint statement.

265
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,509
It was incredible…

266

So, did you bring me a message that
might change the course of the rivers?

But nothing anyone did changed our lives.

[Camila] Wait. Are you trying to tell me
this has to do with that submarine?

350
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,784
Okay. I'm sorry, Camila.
I know I'm putting you on the spot,

351
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,246
but you have to trust me
and freeze those accounts right now.

352
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,917
Anderson, you know I'm taking a big risk
just by talking to you on the phone.

I'm going to do my best.

358
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,772
Mr. President?

359
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,025
First, you claim that
this submarine doesn't exist,

360
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,904
and now, you're insisting that
it's heading out to the Pacific Ocean.

361
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,408
And tomorrow, it's going to have these
fair United States in its crosshairs.

362
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,952
Do I have that right?

363
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,038
Yes, sir.

364
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,458
Initially, I didn't believe
there was a submarine.

365
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,545
There just wasn't enough evidence.

366
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,176
But something didn't add up.

367
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,888
It was capability. They didn't have
the money or the materials.

368
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,599
So to make up for that, their strategy was
to show off the weapons

369
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,392
that they did have
in order to make us think

370
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,603
that they could use them at any time.

371
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,690
I mean, you expect me to believe that
North Korea built a nuclear submarine

372
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,484
but wanted to keep it a secret?

373
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,529
No. That doesn't track, sir.

374
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,116
But what if they got the money
and the materials

375
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,827
from somewhere else?

376
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,915
Mr. President, I can show you five years
of financial transactions

377
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,793

378
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,088
the submarine from North Korea.

What exactly is it you expect us to do?

382
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,269
Freeze the funds
from Idisha to North Korea.

383
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,896
Stop the transfer from happening.

You have the power

have all been frozen.

Junik was miserable
his whole life because of you.

What?

400
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,805
You were so opposed to our marriage
he considered cutting ties with you.

401
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,767
He wanted to understand
why you were acting that way.

402
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,812
And that was how he found out
he wasn't your biological son.

403
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,567
Junik? He knew about that?

404
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,654
And he knew about your childhood also.

[Hwarim] She was a poor kid.

406
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,577
She grew up all alone near
a US military base, like a stray dog.

407
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,498
When she was nine, her mother ran off
with an American soldier.

408
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,878
So she fed herself by babysitting
for busy mothers and doing their chores.

into the salt merchant's family
as his second wife,

411
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,936
I decided that I would marry her off

412
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,938
to the eldest son,

413
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,317

and went to university.

414
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,987
I wanted to have my own person
in the house.

how crazy she really was. [scoffs]

When you were nine years old, no one knew.

418
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,840
Ever since then,
you've been throwing stones at them.

419
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,141
The stones became bigger and bigger,

420
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,893
and now, they've become missiles.

422
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,026
I was born to the weakest woman
in a powerless, small country

423
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,863
that let other countries decide
its wars and fate.

424
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,866
And even that woman abandoned me.
Isn't it incredible?

That someone like me can now pay them
back for everything?

looking for your mother…

And how would I make that happen?

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,890
By quietly pressing a button.

444
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,606
Some people brag about
having the world's strongest military,

445
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,651
about their territories, their resources,
and their weapons.

But I'm going to press the button.

00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,284
No one will know.

448
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,788
And I'll be greater
than the President of the United States.

449
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,791
And why not?

450
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,587
America has no problem starting wars

451
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,298
that could kill millions of lives
in other nations

452
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,385
just to protect itself
from a potential threat.

453

You wasted your breath running around
trying to stop this war.

454
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:17,769
But it'll be me in the end
who truly brings peace.

455
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,316
Because when I press the button,

456
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,988
everyone in the world will forget about
some war on the Korean Peninsula.

457
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,865

And for the next thousand years,

867
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:29,694
Um…

868
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,322
I wanted to be the first to tell you

869
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,242
that the president is considering
giving the medal of honor to Paik Sanho.

870
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,077
That's right.

871
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,413
He was an American.

872
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,957
You know,

873
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,169
part of me believes

874
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,922
he's still alive somewhere.

875
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,758
I wish I could've met him.

876
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,511
The president will see you now.

877
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,651
Hey.

878
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,029
You're our only hope now.

879
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,033
I guess

880
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,661
we're in trouble then.

881
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,547
[journalist] "One of the greatest talks
I've had in years."

882
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,758
"A strong woman who brought peace
to the world."

883
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,261
Did you see the poll results
from this morning?

884
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,846
Candidate… I mean, Ambassador,

885
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,307
even though you were disqualified
as a candidate,

886
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,559
you're still polling first
for the New Republican Party

887
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:46,312
at all eight polling agencies.
First place! [laughs]

888
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,273
Calm down, Miji.

889
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,108
And remember. I'm not a candidate.

890
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,527
It's not just
within the New Republican Party.

891
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,238
Your approval rating
among all presidential candidates

892
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,532
has gone up significantly.

893
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,285
Presidential candidate registration
is open… [grunts]

894
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,703
…until next week.

895
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,081
You can always still run
as an independent.

896
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,293
Miji, Changhee, I can't do it.

897
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,003
When I was running before,

898
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:14,215
it was only because I wanted
to find out why my husband died,

899
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,593
not because I thought
I deserved to be president.

900
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,138
Still though, Miss Seo.

901
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,808
[sighs] If you ask me,

902
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:28,104
I don't believe that anyone
even comes close to being as qualified.

903
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,523
So just say the word, all right?

904
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,067
And I'll cancel my flight to the US.

905
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,945
You know, I've kept my schedule open
if you need anything.

906
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,782
Hey, listen.
Know when to stay in your own lane.

907
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,118
She's my ambassador.

908
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,619
She's my ambassador.

909
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,872
[all chuckle]

910
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,376
[phone buzzing]

911
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,383
Hello?

912
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,260
[Kyungsin] I'm leaving for Beijing.

913
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,056
Madam President.

914
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,641
I did a lot of thinking last night.

915
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,352
[♪ hopeful music playing]

916
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,645
About how crucial the next few days,

917
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,022
the next few months,

918
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,359
and the next few years will be
for the future of the Korean Peninsula.

919
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:18,196
And about how important
the subsequent leader's role will be

920
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,739
once my term ends.

921
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,077
I believe it should be you.

922
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,665
You know the strength it takes
to face the difficulties of our time.

923
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:35,546
I'm thinking of leaving the party
and finding a way to support you

924
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,131
when I get back from Beijing.

925
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,051
I don't think I can do it.

926
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:42,970
Why?

927
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,852
Because I'm still…

928
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,984
too heartbroken.

929
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,158
That's the type of president I want.

930
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,703
Someone who's suffered deeply,

931
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,040
but still has the strength
to push through it,

932
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,042
and becomes stronger from it.

933
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,795
Even though you were a candidate
from the opposing party,

934
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,215
if I endorse you,
it would send a message of unity.

935
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,678
A leader trying
to reunify the Korean Peninsula

936
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,055
should be capable of at least that much.

937
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,433
Think about it carefully.

938
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,894
-Not from your personal perspective…
-[sighs]

939
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,147
…but from a historical perspective.

940
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,112
[♪ melancholy music playing]

941
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:54,625
[Munju] I had a dream. I was this woman.

942
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,380
I didn't believe in God,

943
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,842
but there was a church in my heart.

944
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,554
A place built with pillars
made from my father's bones,

945
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,807
walls plastered with my mother's flesh,

946
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:13,686
floors washed clean
with my husband's blood,

947
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:19,275
and where I sent the soul
of my precious little child up to heaven.

948
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,612
Before I came here,

949
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,741
I buried my love in the black hills
and prayed.

950
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:32,663
Take my place,
and bestow it upon this land.

951
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,292
And when there is enough peace
for everyone,

952
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,586
enough that no one needs it anymore,

953
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:42,590
then please,
return to me my poor, lost love.

954
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:47,887
Even though I don't believe in God,
the forgiveness of sins,

955
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:52,892
the resurrection of the body,
or life everlasting,

956
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:57,021
I know he will live inside me forever.

957
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,319
[♪ melancholy music continues]

958
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,721
