But I was scared.

213
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
I wasn't sure I could live without you.

214
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,057
But thinking that I might die,
it became clear.

215

I should've set you free years ago.

00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,981
I will be telling everybody everything.

217
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,236
I'll be resigning from my posts
and withdrawing from the election.

218

Then I plan to tell the truth
about Mother.

249
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,327
my mother kept close ties with the wives
of over 30 former leaders.

00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:08,165

Forensic services sent the test results.

259
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,662
It was neostigmine bromide.

260
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,668
The exact toxin Sergeant Kim Yongjun
ingested after shooting Jang Junik.

261
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,760
[gasps] Is my daughter-in-law
responsible for his death as well?

262
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,018
The first person
who suspected Junik of spying

263
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,480
was Prosecutor Jang Junsang,
working for the NIS.

264
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,191
He was going through call records
for a Chinese front

265
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,610
that turned out
to be a North Korean spy network.

266
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,033
And then he saw an outgoing call
made from inside his own house.

267
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,787
After that he discovered
the name of a company…

268
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,334
…one owned by Jang Junik.

269
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,670
They'd wired money to
a North Korean shell account in Macau.

He is rapidly solidifying his position
as the leading presidential contender.

while continuing to widen his lead
over the remaining candidates.

277
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,818
After a lot of thinking,
he came to me with it.

278

00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,198

282
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,631
"Why didn't he consider the possibility

283
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008

to North Korea was you, Ms. Lim.

Money flows from Idisha's benami
account to Shiv Holdings,

348
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,608
and from Shiv Holdings
to North Korea's benami account.

349
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,238
The cash flow suggests that
North Korea's selling something to them.

350
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,074
Is that cash flow related
to the submarine?

351
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,201
Okay. We're not sure.

352
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,413
What we do know is that
Idisha has been waging a war

353
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,208
against the United States
using North Korean weapons.

354
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,712
And Shiv Holdings is the broker.

355
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,257
We've got the slush fund ledger
from Aseom Shipping.

356
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,137
"BANK STATEMENT
FOR SELECTED PERIOD"

357
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,348
[Munju] Money came in
from the United States' enemies

358
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,768
and went to Apex Starlight Ltd.
through Aseom Shipping.

359
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,190
But according to my research
on Apex Starlight Ltd…

360
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,485
I found the CEO, Matthew Sinclair.

361
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,155
Coldrain's financial head.

362
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,117
Secretary of Defense Eagleton
served as an adviser for them.

363
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,537
And from now on you're barred
from this room. Presidential orders.

364
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,416
What?

365
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,710
Does that mean someone in the US

366
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,130
is exporting weapons
to America's enemy nations?

367
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,715
Stella Young is an arms dealer

368
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,551
who provides weapons from
the United States and North Korea

369
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,055
for the failed states and enemy countries
of the United States.

370
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,100
Eagleton is a fucking traitor.

371
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,603
This is it. This is the answer.

372
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,439
This is how North Korea
has been so well-armed

373
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,900
despite aggressive sanctions
for the past 20 years.

374
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,987
I was curious as well,
why war never stops in this world,

375
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,740
and who benefits from those wars.

376
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,742
Eagleton never refused a war.

377
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,497
While America's enemies fight
against America with American weapons,

378
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,833
any war benefits him.

379
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,588
Meanwhile Chairwoman Lim Okseon
has been behind the scenes,

380
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,300
boosting North Korea's
weapons manufacturing capabilities.

381
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,219
We could go public.

382
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,389
Let the people know that
the Secretary of Defense

383
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,266
has been inciting conflicts
around the world to sell arms.

384
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,936
I mean, imagine what would happen
if the people knew

385
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,481
that enemy states were using
American arms against American soldiers.

386
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,274
This would be worse than Watergate.

387
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,026
America's fucked!

388
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,947
I think I should meet the president.

389
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,158
If President Chae can deliver this news
to the US president,

390
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,494
he won't choose war.

391
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,538
[♪ sinister music playing]

392
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,376
[Kyungsin] I've ordered
a new investigation.

393
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,966
A re-examination of all the evidence
tying Seo Munju to the murder.

394
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,344
You have, ma'am?

395
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,309
I suspect that someone
has been orchestrating this whole thing.

396
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,026
Miji.

397
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,488
[sighs] Thank God. I'll be right there.

398
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,075
Ms. Seo, Miji's arrest warrant was denied.

399
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,327
She's being released soon.
I'll go get her.

400
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,329
-Okay. Be careful though.
-Yeah.

401
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,679
Mom is busy.

402
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,766
We're going far away,
and she has to pack and get ready.

403
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,727
What are you drawing?

404
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,939
[Eunseong] It's for that man
who was nice to me.

405
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,193
I think he kinda looks like a deer.

406
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,071
He does?

407
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,075
They can be really fierce.
Did you know that?

408
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,162
A male deer would even fight a lion

409
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,333
if it meant they would protect
a female deer or their baby.

We have to freeze that account, Anderson.

That must be the payment
for the submarine.

The submarine will be delivered
to Idisha soon.

521
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,096
[Munju] No payment, no deal.

522
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,849
Kim Hansang would never
hand over the submarine

523
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,935
if there is no payment in advance.

524
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,771
Can you find a way to freeze that account?

525
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,773
I-I-I don't know.

526
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,527
But I'm going to try.

527
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,112
I know how hard this is for you, Anderson.

528
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,781
I'm really sorry,

529
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,866
but now you are the only hope we have.

530
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,497
You know what I'd say back?

531
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,792
"I guess we're in trouble then."

532
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,462
Munju, I don't know
how many moves I've got left.

533
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,757
But I'm gonna use 'em all, okay?

534
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,676
I really appreciate it.

535
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,263
Hope to see you someday.

536
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,725
I'd love that.

537
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,015
[beeping]

538
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,950
[phone buzzes]

539
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,411
EVER PARK MOTEL

540
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,872
Munju.

541
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,165
Sanho, listen to me.

542
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,374
Carefully.

543
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,586
I'm on my way to see Lim Okseon.

544
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,298
-You're what?
-Mother's holding Miji hostage.

545
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,259
She said she'll kill her
if Eunseong isn't there in an hour.

546
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,304
Where are you? I'm on my way now.

547
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,390
[engine starts]

548
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,519
No, I need something else from you.

549
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,481
Once you grab Eunseong,
get to the president.

550
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,149
What did you say?

551
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,943
It looks like Idisha paid North Korea

552
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,819
for the submarine
through Aseom Shipping's account.

553
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,531
Once the submarine is delivered to Idisha,
we don't know what's gonna happen.

554
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,200
We need to let President Chae know

555
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,203
so she can get President Hauser
to act on the intel.

556
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,461
I'm going after Mother.
She'll be following his submarine.

557
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,509
-Munju, wait.
-This is our best shot, Sanho.

558
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,720
Someone has to stop Okseon,

559
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,931
and someone else
has to tell the president.

560
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,684
Just this once,

561
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:22,021
I want you to choose everyone
and not just one person.

562
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,148
You're the only one who can do this.

563
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,449
Some people I trust have been enlisted to
help me get the message to the president.

564
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,787
You'll be hearing from them
fairly soon, I think.

565
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,421
I'll make contact with President Chae.

566
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,800
Then I'm coming for you as fast as I can.

567
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,429
I've had plenty of missions
harder than this.

568
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,225
You'll look back and see me
before you know it.

569
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,353
I have this under control.

570
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,232
Keep yourself safe until then.

571
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,365
And I have this under control.
I know my mother-in-law.

572
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,911
She's not gonna kill me.

573
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,498
I'm not worried about what she'll do.

574
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,631
Make it fast.

575
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,300
I'll get there soon.

576
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,482
Where's Eunseong?

577
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,567
He's left Korea.

578
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,986
He isn't coming here.

579
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,450
Doctor, take her leg.

580
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,503
Eunseong's mother
dropped the paternity lawsuit.

581
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,046
She'll never return to Korea.

582
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,968
If you wanted Eunseong for the money,
there's nothing to worry about anymore.

583
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,513
"WAIVER OF INHERITANCE"

584
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,306
And if it wasn't about that?

585
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,975
Then cut off my leg.

586
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,395
Mother, I know what you want,
and it's not Eunseong or Miji.

587
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,649
Even if you take her leg,
how will you be satisfied?

588
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,317
It's me you're after.

589
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,528
And you can take whatever you want.

590
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,488
I have nothing.

591
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,490
I'm all alone here.

592
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,995
Miji's been released
for the lack of evidence, right?

593
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,082
It won't be easy to prove that I'm guilty.

594
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,211
However, I'd be willing to confess

595
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,340
to the murder of Jang Junik,
my own husband.

596
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:59,262
After that you and Junsang will
get access to what you're really after:

597
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,889
the money in Junik's secret accounts.

598
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,696
What do you say?

599
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,081
Doctor,

600
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,709
forget the amputation.

601
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,336
Start emergency surgery now.

602
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,882
[sighs]

603
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,051
[phone beeps]

604
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,346
Let's go.

605
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,604
[♪ tense music playing]

606
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,915
[♪ music intensifies]

607
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,244
[♪ music ends]

608
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,583
[♪ somber music playing]
