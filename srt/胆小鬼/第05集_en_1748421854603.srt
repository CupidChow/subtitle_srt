The End

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Uncle Huang just finished his homework.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Go to the university.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Mom, why are you here?

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,400
Mom, I miss you.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Let me see you.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,600
You even brought me so many delicious food.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Here's some more.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,800
So many?

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,200
They're all your favorite food.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,600
Uncle Huang.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Mom bought you a new dress.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Try it.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Do you like it?

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Yes.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
It's so delicious.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It looks so delicious.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,400
Thank you, mom.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,200
It's your birthday in a few days.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,600
Mom, what's wrong?

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
It's all my fault.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
I've been taking you to the school since I was little.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
You didn't leave even when you cried.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Uncle,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,600
if mom turns you to high school at a high school,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
would you like to go there?

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Why?

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
You can't skip a life.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But I just want to skip a life.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
I want to take her to the whole world like you.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Mom just doesn't want you to eat another bite.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
I've had a hard time.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not afraid of suffering.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,800
You don't understand.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
It's hard to live a life.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Mom.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
What's wrong with you today?

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
I don't understand what you're saying.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
Mom is going to go to the restaurant.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
The time this time is probably longer.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
You go out to save your family first.

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Mom.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
You're not going to look for my dad again, are you?

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
Actually, we don't need anyone else.

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
We can live well.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,200
Mom has a big thing to do this time.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
We can completely change the situation.

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
We can change the life.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
After this,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
I'll come back to pick you up.

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
By then,

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I'll make sure you have a good life.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800

What's wrong with you?

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I've seen that girl before.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Come in.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Sit here.

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I'll go to the restaurant.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Dad.

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Aren't you going to work today?

110
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm back to get something.

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
This is my classmate, Huang Shu.

112
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Hello, uncle.

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Hello.

114
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll take him home.

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay.

116
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm going to work.

117
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Bye.

118
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Bye.

119
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Bye.

120
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
What are you doing?

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm helping my mom to eat.

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Well, I remember

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
that you have a classmate.

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
His name is Huang, right?

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It's the one

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
who used to be in the art school.

127
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
His name is Huang.

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
What's his name?

129
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Huang Shu.

130
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Which book?

131
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
A girl's friend

132
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
and a pig's car.

133
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Do you remember his birthday?

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It was on 10th of December 1981.

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you still have a contact with him?

136
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
No.

137
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
He just got back from school.

138
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Dad,

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
why did you suddenly ask me to come here?

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
It's about work.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
It should be Chong Ming.

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It's okay.

143
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
I'll go in and eat if you're okay.

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Bye.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
What are you doing?

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Go and check.

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Huang Shu.

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Huang is the yellow one.

149
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Shu is a girl's friend and a pig's car.

150
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
His birthday is on 12th of December 1981.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Okay, I'll go and check.

152
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
If I were on the stage with you,

153
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
it wouldn't be possible.

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
They stole your leg.

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
They didn't even follow you.

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
You're so slow.

157
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Where are you going?

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm going home.

159
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Where else can you go?

160
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
You can lie to me.

161
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Go home.

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Don't go home today.

163
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Let's go out and play together.

164
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Your uncle didn't come to pick you up.

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
I lied to him.

166
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
He said he'd finish it by tonight.

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I don't want to go home.

168
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
My uncle keeps staring at me.

169
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Where do you want to go?

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I don't know.

171
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Huang Di,

172
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
where's your home?

173
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I've never been to your home.

174
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
My home is not convenient.

175
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
What's important is keeping a secret.

176
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Who's going to your home?

177
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Qingli, go to your home.

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I can do it.

179
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I beg you.

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I really don't want to go home.

181
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Okay, let's go.

182
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Great.

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Slow down.

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Qingli,

185
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
you can ride a bike?

186
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm here.

187
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Okay, you can.

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll ride your bike.

189
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Uncle Huang, you ride Qingli's bike.

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
He won't be a bad guy.

191
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Who said I can't?

192
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
You said I can, right?

193
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Qingli, I'm so bad.

194
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Be careful.

195
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It's okay.

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
We'll ride together.

197
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Hurry up.

198
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Okay?

199
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I'll help you.

200
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm done.

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm done.

202
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm done.

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Go.

204
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Don't catch me.

205
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Where should I go?

206
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Go to the dorm.

207
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
No.

208
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Huang Di, hurry up.

209
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
You're going in, right?

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Go to the dorm.

211
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Hurry up.

212
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Qingli, be careful.

213
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Be careful, Huang Di.

214
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
It's so scary.

215
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Hurry up.

216
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Be careful, Huang Di.

217
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Thank you, Huang Di.

218
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Grandpa, I'm back.

219
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
You want to change your shoes?

220
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Come in.

221
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
No need.

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Hurry up.

223
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
What's this?

224
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Grandpa, I...

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Grandpa, I'm fine.

226
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm fine.

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
I'll go, too.

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Hello, Grandpa.

229
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Hello, Grandpa.

230
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I can hear you.

231
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I can't speak.

232
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
They're all my classmates.

233
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Grandpa, I wish you good health.

234
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Have some water.

235
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Be careful.

236
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Don't stand here too long.

237
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Let's go.

238
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
This way.

239
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
This is the gift.

240
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
What's this?

241
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
This thing?

242
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Don't touch it.

243
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It's your stuff.

244
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
It's none of your business.

245
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Uncle Huang, look at this.

246
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
How come there's a ladder and a fish?

247
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I'll go take care of them.

248
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Qingli, are you still making up?

249
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
No, I'm just playing with toys.

250
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Let's play with the four of us.

251
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
What's funnier?

252
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
There's nothing fun in our house.

253
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Do you have a computer?

254
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
No.

255
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Where's the game console?

256
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
We can play in the house.

257
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
What's in the house?

258
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
There's a secret in the house.

259
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Feng Yuchiao, you can't stay here for a while.

260
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I'm going.

261
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
They're all my classmates.

262
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
This is my brother.

263
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Hello, brother.

264
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Brother.

265
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Let's go.

266
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Let's talk to the owner.

267
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Is it ready?

268
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes.

269
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Did you make it yourself?

270
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I did.

271
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
What's wrong with Qingli?

272
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
She's sick.

273
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
She's not sick?

274
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
But what?

275
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I don't see her having a headache.

276
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
She's always like this.

277
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
She's so pitiful.

278
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Why don't we go?

279
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Where?

280
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay, let's rest.

281
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Let's go.

282
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Qingli, let's go.

283
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What?

284
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's go.

285
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
I'll go with you.

286
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Let's go.

287
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Wait a minute.

288
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Take it.

289
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Where are you going?

290
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
To the roof.

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
What are you doing at the roof?

292
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Where?

293
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
To the roof.

294
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
What's in the roof?

295
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
You can go to my house.

296
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Come on.

297
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Okay, I'll be back soon.

298
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Your legs are full.

299
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
You're more active in the three floors.

300
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
This is the secret passage between me and Qingli.

301
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
It's too high.

302
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I can see how much your legs are.

303
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
You go in the middle.

304
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Huang Di will protect you.

305
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I'll protect you.

306
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Qingli, what are you talking about?

307
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I told you,

308
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
she has one silver.

309
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
I didn't say it.

310
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
But you know it.

311
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
It's the last thing I know.

312
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
It's the opposite.

313
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
You're not active.

314
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
You're still a lazy person.

315
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Huang Di, let's go.

316
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Wait a minute.

317
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Don't go so fast.

318
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Come on.

319
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Hurry up.

320
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Hurry up.

321
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Hold on.

322
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Hold on.

323
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Hurry up.

324
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Hurry up.

325
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Go.

326
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Hurry up.

327
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Hurry up.

328
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
You're so anxious.

329
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
This is my house.

330
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Let me see.

331
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Come in.

332
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
It's different from what you think.

333
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Mom.

334
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Aunt.

335
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
You're home.

336
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
The girl is here.

337
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Hi, aunt.

338
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
We didn't go to school today.

339
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
We went to the art meeting.

340
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
We went to the summer vacation.

341
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I didn't even have a backpack.

342
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
This is the first time I see a girl.

343
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
This is the first time I see a girl.

344
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
This is the first time I see a girl.

345
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Uncle Huang.

346
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Hi, aunt.

347
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
You're so pretty.

348
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
You look so pretty.

349
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
You look so pretty.

350
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Why are you wearing a gold crown?

351
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm wearing a gold crown.

352
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I haven't washed my face yet.

353
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I haven't washed my face yet.

354
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
You can sit down.

355
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Take a brush.

356
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
I'll help you.

357
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Okay.

358
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I'll help you.

359
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I'll do it.

360
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Which one is the gold crown?

361
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Give it to me.

362
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Here.

363
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
You don't want to drink it?

364
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
No.

365
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
What are you doing?

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I'm wearing a crown.

367
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Wenjing.

368
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Don't be so noisy.

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
I should have told you.

370
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Here.

371
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
He's still drooling.

372
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
You didn't see

373
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
the one with the face covered?

374
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Really?

375
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You're so lucky.

376
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You're so lucky.

377
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm wearing this.

378
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Are you okay?

379
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm fine.

380
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I'll go upstairs and talk to you.

381
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
No.

382
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Are you okay?

383
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Aunt.

384
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Let's help you wear it together.

385
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
It's not good.

386
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
I'll help you.

387
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
No.

388
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
You're here.

389
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
My aunt is so busy.

390
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
She can't let you work.

391
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
It's okay.

392
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I'm cooking at home.

393
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll wash my hands first.

394
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I'll wash my hands too.

395
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
There.

396
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The toilet?

397
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Yes.

398
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Let's go.

399
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Let's help her.

400
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Come on.

401
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Wang Di.

402
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Yes.

403
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I need to buy some vegetables for my mom.

404
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I'll cook some food for them.

405
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm so hungry.

406
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I'll help her with her work.

407
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Okay.

408
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Wang Di, put the rice on the door.

409
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Yes.

410
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Close the door.

411
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Got it, mom.

412
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Is the wire enough?

413
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
The steamer is ready.

414
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Let's go.

415
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
What are you doing?

416
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I have a secret for you.

417
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
What secret?

418
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Tell me.

419
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
I bought a phone.

420
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Really?

421
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Take it out and have a look.

422
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
I don't need to buy a show today.

423
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm afraid I'll lose my belt.

424
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Did you buy it for your uncle?

425
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I bought it myself.

426
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Why do you have so much money?

427
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm short.

428
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
I used to have some money

429
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
when I went to the show.

430
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
You can make money yourself.

431
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I want to buy one myself.

432
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
My uncle doesn't buy it for me.

433
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
My mom's phone

434
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
is because I used to call her

435
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
when I was at home.

436
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I always listen to her.

437
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
That's a good thing.

438
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
But I have a phone now.

439
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
You can call me anytime you want.

440
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Okay.

441
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
What do you want to talk about?

442
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
You can't finish school.

443
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
You can call me when you get home.

444
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
I can't finish school.

445
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
What's wrong?

446
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Look at my shirt.

447
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
How is it?

448
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Does it match?

449
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
How can I tell you?

450
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
One shirt is four pieces.

451
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
I know you like to wear it.

452
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
My dad has a belt.

453
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Then four pieces.

454
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
What's wrong?

455
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I told you to be careful.

456
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
It's too early.

457
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Is it painful?

458
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
It's okay.

459
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Okay.

460
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
You can take a rest.

461
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
No need to.

462
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
It's fun.

463
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Huang Di,

464
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I like to eat fried chicken.

465
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
But my uncle doesn't let me eat it.

466
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
It's dirty.

467
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Wang Yujia.

468
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
It's okay.

469
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I'll eat it.

470
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm sorry,

471
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I didn't mean that.

472
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
You asked me before.

473
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I didn't know the taste of the pork.

474
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Because my mom

475
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
always put the pork in the bag.

476
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I'm sorry to say that.

477
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I was afraid you would laugh at me.

478
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
What are you talking about?

479
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Wang Di.

480
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
You don't want to be my good friend.

481
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Wang Di.

482
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
If you don't want others to know,

483
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
we'll help you.

484
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
We're like a couple.

485
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes, we won't tell.

486
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I know my dad's situation

487
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
in the hospital.

488
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Our classmates know it very soon.

489
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
It doesn't matter.

490
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
It's unfair to be born.

491
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
It's not fair.

492
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
You're honest and righteous.

493
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
You're so talented.

494
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
You know how much people are compared to you.

495
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Yes.

496
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
You're so talented.

497
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You're good in physical education.

498
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
You're good in everything.

499
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
If I were you,

500
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I'd be on the way.

501
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Besides,

502
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
you have such a good parents.

503
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Yes.

504
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm not even jealous.

505
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Forget it.

506
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
You can't look down on people.

507
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Try to be my dad and mom.

508
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
They don't go home now.

509
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
They fight whenever they see each other.

510
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
They've divorced for many years.

511
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I've thought it through.

512
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
If they really get divorced,

513
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I won't be with anyone.

514
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I'll be with my dad.

515
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Fang Di.

516
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
You're the happiest person

517
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
in our family.

518
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
What are you doing here?

519
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Hurry up.

520
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
They're flying in.

521
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I'll help you.

522
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I'll help you.

523
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Wake up.

524
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Slow down.

525
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Take it out.

526
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Take it out.

527
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
What's this?

528
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
This is your treasure box.

529
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
It's a gift from last year.

530
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I don't know if it's good or bad.

531
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
You're not a good person.

532
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Watch carefully.

533
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Fang Di.

534
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I want to see this too.

535
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
I'll show you.

536
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
I'll show you.

537
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Don't go.

538
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Don't go.

539
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Don't go.

540
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
If you have something to eat,

541
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
you should leave.

542
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Don't wait for me.

543
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Lu Zhao Jie.

544
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I want to be more comfortable.

545
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Got it?

546
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Uncle.

547
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Take me out for a walk.

548
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I'll be back in the morning.

549
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Okay.

550
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Where do you want to go?

551
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Didn't you say

552
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
you went to the bar

553
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
when you were in school?

554
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
You'll take me to the bar

555
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
with you.

556
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
That's not a good place.

557
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I just went to work.

558
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
You just don't want to take me there.

559
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I promise you.

560
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I'll take you there

561
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
when it's over.

562
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Okay?

563
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
It's still a year.

564
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I'll talk to you.

565
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
But you have to promise me

566
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
that you won't drink with me.

567
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
That's boring.

568
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
If you don't listen to me,

569
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I won't take you there.

570
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I'll go to the bar

571
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
with you.

572
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Okay.

573
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I'll listen to you.

574
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
It's almost done.

575
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm going to the bar.

576
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
You should go.

577
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
What about you?

578
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
It's okay. I'll go there later.

579
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Okay.

580
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Take care.

581
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Take care.

582
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Call me when you get home.

583
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Remember to use your phone.

584
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Okay.

585
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Bye-bye.

586
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Take care.

587
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
When are you going to play?

588
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
In the middle of the Han River.

589
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
For example,

590
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Fan is good to you.

591
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
He even gave you a name.

592
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
This time,

593
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
you have to take good care of him.

594
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Do you understand?

595
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
He can't stand

596
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
those who can't see us.

597
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
I understand what Fan means.

598
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
But it's my only chance.

599
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

600
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Today is not good.

601
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
There's still a chance

602
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
to leave here.

603
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I mean,

604
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
this is the only

605
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
chance to leave here.

606
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
So, do you want to leave here?

607
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I used to think

608
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
but now I can't.

609
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
I know why.

610
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
You know it.

611
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
You said you can't see it.

612
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Anyway, no matter what you do,

613
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
I support you.

614
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Uncle Huang's words are right today.

615
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
What?

616
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
You're the happiest person

617
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
in the world.

618
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Go.

619
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Go.

620
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Go.

621
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Go.

622
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
This week is a small-scale meeting.

623
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Every week will be there.

624
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
I can't even imagine it.

625
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I just need to fill up the bottle.

626
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
And I can wear it.

627
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Isn't that a mental illness?

628
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
What?

629
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm sorry.

630
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I didn't mean that.

631
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
I know.

632
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
It's okay.

633
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Do you know

634
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
how many fruits are there in the world?

635
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I don't know.

636
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
How many kinds?

637
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I don't know either.

638
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Go.

639
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I thought you knew everything.

640
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
So, there's still something

641
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
that Mr. Qin knows.

642
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Why is he still following you?

643
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Don't mind him.

644
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Just hide away from me.

645
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
I'll send you home every day.

646
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Then, I'll be unhappy.

647
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Otherwise, he won't see you.

648
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Hello, Mr. Qin.

649
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Hello, Mr. Qin.

650
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm here.

651
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
I'll go upstairs first.

652
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Remember to sit down.

653
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
You have to check tomorrow.

654
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I know, Mr. Qin.

655
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Go.

656
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Bye.

657
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Bye.

658
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Go.

659
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Yifan.

660
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
You are so naughty.

661
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Take it.

662
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Here you are.

663
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I'll serve you some food.

664
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Have you eaten?

665
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
No.

666
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I'll give you some soup.

667
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
I'm fine.

668
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm not eating anymore.

669
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay.

670
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
You're back.

671
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
You're back.

672
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
There's music in the wind.

673
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
There's music in the coffin.

674
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
The water is pouring down on us.

675
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
It's not like me and Yifan.

676
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
There's a joy and a emotion.

677
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
It's a good thing in our hearts.

678
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I've been playing music

679
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
for a long time.

680
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
From the endless circles,

681
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
we can always hear

682
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
the words of our hearts.

683
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
We can't express them.

684
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
We can't express them

685
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
without our love.

686
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Okay.

687
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
You've been working hard recently.

688
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Come on.

689
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Mr. Wang.

690
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
What's the score?

691
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Be careful.

692
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Be careful.

693
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
I'm sorry.

694
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You're not coming to knock?

695
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I don't know.

696
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm sorry.

697
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
What are you doing?

698
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Wait for you.

699
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Wait for you.

700
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Come on.

701
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You're a little girl.

702
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
You're more attractive than her.

703
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
No.

704
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
No.

705
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
What's the use?

706
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
You're not a school girl.

707
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
No.

708
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
They're going to do it.

709
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
We can't dance.

710
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
We can't dance.

711
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
We can't dance.

712
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I said,

713
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
you're so good at dancing.

714
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Look at you.

715
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
You're not going to knock?

716
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm going to beat you.

717
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
What are you looking at?

718
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
You're so strong.

719
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
You're not going to knock?

720
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
I...

721
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
I...

722
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I can't.

723
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I can't.

724
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
I can't.

725
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm sorry.

726
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm sorry.

727
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
You're so attractive.

728
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
You're not going to knock?

729
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm sorry.

730
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:25,360
Is it right?

731
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,460
Mr Flute, how did you get on so late?

732
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,860
Do you believe that I will let them come back?

733
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,460
Jiang Xu!

734
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
I'm warning you.

735
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,460
If you dare to do anything to them,

736
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,260
I will...

737
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,060
What's wrong with you?

738
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,060
Did you call the police?

739
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,060
You killed me?

740
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,260
Come on.

741
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,460
Let go of me!

742
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,260
Jiang Xu!

743
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,060
Let go of you.

744
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,660
Where else can I let go of you?

745
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,860
This is the place you should live.

746
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,460
This is the day you should live.

747
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,260
What kind of day I used to live in?

748
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,460
It's because I have no way.

749
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
But it doesn't mean I will live like that forever.

750
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,860
I finally see the hope now.

751
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,860
But you don't even have hope.

752
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,660
I feel sorry for you, Jiang Xu.

753
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,260
Brother Huang, you can't run away!

754
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
You can't run away!

755
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,860
The cross-section is in the same direction.

756
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,060
That means the body was indeed pulled by the murderer for a while.

757
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,260
But the big hole wasn't the bottom.

758
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,260
It was just the surface.

759
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,260
Brother, I'm telling you the truth.

760
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,060
The killer was the one who killed the murderer.

761
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,060
The murderer was the one who killed the murderer.

762
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,460
It's so strange that we met each other.

763
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,860
I can also meet him in this situation.

764
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,260
Like Zhu Xue,

765
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
the father of the family.

766
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
He's so curious.

767
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,460
Brother, look at this picture.

768
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,060
Look at it.

769
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,460
Can't you see it?

770
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,260
I don't know.

771
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,260
It's okay if my brother can't see it.

772
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,060
You can't see it either.

773
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,860
Isn't this just a frozen ice cream?

774
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,060
You're so funny.

775
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,460
You're so funny.

776
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,860
No.

777
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,660
You're so funny.

778
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,460
Brother,

779
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,060
you've been here for two days.

780
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,260
You're not even going to eat.

781
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,060
Liu Ping,

782
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
let's talk about it again this afternoon.

783
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,260
Whether it's a mental illness or a mental illness,

784
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
we can just have a little more time.

785
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,460
Let's have a look.

786
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,460
Xiaodang,

787
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,260
we have to go to the sea to eat more.

788
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,060
Brother,

789
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
who is Wang Yitao?

790
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,660
We've found some cases of the victim's identity.

791
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
But it's not clear yet.

792
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
We'll talk about it later.

793
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,460
Okay.

794
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,860
What's the matter?

795
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,460
Hey, Xiaowen.

796
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,460
Zhang Hao.

797
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,460
Wang Jie.

798
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,660
Come with me.

799
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,060
You haven't finished your study?

800
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,060
It's late.

801
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,860
I'll call you back.

802
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,460
You've seen it today.

803
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
The host is really nervous.

804
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,860
I've brought my wife

805
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
to the foreign land in Dazhou.

806
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,860
When will she come back?

807
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,460
I can't tell you.

808
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,260
When the war is over,

809
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,860
I can't do anything about it.

810
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,060
I'll leave the case to you.

811
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,260
If you need help,

812
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
find the police and ask for help.

813
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,660
I've already called them.

814
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,260
I understand.

815
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,260
By the way,

816
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,860
the two reporters of the wedding tonight

817
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,260
are all small-minded.

818
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
They're afraid that they'll be blinded

819
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
and affect their work.

820
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
They've been nervous recently.

821
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,260
They've been having a hard time.

822
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,060
I know.

823
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm leaving.

824
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,660
Go to the hospital.

825
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,460
Don't worry.

826
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,060
Have you eaten?

827
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,860
I haven't.

828
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,660
Let's go.

829
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,660
Okay.

830
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,260
Let's go.

831
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:23,860
Okay.

832
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,460
Let's go.

833
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,260
Be careful.

834
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,060
Be careful.

835
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,860
Be careful.

836
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,260
This way.

837
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,860
Okay.

838
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,260
Let's go.

839
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:31,860
Let's go.

840
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,260
Let's go.

841
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Let's go.

842
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,060
Go.

843
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,660
Brother.

844
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,660
The Cao team is quite nice.

845
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,460
Isn't this Liu Zansha's house?

846
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Focus on your mouth.

847
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,060
Hurry up and eat.

848
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
You want to know what's coming up here.

849
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,060
She always has to show her small body.

850
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,660
Come on.

851
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,460
Good kids are across dogs now.

852
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,660
You're not aware of anything.

853
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,660
You should be careful.

854
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,060
You wanna go home?

855
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,060
He usually lives and laughs.

856
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:22,060
He only came back once a month.

857
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
He doesn't even call me.

858
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Is it the New Year now?

859
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,060
Uncle Huang came back last time. It's the 30th of the year.

860
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,060
He only came back once in the spring.

861
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,060
He doesn't love his family.

862
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,060
When will you be in touch with him?

863
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
When will you be in touch with him?

864
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,060
It's the 20th of the year.

865
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,060
I called him.

866
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,060
I wanted to ask him if he would come back for dinner.

867
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,060
He didn't pick up.

868
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,060
I didn't care much at that time.

869
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,060
He didn't pick up the phone.

870
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
You used your phone?

871
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Yes.

872
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Here, use your phone.

873
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,060
I remember someone was suspicious.

874
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,060
I remember someone was suspicious.

875
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
There was a boy.

876
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,060
He came back to the school that day and picked him up downstairs.

877
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,060
I saw him upstairs.

878
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,060
What kind of boy was he?

879
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,060
He was a middle-aged man. He was 1.7 meters tall.

880
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
When he saw him, he pulled his arm.

881
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
How old was he?

882
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,060
He was 18 or 19 years old. He looked like a big boy.

883
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,060
As far as we know,

884
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Uncle Huang was the one who transferred to Yuyin.

885
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,060
He stayed there for less than half a year.

886
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,060
Why did he go back to Yixiao?

887
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
I couldn't go back.

888
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,060
I learned martial arts only after Yixiao.

889
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
Yuyin is the middle-aged man.

890
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,060
My sister was like a demon before she left.

891
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,060
She didn't want Uncle Huang to dance.

892
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,060
It was hard to find someone to take care of her.

893
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,060
It's too late.

894
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,060
What else do you want to say?

895
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Which room did Uncle Huang live in?

896
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,060
Li Dong and his wife.

897
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Take me to see.

898
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,060
I want to see the team.

899
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,060
I want to see the team.

900
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
This room is yours.

901
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
This room...

902
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
This room...

903
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
This room...

904
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
This room...

905
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Uncle Huang, did Uncle Huang live in this room before?

906
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Uncle Huang was the one who transferred to Yuyin.

907
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,060
I was the one who transferred to Yuyin.

908
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Who was he?

909
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,060
He was a martial artist.

910
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,060
He was a fighter.

911
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
He was in the field at the night watch.

912
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,060
When Yan Feng took over the house,

913
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
he locked himself in the room.

914
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,060
He was in a circle and had a friend.

915
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,060
He saved several Dong Qian Gu.

916
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Silly.

917
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
Uncle Huang is a poor girl.

918
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
His parents ran away.

919
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,060
He lived with his old friends.

920
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,060
No one is looking for him now.

921
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
If I say that,

922
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
he will shoot me.

923
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
By the way,

924
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
did you plan to tell Jiao Jiao about this?

925
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
I don't know.

926
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
I don't know.

927
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,060
I don't know.

928
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,060
I don't know.

929
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,060
I don't know.

930
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,060
I don't know.

931
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,060
I don't know.

932
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,060
I don't know.

933
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,060
I don't know.

934
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
I don't know.

935
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
I don't know.

936
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,060
I don't know.

937
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,060
I don't know.

938
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
I don't know.

939
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
Hey.

940
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,060
You're really going to be discharged?

941
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,060
I'm here to drink some water.

942
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,060
I don't drink water.

943
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,060
I'm hungry.

944
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Sit down and talk to me.

945
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
I'll find you something to eat.

946
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Eat.

947
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
Me?

948
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060
I'll ask you later.

949
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Let's eat.

950
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Me?

951
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
I'll eat first.

952
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
Me?

953
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I'll beat you.

954
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060
Eat the goldfish.

955
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
Right.

956
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,060
You're back.

957
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
There's no one in the office.

958
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
You're going to buy wontons.

959
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,060
No one is coming.

960
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
Find Cao's key.

961
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
I'll eat it if I have time.

962
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
You said you'd bring it back.

963
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
What's the wind?

964
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
The leather jacket.

965
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
I'll go to the corridor today.

966
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I saw you in the corridor.

967
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I found something in the river.

968
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I took a look.

969
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
It's a set of girls' clothes.

970
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
It's a bag of blood.

971
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
Where's the thing?

972
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
It's from the hospital.

973
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Liang, you're so good at work.

974
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
Don't be too big.

975
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
What's wrong with you?

976
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Nothing.

977
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
I don't want to play with you.

978
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,060
Give it to me.

979
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
It smells good.

980
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
Does it smell good?

981
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060
Yes.

982
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
It smells good.

983
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
It's not bad.

984
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Does your clothes smell good?

985
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Here.

986
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
Here.

987
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
It's the...

988
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,060
The woman's clothes.

989
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
Does it smell good?

990
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Yes.

991
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
She's afraid of the light.

992
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Yes.

993
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Don't tell me.

994
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,060
Don't touch it.

995
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,060
Who sent you?

996
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,060
Who are you?

997
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
What does he look like?

998
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,060
He's a little younger.

999
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
What's the problem?

1000
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,060
Don't touch it.

1001
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Don't touch it.

1002
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
Don't worry.

1003
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Put it on.

1004
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Put it on.

1005
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Put it on.

1006
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,060
What did you do to her?

1007
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
It's not her.

1008
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,060
It's my own.

1009
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Did you pick it up?

1010
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,060
Where did you pick it up?

1011
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
She's not here.

1012
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Where did you pick it up?

1013
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
Captain Hong.

1014
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,060
You didn't tell me to send you a truck when you were picking it up.

1015
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Don't talk nonsense.

1016
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Brother.

1017
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
I'm done.

1018
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,060
I'll pick up the road and the road.

1019
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
Where's the surveillance camera?

1020
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,060
It's good to take the road.

1021
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,060
Why is it so slow today?

1022
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,060
It's so cold.

1023
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
You know,

1024
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
your skin looks pretty good.

1025
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,060
What? Do you like it?

1026
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
I like it.

1027
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,060
I like it.

1028
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,060
What do you like?

1029
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,060
I'll pick it up for you.

1030
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,060
Captain Hong.

1031
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Captain Hong.

1032
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,060

1035
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,060
Captain Hong.

1036
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,060
Captain Hong.

1037
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,060
