Episode 1

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
Look at the destination.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
What kind of food do you want? Is it imported or domestic?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
It's imported.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Then which brand do you want? We have Germany,

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Japan and the United States.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,600
What kind of price do you want?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
The best one.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
The best one? We have it.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
This is Germany. This is the best one.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,000
How much is it?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
8,806 yuan.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,600
That's expensive. Then this is fine.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,200
This is the old one. It's not more than 6,000 yuan.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
This is the best one.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Then this is it.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Then this is the order.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,600
I'll register a record for you.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,400
How old are you?

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,600
18 years old.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
18 years old.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Episode 1

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,400
You want to die?

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Why?

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
Do you have a future?

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Or no one?

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Everyone knows.

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,800
It's all over. How many people do you want?

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Two.

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Who? What's your name?

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Shenzhen. I don't know what to call him.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,200
Zhang Xu.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,800
What time is it?

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,600
9th. I don't remember that day.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
I found it.

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I watched it.

38
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,600
I won't let him die until the day.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
These years,

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,600
if they don't die, I won't be able to sleep.

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Where's the other one?

42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
That police officer said something.

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Who's there?

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,800
The police officer who was looking for us

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
with you at the hospital.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
He was looking for us.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
He was looking for us.

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
He was looking for us.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
He was looking for us.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,000
He was looking for us.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He has a name.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He's called Deng Yan.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't kill you.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't kill you.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you know how many years I've been in the police?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I've seen all kinds of crimes.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've seen all kinds of crimes.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I was the one who took the knife

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and cut the moon and moon.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was the one who burned the building.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I cut down the handkerchiefs and put them in the fish tank.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There were a lot of people in the police.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I slept more than anyone else.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're not that good.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're worse than me.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm worse than you!

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But they didn't kill the police alone.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't think about it.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Since you got here, you've been a dead man.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You killed the police and Deng Yan's brother.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't talk about it.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was a dead man for a year and two months.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't remember the day.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I saw the car when Yimeng ran away.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What car?

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't remember the name.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The car brand.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Since you went to the company to find Yimeng,

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
he knew something was going to happen.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He was ready to run away at any time.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Later, he asked the police to find out.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He said there was no evidence.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He asked me to wait and see.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That day, he got a call.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It was a man.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He said there was evidence of Yimeng's rape.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He asked him to get the evidence.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Otherwise, he would hand it over to the police.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I went downstairs.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I didn't need to answer the phone.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I saw the police.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hurry up.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The car in front of us.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The car in front of us.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The car in front of us.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The car in front of us.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The car in front of us.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The car in front of us.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The car in front of us.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The car in front of us.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The car in front of us.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The car in front of us.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The car in front of us.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The car in front of us.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The car in front of us.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The car in front of us.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The car in front of us.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The car in front of us.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The car in front of us.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The car in front of us.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How did he get the money?

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He is behind you.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you want to give it back?

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They said he had the evidence in his hands.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How did you know he had no evidence?

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who is the person who called?

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's the police officer of the Star Road.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're talking nonsense with me?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's him.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yiming knows he's a police officer.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He might have some evidence to cover him.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Just say it.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think Yiming has been here for an hour.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's been hiding and watching the situation.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's the place where the person in the phone is?

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's a tunnel on the edge of the city.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's a tunnel on the right.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's so dark.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What do you think this place is?

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Continue.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
差不多

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The police officer is here.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a band.

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Are you sure the criminal is gone?

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There's a marriage motorcycle in the map.

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hurry up.

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,800
Well were you nervous typhoon like the Un recognition term before then

139
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,840
are you fried

140
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,000
When did you go back?

141
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,160
When grandma stood up

142
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,000
I showed them

143
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
sweetie

144
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Smart

145
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,840
赼

146
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
赼

147
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,580
No.

148
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,280
Beatty.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

150
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,800
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,200
That day, I sent the silver to the Fire Department.

153
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
They sent me to Guangzhou.

154
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Then they sent me to America from Hong Kong.

155
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Why didn't you leave with him?

156
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
How could he take me there?

157
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,160
He took me to Shenzhen.

158
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,920
To his brother.

159
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
I made a fake ID.

160
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
How could you come back?

161
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,720
At first, my brother gave me some money.

162
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,880
But he didn't give it to me.

163
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,440
I was in trouble for nine months.

164
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,200
I ran away.

165
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
I've been together for ten years.

166
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,880
I think it's okay.

167
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,520
I came back to see my mom.

168
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,680
I've finished the arrangement.

169
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
I sent it to Japan.

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
It's just a fake ID.

171
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,880
Then you thought

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
you could find Cao Meng's money.

173
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
If Yin Peng can go out,

174
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,920
he must have something to do with Cao Meng.

175
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,640
He must be worried.

176
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,120
Besides, I want to find him.

177
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,640
I can't find him.

178
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,680
How do you know that Yin Peng went back to Shenzhen?

179
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,960
I told him about Cao Meng's gun.

180
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,400
I took the gun back.

181
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,240
I went back to find him.

182
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
The gun was gone.

183
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,640
I came back with a gun.

184
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,640
Yin Peng has a gun?

185
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
I was in the cloud.

186
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I had to be careful.

187
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,720
Did Uncle Huang kill Yin Peng?

188
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
He did.

189
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,400
Uncle Huang is really not a killer.

190
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
In 1997,

191
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,480
Yin Peng made a business in Guangzhou.

192
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,360
I met him at that time.

193
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,560
His Guangzhou lost a master.

194
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,880
I told him two things.

195
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,120
First, he wanted to be a snake.

196
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
He wanted to be a treasure.

197
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,800
He wanted to be a good man.

198
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
Second, he wanted to find a girl

199
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
before he made a big business.

200
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,240
He did as he said.

201
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,240
He was really a good man.

202
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
Yin Zhonghao!

203
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,320
He started to find a girl.

204
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,480
He found out that

205
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,120
he was looking for a little bit of a little horse.

206
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,080
He was not a real girl.

207
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,560
He contacted all kinds of girls.

208
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,480
As long as he was a real girl,

209
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,160
he would give him a lot of money.

210
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,000
In 1999,

211
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
he started to take medicine.

212
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,920
He was still struggling.

213
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,360
His spirit was getting better.

214
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
He was getting more and more stable.

215
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,400
He made a warehouse under his company.

216
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
He installed the warehouse

217
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
and put it in the hotel room.

218
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,080
When he started to work,

219
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,960
I sent all the girls there.

220
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Sometimes he stayed there for a few days.

221
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,840
He didn't come out.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,640
I went in.

223
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
There was a camera.

224
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,560
One time,

225
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,080
I sent a girl back.

226
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
The girl was scolded by her boyfriend

227
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
when she got in the car.

228
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,000
She said she was sick.

229
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,560
She didn't like to be tortured.

230
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
She even took a video of him.

231
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,400
She said she would kill him if she was told.

232
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,080
I remember

233
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,520
when Yin Zhonghao was in Guangzhou,

234
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,720
the enemy took him away.

235
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
He was hurt.

236
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,800
He must have been exhausted.

237
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,320
Yin Peng and Uncle Huang

238
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,360
met each other long ago.

239
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,120
They were in the sun at midnight.

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,160
Uncle Huang danced on the stage.

241
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,680
Yin Peng's eyes were swollen.

242
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,560
He asked me to call him.

243
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,080
Hit the beat to the studies.

244
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,400
Land vs Inn

245
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,720
Let him leave a message.

246
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,680
When there was nothing to do,

247
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,040
he sang with me.

248
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,320
He didn't let me stop using theotsy farm to eat.

249
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,440
Stillством 5th all ofosse is gone now.

250
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,360
You performed on the stage

251
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,200
to hear that you did a musical.

252
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,480
Uncle Huang didn't change him.

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Later, when Wang Lanzi and Uncle Huang came,

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I recognized him at night.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And Yin Pong.

256
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is Boss Yin.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This is my niece, Uncle Huang.

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, good.

259
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Come, sit down.

260
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Sit down.

261
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Come over.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sorry.

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why did you promise to meet Yin Pong?

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yin Pong asked me to come out and sing with him.

265
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I didn't have anything else to do.

266
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I promised to give him 100 yuan.

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When did you go to meet Yin Pong?

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't remember.

269
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I went to the old street at night to buy some snacks.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Where did you take him to?

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The warehouse in the world.

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
How many days have you been locked up?

273
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Two or three days.

274
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I went in and gave him two meals.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I also gave him three more gold.

276
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yin Pong's business is all about that.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yin Pong

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yin Pong

279
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yin Pong

280
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
After a few days, Yin Pong asked me to send him back.

281
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That night, I went to Guangzhou with Yin Pong.

282
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
After I came back, you came to the company to find Yin Pong.

283
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I knew that Uncle Huang was dead.

284
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That afternoon, where did you send him to?

285
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I gave him 10,000 yuan.

286
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He said he would leave the car at the entrance of the gate.

287
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What exactly is the location?

288
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is the street opposite the gate.

289
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's all for medical equipment.

290
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yin Pong

291
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yin Pong

292
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If the boss didn't lie to me,

293
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the people who called Yin Pong and gave me ten thousand of the medicine should be today.

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But he thought it was Xiao Deng.

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Xiao Deng never followed the car.

296
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He saw that Yin Pong was not well.

297
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I still don't understand who killed Uncle Huang.

298
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Captain Hong

299
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I found out that the other three people who were the strong red pigs

300
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
were all dead in the period of the last seven years.

301
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
All dead?

302
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, and they were kidnapped.

303
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
One was killed in the cold and the other was killed in the snow.

304
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And one was thrown into the ice and the cold.

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Li Li Wei, December 10, 2003

306
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Liu Enming, December 10, 2010

307
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He Sheng, December 10, 2006

308
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

309
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes, I am.

310
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Why are they all December 10?

311
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's Uncle Huang's birthday.

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The three people who died

313
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
were all fighting for Uncle Huang.

314
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And the female doctor of Ming'ai's clinic, Zhang Xia Feng

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Her ex-husband is Qin Dago.

316
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Which Qin Dago?

317
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The one in the 12th class.

318
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes.

319
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Qin Di and Qin Tian's mother

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Zhang Xia Feng was a witness

321
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that Qin Li was the one who died on the 27th.

322
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And actually on the 28th

323
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Qin Li was the one who told her to say that.

324
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Otherwise, she wouldn't have dared to lie.

325
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
If you say so,

326
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
when Uncle Huang died,

327
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Qin Li was not in the clinic.

328
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
She should be in the clinic.

329
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What time is it today?

330
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's 10 o'clock.

331
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I need to check the doctor's condition.

332
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I need to check the doctor's condition.

333
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll be back soon.

334
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't worry, aunt.

335
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Take care of yourself.

336
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I...

337
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I brought you this...

338
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I brought you...

339
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You brought something?

340
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't bring it down.

341
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I can't use so much.

342
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No, no.

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Don't be polite.

344
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If you need anything,

345
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
tell me.

346
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay.

347
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I found the address.

348
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Except for Yin Peng,

349
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
the driver is the last one.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You can't move down.

351
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'll move up.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The crew is in a hurry.

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'll go out

354
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
after this driver is done.

355
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You're a fool.

356
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I know.

357
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Remember,

358
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I did this for Uncle Huang,

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
not for you.

360
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I found it.

361
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Keep an eye on it.

362
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm not going to die for it.

363
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
These days,

364
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
as long as they don't die,

365
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I can't sleep at all.

366
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I can do it for them.

367
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It's not fair.

368
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'll do it for you.

369
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll do it for you.

370
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll do it for you.

371
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll do it for you.

372
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll do it for you.

374
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'll do it for you.

375
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'll do it for you.

376
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You're a fool.

377
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
volunteer

378
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,500
company

379
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SIGC

380
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The anomaly of the leadership

381
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
according to the evidence

382
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
was a common suspect

383
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
of Huang Shuàng and Zeng wys

384
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
in the second dose.

385
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
They are attached

386
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,540
with Rush вм.

387
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,940
He was very close to the school.

388
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,060
Back then, I and Feng was in this...

389
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,980
Zhang Xia Feng's doctor at Ming'ai Hospital.

390
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,380
Now, it seems that his identity...

391
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:44,900
Brother.

392
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,700
...is a fake.

393
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,620
Do you believe in the police?

394
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,820
I don't want to believe it.

395
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,300
The police is so smart.

396
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,340
I knew you were suspicious of him.

397
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,820
Why did the old man arrest him?

398
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,740
Maybe he was clear in his heart.

399
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
We didn't find the evidence.

400
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,140
In my opinion,

401
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,220
there should be something else that hasn't been completed.

402
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,180
So he can't leave.

403
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,180
What else?

404
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,500
The girl was in the car and was so mad.

405
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,540
She was so upset that she even gave him a call.

406
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,380
The record of the yellow book.

407
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,980
If Qin Li found the treasure first,

408
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,420
what would he do?

409
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,980
Li Li Wei.

410
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,100
Liu En Ming.

411
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,780
He Sheng.

412
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,060
He was always in the red book.

413
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,580
There are a few men who are not very good at this.

414
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,900
Zhang Xun has a connection with Qin Li Wei.

415
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,580
You have a friend with the red book.

416
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,340
Okay.

417
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,660
Qin Li likes to go to the red book.

418
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,140
Fair enough.

419
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,260
I think Hubei was just heading to talk to me.

420
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,620
When you know what you are up to?

421
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,220
Shen!

422
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,620
Where did you hide the red book?

423
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,500
== Read it ==

424
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,660

426
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,760
I really don't know it.

427
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,860
He did have a house there.

428
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,540
He Lant opened a big block of land in er wo.

429
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,540
Liu was線 his ocher comatose.

430
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,680
He then caught my dependast ve dus.

431
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,720
The tank was empty.

432
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,840
He was sat their theD soe.

433
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,880
You're the one who should go.

434
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
I've never been there.

435
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,920
Really.

436
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,680
Hello?

437
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Dad, are you going to catch the luggage?

Don't ask.

440
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Stay at home.

441
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,640
Dad, I beg you.

442
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
Tell me the truth.

Are you going to catch the luggage?

444
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,840
If he's innocent,

445
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,400
I'll give him a chance.

446
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Is it the fastest?

447
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840

My mood is like a light in the dark

750
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:42,480
I like to see you smile and call me a little turtle

751
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,480
I'm a little bit afraid

752
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,480
I can't turn back in my world

753
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,480
You are in your world
