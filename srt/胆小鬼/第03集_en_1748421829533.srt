Episode 22

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,400
Second Room

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,640
3 Seconds

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:28,940
Where do you guys

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,560
Here, money

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,600
Where is the scissors

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,180
Oh, you forgot it again, I'll get it later

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,080
Nevermind

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,700
I haven't fully recovered yet.

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,760
I was excited to meet someone you liked.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,420
I pretended like I couldn't say that,

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,420
but not 지�kekan's otto.

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,880
Don't ask me!

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,480
It's my birthday.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,460
I'll treat my daughter as a student.

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,600
Don't ask me about your home.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,780
Such a big

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,500
my daughter doesn't have a child forever.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Simple

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,360
Stop, you are good

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,920
You are good, I am good

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
Actually, I can also contact your home

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,360
My home is not good

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
My mom doesn't let me see

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
I'll look at you the best

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,280
This key is for you

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I'm not here in the future

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
You can come anytime

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,840
Interesting

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,480
I'll give you a discount

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,720
I'll send you

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,600
How can I give you a discount

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,840
It's not a chance to cut it in two

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
How can you be so superstitious

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,520
It's been 15 years since I started working with Qiao Dan

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,960
I've already cut it in two

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
Go, I'll take the two

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,240
What flavor do you want?

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Ma sauce

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,160
I'll go

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,040
But I'm going to do it again

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
I'll go

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,400
I'll go

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll go

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I'll go

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I'll go

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'll go

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I'll go

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I'll go

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I'll go

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I'll go

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll go

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll go

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I'll go

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I'll go

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I'll go

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll go

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I'll go

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I'll go

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I'll go

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll go

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
I'll go

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll go

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I'll go

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I'll go

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I'll go

86
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll go

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I'll go

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I'll go

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll go

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll go

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll go

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'll go

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I'll go

94
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
I'll go

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I'll go

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll go

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I'll go

98
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I'll go

99
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I'll go

100
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I'll go

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
I'll go

102
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,060
I'll go

103
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
Hurry up

104
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
This way

105
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,980
What should I do with this comradesء th

106
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,780
atory

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,980
Is bloody

108
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,060
What?

109
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,480
lässt정을

110
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
I am sorry

111
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
is a heart

112
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,320
Which twenty percent

113
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,760
침

114
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,740
dormir

115
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,140
This dare

116
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,780
This brave

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Take a good record and find out.

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay.

119
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Where is she?

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
She went out.

121
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
How did you know I was going to make a living at their house?

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I bought it when I went out.

123
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
I always feel that they have to put things in their soup.

124
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
They can eat it every few days.

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
It's weird.

126
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
He Cao.

127
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
I owe you a name.

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
We don't have to do this.

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
If it's not for you,

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I'll be a waste.

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Did you get the money back?

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Liu Ping just called.

133
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
He paid 50,000 yuan for the house and 100 million for the park.

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
What about the car?

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
How much is the car worth?

136
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
It's like a life.

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
It's a good thing.

138
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
By the way,

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Qin Da Zhi has a big son.

140
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,400
He has been with his mother for more than ten years.

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
He is in contact with the other person.

142
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
He is checking his account.

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
What are you thinking about?

144
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
We can't get a second hand

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
in this life.

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,400
How much is the life worth?

147
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
What about you?

148
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Not enough.

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Qin Da Zhi said it.

150
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't be happy.

151
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Drink some soup.

152
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll add some fish to your soup.

153
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Here.

154
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Dad, come in.

155
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
You're back.

156
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Dad.

157
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Come on.

158
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Have a seat.

159
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Go get some soup for your dad.

160
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Okay.

161
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Where is Xiaoling?

162
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
She went to Hangzhou in the morning.

163
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Tell me.

164
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Maybe she forgot about it.

165
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Her sister called her last night.

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
She asked Huo Qing to come.

167
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
What's the rush?

168
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
They are both in a small factory over there.

169
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
They said they would come to a U.S. business.

170
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
They asked Xiaoling to negotiate with them.

171
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
My mom has already negotiated with the Americans?

172
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,400
You should go to the U.S. to negotiate with your mom.

173
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I thought she would just say whatever she wants.

174
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
What about the company?

175
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
The company is not good.

176
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
No one is in charge of it.

177
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
My mom is in the sea too.

178
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You know the sea?

179
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Of course.

180
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Many of our classmates are in the sea.

181
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
They have money.

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
All the people are famous.

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Dad, buy me a coat.

184
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Learn something. Don't always judge others.

185
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Jiaojiao, if you can get into the first 15 this time,

186
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I will buy you one.

187
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Say something.

188
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Dad, he is so bad.

189
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Right, Huo Qing.

190
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Huo Qing.

191
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
I suddenly remembered.

192
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
I have seen the Qin's

193
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
in the 128th case.

194
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
When?

195
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
When the high school was starting.

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
At the parents' meeting.

197
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
He sat in front of me.

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Come in.

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
What is this?

200
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Officer.

201
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Pu Jian.

202
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Who am I for denying the interview

203
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
of the leader of your apartment?

204
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Such a big case.

205
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
The situation was a step problem.

206
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
You have a great contribution.

207
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
You want me to sink the hopes.

208
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I didn't pay my own contribution.

209
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll do my best.

210
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Okay, okay. Don't bother.

211
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Your work and case skills

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
are all in the hands of the public.

213
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I'll call you over to tell me.

214
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
After your master retired,

215
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
the position of the captain has been in the air for half a year.

216
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
So I officially informed you.

217
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Starting from January next year,

218
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
you'll be the captain of the position.

219
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Why are you still upset?

220
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Is this a deal?

221
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Yes, it is.

222
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
What else do you have to worry about?

223
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Chief, I think

224
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I should cooperate with him

225
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
when he's still in the Cangmeng.

226
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Because he saved your life,

227
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
you want to get a chance to repay him?

228
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
No.

229
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
It's because of your father-in-law.

230
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
The foreign bureau has been in the office for so many years.

231
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
No one is talking behind his back.

232
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
It's okay.

233
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm serious.

234
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
You're so stubborn.

235
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I'll talk to the other leaders later.

236
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Okay.

237
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll talk to the other leaders later.

238
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
We'll talk later.

239
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Okay.

240
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
There's one more thing.

241
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
That case of the demon

242
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
has a very bad influence on society.

243
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
In the evening,

244
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
we were afraid to get into the car.

245
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
So the leaders

246
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
ate a heart-shaped cake

247
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
for the public.

248
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
They specifically approved the TV station

249
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
to be a interview for Chief Qin.

250
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Why did they

251
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
promote the food of the mountain?

252
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
The specific time...

253
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
It should be these two days.

254
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
They're going to be forced.

255
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
The leader said

256
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
the worst is to stay in the new season.

257
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Good spirit.

258
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
You deserve it.

259
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
You're willing to cooperate.

260
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
I have to thank you.

261
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Just be my last

262
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
and I'll give you a favor.

263
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Mom.

264
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Come with me.

265
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Just a little.

266
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
How many bowls do you drink?

267
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
This is for Chief Qin.

268
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I'll let you drink it later.

269
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I'll get you a cup of tea.

270
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I'll get you a cup of tea.

271
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I'll get you a cup of tea.

272
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
I'll let you drink it later.

273
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Just let him drink it.

274
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
This is so good.

275
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Can the doctor

276
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
let him drink the fish soup?

277
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
The doctor said

278
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
the doctor said

279
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
the fish soup is soft and smooth.

280
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes.

281
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
We've been buying fish for a long time.

282
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
If the old man can eat meat,

283
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
he won't be able to afford it.

284
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
You.

285
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Why are you talking about these things?

286
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
How much can we help?

287
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
How much can we help?

288
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
How much can we help?

289
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Think about it.

290
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Are you done writing?

291
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Are you watching TV again?

292
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Yes.

293
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Let him watch the work.

294
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm so busy watching TV.

295
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm so busy watching TV.

296
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
It's not far from the last day of the execution.

297
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
The last scene.

298
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Do you have

299
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
anything to say to the family of the victim?

300
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
No.

301
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Nothing?

302
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
No.

303
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I know

304
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
you don't have feelings.

305
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I heard

306
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
you wrote a letter

307
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
to your little son.

308
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Just now

309
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
they gave me this letter.

310
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Do you allow me

311
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
to face the camera

312
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
and help you read the letter?

313
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I'll read it.

314
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
My son

315
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
is as good as his face.

316
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Is his life and learning

317
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
good?

318
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
You've never

319
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
come to see him in these days.

320
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I miss you so much.

321
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm sorry to you.

322
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I didn't raise you up

323
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
to help you

324
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
arrange for a better life.

325
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I'll take it.

326
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
From now on

327
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
you have to rely on yourself.

328
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
You have to take care of your grandpa.

329
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Remember,

330
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
don't rely on anyone else

331
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
but yourself.

332
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
If you make friends

333
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
you're the most sincere person.

334
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You're still young.

335
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
You've never seen a real society

336
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
that doesn't understand the world.

337
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
You're wronged.

338
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
You have to learn to be patient.

339
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
You have to be patient.

340
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
You have to be a big man.

341
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Remember

342
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
not to be impulsive.

343
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Be a person who respects the law.

344
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
You're a smart child.

345
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I hope my English

346
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
won't be a burden to you.

347
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
You can be capable

348
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
to walk towards light yourself.

349
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
In 1999

350
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
December 19th,

351
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Night.

352
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Night.

353
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Night.

354
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Night.

355
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Night.

356
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Night.

357
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Here.

358
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Son of a bitch!

359
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Greetings my boy,

360
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,540
serve my son!

361
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Why are we disturbing you?

362
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,540
Great soldiers serve their son!

363
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,560
Greetings my boy,

364
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,540
serve him!

365
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
Close your eyes,

366
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,520
don't move!

367
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,400
Open your mouth!

368
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
Quick, quick!

369
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,480
Why do like that?

370
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
Come here!

371
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,520
Brother Xiang!

372
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Brother Xiang!

373
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,400
Don't touch me!

374
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Greetings my boy,

375
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400

376
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Brother Xiang!

377
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,480
Brother Xiang!

378
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,400
Brother Xiang!

379
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,380
Notyour dog!

380
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Get out of my way!

381
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Get out of my way!

382
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
You're a murderer!

383
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Get out of my way!

384
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
You're a murderer!

385
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Get out of my way!

386
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Come here!

387
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
Or you'll come out with me!

388
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Yang.

389
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
Why are you here?

390
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
I'm here!

391
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Someone hit the man!

392
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
Don't kill him!

393
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
What happened to you?

394
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
I'm a murderer!

395
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Why are you here?

396
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Look!

397
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
I'm here!

398
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
I'm here!

399
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Who are you?

400
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,380
Get out of here!

401
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Get out of here!

402
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Who are you?

403
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Get out of my way!

404
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm not going to wash it.

405
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
Give it to me.

406
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
It's so dirty.

407
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
Do you know?

408
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,060
Ancestral

409
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
That guy is from Gaosan.

410
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
His father was kicked out of the family.

411
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
He died two years ago.

412
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
The case is solved.

413
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
The murderer is the one.

414
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Qin Li is in a serious situation right now.

415
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
He is really in a hurry.

416
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
You feel under pressure.

417
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
I don't feel under pressure.

418
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
I'm thinking how to help her.

419
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,380
Now I know this story.

420
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm not worried at all.

421
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
I don't know at all.

422
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
I think he's not even looking too anxious.

423
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Since he was a kid,

424
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
he didn't even attend the cultural class.

425
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
He's a student anyway.

426
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
Don't worry too much.

427
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,380
Chen Junwen, Chen Junwen.

428
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,380
I've always been asking you.

429
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Why did the kid come that day?

430
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Why is he still following the police?

431
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
What's wrong?

432
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
What's wrong?

433
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,380
What's wrong?

434
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
What's wrong?

435
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
What's wrong?

436
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
What's wrong?

437
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
The police has been looking for his mother.

438
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
What's wrong with his mother?

439
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,380
His mother is in a bad mood.

440
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
She has a problem with her brain.

441
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,380
She seems to be a troublemaker.

442
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
What's the problem with the high school?

443
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
I'm just a student.

444
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
Wang Jin, don't get angry.

445
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
He's been bullied by the school.

446
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
Then you can bully him.

447
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
What are you doing?

448
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Get out.

449
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Why do you know?

450
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
Why?

451
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,380
Is it because he's a troublemaker?

452
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
Little boy!

453
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Please do this for the rest of your life.

454
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,380
Wang Jin, don't mention it again.

455
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Just say it once more.

456
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,380
I always say it.

457
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Let's never mention it again.

458
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,380
Actually, these days,

459
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
I don't even dare to look at him.

460
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm afraid he'll hate me.

461
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
How do you eat?

462
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
Xin Li,

463
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,380
I just want to apologize to my father.

464
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Your father didn't eat me.

465
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,380
You didn't eat me.

466
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Then we'd better go.

467
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Do you have a good friend?

468
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Wang Jin.

469
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Good food.

470
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,380
You didn't fight with Wang Di today?

471
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
He's still playing basketball with someone.

472
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,380
Why don't you wear a scarf?

473
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
I lost it.

474
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Really?

475
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,380
Get in the car.

476
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,380
You can go.

477
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,380
I told you to get in the car.

478
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
I told you not to look for me.

479
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Come here.

480
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,380
Uncle Huang.

481
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,380
Uncle Huang, come down.

482
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Who is that?

483
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,380
Can you promise me that you won't tell your classmates?

484
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
No.

485
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Thank you.

486
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
It's noon today.

487
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
I should thank you.

488
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
It's okay.

489
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
I'll go to the bathroom.

490
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
I'll go to the bathroom.

491
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
I'll go to the bathroom.

492
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
I'll go to the bathroom.

493
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,380
It's okay.

494
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,380
By the way, I owe you money.

495
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
I have to...

496
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,380
Don't pay me back.

497
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
You can pay me a bag of paper money.

498
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
I like the one with the fragrance.

499
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
Okay, I remember.

500
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I'm kidding.

501
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Are you serious?

502
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,380
Li.

503
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
If you're unhappy,

504
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,380
you can tell me.

505
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,380
I can understand.

506
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
I really can understand.

507
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
I believe you.

508
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Do you want to listen to my song?

509
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
Okay.

510
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,380
The Song of Love

511
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Hello, everyone.

512
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,380
This is the music show of FM586.

513
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,380
The center of the Chinese history of Beijing.

514
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,380
The song is called

515
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
The World of the Moon.

516
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
We have a new beginning.

517
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Many things have changed.

518
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
What we're hearing now

519
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
is a song called

520
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
The Song of Love.

521
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
You're the one who sang this song.

522
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Why can't I sing it every time?

523
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
There's a machine gun.

524
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,380
You've pretend it.

525
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Happy New Year.

526
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
Happy New Year.

527
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
It's said that the world is full of sun in 1999.

528
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
Why are you still so good today?

529
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
The world is full of sun.

530
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Every day is possible.

531
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
Li.

532
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
I've called you to play basketball.

533
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
Xia Long.

534
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
I'm here.

535
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
I'm playing basketball.

536
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
I'm playing basketball on the roof.

537
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Come on.

538
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,380
Help me.

539
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,380
Help me.

540
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,380
Hold on.

541
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,380
Hold on.

542
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
You know to stay still.

543
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
Hold on.

544
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
Hold on. Don't be afraid.

545
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,380
I'll be with you forever.

546
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,380
Hold on.

547
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Hold on.

548
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Your life is still pretty long.

549
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Can you read the male lead's female book?

550
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Take it from the left.

551
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
Look, there's a difference here.

552
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,380
It's about 40 years old.

553
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
There's a card.

554
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
See?

555
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,380
This represents friendship.

556
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
You don't have many friends in your life.

557
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
But they're all born and raised.

558
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
This represents love.

559
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,380
Is this love in your life?

560
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
What's wrong?

561
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
It's worse than a foot.

562
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
Don't say nonsense.

563
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Report.

564
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Hello, teacher.

565
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Why are you late again?

566
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Go back.

567
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
You should be here early tomorrow.

568
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
This...

569
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Thank you, teacher.

570
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
He's late again.

571
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,380
I'll say a few words before class.

572
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
I found that the air in class is a problem.

573
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,380
Someone is spreading rumors.

574
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
Who is spreading it?

575
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,380
What is it?

576
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
You know it.

577
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
A man is greedy.

578
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
A small person is long-time.

579
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
What does the holy book do?

580
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
It's not a small person.

581
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,380
I don't want to hear

582
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
any of these words.

583
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

584
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
Take it easy.

585
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,380
Take it easy.

586
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,380
It's not early.

587
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,380
Make it louder.

588
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
Yes.

589
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
And

590
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,380
some male and female classmates in class

591
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
should keep a distance.

592
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,380
After all, it's spring.

593
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Teacher, class.

594
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
Keep a distance.

595
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Class.

596
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Who is the teacher?

597
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
Don't bother me.

598
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
Class.

599
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
Stand up.

600
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,380
Don't.

601
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,380
Don't.

602
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Good morning, teacher.

603
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
Good morning, everyone.

604
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Now, sit down, please.

605
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,380
You're talking about your own expression.

606
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,380
Why are you here?

607
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,380
I'm not here.

608
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
If something happens,

609
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
try to leave now.

610
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,900
Ah!

611
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,740
Zheng Xiao!

612
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,300
Let me see.

613
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,580
It hurts! It hurts! Don't be afraid.

614
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,380
Hurry up and run to the bathroom.

615
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,380
Wait, wait, wait.

616
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,780
Ah! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

617
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,980
Stop yelling. Stop yelling.

618
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,180
It's all right.

619
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,460
This is good.

620
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,820
It's just a foot.

621
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,100
Just keep it.

622
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,780
Be careful.

623
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,340
Are you going to the hospital again?

624
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,380
It's okay. No need.

625
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,940
Slowly.

626
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,900
Slowly.

627
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,700
Slowly.

628
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
When can I recover?

629
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,380
The wound is still in the pot for 100 days.

630
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,380
You have to get better every night.

631
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,380
No!

632
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I'll be on the stage next week.

633
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
Don't think about it.

634
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,380
What should I do? I've been practicing for so long.

635
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
It's okay. It's okay.

636
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,380
Don't worry. There will be a way.

637
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
You said it was a relief.

638
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,380
I'm not your foot.

639
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,380
You are a student.

640
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,380
You've been working hard to get you out of here.

641
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Why are you talking to me like that?

642
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
It's okay, teacher.

643
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
We are good friends.

644
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,380
Right? Are you a good friend?

645
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm so angry.

646
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
This is my office.

647
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Come in.

648
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,380
I'm so sorry.

649
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,380
This way.

650
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,380
I especially asked you to run.

651
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,380
Come, please sit.

652
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
I'm just a parent.

653
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,380
Normal.

654
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Teacher Fan.

655
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,380
Did you teach him to make mistakes at school?

656
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
No big mistake.

657
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Please have some water.

658
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
Please sit.

659
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Recently,

660
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,380
my sister-in-law is studying.

661
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,380
She's getting worse.

662
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,380
She's a little bit down.

663
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
There's another problem.

664
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
I don't know how to open her mouth.

665
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Teacher Fan, you can say it.

666
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Yes.

667
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,380
She's been a little bit down lately.

668
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
Down?

669
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Is she with her classmate,

670
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,380
Wang Di?

671
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,380
You know her, Yang Jun?

672
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,380
I often mention her at home.

673
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Wang Di seems to be a very talented boy.

674
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Right?

675
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
Yes.

676
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
I know this at home.

677
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
But it shouldn't be a big deal.

678
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I'm so worried.

679
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,380
You said it's a big deal.

680
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,380
I'll have to know the situation seriously after I go back.

681
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Also,

682
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,380
look at the age-old boy.

683
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
He's a youthful boy.

684
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
This kind of behavior is normal, right?

685
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
Yes.

686
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,380
Yang Jun, you're so open-minded.

687
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,380
Teacher Fan, I'm retired.

688
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,380
You can call me Yang Jun from now on.

689
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,380
No, no, Yang Jun.

690
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
How can you do that?

691
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,380
Actually, I used to be a police officer.

692
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Really?

693
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Look.

694
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Here.

695
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,380
This is the picture I took.

696
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,380
He's so handsome.

697
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
You know,

698
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
many students gave me a nickname.

699
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
They're old friends.

700
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
Why?

701
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,380
I was in the prison back then.

702
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,380
I was watching the teacher.

703
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,380
I was a self-taught teacher.

704
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
I was a teacher.

705
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,380
It's rare.

706
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,380
You must be very experienced.

707
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,380
You're a teacher.

708
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,380
But you're a teacher.

709
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,380
I'm not.

710
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,380
But I have to say this.

711
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,380
I was a senior in high school.

712
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
I was a freshman.

713
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
I saw Qin Da Zhi.

714
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,380
I felt that he was so familiar.

715
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
I didn't know where he was.

716
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,380
Then I thought about it.

717
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,380
He saw those pictures of his life in my account.

718
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,380
His eyes were so different.

719
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,380
I should have been a police officer.

720
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
Teacher Fan.

721
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,380
I think you should stop talking about it.

722
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,380
But you should take more care of Qin Li.

723
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
Yes.

724
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
You rarely see smart kids.

725
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,380
What a pity.

726
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,380
I'm sorry.

727
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,380
The kids are so young.

728
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,380
They're good to teachers and parents.

729
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
They're all good kids.

730
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
They're born to be a hundred children.

731
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,380
Teachers are also good at counting.

732
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Teacher Fan.

733
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,380
Teacher Fan.

734
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Your responsibility is important.

735
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,380
Yes.

736
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
Is Yang Qi here?

737
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Chen Chun.

738
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Excuse me.

739
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
I need to talk to Teacher Fan.

740
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
Teacher Fan.

741
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
I'm leaving.

742
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Thank you.

743
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
You're welcome.

744
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
I'll leave you to it.

745
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Yang Qi.

746
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,380
Are you here to see Qin Li?

747
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
No.

748
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm here to see her.

749
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
No matter who you are,

750
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,380
you should change your mind before you come.

751
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
Have you thought about it?

752
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,380
It will affect the children's welfare.

753
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
You're too late.

754
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,380
You're wrong.

755
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
It's easy to do.

756
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
Take care.

757
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
I won't see you off.

758
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
Take care.

759
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,380
It hurts.

760
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
Be gentle.

761
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
What's wrong?

762
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,380
He's a little bit late.

763
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,380
Uncle Huang.

764
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
Fan asked you to the office.

765
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,380
What's wrong?

766
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
I don't know.

767
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,380
I'm in a hurry.

768
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
I can't call you.

769
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,380
You can go.

770
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,380
Wang Lin, you can go back.

771
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Take care.

772
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
Take care.

773
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,380
You're not that good.

774
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,380
I'll take care of you.

775
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
No need.

776
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,380
I can walk.

777
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
You're still so capable.

778
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
You carry it.

779
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
You can't wait.

780
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
Go.

781
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Come on.

782
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
He's a little bit lower.

783
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Hurry up.

784
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
So miserable.

785
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
You stole a fart.

786
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
You didn't even smile.

787
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Let me ask you.

788
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,380
You're going to play with your feet today.

789
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,380
You're not a man.

790
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
Don't move.

791
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,380
It hurts.

792
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,380
Throw it away.

793
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
How many balls did you say?

794
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,380
We played three balls yesterday.

795
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
We had three plus five.

796
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
We were in a hurry.

797
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
We didn't get one.

798
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,380
Yes.

799
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,380
We didn't get one.

800
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,380
Let's play.

801
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,380
The Chinese sword is for my wife.

802
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
Good.

803
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,380
The Chinese sword is for my wife.

804
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
Are you okay?

805
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,380
My feet are numb.

806
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
I can't get rid of my feet.

807
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
You're still alive.

808
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,380
I can't get rid of my feet.

809
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,380
You're still alive.

810
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,380
You're a man.

811
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,380
Come here.

812
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,380
I see two police officers in the office.

813
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
They're talking to the police.

814
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
Police?

815
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,380
What's the police doing with the red book?

816
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,380
I don't know.

817
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
It's nothing good.

818
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
I've always thought that he's got a problem.

819
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,380
He's so bad at studying.

820
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,380
He's a good student.

821
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Yes.

822
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
I'm better than you at studying.

823
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Your mom is involved in the transmission of crimes.

824
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,380
If you have any news, tell us.

825
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,380
Do you know the problem?

826
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380
There couldn't be any stranger.

827
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,380
The clue is obvious.

828
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,380
S breve.

829
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
Not sure about it.

830
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,880
Anything.

831
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,380
Whichunal?

832
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,100
You're crying all day.

833
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,980
You're so tired.

834
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,060
Shut up.

835
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,140
Just leave it alone.

836
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,500
Is there anyone who can help?

837
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,700
What's the use?

838
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,420
Someone is strong when they support you.

839
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,980
I'm a classmate,

840
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,420
but I don't like to steal people.

841
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,820
Exactly.

842
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,020
Let's just say we don't care about her.

843
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,180
What's wrong with you?

844
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,860
Just learn.

845
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,540
No.

846
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,580
Family education.

847
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,420
Exactly.

848
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,180
Family education.

849
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,900
Exactly.

850
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,100
Your mom...

851
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,300
She's really a victim.

852
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,260
What are you doing?

853
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,540
What's up?

854
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,420
What are you doing?

855
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,700
Your mother-in-law.

856
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,660
What are you doing?

857
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,780
You're sick.

858
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,700
You're sick, aren't you?

859
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
What's wrong with you, Xiling?

860
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,460
You're sick today.

861
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,580
Xiling.

862
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,700
You're sick today.

863
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,500
Xiling.

864
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
Xiling, you're sick.

865
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,180
Come here and have some water.

866
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,420
You're looking for death?

867
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,100
Enough.

868
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,180
Forget it.

869
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,860
Sit.

870
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,700
Just eat the fat on your head add on.

871
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,060
I kneel down and be thanked for it.

872
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,500
Sit.

873
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,700
Are you getting some까요 to the hospital?

874
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,940
And...

875
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,860
Outskirts and everything.

876
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,100
Just say you can take care of yourself.

877
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,780
I've invited you to the hospital.

878
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,500
And...

879
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,820
I'm wondering what's so wrong with you.

880
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,060
What are you doing here?

881
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
I've been waiting for you to come home.

882
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,060
I'll go back with you and have a look.

883
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,060
No need.

884
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,060
I'm just in a normal house. What are you afraid of?

885
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
Let's not talk about this.

886
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,060
The last time I told you about the math contest,

887
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,060
do you still want to go?

888
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
Can I still go?

889
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Even though you're not willing to join the contest,

890
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,060
you've won the prize.

891
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Compared with other classmates, you have a advantage.

892
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,060
This year's second year, Ming'e is the only one.

893
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,060
If you want to go, I'll fight for you.

894
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,060
I want to...

895
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060
You should prepare well.

896
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,060
There's only one month left.

897
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060
I'll go back first.

898
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060
Wait, wait, wait.

899
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,060
I haven't finished yet.

900
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,060
What are you looking for?

901
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,060
The contest is getting a prize.

902
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,060
If you have the opportunity to give it away,

903
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,060
it's all a joke.

904
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,060
This opportunity is always good.

905
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,060
I mean it.

906
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
Do you understand?

907
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,060
As long as you believe that I'm doing this for you,

908
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,060
the rest of you will have to rely on you.

909
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

910
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,060
It's not easy for you to say thank you to the two of you.

911
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,060
I thank you.

912
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,060
Go.

913
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,060
The First Day of the Contest

914
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
Wang Li!

915
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,060
Wang Li!

916
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
I have something to tell you.

917
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,060
What is it?

918
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,060
I'm going home.

919
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
I'm not going home.

920
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,060
I've made an appointment to stay home.

921
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Okay.

922
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,060
Go back to your seat.

923
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Don't wait for me.

924
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,060
The First Day of the Contest

925
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
Wang Li!

926
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,060
Wang Li!

927
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,060
Wang Li!

928
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,060
Come here.

929
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,060
Come here.

930
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,060
Come here.

931
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,060
Are you really not cold?

932
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,060
I'm not cold.

933
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,060
I see that you're cold.

934
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,060
I see that your scarf is not warm either.

935
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm used to it.

936
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,060
You don't want to ask me

937
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,060
why?

938
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,060
Why?

939
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,060
Because I don't care.

940
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,060
Because

941
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,060
it's not your fault.

942
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,060
Then will you care about it yourself?

943
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,060
I'm just

944
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,060
your father.

945
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,060
It doesn't matter

946
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,060
whether you care about it or not.

947
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,060
You will never

948
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,060
change the way others view you.

949
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
If the world is not good to you,

950
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,060
you can bear it.

951
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,060
You can fight back if you can't.

952
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,060
But you can't admit defeat.

953
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,060
You can't lose pride.

954
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Anything can be taken away by others.

955
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Except for the pride.

956
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,060
So

957
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,060
if something happens again,

958
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,060
don't cry.

959
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,060
If you cry,

960
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,060
they will win.

961
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,060
You can't let them win.

962
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,060
Okay.

963
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,060
I'll listen to you.

964
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,060
I won't cry anymore.

965
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,060
You can't let them win.

966
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,060
Forget it.

967
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,060
Here you are.

968
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,060
It's delicious.

969
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,060
Don't cry anymore.

970
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,060
Smile.

971
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,060
Super Junior is going to win.

972
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,060

973
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,060

Where is Hong?

976
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,060

00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,860
or did you catch the murderer?

981
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,940
I thought I was dreaming.

982
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,900
Brother Liu, I remember many years ago,

983
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,740
it seems that the murder happened.

984
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,420
I got the newspaper.

985
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,020
Yes.

986
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,700
I was still in the middle of the trip.

987
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,220
Really?

988
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,300
When did you come?

989
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,180
One year ago.

990
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,980
Ten years ago.

We just finished taking a shower and what now?

Hurry up, density of the commune.

Sister, don't lift mother, let mother understand you.

I'll call Ahhh, on your behalf.

Okay, you are not afraid.

Comming in dizzy on myself

1050
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,760
I adapted to the candy-over marriages

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,460
Oh oh oh oh

Your expression is more than a friend's love

1079
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,260
The strange smell of the window

1080
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,260
The sweet color

Look at my little turtle

My mood is like a river

Please throw away the strange smell of the unique

1086
