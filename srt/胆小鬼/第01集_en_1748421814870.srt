You can't buy the ticket like the staff.

You can't read it.

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,440
Do you want the book of the Year?

92
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,240
No.

93
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Then can you help me?

94
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
No.

96
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Someone's calling me.

97
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
I can't read it.

98
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,840
I can't read it.

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,640
It's okay.

100
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
Just make two mistakes.

101
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
It's all his fault.

102
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
The first book of the Year.

103
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,040
The first book of the Year.

104
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
The first book of the Year.

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
The Second Book of the Year.

106
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,640
The English translation of the first book is about the others.

107
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,240
There was a gunfight at the breakfast scene today.

108
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
They died.

109
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,240
She went down the rooméntel.

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,840

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,840
Really.

112
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Really big.

113
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
I heard the English translation before.

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,240
Gunfight.

115
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
Am I a kid?

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Let me see what you know.

117
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
Let me see.

118
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,840
Can Graphics inważneness stand on such a coincidence?

119
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,360
I can exchange your room.

120
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Why don't you come back every time?

121
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,840
You're asking about the money.

122
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,160
I'm not asking.

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,760
There's a reason.

124
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,320
By the way, don't write to me anymore.

125
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll tell you the truth.

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,560
My mom is so noisy.

127
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Really, Wang Jie, there's a reason.

128
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,560
Feng Xueqiao.

129
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,840
It's late. You're still chatting.

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,760
Go to my office in the afternoon.

131
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,080
Wang Jie, you have Feng Le and you.

132
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,040
Director Shen.

133
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,840
Okay.

134
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,200
Fang Liu, read it here.

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,000
There's a reason.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,760
There's no reason.

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
There's a reason to exchange.

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
There's a reason to be a lawyer.

139
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,800
There's a reason to be a lawyer.

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
There's a reason to be a lawyer.

141
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
I was just passing by.

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
There's a cop.

143
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
He's wearing a girl's uniform.

144
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,560
Do you know him?

145
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,640
I don't know him.

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,600
He's wearing a uniform.

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,080
I've never seen him in school.

148
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,800
Why is he wearing a police uniform?

149
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,520
He's a cop.

150
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
His dad doesn't like police.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,440
He doesn't look like his dad.

152
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,720
You look like your dad.

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
Why not?

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Let's go to the office.

155
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
I'll look for him later.

156
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,320
What's going on?

157
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,760
Let me tell you.

158
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,400
This is our classmate.

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Today's new classmate.

160
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,120
He's a senior and a junior.

161
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,040
We're here to help each other.

162
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
Let's welcome him.

163
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,480
Let me introduce myself.

164
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,280
My name is Huang Shu.

165
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
So pretty.

166
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
What's wrong?

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Which book is this?

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,440
A girl's house and a pig's house.

169
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
What a nice name.

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,240
You have a high rank.

171
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,800
Sit here.

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Put your hands down.

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Let me see.

174
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,280
Sit.

175
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
Sit.

176
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
Put your hands down.

177
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,160
You're a senior.

178
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,840
You have a high rank.

179
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Sit on the last row.

180
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Sit next to him.

181
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,800
We'll adjust it if it doesn't suit you.

182
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
So nice.

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm a student.

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
Did you smell it?

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,920
Did you smell it?

186
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,440
What?

187
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,520
It's like a perfume.

188
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,160
It's like a nose.

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,040
Calm down.

190
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,160
This is...

191
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
This is a new classmate's book.

192
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Who remembers the most famous sentence?

193
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,760
It's about the teacher with a book.

194
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,760
Which sentence?

195
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
The teacher's back-end girl.

196
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
The so-called girl-like book.

197
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
It's a beautiful girl.

198
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
She uses this book.

199
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
It's beautiful.

200
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
It's beautiful.

201
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Let me see.

202
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
What are you doing?

203
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
It's not good to have a little aunt in a nutrition circle.

204
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
You have to eat more.

205
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,520
What nutrition circle?

206
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,920
This white little classmate is called a nutrition circle.

207
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
The better the nutrition, the bigger the classmate.

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
Look at me.

209
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,800
Who said that?

210
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,720
The teacher said it.

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,520
Science.

212
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,600
Science is about the kind of person.

213
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,920
Which kind of person?

214
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,320
The kind that's the best.

215
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,120
You're the best, okay?

216
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
You're too hurt.

217
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,400
You're so arrogant.

218
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm sorry that I didn't hit you.

219
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I didn't hit them.

220
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,520
Don't eat instant noodles every day.

221
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,920
Don't eat this.

222
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,720
I bought it for free.

223
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,120
My mom didn't buy it for me.

224
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
I can only buy it from the food card.

225
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,520
Don't eat this.

226
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,920
This is a long-term year.

227
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
What are you talking about?

228
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,520
Really.

229
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
You asked me to eat it.

230
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,480
Have breakfast.

231
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,960
Have you eaten breakfast?

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,520
The year is not a time to be separated.

233
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,360
You love food, don't you?

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,960
Please.

235
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,920
You eat more.

236
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
You can take care of yourself.

237
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
You're too old.

238
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
Do you want it?

239
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Go.

240
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Go.

241
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Go.

242
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Go.

243
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Go.

244
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Go.

245
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Go.

246
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Go.

247
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Go.

248
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Go.

249
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Go.

250
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Go.

251
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Go.

252
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Go.

253
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Go.

254
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Go.

255
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Go.

256
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
I heard that

257
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Uncle Huang is a dancer.

258
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
He was a businessman.

259
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
You're a dancer?

260
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
It's aunt Qi.

261
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
You just watch the door.

262
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
It's delicious.

263
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
And the police came this morning.

264
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Not his dad.

265
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Don't you two

266
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
eat the pig's feet?

267
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Eat it quickly.

268
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
The old man is waiting in the office.

269
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
How did Hong Fei

270
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
come to the hospital

271
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
like this?

272
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
He came in the second door.

273
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
His dad is the boss.

274
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
He's paid for the school uniform.

275
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
How do you know?

276
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm the squad leader.

277
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
I'm the squad leader.

278
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
I don't know anything.

279
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
What are you doing

280
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
as the squad leader?

281
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Guang Di.

282
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
When will you

283
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
come with me to practice?

284
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Wang Xiaobin.

285
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Tomorrow is the day before yesterday.

286
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
It's not the day after tomorrow.

287
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Go find someone else.

288
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
What's wrong with you?

289
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Didn't you say it well?

290
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
You asked me to go to the class.

291
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
What? How do I know?

292
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Guang Di, don't say anything.

293
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
You can borrow me

294
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
for a month.

295
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Jiang, you're sick.

296
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
What's your name?

297
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
You're so stubborn.

298
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
You're going to eat it.

299
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,760
About two months.

300
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
There's a man.

301
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
He looks like

302
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
he's in the lower 40s.

303
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
He's driving a car

304
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
in front of us.

305
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I've been waiting

306
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
for him for a long time.

307
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
He's driving at 7 p.m.

308
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
There's no one

309
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
in front of us.

310
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
He's driving a car

311
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
in front of us.

312
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
He's driving left and right.

313
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Sometimes he's driving

314
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
in the middle of the street.

315
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I've run into the problem.

316
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
But it seems

317
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
there are

318
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
the few days

319
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
that he shared my thoughts.

320
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I thought it was not right.

321
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I did my best

322
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
to perceive him in person.

323
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I'll go in.

324
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,520
Knock on the Durian Closet

325
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
sitting in the lawn.

326
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,760
This is B.

327
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,760
His clothes are embroidered at that boy'sふ.

328
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
He must've met

329
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
one of them.

330
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,560
Yes, it should.

331
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Guo Jie.

332
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
You...you...you...

333
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Continue.

334
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Guo Jie.

335
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,960
How is the specific situation of this case?

336
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,760
The most used case is the 250-410.

337
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,360
The total salary of the four-month contract is

338
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
120 million yuan.

339
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,160
The contract with the previous Nantata,

340
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
and the white tower of the 96th year,

341
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,760
are all vehicles used by the taxi drivers.

342
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,360
I suspect it's the same person.

343
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Go back to the house!

344
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,160
Go back to the house!

345
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,360
Stop!

346
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
Stop!

347
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,760
Stop!

348
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
Stop!

349
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,960
Stop!

350
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Stop!

351
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,360
You're still going?

352
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
Did you spend hundreds of dollars on the big board?

353
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,960
I didn't do well.

354
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
Who are you messing with?

355
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
I just fell.

356
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,960
It's just fine, Wang Di.

357
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
This is my ball.

358
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,560
You love playing but don't play.

359
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
What's wrong?

360
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,560
Wang Di!

361
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,760
Stop messing with him.

362
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,960
Let's play.

363
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,360
Let's play.

364
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
It's fine.

365
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Let's play next time.

366
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,560
You're close to a fool.

367
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,760
He's not a fool.

368
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
You're a fool.

369
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
If I had a ball,

370
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
you'd play with those fools.

371
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
How much is a ball worth?

372
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm sure.

373
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
Okay, I'll buy it.

374
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
I'll pay you 70 or 80 yuan.

375
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
What's wrong?

376
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,560
My stomach hurts.

377
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
I've had enough.

378
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I'm a little bit tired.

379
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,360
No, hurry up.

380
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Pay me.

381
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,960
Give me more.

382
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
No.

383
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,760
I told you to get more.

384
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
Who knows you're so useless?

385
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Our new girl is called Uncle Hong.

386
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,560
I heard she's been transferred from a school.

387
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,360
She's not a good student.

388
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes.

389
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,560
If she's transferred from a school,

390
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
she can transfer to our kindergarten.

391
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
Do you need to ask?

392
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,960
She must be from the back door.

393
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,360
And I heard

394
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,560
her mom is not in a good mood.

395
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
What do you mean?

396
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
She's ill.

397
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
I don't know.

398
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,360
She's not normal anyway.

399
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,760
Hurry up.

400
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Hurry up.

401
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,760
Wait for me.

402
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
What did you tell them?

403
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I didn't.

404
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,880
I told them to get out.

405
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Don't come out.

406
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,360
They're still coming.

407
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,260
Stop.

408
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,360
Stop.

409
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Stop.

410
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
I said jump.

411
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Just jump.

412
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm sorry.

413
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,280
You may Commercial Be ef first.

414
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,000
Very sorry.

415
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,520
It's gone.

416
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
It's gone.

417
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,120
I thought we didn't know that Feng Yunzhi is gone.

418
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,080
You are crazy.

419
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,640
You sent in me.

420
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
What are you doing?

421
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,360
This Feng Xiaoqiao is too cruel to Xia Hou.

422
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Who told you to talk? I think you did it on purpose.

423
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:49,360
All day long, at school

424
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,860
It hurts.

425
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,360
Why are you always cleaning?

426
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,660
I just came

427
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,640
quantum

428
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,360
You know

429
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,360
what

430
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,360
He does中国

431
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,960
Okay, I'll wear it if you dare to fall.

432
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,920
Look at that

433
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,760
do you have a magnet in the classroom?

434
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,560
Yes.

435
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,760
What?

436
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,160
We're little ghosts.

437
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,760
We're little ghosts.

438
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,560
Come on, let's shake hands.

439
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
Look at that

440
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,360
do you have a magnet in the classroom?

441
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,060
Little ghosts, come on.

442
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,560
Shake hands.

443
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,360
Your coffee

444
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,260
feels like I'm listening to it.

445
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,560
The music I love to collect

446
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,460
is very beautiful.

447
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,760
You're so special

448
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,160
in every little detail.

449
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,260
Aiya, iya, iya.

450
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,560
Such a contrast.

451
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm afraid of wasting

452
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
the past of emotion

453
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I hate myself

454
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
I think of you

455
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
carefully

456
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I hate it

457
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,360
I'm afraid of losing my tears

458
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Aiya, iya, iya.

459
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,360
You're so special in every little detail.

460
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
I like to see you

461
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,560
quietly

462
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,360
holding my little ghost.

463
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
Aiya, iya.

464
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Do you know

465
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
what's the impact?

466
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You can't afford it.

467
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Aiya, iya, iya.

468
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Are you crazy?

469
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
You're so weak.

470
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
How can you kill me?

471
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
I'm afraid of losing my tears.

472
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
I hate myself.

473
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
I hate myself.

474
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
I hate myself.

478
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
I hate myself.

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360

00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
I hate myself.

482
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
I hate myself.

483
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
I hate myself.

484
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
I hate myself.

485
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
I hate myself.

486
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
16.2 yuan.

487
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
16.2 yuan.

488
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
16 yuan.

489
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Do you want anything else?

490
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Anything else?

491
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Or do you want one?

492
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
If it's for others,

493
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
I'll tell you.

494
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
I love to sell it.

495
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
I'll buy one every time.

496
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Oh, my god.

497
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360

Sorry.

566
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Hello.

567
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I want a cup of cola and a cup of beer.

568
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Ordering a meal would be more suitable. I also bring a towel.

569
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Then let's order a meal.

570
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Do you want a bag?

571
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Eat here.

572
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Okay, wait a minute.

573
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Thank you.

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
You've been in a long relationship.

577
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
You're like a normal person.

578
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
We're just friends.

579
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
When did you come back?

580
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
A few days ago.

581
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
I can't sleep at 12.

582
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Why did you run away at home at night?

583
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,360
My dad is in the hospital in the morning.

584
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I came to the bed.

585
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
What's wrong with Uncle?

586
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
I also love him.

587
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
I stayed in the hospital last week.

588
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
How could it be?

589
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
The doctor said he could find it early.

590
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
But...

591
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm not sure what happened.

592
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
I...

593
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
I don't sleep.

594
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
How are you feeling?

595
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I'm fine.

596
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm not bad.

597
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Hong Juexiao.

598
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
You've been in a relationship with no one for so many years.

599
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
You never come to my school.

600
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
We've been in a relationship with you.

601
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
We've met each other.

602
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Have you ever met a lover?

603
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
No.

604
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
For ten years,

605
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
you've never thought of meeting me.

606
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
No.

607
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Why?

608
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
I don't want to.

609
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
I don't know why.

610
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Wang Di.

611
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Have you ever liked me?

612
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
I love you.

613
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
What's this?

614
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
It's a different blue iron.

615
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
It smells like a different color.

616
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
It doesn't have a ring.

617
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
It's so pretty.

618
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I love you.

619
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
I love you.

620
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,360
I've already sold my car.

621
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Sold it?

622
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
When did you sell it?

623
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
It should be...

624
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
It should be September.

625
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Who did you sell it to?

626
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
I don't know.

627
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Why didn't you sell it?

628
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
It's true.

629
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
I posted an ad on the market.

630
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
A man sent me a message

631
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
and asked me to drive over to find it.

632
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Is the car's name on the car?

633
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Yes.

634
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I sold it together with the car.

635
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
I've sold it.

636
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
I've sold it for 2,000 yuan.

637
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
I've lost it here.

638
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Where did he ask you to meet?

639
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Right.

640
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
It's a five-day exam.

641
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
We've investigated.

642
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,360
He has a partner in this room.

643
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
He can come.

644
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
He can't come.

645
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
It's too late.

646
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
He can't come out.

647
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Wait.

648
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
The lady just called.

649
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
She's so noisy.

650
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Can't she be in a hurry?

651
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
She's in a hurry.

652
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
I know.

653
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
I know.

654
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
I've got a message for you.

655
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Brother, you're here.

656
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
You're alone today?

657
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
I've never seen you before.

658
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
I've got a new one.

659
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Where's Wei Yang?

660
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Where's Li Wen?

661
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
He's inside.

662
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Where's Wei Yang?

663
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
He's inside.

664
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
He's inside.

665
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Wei Yang.

666
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
Get out of the way.

667
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Get out of the way.

668
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Don't move.

669
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Keep your voice down.

670
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Keep your voice down.

671
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
The first question.

672
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,360
The height of the long stick is 25, 4637.

673
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
The second question.

674
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
H is equal to Y,

675
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
which is equal to 74.

676
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
What about the third one?

677
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,360
The speed of the retreat is 1.5 times the speed of the climb.

678
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
So the house won't be covered.

679
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
You're so crazy.

680
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
I can remember it even when I look at it.

681
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
It's not a new one.

682
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
It's simple.

683
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
It's a new one.

684
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
It's a new one.

685
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
It's a new one.

686
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
It's a new one.

687
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
It's a new one.

688
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
It's a new one.

689
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
It's a new one.

690
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
It's a new one.

691
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
It's like a calculator.

692
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
It's simple.

693
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Are you acting like I'm acting?

694
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Move your mouth.

695
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Even got my reason.

696
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
You even bought it?

697
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
There is a chain!

698
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
I bought every books from taverns.

699
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
They look so weird.

700
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Mud übrigens.

701
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Can you please vitamins but books?

702
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
电 but poem's important thing.

703
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
It's talks about literature.

704
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
This is a topic.

705
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,240
What's wrong?

706
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,080
You're so good at writing.

707
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,600
Don't move.

708
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Maybe you're talented.

709
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,840
I can't be like that.

710
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,400
Why do you have a bone in your head?

711
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
What bone?

712
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
My brother didn't hug me when I was a kid.

713
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,760
He was a big bag.

714
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,520
Your bag is really small.

715
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,680
All right, it's done.

716
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,160
Come on, come on.

717
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,000
Here's your milk.

718
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,720
Just one bag.

719
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,880
You two share it.

720
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,480
I've had it this morning.

721
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,320
Drink more.

722
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,400
You're getting better.

723
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,120
You're done?

724
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,800
Yes.

725
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,200
How is it?

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,640
Look.

727
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
What's wrong with the back?

728
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
It's pretty good.

729
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
All right.

730
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,600
Men should be short-tempered and energetic.

731
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,640
They should be beautiful.

732
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,800
I'll pack the first one.

733
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,840
Don't grow up.

734
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,480
After drinking the milk,

735
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,520
go home and sleep.

736
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,160
All right, auntie.

737
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,920
Do you feel better?

738
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,360
All right.

739
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,080
What's wrong?

740
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Are you having a headache?

741
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,360
What's wrong with your brain?

742
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,280
I told you to go to the hospital.

743
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,080
You didn't look at it.

744
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,920
I went there myself.

745
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,920
When did you go there?

746
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,760
I don't know.

747
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
Do you see any problems?

748
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
The water is not balanced.

749
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,720
What?

750
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,720
Your brain is in water?

751
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,200
Your brain is in water.

752
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,160
What's the problem?

753
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,520
Little problem.

754
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,200
I've prescribed some medicine.

755
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
I'll try it for half a year.

756
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,880
You're just a lack of exercise.

757
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,920
You won't play with me.

758
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,000
Did you take the medicine today?

759
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,120
No.

760
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,040
Hurry up.

761
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,880
Go home and take the medicine.

762
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm leaving.

763
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,480
Wait for me.

764
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,400
Put this on the top.

765
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,320
Let my mom see.

766
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,480
Aunt, I'm going to pee.

767
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,760
