00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800
What's the matter?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,000
We've been in the police station.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, we're in the police station.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When did you find out?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Just now.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Someone was looking outside.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I saw it.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Enough.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are you looking at?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Light.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's all light.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What light?

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How many people are there?

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What kind of face?

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's crazy.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How many years have it been since this light was turned on?

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A'Yi,

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
are you living in this building?

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, I've been there.

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This place is normal.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Who lives here?

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then let's go home.

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's so cold.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's okay.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Enough.

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's go home.

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Brother.

30
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Where are the reporters?

31
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're gone.

32
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Which newspaper?

33
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know.

34
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Where's Cao Meng?

35
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He went upstairs with his parents.

36
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There's a piece of paper.

37
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It can't be library.

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go to selecting,

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,140
Go up.

40
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,000
Sister-in-law.

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Could you take it for me?

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Next time.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come my sister-in-law.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Director Plus,

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as you can predict,

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
they will find out about this place.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Are we going to bed?

48
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Look!

49
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yong,

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
when are you going?

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,560
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,160
Go back.

53
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,560
When did you get here?

54
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,560
Mr. Kong.

55
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,920
This is Zhang.

56
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,160
He found out about the body.

57
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,280
He went back to make a report.

58
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
He told you the exact situation.

59
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,160
Go back.

60
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,160
My mom is sick today.

61
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,760
I'll come back to see her.

62
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,440
Don't come back tonight.

63
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
She's been hit by an old woman.

64
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm here.

65
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,560
Okay.

66
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,360
I'll go there.

67
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,440
Call me if you have anything.

68
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,560
Let's go inside, OK?

69
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,800
Wait a second Here we go.

70
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:26,160
The snow is soダIt's slaguety,

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
Drink some water today.

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Thank you.

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
How is it going?

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Please clear this up.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay.

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Brother.

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Zhang Quancai.

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Just call me Zhang.

80
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Sit down.

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Sit down.

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Okay.

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Brother.

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
You live in that building alone?

85
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I live alone in that building.

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Can you still live in that building?

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Yes.

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
I just go to the water myself.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
I get a little bit spicy at night.

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
I've been living here for eight years.

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Other people have left.

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Why don't you leave?

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Just to make more money.

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
What else can I do?

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Mr. Zhang.

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
When did you find out the time?

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
More than six o'clock.

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
It's dark.

99
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
That big pit.

100
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
The building in the distance.

101
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Why did you go there?

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I went to pick up some stones.

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
To dig up the sand.

104
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
After you found out, you moved a stone.

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Who saw that?

106
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
I was scared to death.

107
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
I found out, I was done.

108
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Brother.

109
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I thought about it.

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Why didn't the murderer hide the stone in the room?

111
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
If he was lucky, he wouldn't have found it in a year and a half.

112
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Why did he go to this yard?

113
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
If he was in the first place,

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
he wouldn't be in this building anymore.

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Let's assume that the wall and the murderer

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
were all in the yard.

117
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
In the process of being a victim,

118
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
there must be a scream.

119
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
But I asked all the staff

120
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
if there was any sound.

121
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
There is a possibility that

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
the murderer was stolen here

123
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
after the person died.

124
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,160
So what you mean is

125
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,760
that the building and the yard

126
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
were not the same.

127
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
You just think about it.

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Recently,

129
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,160
did you see any suspicious people

130
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
in the building?

131
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
No one lives in our building.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
There are some criminals

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,360
who went in and out.

134
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Some people are still in the house.

135
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
They are all suspicious.

136
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
I saw it.

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
I saw it.

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
What are you looking at?

139
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,960
I saw it.

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,360
It's all over.

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Two years ago,

142
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
two crazy people fell from the train.

143
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Then, this thing became more and more popular.

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Some young people

145
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
came to this place

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
to explore and practice.

147
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
This building is called the Gui Yu House.

148
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
The biggest problem is

149
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
the body.

150
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
They didn't wear clothes.

151
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
And

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
they didn't even notice the scene.

153
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
The ordinary people

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,560
took the evidence of the murderer

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,960
and took the murderer

156
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
with them in the clothes.

157
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,960
The spirit can't think so well.

158
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
The ghost is here.

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
The ghost is here.

160
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
The ghost is here.

161
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
The ghost is here.

162
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
The ghost is here.

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
The ghost is here.

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
The ghost is here.

165
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
The ghost is here.

166
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
The ghost is here.

167
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
The ghost is here.

168
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
The ghost is here.

169
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
The ghost is here.

170
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,960
The ghost is here.

171
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
The ghost is here.

172
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
The ghost is here.

173
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
The ghost is here.

174
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,560
The ghost is here.

175
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,960
The crucial part of the F�l3 is

176
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
The body is hidden there.

177
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
But I don't know why.

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
I want to wait for the head to deal with it.

179
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,840
But I haven't waited for him to...

180
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,040
You found out that it's the old Zhang?

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,840
Yes.

182
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
Brother, you're so interesting.

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
It's really old Jiang.

184
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,880
Don't take pictures.

185
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
We'll talk when the time comes.

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,880
Yes.

187
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,360
Brother.

188
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Deng Yan,

189
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
do you know how to make a new phone?

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,160
Come on.

191
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,720
Give it to me.

192
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,680
Give me the old phone.

193
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,240
You can't touch it.

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,040
Give it to me.

195
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,080
Give it to me.

196
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
Why doesn't it really smell like brandy?

197
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
Look around here today,

198
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,760
what matters to you is your relationship right.

199
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Brother,

200
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,680
Are you thinking about Jiaojiao?

201
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Jiaojiao has a sister-in-law in Hangzhou.

202
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
What are you thinking about?

203
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
You understand when you have a child.

204
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,440
Especially your daughter.

205
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,440
If you really think about it,

206
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,880
call her.

207
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,000
Forget it.

208
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,560
I might be asleep now.

209
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,280
I'll talk to her tomorrow morning.

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Look at you.

211
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
You're so tired.

212
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,080
I don't know if you're a cop

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,480
or a father.

214
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm here for you.

215
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,520
Turn off the lights and go to sleep.

216
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
You little brat.

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
You're three years old.

218
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,360
It's actually very simple.

219
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,320
One X, one Y.

220
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
Two drops.

221
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,720
Unscrew one first.

222
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
Then remove the other one.

223
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,280
Do you understand?

224
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,800
How did you get this number?

225
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
I still don't know it.

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
Am I too stupid?

227
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,120
Don't worry.

228
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,560
Think about it yourself.

229
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
Then I'll tell you.

230
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,880
약간

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,360
You headache again?

232
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Wait...

233
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,860
Hey!

234
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,680
For the betterment of thema's family photo!

235
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,800
We're done!

236
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,000
We're done!

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,640
We're done!

238
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,360
Is it comfortable?

239
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Is it comfortable?

240
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,640
I'm asking you.

241
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,960
Is it comfortable?

242
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,800
Just listen.

243
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,320
Wu Weizhi,

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,800
he's your partner.

245
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,920
If it's me, I can't take it.

246
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
Get up.

247
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,600
Another one.

248
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,520
Get up.

249
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,600
Get up.

250
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm telling you.

251
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm telling you. Get up.

252
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
Get up.

253
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
Look after each other.

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,920
What times the moon seems so dim

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,920
in the old days.

256
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
보다 Pole的人.

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
There was a puzzle at last.

258
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,920
But you guys,

259
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
there hasn't been any pose choreography

260
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
on the previous video.

261
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
And sometimes even

262
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,140
even on

263
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,520
me

264
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Isn't it?

265
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,160
I guess that'sılı.

266
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,000
You got surprised?

267
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,480
Isn't that a little interesting?

268
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,280
I'm not hungry.

269
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
You're too bullying me.

270
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm not going to let anyone else take care of me.

271
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
What are you talking about?

272
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,680
I'm not talking about you.

273
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
You're killing your son!

274
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
You're a girl who's dead!

275
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
You...

276
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
I...

277
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Get up!

278
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,880
Get up!

279
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
Where are you going?

280
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,880
Get up!

281
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
Don't touch me!

282
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Don't touch me!

283
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm going to kill you!

284
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Let go of me!

285
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Let go of me!

286
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Stop!

287
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Don't touch me!

288
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Don't touch me!

289
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Let go of me!

290
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Don't touch me!

291
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Let go of me!

292
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Qi Li!

293
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Don't!

294
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Wait for me!

295
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Don't hit me!

296
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Did you hit Mr. Guo?

297
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Don't hit me!

298
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Are you okay?

299
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I almost forgot to clean up.

300
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Mr. Guo?

301
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Uncle Heng, are you okay?

302
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Yes.

303
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Hurry and clean up.

304
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Don't catch a cold.

305
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Is it enough?

306
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Yes.

307
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,880
Although I don't want to be your suspect,

308
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,880
it depends on your grades.

309
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,180
Tell me, really.

310
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,860
Yeah.

311
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Just give me that case.

312
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,160
If we have to weerlet back in home.

313
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,420
You're done looking.

314
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,380
Why are you still like this?

315
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,620
You didn't even show up.

316
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,580
This is such a PC you can use.

317
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
Stop it!

318
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,980
I'm just staying at home with my parents.

319
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,580
I'll never dance again.

320
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,580
Your hair is so pretty.

321
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,580
Where did you buy it?

322
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,780
What do you like?

323
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,780
The collar.

324
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,780
For you.

325
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,580
I don't have a good look on the third floor.

326
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,580
Who said that?

327
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,180
It's not necessary.

328
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,980
You don't have a hair loss,

329
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
you don't have a high hair loss,

330
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
and you don't have a long hair.

331
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,980
I can't compare to you.

332
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,980
Xiaoyan, don't be so mean.

333
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,580
You've already squeezed a bun.

334
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,980
You're the one who squeezed the bun.

335
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,580
I'm just jealous of you.

336
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,580
Then I'm jealous of you.

337
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
You don't know how jealous I am.

338
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Wang Jin, are you not happy?

339
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,180
What are you afraid of?

340
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,580
I don't want to hit women.

341
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,180
I haven't found you yet.

342
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,780
She asked me to stay at school.

343
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,380
I can't think of anything else.

344
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,980
What should I do?

345
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,580
Let's start with the eight deaths.

346
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,580
I don't want to hear anything.

347
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,980
Who told you to do it?

348
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Who told you to do it?

349
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Even if you don't do it,

350
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
I can beat her.

351
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,380
You're still a boy.

352
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Which time did I not do it for you?

353
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm so tired.

354
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,580
You bought so much.

355
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Are you hungry?

356
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,580
I'm afraid that she's already dizzy.

357
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,380
Let's eat.

358
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,380
We're back.

359
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,780
Are you anxious?

360
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,180
I'm going to treat you to a meal today.

361
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,580
Didn't you go to buy a soup?

362
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,980
I've changed my mind.

363
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,180
I just want to treat you to a meal.

364
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,780
Do you have a lot of money?

365
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
I'm not good at it.

366
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,780
What are you looking at? Call me.

367
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
One person.

368
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,780
I have to call a big one.

369
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,980
I'm happy to have my best friend.

370
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,180
Go eat.

371
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,980
Come on.

372
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,380
He did it on purpose.

373
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,180
Is it because of the morning?

374
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,980
What's the matter?

375
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,580
A father.

376
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,780
Another father.

377
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,780
He can still cook together.

378
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
He's so good.

379
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,980
What's the first meal?

380
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm hungry.

381
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Is it good?

382
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
Slowly.

383
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,580
You two are still eating so little.

384
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,380
It's not good to eat when you're out.

385
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,180
Uncle Huang, I'll give you a few rice cakes.

386
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,180
Call me.

387
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,780
Thank you.

388
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,980
You're still saying thank you to me?

389
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,980
I just want to thank you.

390
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,380
Qin Li.

391
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,380
Wang Di.

392
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,380
Thank you.

393
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Jia Ru.

394
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
I can only be a heartless sinner.

395
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,580
I don't have a life.

396
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
If I can calm down one's sadness

397
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,780
or eliminate one's pain

398
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,580
or make a lost bird

399
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,380
return to his court,

400
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,780
I won't need this life.

401
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,780
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,780
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,780
You should be with Wang Di.

404
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
Don't be with me.

405
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,980
I'm afraid someone will find you trouble.

406
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
I don't want to.

407
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,180
Although Wu Kexhi is not a good person,

408
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,580
he's not a rogue either.

409
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,980
He's Wang Di.

410
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,180
He's been punished for this.

411
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,580
I don't think he's going to do it.

412
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,180
We've discussed it.

413
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
Mr. Fang can't take him so long.

414
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
He doesn't need to go.

415
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,980
I was the one who touched him first.

416
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I was tired.

417
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,580
And

418
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Hu Kexhi was wrong.

419
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,580
So I wrote the whole process down

420
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
and asked for the signature of the student.

421
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,180
And he said

422
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,780
the signature went into her heart.

423
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,820
May I use it?

424
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:39,180
No,

425
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,180
if it's up to you.

426
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,180
I'll train her together.

427
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,980
Don't leave me.

428
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,040
Ok

429
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,340
Stage

430
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,060
What do you want?

431
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,740
Apologize to me.

432
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,540
Damn it.

433
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,580
You still hit me?

434
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,740
What are you doing?

435
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,060
Of course you will come, Sun Hu.

436
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,420
Dad.

437
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,820
You're going to waste my time.

438
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,540
Why are you talking to them?

439
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,860
You're also a rogue.

440
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,500
I'll give you a hard time.

441
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,580
Wang Bin, please don't be so excited.

442
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,780
You're here to hurt me.

443
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,460
You're going to hurt me?

444
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,740
You're a rogue.

445
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,900
Calm down.

446
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,940
The doctor said

447
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,500
there should be nothing serious.

448
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,980
I think Wang Bin will wake up soon.

449
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,900
Why are you so honest?

450
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,500
My son is like Yu Ying.

451
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,340
He beat Liu Man.

452
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,500
Does he care about the school?

453
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,180
No, he doesn't.

454
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,260
Can he?

455
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,300
Let's talk about it slowly.

456
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,580
Is this a fight?

457
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,940
Mr. Chen.

458
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,020
Call the kids to the school

459
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,660
and take the iron bridge and head up.

460
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,620
Brother.

461
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,500
Sister-in-law.

462
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,100
I understand you two are angry.

463
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,660
You don't know

464
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,340
my sister's son is a rogue.

465
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,220
He's a rogue.

466
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,620
You're a rogue.

467
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,420
Go home and go home.

468
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,500
That's a joke.

469
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,780
Why are you acting like a man?

470
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,500
Brother.

471
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,620
You can't listen to me.

472
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,260
Let's go.

473
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,180
I asked.

474
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,820
It was your son

475
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,340
who beat my son in the school.

476
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,460
My son came to revenge for me.

477
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,860
You said it was wrong.

478
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,940
It's all wrong.

479
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,700
Right?

480
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,020
If you go back to school,

481
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,220
he won't be able to handle it.

482
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,940
Right?

483
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,580
What do you mean?

484
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,740
What do you mean?

485
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,580
Dad.

486
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,140
I don't mean anything else.

487
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,780
Brother.

488
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,380
As long as the kid is fine,

489
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,060
I'll pay you 5,000 yuan.

490
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,740
I'll be your compensation.

491
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,180
You're a buyer.

492
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,100
Why are you acting like a man?

493
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,020
It's my words.

494
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,180
Go down.

495
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
If you're not satisfied,

496
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,340
let's go to the school.

497
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,740
Tengbo.

498
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,940
You're talking nonsense.

499
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,300
You're acting like a man.

500
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,100
I just want to wait for you to leave.

501
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,540
What do you want me to use?

502
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,020
Are you going to be a buyer with me?

503
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,180
You can't just let it go.

504
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,780
As long as you can guarantee

505
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,180
that you won't bully me again,

506
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,980
I can give up.

507
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,580
Anyway, you don't need to care about it.

508
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,940
You're a kid.

509
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,660
Wang Di.

510
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:41,940
Here.

511
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,060
The medicine.

512
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,700
It's useful.

513
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Eat it.

514
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,220
Where's my dad?

515
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,860
He's gone.

516
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,300
Qinli.

517
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,380
Tell me.

518
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,580
Why did he fight?

519
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,500
He won't tell me.

520
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,700
Because...

521
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,940
Oh, my god.

522
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,100
Don't ask.

523
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,820
Some people are just pretending.

524
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,100
I should be the first.

525
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,060
I'm the first.

526
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,500
What are you trying to do?

527
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,700
You're sweating.

528
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,220
If your dad didn't do it because of you,

529
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,060
I'll tell you.

530
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,300
Don't say that.

531
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,540
I'm confused.

532
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,460
You two.

533
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,300
You two are getting more and more difficult to manage.

534
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,580
You're making me worry.

535
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,220
What's wrong?

536
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,340
Qinli is now a son.

537
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,260
You two were born one day.

538
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,700
I saw him grow up.

539
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,940
He's my son.

540
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,100
At least half of his son.

541
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,940
Right, Qinli?

542
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,300
Is it okay?

543
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
It's okay.

544
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,220
Yes.

545
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,940
If you want someone to ask you for a half of the sensible thing,

546
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,220
I can't be so worried.

547
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,340
Yes, you can't.

548
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,660
You're so naive.

549
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,620
I didn't mean to clean you up.

550
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,860
Okay, okay.

551
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,980
Take your medicine and lie down.

552
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,340
Don't touch him.

553
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,460
Qinli, you too.

554
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,500
Go home early.

555
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,340
Okay.

556
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,020
You watch him drink the water.

557
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,940
I'll go and get your dad.

558
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,820
Come on, drink the water.

559
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,420
Go away.

560
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,020
Don't move.

561
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,220
You're so ugly.

562
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,820
Ugly?

563
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,180
You're so ugly.

564
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,020
Come on.

565
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,660
This one.

566
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
This one.

567
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,300
One, two, three.

568
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,620
Please, Luo Yiyang.

569
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,220
Next, a decision is made.

570
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,820
The second round is not to be held.

571
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,420
The emperor is not to be held.

572
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,660
The reason is that the school has a lot of talk.

573
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,100
They fight each other.

574
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,300
They are not filial.

575
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
And they are the members of the society.

576
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,420
They fight each other.

577
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,020
They create a bloodshed.

578
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,220
They are so aggressive.

579
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,100
They create a very bad effect on my school's reputation.

580
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,820
They are educated on the basis of school skeleton.

581
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,940
These are people from the school.

582
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,420
The school Free Business Institute 먼저 decides.

583
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:58,820
She betrudes all of them.

584
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,140
More than one percent of students

585
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,460
will work hard on this.

586
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,980
It's our responsibility to get to this.

587
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,780
We may be allowed

588
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,220
to meet with theiratched disciples earlier.

589
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,660
You wok!

590
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,740
It's nothing.

591
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,500
Milli,

592
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,260
guys!

593
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,060
Our guests arrived.

594
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,340
Shit!

595
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,780
What are you these days?

596
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,700
Well…

597
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,180
Come have a look.

598
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,260
You are getting smaller.

599
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
I also feel unfair.

600
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,260
You can't tell me if it's fair or not.

601
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
Do you think I don't have to take responsibility for this?

602
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I've been talking about this for three months.

603
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
I thought you guys had beaten me up.

604
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
You still keep on chasing me.

605
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
If you come to this teacher, I'll treat you well.

606
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
Sit down.

607
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Don't move.

608
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,380
很好

609
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Don't move.

610
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Don't move.

611
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Just wait and listen.

612
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Ah

613
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,760
Almost

614
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,260
the Chinese interpretation one.

615
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,260
Hey

616
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Let's all take photos

617
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
Hey

618
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,880
No.

619
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,040
Sure

620
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
No

621
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,040
All right, arteries

622
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,360
Today we learn about airconditioning in the pigment in this white forest

623
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,080
And the solution of resonance

624
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,160
So, today, receptá sp maioria in the real Therefore

Preference of Nepal is using red clay

626
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,840
And under this condition

627
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:14,760
Cold clay will be made into white

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,580
And whitecture ponto micron olun

To fill the air in and to the east

634
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,540
The temperature of the hot water is higher than the temperature of the white rice.

635
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,340
So, in hot water, the white rice can be melted into liquid white rice.

636
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Now, put the hot water in the water and heat it up.

637
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,340
After heating up, add water to the hot water.

638
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,340
Watch out for the reaction.

639
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,340
It's okay.

640
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Teacher!

641
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Teacher!

642
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Hurry up, hurry up, take the water and cool it down.

643
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,340
You're back?

644
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,340
It's the last one yesterday. It's a pity that it's thrown away.

645
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
The new one is in the pot and is still boiling.

646
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Grandpa.

647
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
I didn't take care of you.

648
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Why are you so stubborn?

649
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Come on, slowly.

650
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Slowly, slowly.

651
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Hurry up.

652
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Slowly, slowly.

653
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Where did you fall?

654
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
Are you okay?

655
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,340
You're sick and you're going back to school.

656
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Wang Rui-jiao is asking you every day.

657
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
It's not easy to watch your father's TV at home.

658
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,340
I'm not going back.

659
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
Wang Di.

660
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
My brother might be coming back.

661
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
How long have you two not met?

662
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
I can't remember.

663
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,340
Maybe I can't recognize him.

664
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Your brother is quite nice.

665
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
There's more people at home.

666
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
He's better than you.

667
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Actually, I can do it myself.

668
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,340
I'm used to it.

669
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
You can pull it down. Don't be too smart.

670
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I'm riding a bike now.

671
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
It's faster than you.

672
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Really?

673
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
I don't believe it.

674
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,340
We'll go to the horse road to the toilet when you're done.

675
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Okay.

676
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
I'll let you do it.

677
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Don't push me.

678
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Qian Li, you can't do it.

679
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Hurry up.

680
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,340
Brother.

681
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340
Xiaoyang.

682
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Hurry up.

683
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,340
I'll beat you to death.

684
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,340
You're a red light.

685
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,340
You'll lose if you don't pay.

686
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Run.

687
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
You're the best.

688
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
Let's go.

689
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Don't run.

690
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
Wait.

691
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Don't run.

692
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
What are you running?

693
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Are you crazy?

694
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
Mr. Cai.

695
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,340
You're back.

696
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,340
You didn't tell me you'd come back.

697
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,340
I just saw you.

698
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Are you okay?

699
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
I'm fine.

700
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
I'm fine.

701
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,340
I don't see anything.

702
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,340
I'll let you go to the Olympics.

703
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Hurry up.

704
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Be careful.

705
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,340
Let's go.

706
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
I'll let you go.

707
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
I'm done.

708
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,340
I'm here again.

709
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,340
I'm done.

710
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
I'm done.

711
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
Someone's here.

712
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
Excuse me.

713
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,340
Someone's here.

714
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Where?

715
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
I didn't see anyone.

716
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Who?

717
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
Do you have to ask?

718
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
I can't control myself.

719
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,340
Why are you so quiet?

720
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Why are you so stupid?

721
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Who's stupid?

722
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
I'm done.

723
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm done.

724
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
I didn't write your name.

725
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Let's see who's here.

726
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Where's Wang Die?

727
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Come on.

728
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Come on.

729
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,340
You're back.

730
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
I'll put one on you.

731
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
No.

732
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
I'll put one on you.

733
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
You're so weird.

734
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
You're a little duck.

735
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Are you okay?

736
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
You're a little duck.

737
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
You're a little duck.

738
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
You've been sweating so much.

739
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
You've even opened your pants.

740
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
What?

741
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
I've even wiped your pants.

742
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Why are you so big?

743
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
You're so big.

744
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
You're so dirty.

745
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
You're just a bag.

746
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Stop it.

747
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
You're so dirty.

748
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,340
I'll put one on you.

749
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Does it hurt?

750
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
Don't.

751
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
I've been feeling bad for a few days.

752
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
Let me.

753
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
It's okay.

754
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,340
I know you're here today.

755
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
What's wrong?

756
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
You're sick again.

757
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Can't you come here?

758
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
The second one is the water.

759
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
Are you happy?

760
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
The third one.

761
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
The last one is good.

762
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Wait and see.

763
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Hold it.

764
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
You're dead.

765
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
You're dead.

766
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
You're dead.

767
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,340
Dear students.

768
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
Congratulations.

769
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,340
Welcome to the first round of the 2020

770
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,340
The first concert of the year.

771
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
The new year's dream

772
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
brought a new hope.

773
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
The new year's dream

774
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
came true.

775
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Are you nervous?

776
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Great.

777
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
If you win the first place again,

778
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
you'll be in trouble.

779
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Uncle Hao.

780
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Let's do this.

781
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Thank you.

782
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,340
Next, please give a big hand.

783
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
The seven families in the building

784
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
have four old people and three parents.

785
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
One of them has children.

786
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,340
They can be the main members.

787
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
The main members are the people who stay.

788
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
There's a second or third person.

789
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,340
There's nothing to ask.

790
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
You don't know anything.

791
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
It's not a simple thing.

792
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
It's a mental problem.

793
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
There's a guest in the house.

794
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
Do you see him?

795
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Which one?

796
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,340
The one with a lot of questions.

797
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I think he's suspicious.

798
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,340
If you're suspicious,

799
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,340
you can't bring him back.

800
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,340
You're so good at finding people.

801
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,340
What's so hard about finding a man?

802
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
I don't know.

803
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,340
You go and sweep the house.

804
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
I'll go with the team.

805
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Okay.

806
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I'll take care of you.

807
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,340
Okay.

808
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Has the report come out yet?

809
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
The situation is more complicated this time.

810
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
I'm alone.

811
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
The staff should be here soon.

812
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
Sorry, I'm late.

813
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,340
The five-year-old mother is alive and breathing.

814
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,340
56 families are in a new life.

815
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Today, the music of the music is playing.

816
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Today, the five-year-old mother is alive and breathing.

817
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,340
You see, the high-level spirit of the group is coming to us.

818
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,340
Please welcome the guest of the high-level competition.

819
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,340
The guest of the high-level competition.

820
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,340
The guest of the high-level competition.

821
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
The guest of the high-level competition.

822
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,340
The guest of the high-level competition.

823
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,340
The death time is 72 hours before the body was discovered.

824
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
The time is one hour before the death.

825
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,340
That is, from 1st of January, at 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

826
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,340
Through the visual inspection,

827
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,340
the dead body's mucus and entire skin

828
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
are not as red as before.

829
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
The body is dark, but not as red.

830
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
It can be taken as a move.

831
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
The wound on the right shoulder and the wound on the left shoulder

832
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
is caused by the force of the hook.

833
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,340
It is a miracle that the wound on the left shoulder is removed.

834
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Through the smoke, there are also blood on the left shoulder.

835
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,340
Blood is not only included in the blood of the dead body,

836
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
but also because of the blood of the man.

837
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
The wound on the chest and the wound on the lower part

838
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
is made up of the knife and knife.

839
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,340
The dead body is not in the shape of a sandpaper.

840
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
It is in the same direction.

841
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,340
The wound and hair on the back of the head

842
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
are found to be a little bit damaged.

843
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
The body is not found to be damaged.

844
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
The suspect is likely to be blind.

845
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,340
The body is not experienced in the sound,

846
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,340
but the dead body found a suspicious move.

847
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Because it is exposed to the sky for a long time,

848
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
it is not only the enemy.

849
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
But according to the dead body,

850
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,340
the smell of the breath of the mouth and the smell of the breath

851
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,340
is likely to be very serious.

852
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,340
Because of the smell of the breath,

853
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,340
after we enter the body,

854
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
the first step is to separate the body from the body.

855
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,340
The body is not very strong.

856
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
In addition,

857
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
the breath and the breath inside

858
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
are all mentioned in the same kind of small,

859
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
small, and dangerous way.

860
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
It is possible that it can't be removed,

861
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
but after we enter the body,

862
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
the breath and breath inside will be very serious.

863
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,340
Let's go!

864
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Let's go!

865
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
The body is not very strong.

866
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
The body is not very strong.

867
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
The body is not very strong.

868
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
The body is not very strong.

869
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
The body is not very strong.

870
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
The body is not very strong.

871
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
The body is not very strong.

872
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
The body is not very strong.

873
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
The body is not very strong.

874
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
The body is not very strong.

875
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
The body is not very strong.

876
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
The body is not very strong.

877
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,340
The body is not very strong.

878
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
The body is not very strong.

879
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:24,340
The body

880
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
I'm not afraid of you.

881
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,340
I'm not afraid of you.

882
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
I'm not afraid of you.

883
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm not afraid of you.

884
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm not afraid of you.

885
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm not afraid of you.

886
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I'm not afraid of you.

887
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
I'm not afraid of you.

888
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I'm not afraid of you.

889
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I'm not afraid of you.

890
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
I'm not afraid of you.

891
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,340
I'm not afraid of you.

892
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
I'm not afraid of you.

893
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
I'm not afraid of you.

894
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Next is you.

Not afraid of me.

896
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
I'm afraid of fading.

897
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Come on.

898
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
Let me see.

899
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Well.

900
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Can you take a terrorist attack?

901
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,540
You can't?

902
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,540
Sorry, brother.

903
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,740
Is this a threat?

904
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,040
Let's go.

905
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,340
My father is dying,

906
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,340
