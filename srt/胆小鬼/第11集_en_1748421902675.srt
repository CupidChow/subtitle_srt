Episode 1

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Xing Li, how did you get out of there?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Can't you see the light?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I have a fire station.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What fire station?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I made it myself.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I used a stool.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And a sandal.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very simple.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's everything in the school.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I made five or six sticks.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I got out of there in half.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh my god, you're so awesome.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Xing Li said there's a star in the air.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're a star-spangled man.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I believe in you, Xing Li.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're beautiful.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're the mirror of the star in the sky.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I want to see it.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to see it too.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Xing Li, why don't you take us down to see it?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're so beautiful.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You must be a man.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid of it.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll teach you.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't think so.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm afraid of the earth.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The more dark the place, the better the stars are.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You wrote that poem at the school.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You got the inspiration at the bottom.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You said you wouldn't dare to go down.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What do you mean?

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go down.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go down.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who's going to do it?

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You still have a bag.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's go.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Get me a bag.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Get me a bag.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I told you, the bag can connect to the cloud.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Right.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why don't I believe it?

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is the hole.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can get out of here.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Come.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Come on.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's fine.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll hold you.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll take you behind.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll take you behind.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll take you behind.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Come on.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's wrong?

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's so dark inside.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why are you still here?

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't use it last time.

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm still here.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What if we lose it?

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We're all here.

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's fine.

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're afraid of what?

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be careful.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't.

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm afraid of what?

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm afraid of what?

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm behind.

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hurry up.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm scared.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's so dark inside.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't be old.

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm scared.

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's wrong with you?

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's wrong?

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can't you see?

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't get in.

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm scared.

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't get in.

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's go.

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm scared.

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go.

85
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's go.

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tell me.

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why are you here?

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Jiaojiao, why don't you wait for us here?

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I'm alone.

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm afraid of you.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't have anyone here.

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why are you so busy?

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wang Di, why don't you stay with Jiaojiao?

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm begging you.

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's wrong with you?

96
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can you two go?

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't worry.

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We'll be back soon.

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Be careful.

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry.

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Boy or girl?

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who are you talking about?

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wang Di.

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're talking about...

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's wrong with you?

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm talking about you.

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm scared.

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't be angry.

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How can I go down next time?

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Next time?

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When?

112
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think it's spring.

113
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Where's your brother?

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's here.

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He's not here.

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you stupid?

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're a liar.

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I said we'll see him tonight.

119
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, just take a break.

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Who do you think we're talking about?

121
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not you.

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I used to be your brother.

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But now it's your brother.

124
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's in such a dark place.

125
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was scared to death last night.

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's you.

127
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You've been laughing at me.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What are you laughing at?

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Uncle.

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wang Di.

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's a star in there.

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I saw it.

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wang Di.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You server has dropped a woman.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who's in line with you?

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Be prepared.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let me go back.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Emperor Whyout

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Coo taxes

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong?

141
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Miss�

Shoot

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Don't move!

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,480
Don't fight!

147
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Fight!

148
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Don't fight!

149
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,180
I definitely will forget it.

150
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,040
Wake up!

151
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,240
When did you come?

152
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,920
Last night.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We got off the plane and Liu Ping called. What happened?

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You scared me.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The doctor said that Li Dong Mai was almost two meters away.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You really scared me this time. You really know that.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You didn't mean to.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was just trying to explain.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

We're talking about Xiaodeng.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Where are you going?

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You have a wound on your leg.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The doctor said you can't run. Where are you going?

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Tell me.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm going to see you.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't run.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can't run. Do you know?

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let me stay with you.

What a hurry.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,960
I've been cabin two years ago.

187
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Fine, get the cells cleaned

188
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,360

I doph excellently

196
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Why did you ask me to be office guy?

197
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,120
Are you ok , from where?

198
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,580

201
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,540
One year or two

202
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
How old are you?

203
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
25 years old.

204
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,540
You can't find a partner.

205
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Isn't that appropriate?

206
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,540
Well, Xiao Fa Yi is a student.

207
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
Are you also a student of Xing Jing?

208
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I'm a junior. I'm the first one.

209
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,540
Did you see them?

210
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,540
How do I see them?

211
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Wait.

212
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,540
I'm going to school.

213
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
I'll take you there.

214
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Just wait and see.

215
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,540
I'll go there.

216
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
I'm going to school.

217
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Shi Er.

218
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
You've never been in a relationship.

219
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Let's talk about it.

220
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Get lost!

221
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
It's the first time I've met a girl.

222
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
I'll take you there at midnight.

223
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Got it?

224
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I know you like this place.

225
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
I'm the main dancer.

226
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,540
Call a cab!

227
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,540
So can you tell me where are Wen Fei and hello earlier?

228
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,540
If you want to arrive in Xiao Fa Yi Village and play with me,

229
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,820
I can see where they are.

230
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,540
Xiao Yuan.

231
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
When I'm near you, where you will be.

232
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Xiao Jia is just here.

233
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
I can't see you.

234
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Protect your ego.

235
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,500
I think we should deliver the service outside.

236
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,100
It's so hard to bring this in.

237
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,220
This is an emergency meeting.

238
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,820
Make a decision.

239
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,900
Ok, stop.

240
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,500
Tell what I do in the evening

241
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,940
in the ring.

242
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,220
Is it still there?

243
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,380
What's up?

244
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,860
he complained about you.

245
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,140
We both got frustrated.

246
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,900
Although I didn't do things right,

247
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,860
I shouldn't be going that far even when people are bagus.

248
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,260
Fate doesn't allow me,

249
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,300
so why must you pretend to be father to me?

250
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,780
Talking about my father,

251
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,620
you must have been Communist.

252
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,660
I am a cop.

253
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,900
Your father is a criminal.

254
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,380
I am a prisoner of my duty to pay his price.

255
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,860
If you hate me,

256
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,900
it's normal.

257
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,300
I can understand.

258
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,540
Qin Lie,

259
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,700
are you listening to me?

260
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,940
Your brother died today.

261
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,660
He did die in my hands.

262
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,500
He was arrested and exiled.

263
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,620
Maybe you don't know that

264
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,300
before you two met last night,

265
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,180
he killed a cop.

266
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,420
He is my brother.

267
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,860
We went to that little shop.

268
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,900
What are you doing?

269
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,420
I am trying to kill Uncle Huang.

270
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,500
All the proofs

271
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,460
were"?

272
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,220
I know

273
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,380
your relationship

274
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,540
is against Uncle Huang today.

275
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,220
Were you

276
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,980
excellent in Hua Dayang's record?

277
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,420
Don't you know anything?

278
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,340
I'm sorry.

279
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,220
I can't say anything.

280
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,580
Even if you can't speak,

281
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,580
you have to answer the police's questions.

282
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,620
From 1st of January to 8th,

283
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,780
from 6 to 8, where are you?

284
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
Qingli.

285
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,500
It's useless to wait for me.

286
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm not talking to you about the news.

287
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,580
You have to answer.

288
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,540
Qingli.

289
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,380
Qingli.

290
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,540
Did you hear that?

291
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,500
Qingli.

292
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,540
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
I'm back late.

295
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,740
I'm sorry.

296
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,820
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,820
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm sorry.

306
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
I'm sorry.

307
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
I'm sorry.

310
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
I'm sorry.

312
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
I'm sorry.

315
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,820
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
I'm sorry.

319
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
I'm sorry.

320
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm sorry.

321
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
I'm sorry.

322
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
I'm sorry.

323
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm sorry.

324
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,020
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,020
I'm sorry.

326
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Food poisoning?

328
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Yes.

329
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
This place has a record.

330
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Look.

331
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Here. Look.

332
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
On January 27th, the night was clean.

333
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
The food was poisoned and the smell was good.

334
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
After that, he stayed here for a few days.

335
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
He left yesterday.

336
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Are you sure about the time?

337
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I'm sure.

338
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
On January 27th, I was on duty.

339
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I was very impressed.

340
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
His brother carried him here.

341
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
He was unconscious at that time.

342
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Why do I think it's on the 28th night?

343
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
On the 27th night, you were mistaken.

344
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
I was on duty for those two days.

345
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,520
So he didn't leave here for a few days?

346
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
No.

347
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
He didn't.

348
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
No one stayed here for a few days.

349
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
He was alone.

350
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
He could have been discharged in three days.

351
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
But his brother didn't pick him up.

352
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
He felt sorry for us.

353
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
So we stayed here.

354
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I also gave him two pills.

355
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
He couldn't get rid of them.

356
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
We kept him in a good place.

357
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
After he was fully recovered, he left.

358
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
The food poisoning was not that serious.

359
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
It was an emergency.

360
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,520
They stayed in our neighborhood.

361
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
The kid was on fire.

362
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
He came here to hit the ground.

363
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
How can you be so serious?

364
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
We couldn't do it before.

365
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
We were expanded last year.

366
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
The equipment was stolen.

367
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
It was similar to the hospital.

368
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
What is it?

369
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Food poisoning.

370
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
We can't find out.

371
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
We have to go to the hospital.

372
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Be careful.

373
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Chief,

374
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Uncle Huang died last night.

375
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
He was in the hospital.

376
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
He didn't leave here.

377
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
He didn't have a chance to get a surgery.

378
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Why did Qin Tian send a message to Qin Lie?

379
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
He asked him to take a look at the room.

380
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Maybe Qin Tian wanted to

381
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
ask his brother to help him before he left.

382
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
He didn't want to.

383
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
How can I know?

384
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Put the cleaning away.

385
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
What are you thinking?

386
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I don't know.

387
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
I think his father and brother

388
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
are all gone.

389
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
They are still in the family.

390
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
They are all gone.

391
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
They are all children.

392
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
They are all children.

393
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
They are all children.

394
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
They are all children.

395
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Xiao Dong didn't have a chance to get a surgery.

396
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Chief Feng,

397
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
can you hear me?

398
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
I sent you back to the hospital.

399
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
The doctor said

400
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
you had to lie on the bed for a month.

401
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
You just finished your surgery.

402
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
What's wrong with your lungs?

403
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I have no feelings now.

404
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Are you weird?

405
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I have no feelings.

406
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Alright.

407
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
I'm sorry.

410
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
I'm sorry.

411
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm sorry.

414
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
I'm sorry.

419
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm sorry.

420
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
I'm sorry.

421
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I'm sorry.

422
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm sorry.

423
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
Chief Feng,

424
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
why are you here?

425
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
You're at home and are getting better, right?

426
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,840
Why You sleep

427
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,720
You stay here

428
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,520
Stay here

429
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,080
You are busy

430
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Naval

431
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,520
Make it

432
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,840
Let me give you a bowl of operator

433
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,840
ok

434
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,720
Don't touch me

435
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,720
It's like a little《China》

436
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,560
I've the rules

437
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,080
I don't need to know

438
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,200
bots, monthly lists

439
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,720
The road is very narrow, so it's hard to see the road.

440
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,720
The road is very narrow, so it's hard to see the road.

441
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,720
The road is very narrow, so it's hard to see the road.

442
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,720
The road is very narrow, so it's hard to see the road.

443
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,720
The road is very narrow, so it's hard to see the road.

444
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,720
The road is full of cars and the road is narrow.

445
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,700
The road is narrow.

446
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,200
Turn around originally.

447
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,000
This road is very narrow.

448
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Because I don't know, I took it all.

449
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I checked it. I'm still here.

450
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Hello.

451
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Where's the room?

452
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I said it's going to be cold.

453
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Do you know this family?

454
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I've seen them.

455
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
They're young.

456
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Have you said anything?

457
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
No.

458
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I've lived here for more than a year.

459
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
I've seen them twice or three times.

460
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
You can't even talk to them.

461
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
They're all night long.

462
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
They're all night long.

463
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Do you know what they do?

464
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
I don't know.

465
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Have you ever been to him?

466
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,040
You're police officers?

467
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Yes.

468
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Who?

469
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Police officers.

470
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I'm asking if I know the other guy.

471
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
The one with the bad ear?

472
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
You know?

473
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
It seems to be Qin.

474
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Yes.

475
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Say something.

476
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
No.

477
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
I just came to him several times.

478
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
He's a devil.

479
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
He went upstairs with me.

480
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
He's trying to break into his house.

481
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
I heard him shouting.

482
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
It seems Qin.

483
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
What does Qin look like

484
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
when he comes to him?

485
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
He's like a boss.

486
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
He's a big man.

487
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
He's a killer.

488
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Who doesn't know how to play the game?

489
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Is Zhang Xu and Qin Li still in touch?

490
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
It has something to do with Mr. Huang.

491
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Besides the account,

492
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Qin Li has no other social records

493
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
in recent years?

494
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
No.

495
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
I haven't done any of his bank accounts.

496
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
I haven't even put my phone number on it.

497
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Do you think it's strange?

498
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
But Qin Li didn't have time to make money

499
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
when he was in the hospital.

500
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
The two doctors in the clinic

501
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
have proven it.

502
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
But Zhang Xu was a grandma

503
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
back then.

504
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Can you tell me which one is lying?

505
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
I'm sorry.

506
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm sorry.

507
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm sorry.

508
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Are you changing clothes?

509
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Miss, we've met many years ago.

510
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Do you remember?

511
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Are you police?

512
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
What are you doing here?

513
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
No. Where are you going?

514
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I'm dead.

515
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
You've been here for several times.

516
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
What are you doing here?

517
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
What's the matter with Zhang Xu?

518
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
I've told you many times.

519
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
He's dead.

520
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
You're still here.

521
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
You're still a bad guy.

522
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Back then,

523
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
the police came to us differently.

524
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
We didn't want to disturb you.

525
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
But we really needed your help.

526
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Tell us

527
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
what's going on.

528
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
If Zhang Xu is

529
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
in the clinic,

530
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
he's been laced.

531
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
The police is also there.

532
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm going to the clinic.

533
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
You're not in the clinic?

534
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Yes, I'm not in the clinic.

535
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
And I found

536
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Zhang Xu,

537
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Uncle Wang,

538
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
and the kids in the clinic.

539
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
There's no one in the clinic.

540
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Hello.

541
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Okay, I got it.

542
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
I'll go with my friend.

543
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Okay.

544
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Li said

545
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Zhang Xu went to the clinic the first day.

546
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,040
He said you were Wang Ru.

547
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Uncle Wang's mother.

548
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
Wang Ru was taken away by people in 1999.

549
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
He went to Jiangze.

550
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
He was left all over the place.

551
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
He later took part in a big fraud.

552
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
A year ago,

553
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
he was caught by a Shen Dong

554
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
after returning to Yibo.

555
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
He was arrested for eight years.

556
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
He left Shen Dong the day before.

557
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
He came to visit Wang Ru.

558
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
He came to visit him every year.

559
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Where is he?

560
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
He'll be here soon.

561
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,040
When was the first time you met Zhang Xu?

562
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
After he came here.

563
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
I didn't know him before.

564
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Why did he come to see you?

565
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
He said he was a good friend of Uncle Wang.

566
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
He told you

567
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
every time he came.

568
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
He didn't tell me anything.

569
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
He told me everything.

570
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
He brought me food,

571
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
used it,

572
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
and money.

573
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
He was a good friend.

574
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
When Zhang Xu came last time,

575
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
did he mention to you

576
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
what he was doing in Shenzhen?

577
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
No.

578
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
He hasn't come for a long time.

579
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
He hasn't come for a long time.

580
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
He came once in three months.

581
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
He's very professional.

582
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Your brother Wang He Tao

583
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
has never seen you before.

584
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
He doesn't know I'm here.

585
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
The second year of Uncle's death,

586
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
my mom died.

587
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
He left the wedding

588
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
and went to Japan to work.

589
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I also heard from

590
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
the old neighbor that he came back.

591
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Who else

592
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
else came to see you?

593
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
No one else.

594
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Officer Feng.

595
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
When Uncle left,

596
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
did he say

597
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
he had a crush on me?

598
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
I don't know.

599
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I don't know.

600
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
I didn't know.

601
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
I didn't know.

602
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I didn't know.

603
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Did you feel pain?

604
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Go to get changed.

605
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Here.

606
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Five yuan.

607
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Five yuan.

608
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Kid.

609
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Your hand is injured.

610
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Wait.

611
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Grandma has red key.

612
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Grandma.

613
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
It's okay.

614
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
What?

615
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
I'm sorry.

616
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
I'm sorry.

617
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm sorry.

618
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
I'm sorry.

619
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
I'm sorry.

620
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
I'm sorry.

621
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm sorry.

622
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
I'm sorry.

625
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
I'm sorry.

626
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm sorry.

627
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
I'm sorry.

628
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm sorry.

629
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
I'm sorry.

630
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Do you believe what Golou said?

631
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Didn't you know earlier?

632
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Are you afraid?

633
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,440
Coming...

634
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,040
ok

635
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,760
Uncle

636
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,220
Why do you come here?

637
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,200
We just came to check

638
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,140
What if you don't tell me

639
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,800
How dangerous things are

640
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,820
Uncle Hong

641
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,820
Why are you here?

642
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,820
I'm here to make money.

643
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
You're here to make money?

644
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,820
I don't have enough living expenses.

645
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,820
So I'm here to make money.

646
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,820
I'm sorry.

647
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,820
I always ask you to treat me.

648
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,820
Treat me?

649
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,820
You're my best friends.

650
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,820
I can make money by myself.

651
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,820
I just want to treat you.

652
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,820
What's wrong?

653
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,820
Xiaoxiao, you've been saying you want to come today.

654
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
You're here today.

655
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,820
You've seen it, right?

656
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,820
Are you coming or not?

657
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,820
I'm not coming.

658
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,820
I was scared to death.

659
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,820
Because of such a big thing,

660
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,820
my heart almost broke out.

661
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,820
And there's a piece of male kiss.

662
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,820
I don't understand what's so fun about this place.

663
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,820
I feel like there's no good person.

664
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,820
I'm sorry.

665
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,820
I didn't mean that.

666
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,820
It's okay.

667
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,820
I'm not coming anymore.

668
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
I'm here to resign today.

669
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Do you know you're here?

670
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,820
Bai Bai, you two came here yourself.

671
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,820
Who are you?

672
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,820
You don't know me?

673
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,820
Don't you know me?

674
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,820
What are you doing?

675
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,820
It's none of your business.

676
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,820
Feng Yuan, what are you doing?

677
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,820
Let go of me.

678
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Let go of me.

679
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,820
You two are still playing.

680
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,820
Let go of me.

681
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,820
I'll pay you back.

682
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,820
One hundred and two hundred, okay?

683
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
Let go of me.

684
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Let go of me.

685
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
Don't hurt me.

686
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,820
What are you doing?

687
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
Let go of me.

688
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,820
Let go of me.

689
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,820
Let go of me.

690
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,820
Let go of me.

691
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,820
Let go of me.

692
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,820
Let go of me.

693
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,820
Let go of me.

694
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,820
Let go of me.

695
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,820
I'm fine.

696
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,820
What's the matter with you?

697
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,820
What's the matter with you?

698
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,820
Brother, you're so naughty.

699
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,820
Why are you so naughty?

700
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,820
You're so naughty.

701
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,820
You'll die if you don't want to.

702
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,820
What's your name?

703
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Ji Shu, my name is Zhang Xu.

704
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Get lost.

705
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
What's wrong with you?

706
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,820
Are you Zhang Xu?

707
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,820
I can't stand you.

708
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,820
I'll wait for you.

709
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,820
Ji Shu.

710
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
Are you okay?

711
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,820
You're so naughty.

712
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,820
Wang Di.

713
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,820
Are you okay?

714
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,820
Did you wear a mask?

715
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
Why are you here?

716
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,820
What happened?

717
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,820
I'm fine.

718
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,820
Let's go.

719
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,820
Qilin.

720
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,820
Do you know that

721
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,820
Uncle Huang dances in this place?

722
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,820
Why didn't you tell us?

723
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,820
You treat us as friends.

724
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,820
Why didn't you tell us?

725
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,820
What kind of place is this?

726
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,820
We shouldn't have come here.

727
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,820
We shouldn't have come here.

728
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,820
That's right.

729
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,820
You shouldn't have come here.

730
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,820
Enough. Stop arguing.

731
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,820
It's all my fault.

732
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,820
Let's go eat.

733
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,820
It's not your fault.

734
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,820
I'm not going home.

735
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,820
Uncle Huang, I want to go home too.

736
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,820
Wang Di, can you give me a ride?

737
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,820
Zuo Jiao.

738
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,820
Are you okay?

739
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,820
I'm fine.

740
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,820
Can you walk?

741
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,820
You can't walk because of me.

742
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,820
Let's go.

743
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,820
I'll help you.

744
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,820
You're a ten-year-old old model.

745
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,820
It's too old to repair.

746
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,820
I'm saying

747
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,820
you're a old model.

748
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,820
You can't repair it.

749
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,820
Or you can buy a new one.

750
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,820
Look.

751
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,820
Let me introduce you.

752
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,820
These are all new models.

753
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,820
And

754
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,820
they are all new models.

755
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,820
They are all new models.

756
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,820
And

757
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,820
they are all new brands.

758
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,820
You can't be bothered to buy them.

759
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,820
