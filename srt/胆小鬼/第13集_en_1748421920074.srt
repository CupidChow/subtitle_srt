00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,800
Chao Chao, what's this?

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
What?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,800
A bill.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,000
I...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,800
I'll use these two to exchange you. What?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm not going to exchange you. You don't even know how to use those two.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Then give these two to you.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
The outsiders are going to be in the office next week.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
You're so rubbish.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
I wrote the wrong thing last time.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,400
If you write it again, you'll lose the word.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Where did you buy your lottery tickets?

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,000
I...

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
This thing is really fake.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
You have to go to a special place.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
You don't know.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Is this bill true?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Nonsense. I don't buy tickets.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Sell me.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can you afford it?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
120 yuan.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Can you afford it?

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm just kidding.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,400
You can't afford it even if you buy it.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,800
You're from the second-party group.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
That's right.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,600
What's wrong?

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,000
How about this?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,200
I'll write 50 of the second-party group's business for you.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
I'll take back the money from you.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
How about it?

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
What's your name?

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,800
Gao Erwu, class 5. Please accept it.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Team up.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,000
Deal.

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Episode 16

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,200
The school has started investigating the specific situation.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,600
The school must be responsible for its compensation.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't stop. You tell me to leave.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Are you leaving? Are you leaving?

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,400
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
You're not even close to the Qingli.

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,900
Aff Gem II

45
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
I suddenly stopped having this fright.

46
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,260
You mean...

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,200
Yin Yan received a painkiller

48
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,280
Yin Yan looks so particular

49
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,620
inside her hands

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,280
Yin Yan

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,240
it's so weird

52
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,640
I think..

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,420
Go to sleep.

54
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,820
You are美國.

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:15,560
Feel the...

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,640
Feel the...

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,620
Didn't come home last night

58
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,640
Feel the...

59
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,560
What's going on

60
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,400
Give me one.

61
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll have this evening with him.

62
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
What's wrong?

63
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm fine.

64
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm fine.

65
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,120
Let me help you.

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,920
You're fine.

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Wang Di,

68
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,520
Chen Zhongrong called me.

69
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
He said he was looking for you.

70
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,320
Did he say anything?

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
No.

72
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
He said he'd wait for you at school

73
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,720
tomorrow morning.

74
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
What did Chen Zhongrong say?

75
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,320
Did you get into trouble with the school?

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,320
No.

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,320
What trouble?

78
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
You can't think of a good kid.

79
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,720
You just got into trouble for the school.

80
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
You can't reward him for that.

81
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,120
It's too sudden.

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
He just wants to go.

83
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,520
Tell me.

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
What time is it?

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
He said he'd wait for you at school

86
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,320
tomorrow morning.

87
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,920
I'll have a bite.

88
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm not eating.

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
I'm going out.

90
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Eat more.

91
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I'll go.

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
I'll go.

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Why are you here?

94
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,920
I called you.

95
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Why are you here?

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Who?

97
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
My classmate.

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,520
Come in.

99
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Hello.

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,720
Hello.

101
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Have you eaten?

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
I've eaten.

103
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Thanks.

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
Mom, we went upstairs last night.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,520
Don't peek at the computer.

106
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,920
We've agreed to wait for two days.

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Chen Zhongrong called me.

108
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I'll go tomorrow morning.

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,920
What are you going to say?

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Tell me the truth.

111
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Why are you pushing me?

112
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
What's the point of pushing you?

113
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
What are you going to say?

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
You still have to hand me out.

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,920
I have no other way.

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I was originally wronged by Qi Li.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,520
Why should I be blamed for you?

118
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Don't say that.

119
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
You've seen the thing after all.

120
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
What do you mean?

121
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,520
Are you scaring me?

122
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,320
Of course not.

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Fang Di,

124
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
there's a solution.

125
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
You don't have to be black.

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
What is it?

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
As long as you say it,

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I'll do my best.

129
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,920
Gao Lian.

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,920
I didn't expect you to be like this.

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,320
I don't know you.

132
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
I saw everything.

133
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
You saw everyone.

134
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
And Hu Kai Zhi.

135
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,120
Qi Li was wronged.

136
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
You said you wanted to protect Hu Kai Zhi, right?

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
That's right.

138
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,520
I'll tell you what I want to say now.

139
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
But my dad didn't say anything.

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,320
My dad called Director Chen this afternoon.

141
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
They've figured out the solution.

142
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
What solution?

143
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,320
If it wasn't for the 11th holiday,

144
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
you and Qi Li

145
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,520
are no longer the students of Yu Ying.

146
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,320
I've been the director for 12 years.

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,720
I've never caught such a secret.

148
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Yu Ying's student?

149
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
He's watching the yellow video.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
What's his surname?

151
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,720
Shi Wu Qian Li.

152
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
The principal asked me

153
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,720
to deal with this matter

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
before the holiday ends.

155
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Did you see it yourself?

156
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,720
You and Qi Li got together.

157
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Qiu You came back and signed the contract that night.

158
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
It's not mine.

159
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
It has nothing to do with me.

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Okay.

161
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,720
Did you admit Qi Li?

162
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
It's not Qi Li.

163
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,720
You two found it in your room.

164
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
It's not yours. It's not Qi Li.

165
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,920
It's a ghost.

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,320
We're not the two of us anyway.

167
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,320
You and Qi Li are childhood friends.

168
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
You always protect her.

169
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,520
But now,

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,320
it's not the time to be so angry.

171
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,720
You're a great student in the competition.

172
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,920
You were very happy in school.

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
But do you know?

174
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,920
You made a wrong decision this time.

175
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,720
Wang Di,

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
do I need to remind you?

177
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,920
You have a big pot in your body.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,520
Tell me.

179
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,920
Who is Dong Yun?

180
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
I don't know.

181
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
You don't have to tell me in front of the light.

182
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,720
It's you who can't tell.

183
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
Hu Kai Zhi.

184
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Hu Kai Zhi.

185
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,920
Why did Hu Kai Zhi run to your room?

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Did I run to him when I entered the room?

187
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,520
I didn't see him.

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
You didn't see him.

189
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
How could you say it was Hu Kai Zhi?

190
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
You didn't see Qi Li and me.

191
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
Why did you say it was us?

192
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Because it's in your room.

193
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
You're the one who made a mistake.

194
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,920
What did you make a mistake?

195
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
Can you confess?

196
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,720
You can find the witness.

197
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,920
You said it was Hu Kai Zhi who ran to your room.

198
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,720
And you ran to him again.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Why did you run to me?

200
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
Okay.

201
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,920
Find Qi Li.

202
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
If we both said it was Hu Kai Zhi,

203
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,920
can you believe me?

204
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Didn't pay attention to it to prove that I'm a natural suffering.

205
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,520
Chef Jia lt was Heier.

206
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,220
Qi Li didn't come to see me yesterday.

207
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,920
I didn't want to visit Qi Li,

208
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,520
but the leadership told me to quit the pity's mess.

209
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
It's hard to restore the power.

210
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
What do you mean?

211
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
It's just a loss.

212
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,520
You're not that fast, but you can lower the power.

213
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
You can restore as much as you want.

214
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
It's hard to say now.

215
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Now, the public health organization can provide help.

216
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I have a separate file.

217
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Have a look.

218
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Hello.

219
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Is Qin Li living in this flat?

220
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Who are you?

221
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
You're Qin Li's brother.

222
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
We met last time at the opening of the family meeting.

223
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm Feng Jiujiao's mother.

224
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
It's all my fault.

225
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
If I didn't let my niece listen to me,

226
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
she wouldn't have been here.

227
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
It's useless to say that today.

228
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
If Qin Li didn't mention you,

229
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
you're the one who's in the hospital now.

230
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Now, Uncle Huang and his brother

231
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
will definitely kill me.

232
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Did you tell your parents?

233
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
My father is in the outside world.

234
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
I told my parents.

235
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
What about you?

236
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
You didn't tell them?

237
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Why?

238
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Why?

239
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
You still don't know what happened to Qiu You?

240
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
What's wrong?

241
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I don't know what to say.

242
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Anyway, the school is going to fire me.

243
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Why?

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I told you that you should be sure.

245
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
You can't tell Uncle Huang.

246
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
You can't say anything.

247
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I promise.

248
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
What's wrong?

249
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Director Chen,

250
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
he asked me to sell my luggage to release me.

251
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Sell my luggage?

252
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
What do you mean?

253
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
I don't know.

254
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,520
I really don't know what to do now.

255
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Director Chen.

256
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Director Chen.

257
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Oh, my god.

258
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
You're doing such a big thing.

259
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
What's wrong with the school?

260
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I came to you first.

261
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
There must be a reason.

262
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm telling you.

263
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
I'll tell you later.

264
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
We're the only ones who know.

265
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
No one can know for now.

266
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
What do you mean?

267
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
What do you mean?

268
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
You're the head of the class.

269
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
You think you don't have to be responsible?

270
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Yes.

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
You have to think about your future.

272
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
What if you lose your job?

273
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
You have to think about your child.

274
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Let's go.

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I'll do it.

276
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
It's hot.

277
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
No, it's fine.

278
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Cut the fruit.

279
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Okay.

280
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I can't handle it.

281
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Xiao Teng's family is in charge of it.

282
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Everything is on the standard.

283
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
The distance is even more than a thousand.

284
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Don't let her sister take it.

285
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
I've been thinking about something

286
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,520
in my mind these days.

287
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
What's wrong?

288
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I have a feeling.

289
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Today,

290
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
it's not the truth.

291
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Do we want to be independent?

292
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
I can't say anything.

293
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Everything is on the standard.

294
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
The room,

295
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
the clothes,

296
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
the iron hook,

297
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
the iron evidence.

298
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
And,

299
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
I've investigated about Yin Peng.

300
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
He was in the province,

301
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
but didn't go to the outside.

302
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Xiao Teng is the wrong person.

303
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't believe Xiao Teng will be able to see it.

304
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
You can't control him.

305
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
You saw it yourself?

306
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Yes.

307
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Guo Jie,

308
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
the case is over.

309
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
By the way,

310
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
did you go to Gao Liang's house yesterday?

311
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
You don't know he is Gao Liang's father.

312
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I have to ask who's father.

313
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
As far as I know,

314
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
it was the autumn of 2000.

315
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
You and Qin Li,

316
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Uncle Huang,

317
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
had a conflict.

318
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,520
At that time, Uncle Huang left Yu Ying.

319
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Is that the case?

320
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
I don't remember.

321
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Let me remind you.

322
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Gao San just started his studies.

323
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Once, Uncle Huang went back to Yu Ying.

324
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
To save Qin Li,

325
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
he had a fight with you in the corridor.

326
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Did you have an impression?

327
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Who said that?

328
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Don't ask who said it.

329
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Is that true?

330
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
What do you mean by that?

331
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Because Gao Lei had a conflict with Uncle Huang,

332
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
you suspect him?

333
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Miss, don't worry.

334
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
We are normal people.

335
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
The case is over.

336
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
You are still asking questions at home.

337
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Is that normal?

338
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
You may not know.

339
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
In the school,

340
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
someone always says lies.

341
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
What you said is Gao Lei.

342
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
I think it's not bad

343
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
to dismiss the misunderstanding.

344
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
What do you think?

345
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Did you lock Qin Li

346
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
into the workshop?

347
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I didn't mean it.

348
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Tell me the truth.

349
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Is that true?

350
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I didn't mean it.

351
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Have you seen this book?

352
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
No.

353
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Where is this?

354
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I really don't have it.

355
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Don't ask.

356
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
You may leave.

357
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Captain, hello.

358
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
I am Gao Lei's father.

359
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Hello.

360
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
We have seen each other.

361
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
You were sitting in front of me

362
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
at the opening of the meeting last year.

363
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
You are sitting in front of me.

364
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Gao Lei

365
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
is familiar with the evidence and the evidence.

366
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
What do you mean?

367
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
You just say it.

368
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
You suddenly ask the child at home.

369
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
She is unhappy with her parents.

370
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Don't go there anymore.

371
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Today is dead.

372
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,520
But I don't think it's right.

373
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
You should read that book.

374
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
And the pattern.

375
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
And the number.

376
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
You shouldn't have said it.

377
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Tell me.

378
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Have you asked Jiao Jiao?

379
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
No.

380
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Why?

381
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
She can't bear it.

382
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
It's the same.

383
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
She is afraid of her own child's suffering.

384
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
She is more confident.

385
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
She should let it go.

386
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
If Yang Ju is here,

387
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,520
she will definitely persuade you.

388
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
She isn't going there.

389
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Maybe he is coming back,

390
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
maybe it was all working out.

391
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Well..

392
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,540
Yan Er &

393
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,520
Li I Member

394
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Meet your new�

395
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
No, I have something else to do.

396
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Guo Jian, you should take good care of yourself.

397
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Call me when you go back.

398
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm not sending you off.

399
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Take care.

400
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Okay.

401
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Is it Zhi Yu?

402
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Zhi Yu.

403
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,520
He also listens to my dad and is in love with me.

404
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
I'm leaving.

405
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
When will you be back?

406
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Soon.

407
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Your book is about the Royal Uncle, right?

408
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Why don't you bring me home?

409
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm not done.

410
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I've told you.

411
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
You can't tell me about this.

412
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Uncle Jiao and Uncle Huang are good friends.

413
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,520
I think you should know about it.

414
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
I should know.

415
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
I really should know.

416
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
It's not the time.

417
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
She must be gone.

418
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
But you are a daughter.

420
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
You are your own daughter.

421
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I will be in the college for another four months.

422
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
You will regret it yourself.

423
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Mom.

424
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Mom.

425
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
You're back.

426
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Come in.

427
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Did you smell the smell?

428
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Mom, you have to eat.

429
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I like to eat soup.

430
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I want to try it.

431
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Come on.

432
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
It's so hot.

433
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
It's hot.

434
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Let's burn it.

435
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
It's so hot.

436
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Is it good?

437
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Mom said it's not good.

438
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
She said it's not good.

439
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
I eat a lot of food every day.

440
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
No problem.

441
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
As long as you are a mother, you are a mother.

442
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
How is it?

443
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
It's good.

444
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Come over after you finish.

445
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
If you can't do it,

446
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
don't say yes.

447
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I can do it.

448
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
It's ribs.

449
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
I don't need to eat it.

450
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I can't.

451
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Who wants to eat this?

452
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Come on.

453
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Come on.

454
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Come on.

455
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Mom.

456
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I don't want to eat it.

457
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Mom.

458
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Xilin.

459
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Xilin.

460
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Xilin, I'm here.

461
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Xilin.

462
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,240
Qin Li, blossom tone is getting more natural now

463
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,940
I... I felt everything

464
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
Only Aurora

465
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay

466
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,120
I...

467
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
This matter...

468
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,600
was discussed with me by Director Chen.

469
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,480
He meant...

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,120
if you can't get the evidence

471
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,800
and prove your innocence,

472
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
there will be only one result.

473
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,760
You said I was the only one.

474
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,360
I told you before.

475
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,960
The solution was not distances.

476
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,240
You can only write the material.

477
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,480
Be used only for...

478
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,320
a резure.

479
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,200
Once you transformation,

480
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,320
you will be yielded

481
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
according to the order of the Prime Minister.

482
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,960
The competition is over.

483
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,000
According to the standard of the price of the competition,

484
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
the school will help you

485
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,360
earn 20 points according to the policy.

486
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,400
As long as you write...

487
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,240
I won't write.

488
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,040
Why are you forcing me?

489
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
Don't ask me.

490
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,120
This is not my opinion.

491
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,880
I'm just a little leader.

492
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,600
You can't be the fool.

493
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,320
Now there are only two ways to defeat you.

494
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,040
Either Qin Di leaves or you two leave together.

495
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,040
The school is willing to give you this chance.

496
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,760
As long as you write this fabric,

497
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,440
even if you just write it,

498
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,440
you can't see anything.

499
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,840
It's not yours.

500
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,880
I mean, you...

501
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,000
You can wait.

502
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,280
I don't understand.

503
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,440
Zhi Bang,

504
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,040
Huang Ting, you still don't understand.

505
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,520
The school is willing to give Qin Di away.

506
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
It's not you.

507
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,760
I want to protect her, too.

508
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,040
I have no choice.

509
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,720
I can only protect you now.

510
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Do you understand?

511
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't know what's going on in your family.

512
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,600
If you leave,

513
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
what will you do in the future?

514
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,200
What will your mother do in the future?

515
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,320
This is your only chance.

516
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,680
I don't want to see you go ahead.

517
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,320
You had or did not know the truth?

518
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,120
Why did you leave me where I am?

519
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,080
The future won't change.

520
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,080
Although Mom had gone to the hospital,

521
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,720
instead of being able to hide it in the world,

522
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,320
you even made a decision so I could avoid you,

523
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,840
I'll do the best that I can.

524
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,880
Super đầuanges.

525
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,040
Congratulations.

526
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,400
See you next time.

527
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,040
Here's what we have here.

528
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,520
Fang Yu.

529
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,440
Mr. Fang,

530
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,440
you just asked me to train with Zhao Qin.

531
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,240
Please.

532
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
I won't let you see Qingli.

533
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Uncle, you must be really worried about me.

534
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Then listen to me.

535
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
What exactly happened to me?

536
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
You know very well about Wang Di.

537
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Chen Zhu has called Qing Tian.

538
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
He said that if you want to fire Qingli, you must be responsible for it.

539
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I didn't expect that you would treat Qingli like this.

540
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Why Qingli?

541
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
You and Gao Lei are the same kind of people.

542
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
He is innocent.

543
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
He is innocent.

544
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
I'm not Gao Lei.

545
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Then why don't you tell the truth?

546
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Why don't you say that Qingli will become like this for you?

547
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Why don't you say that?

548
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
I'm afraid.

549
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
What are you afraid of?

550
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Don't look for excuses.

551
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
You hurt Qingli.

552
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You and Wang Di, you two hurt Qingli.

553
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
You and those bad people hurt Qingli together.

554
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Feng Xuejiao.

555
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Actually, I can become your good friend.

556
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
It's not because of how good you are.

557
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
It's just because I needed it at that time.

558
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
You just appeared.

559
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
That's also what you do to Wang Di.

560
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,240
You and Wang Di, me and Qingli,

561
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
are never the same kind of people.

562
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
You can never understand the pain of our real life.

563
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
From now on, we are no longer friends.

564
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
You should go.

565
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm afraid.

566
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
I'm afraid.

567
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm afraid.

568
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm afraid.

569
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm afraid.

570
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I'm afraid.

571
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm afraid.

572
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm afraid.

573
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm afraid.

574
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
I'm afraid.

575
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
I'm afraid.

576
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm afraid.

577
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
I'm afraid.

578
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
I'm afraid.

579
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
I'm afraid.

580
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
You are so short.

581
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
You will be back soon.

582
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Think about it.

583
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm afraid.

584
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm afraid.

585
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm afraid.

586
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Mr. Wang.

587
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Mr. Wang.

588
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I got it from the file.

589
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
I'll send it to you.

590
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
And this.

591
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
The notebook of Xiaotang.

592
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
I keep it.

593
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
The day is so good today.

594
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
I got it.

595
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
It's such a long day.

596
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
You should take a seat.

597
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Let's sit here.

598
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
You can sit here.

599
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
It's okay.

600
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
You can sit here.

601
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
You can sit here.

602
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm afraid.

603
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
I'm afraid.

604
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
I'm afraid.

605
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
It's okay.

606
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I'll go buy it.

607
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
No need.

608
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
I'll go.

609
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Take a seat.

610
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Okay.

611
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
What?

612
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
You're not leaving?

613
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
No.

614
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
I'll stay with you and my mom.

615
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Can I?

616
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
I've found the office.

617
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Where?

618
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
I found the office.

619
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
The editor.

620
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Good.

621
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
You've been a scholar since you were a kid.

622
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
You've been working in the high school.

623
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I've been working in the high school.

624
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
I've been working in the high school.

625
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Which department?

626
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
In this life,

627
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,240
you have to fight with your soul.

628
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
You have to fight with your soul.

629
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
You have to fight with your soul.

630
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Okay.

631
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Okay.

632
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
You're so good.

633
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
You're a father.

634
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
You're a father.

635
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
You're a father.

636
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm writing a letter and writing a note.

637
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
One thing.

638
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I've been

639
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
trying to tell you

640
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
about the good old days.

641
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
You fought with

642
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Hu Kezhi at the high school.

643
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
You went to the hospital.

644
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
His dad took 5,000 yuan to treat you.

645
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I didn't think much.

646
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
I was so weak.

647
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
I just took the money.

648
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
I took it.

649
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I know.

650
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
I heard it in the room.

651
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I've been thinking about it for 10 years.

652
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I've been looking for a chance

653
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
to admit my mistake.

654
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
When you needed me the most,

655
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
I didn't think much.

656
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
So you're willing to admit it?

657
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I'm willing to admit it.

658
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
I'm willing to admit it.

659
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,240
I've been thinking about it for 10 years.

660
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
You're a father.

661
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
You're a son.

662
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I'm sorry.

663
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Even if I say sorry to you today,

664
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
dad,

665
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
even when people have hearts

666
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
and can't afford to go,

667
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,960
the cut of the wound.

668
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
Uncle Huang, this is the top of the camp.

669
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,200
The top of the camp is the bottom of the oil.

670
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,720
And the blood of the wound

671
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,600
is different from the time of the camp.

672
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
What do you mean?

673
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,640
After the death of Uncle Huang,

674
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,280
someone else carved the pattern.

675
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Uncle Huang, this is

676
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,760
carved when he was not dead.

677
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,440
You mean

678
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,600
Uncle Huang was carved when he was alive?

679
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,240
Yes.

680
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,160
And Uncle Huang was

681
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,480
the top of the camp.

682
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,760
And maybe

683
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,200
he was the one who carved

684
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,320
when he was alive.

685
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,800
Dad.

686
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,560
Dad.

687
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,960
Jiaojiao, why are you here?

688
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,480
I brought you lunch.

689
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,160
I'm so lucky.

690
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,920
Xiao Zhao knows how to cook.

691
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,640
You're going out?

692
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,560
Sister Yao,

693
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,040
I have to learn how to cook

694
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
in America.

695
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
I learned it from Rumei.

696
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,960
Rumei?

697
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,400
Eat. Eat.

698
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,240
I'm leaving.

699
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,920
Okay.

700
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,520
Sit down.

701
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,880
Be careful.

702
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
Rumei means

703
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,840
a friend.

704
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,760
English.

705
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm a friend.

706
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,560
I'm a Sichuanese.

707
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,920
I chose to wear

708
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,960
spicy chicken feet,

709
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,040
boiled meat,

710
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,160
fried vegetables.

711
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,560
Have some more.

712
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,720
It's the same.

713
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,920
Try it.

714
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,880
Dad.

715
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,040
I just came back.

716
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,320
You didn't come home.

717
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,560
It's a busy city.

718
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,080
You don't care about the rules.

719
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,200
There's a case.

720
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,280
I have no choice.

721
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,400
What case?

722
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
I know.

723
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,160
It's the old rule.

724
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,720
I don't ask.

725
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
I don't ask.

726
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,560
Really?

727
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,160
Yes.

728
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,160
You don't eat it?

729
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,800
I don't ask.

730
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,640
Eat it.

731
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,360
Dad, I've thought it over.

732
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,240
I won't go anywhere this time.

733
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,680
I'll accompany you.

734
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,800
I'll go now.

735
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,400
Alright.

736
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,520
I'm dinner table

737
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,400
and He remains.

738
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,320
Just wait.

739
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,920
No.

740
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,160
Rumei

741
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,720
لاردا

742
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
Do you have enough words?

743
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,160
I knew

744
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
you powered my mother

745
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
so many angles.

746
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,880
I'm not stupid.

747
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,320
None of my problems

748
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,120
exist now.

749
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
It's my mom who's sorry to you.

750
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,880
It's not good for your dad to do it.

751
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Take care of yourself.

752
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
This year,

753
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm not your old man.

754
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Anyway, I'm back now.

755
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
I have to watch you.

756
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Don't drink too much from now on.

757
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
When you retire,

758
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
I'll take you out for fun.

759
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
You haven't even been to America.

760
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
You won't be hard to get out of your graduation.

761
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I remember.

762
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
It's not convenient for me to go out now.

763
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I'll retire.

764
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
I'll listen to you.

765
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
It's almost the same.

766
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
I'll go.

767
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Where's the water?

768
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
I'll get you some water.

769
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Where?

770
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Dad, what's this?

771
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
Did you see it?

772
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Now this case

773
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
has something to do with the water in the past.

774
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
But I didn't want you to know.

775
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
What's wrong with you?

776
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,880
How... how do I get it back?

777
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
What do you mean?

778
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
This is what I drew.

779
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,880
I can't turn back in my world.

780
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,880
You're in your world.

781
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,880
It doesn't matter to me.

782
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Research CJ

783
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,880
I'm afraid of being cold and lonely

784
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,880
I hate myself for being self-conscious

785
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,880
I'm against the tears of my own tears

786
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm more willing to be with you

787
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,880
I like to see you smile and call me a little girl

788
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Your expression is like the love between friends

789
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,880
The lonely taste and sweet color

790
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,880
It's unique and unique

791
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,880
I'm afraid to see you smile and call me a little girl

792
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,880
My mood is like a lover chasing after

793
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,880
The weird intuition and the wrong positioning

794
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm a little worried

795
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,880
I like to see you smile and call me a little girl

796
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,880
Your expression is like the love between friends

797
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,880
The lonely taste and sweet color

798
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,880
It's unique and unique

799
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,880
I like to see you smile and call me a little girl

800
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,880
My mood is like a lover chasing after

801
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,880
The weird intuition and the wrong positioning
