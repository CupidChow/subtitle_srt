Episode 1

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,600
You need to have surgery now.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,600
I suggest you do it as soon as possible.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,600
Can you do it after the surgery?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,120
You can't make this kind of insurance.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,560
You need to decide for yourself.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do you remember the cowhide I just came out that year?

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
I put it in there.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
You go there and find it.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll arrange the surgery for you in the hospital the next few days.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm so sorry.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're back now?

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You said it's not a big deal.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not talking about you.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm talking about you taking Qin Li with you.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You have to live until Qin Li is born.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Do you understand?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Do you know what money I used for your surgery?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's the money your son took from me.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Episode 1

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The car can't even be taken in this angle.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have to follow the car.

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One team.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When are you going to do that?

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll do it in a few days.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mom, hurry up.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll try my best.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Where are the hotel prices?

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They're all in the house.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've been there for several days.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll let them go when I'm done.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's New Year's Eve.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll pay for it.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you so relaxed?

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's all because of the sudden request from the leader.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have no choice.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
By the way,

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
is the girl who died in the haunted house called Uncle Huang?

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you doing?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's in medical school.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm working in medical school.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I heard that he died very...

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I didn't say anything.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you hear that?

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to give that to your friend.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:02,440
Okay,

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Come on, just give me a break.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Comrade,

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
why didn't you get the款?

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Didn't you get the car?

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come on!

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,320
There's no gold.

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
music

66
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
You find out

67
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,360
Your hair

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Why don't I

69
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,840
Are you useless

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,320
Then you

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Music

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Music

73
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,440
Music

74
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Music

75
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,200
Music

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,720
How do I hang up

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,760
Music

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Music

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,520
how to night

80
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,140
Here.

81
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,980
I told you not to give you a text message.

82
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,300
And if there are no text messages, then you need a call.

83
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,020
tasty!

84
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,320
give me a hand.

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,460
We just got divorced.

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,100
No car, no house.

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,540
Even leavers won't love him.

88
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
My business ends here.

89
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,700
No need you care about me.

90
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,740
It's no big deal.

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Take a look at me for real.

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
Didn't you think that I can't raise a child?

93
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,860
elública.

94
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
When did you bring her home.

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,540
She'd raise you when the accident come,

96
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
You're still asking for this?

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
Enough, stop talking.

98
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Mom, I miss you.

99
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,540
When can you go back to your home?

100
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,540
I know.

101
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,540
I'll go home after I've solved the case.

102
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
You're the only one who did the whole case.

103
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
Don't go to the police station.

104
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
No.

105
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Is that true?

106
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
I agreed to take the police.

107
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
You didn't agree to stop it?

108
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,540
You stopped it when I was in the police station.

109
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Now you stop it?

110
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
It's late.

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
You said it.

112
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
How can I go back now?

113
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Okay, I'll go home after I've solved the case.

114
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
Why don't you go back to your room tonight?

115
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
I can buy a new phone case for you.

116
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
I can't tonight.

117
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
I've made an appointment.

118
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Who are you?

119
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
Is it the same person?

120
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Nothing.

121
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
Then you can go out.

122
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
You should go now.

123
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Listen, this is the thing.

124
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Mom, you don't need to go to your room.

125
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
It's urgent.

126
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Okay, okay.

127
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,540
You can't do this all day.

128
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
What are you doing?

129
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,540
You look so pretty.

130
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm just a colleague.

131
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
I'm not bad looking.

132
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Okay.

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Hello, Mr. Feng.

134
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
What's up?

135
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
What's up?

136
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
This car owner is Wei Zhihong.

137
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
He's 42 years old.

138
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
He owns a big car factory.

139
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
He's been working in the factory for two years

140
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,540
because he's been working in the factory for a long time.

141
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,540
And he's got a pig's tank in the factory.

142
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Mr. Feng,

143
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
did we find him this time?

144
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
Yes.

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Mr. Feng,

146
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
did we find him this time?

147
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
Why is it a big car again?

148
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Yes,

149
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
it's a bit strange that you're in the big car.

150
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
We found Wei Zhihong and we know.

151
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Where's the car?

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
I told Mr. Liu to go back.

153
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
Let's go.

154
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
He's missing a person.

155
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
He's been in the car for ten years.

156
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
He's really...

157
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Mr. Liu.

158
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Hello.

159
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Hello.

160
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Uncle Huang.

161
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Who is it?

162
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Gao Lei.

163
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Why do you have my phone number?

164
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
It's a secret.

165
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Is something wrong?

166
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Nothing.

167
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
It's just that

168
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,540
you left the school quite suddenly.

169
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
You didn't have a chance to say goodbye to each other.

170
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
It's a pity.

171
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
What do you mean?

172
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Nothing.

173
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Do you have other things?

174
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Are you free tomorrow?

175
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
I want to play with you.

176
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
No.

177
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Where's the phone number?

178
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
I don't have time.

179
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Uncle Huang.

180
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,540
Do you hate me?

181
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Why would I hate you?

182
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
I just want to treat you to a meal.

183
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
You can do anything.

184
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I'll wait for you to be free.

185
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Say it again.

186
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,540
Go.

187
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Hello, Qin Li.

188
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Gao Lei just called me.

189
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
Why does he have my phone number?

190
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Go to bed early.

191
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Good night.

192
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Why can't I open the door?

193
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
I thought there was no one at home.

194
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Why are you back?

195
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
I came to see the ball.

196
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
You're not going to play at Gao Lei's house?

197
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,540
I just came back to check

198
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
if you have any food.

199
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
I'll check after the meal.

200
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Grandpa, you've done your homework.

201
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
Are you done?

202
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Yes.

203
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
What's wrong with you?

204
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
You're upset?

205
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
Why did you give

206
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Uncle Huang's phone number to Gao Lei?

207
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Why did you send me a letter?

208
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
I was just playing at his house that day.

209
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
He asked me to do it.

210
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
Uncle Huang said

211
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
that other than us three,

212
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
he wouldn't tell anyone.

213
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
I said it.

214
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,540
It's a big deal.

215
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Are you going to sleep?

216
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
Are you with Gao Lei now?

217
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
What's the big deal?

218
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
I'm not going to sleep.

219
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
Are you with Gao Lei now?

220
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
What's the big deal?

221
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
I can't play with you anymore.

222
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
Go back.

223
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Are you really angry?

224
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Fine.

225
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
I'll come back after I'm done.

226
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
I'll be a dog when I come back.

227
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
Is it because of the ball?

228
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
What did you say?

229
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,540
I said

230
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
did Uncle Huang's phone number

231
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,540
change the ball card?

232
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
What do you mean?

233
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
I just want to know.

234
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
I really didn't see it.

235
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Bye.

236
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
The next time you come back,

237
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
you'll be a little bit more lively.

238
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
I think you'll be a little more lively.

239
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
No.

240
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,540
I don't think so.

241
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,540
You said you'd be lively.

242
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,540
You're here to be a coward.

243
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
I'm a coward.

244
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
I can't.

245
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
I'm still afraid of being scolded.

246
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Xiaobang.

247
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
How about this?

248
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
I'll take it.

249
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,540
I'll take it.

250
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
I'll take it.

251
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I'll make it more layered.

252
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,540
And then I'll keep the flowers short.

253
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
I think it'll be the same.

254
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
You're not as good as I thought.

255
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
I can try it.

256
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Are you sure?

257
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,540
You're the one.

258
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Are you sure?

259
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
I'll listen to you.

260
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
It's so pretty.

261
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
I'll take it.

262
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,540
Take it.

263
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
Take it.

264
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
Don't be so nervous.

265
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,540
Did you call her?

266
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,540
Yes.

267
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Qin Li said she'll meet you at the supermarket later.

268
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
She didn't tell me.

269
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,540
She's busy.

270
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Let's go to the fridge after that.

271
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm a little hungry today.

272
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Don't eat that.

273
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
I'll go to the bifontan to drink some hot water.

274
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Okay.

275
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
I'll treat you to this.

276
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
No, I'll treat you.

277
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
You treat me every time.

278
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
I won't come out to play with you if you're in line.

279
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
I'll treat you to this.

280
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,540
I'll treat you to the hairpins.

281
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
I'll take it.

282
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Okay.

283
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
What's wrong with you two?

284
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
You didn't say anything.

285
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,540
The two of you are making a mess.

286
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
What's the problem?

287
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
It's just a minor thing.

288
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Don't be angry.

289
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
Come on.

290
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Come on, pull your hand.

291
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,540
Come on.

292
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Come on.

293
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
Hurry up.

294
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Pull your hand.

295
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,540
Pull your hand.

296
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Good job.

297
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Now I'll announce that you two are in the same team.

298
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,540
Be careful.

299
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Be careful.

300
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Yes.

301
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,540
You're in the third grade now.

302
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,540
Are you under a lot of pressure?

303
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Yes.

304
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
I wrote two notes every day.

305
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
You love Mo?

306
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
Do you have a conscience?

307
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
I don't want you to copy me.

308
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
What's your support for?

309
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
Wang Di doesn't have to ask.

310
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
He must learn to pretend to be me.

311
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
He wants to be our guest.

312
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Who told you that I want to be your guest?

313
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,540
You're so tired to be a guest.

314
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,540
You wrote so many words every day.

315
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
I don't do that.

316
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
How about you?

317
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
I've never thought about it.

318
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Why are you asking others?

319
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
What's your wish?

320
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Actually, it doesn't matter what kind of professional I am.

321
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
As long as I can graduate from college,

322
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,540
I want to marry the person I like

323
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
and then turn to the world.

324
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
You're also a smart person.

325
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Maybe I can find a mom and not marry you.

326
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
I think it's good.

327
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
You can know what you want.

328
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
It's good.

329
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
It's good.

330
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
What about you?

331
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
Wait a minute. Let me guess.

332
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
You want to be a dance star.

333
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
No.

334
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
You want to be a star, right?

335
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Right?

336
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Right?

337
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Actually, I want to have a home

338
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,540
that belongs to me like you.

339
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
What's wrong?

340
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Are you stupid?

341
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
I don't think so.

342
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
Yes, you're not stupid.

343
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
What if you can't achieve it?

344
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
You can stay with me.

345
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
They don't know.

346
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Anyway, I'll stay with you.

347
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
I'll stay with you.

348
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
When you have your own home,

349
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
you won't say that.

350
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Don't leave me.

351
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Come on.

352
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Let's stay together forever.

353
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,540
Stay together forever.

354
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Cheers.

355
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Cheers.

356
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
What's the place

357
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
under the iron door?

358
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
Air-conditioning.

359
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
What air-conditioning?

360
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
It's built during the war.

361
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
There are many schools and factories in Shandong.

362
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,540
But most of them are abandoned.

363
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
There are buildings under the prison.

364
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Do you mean

365
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
the warehouse under the school?

366
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Yes.

367
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Why don't I know?

368
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
Men move to the studio.

369
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
You must know that.

370
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
How long does it take to build the air-conditioning?

371
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
It takes a long time to build the whole Shandong.

372
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
You've been there.

373
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
I've been there all the time.

374
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
I want to go there.

375
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
How can you be like that?

376
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
You're not that beautiful.

377
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
What are you doing?

378
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
You didn't see it?

379
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
What?

380
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
I cut my hair.

381
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,540
What?

382
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Look.

383
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Come here.

384
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
What?

385
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,540
You're better looking than me.

386
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
I'm sorry.

387
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
You're better looking than me.

388
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Don't be angry.

389
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
He didn't mean it.

390
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
Are you going to dance tonight?

391
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,540
I'm going to do it one more time.

392
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
I don't feel relieved

393
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
when you dance at a place like that.

394
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Anyway, you're going to earn money.

395
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,540
Just treat it as finding a job.

396
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Besides, the manager is nice to me.

397
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
He gave me 150 yuan for dancing.

398
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm 30 yuan more than others.

399
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,540
I just want to save some money.

400
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,540
I won't leave other than dancing.

401
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
I'll give you the money.

402
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
I'll be back.

403
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
All right.

404
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
I'll give you the money.

405
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm giving you the money.

406
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Do you want to go or not?

407
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
You need money.

408
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
I can give you the money.

409
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,540
How much money can I give you?

410
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
That's nonsense.

411
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
You're just like my grandma.

412
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,540
You're so smart.

413
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
You should study hard.

414
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,020
Learn things by yourself.

415
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,140
I asked the casino friend

416
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,120
to use that money

417
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,880
and earn a reputation phonetically.

418
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,940
That won't be small bloke's business.

419
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,300
Did Zhou Zhi have to

420
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,500
pull you into the club

421
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,200
that morning

422
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
to be theたis-iel?

423
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm not a kid.

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You should study hard now.

425
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
You should go to a good university.

426
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't need that wine.

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I promise you.

428
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're so sweet.

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Don't always care about my nose.

430
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm not a kid.

431
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
You're younger than me.

432
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm not a kid.

433
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
You're also a kid.

434
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,400
I can wait for you to grow up.

435
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Mr. Xiao Qi.

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Get rid of the kid from now on.

437
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
You're not young.

438
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I know.

439
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Go home.

440
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Go to bed early.

441
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
I want to.

442
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Hello.

443
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
Uncle Huang.

444
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Gao Lei.

445
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,000
Didn't I tell you not to call me again?

446
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,600
I'm not a kid.

447
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm just a kid.

448
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Don't call me.

449
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm not a kid.

450
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm just a kid.

451
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm not a kid.

452
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Uncle Huang.

453
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,400
I'm Gao Lei.

454
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I told you not to call me again.

455
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Didn't I tell you not to call me again?

456
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
I just want to see you.

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
At least I can talk to you face to face.

458
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Then?

459
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
Then you decide.

460
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Decide what?

461
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Decide.

462
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Do you still want to see me?

463
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
I don't want to see you now.

464
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Why are you so annoying?

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Uncle Huang.

466
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Aren't you afraid of me?

467
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Afraid of you?

468
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,800
What am I afraid of?

469
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
How about this?

470
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I'll tell you a place.

471
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,200
It's 12 p.m. tonight.

472
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Do you dare to come?

473
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Pressing the three-имper flexi icon you are trying to show now.

474
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,600
Hey,

475
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,600
you are here.

476
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Twenty percent?

477
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,960
Twenty percent?

478
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,600
You don't have any 20 percent.

479
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Come on in.

480
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm not sure if I can do it.

481
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm not sure.

482
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm not sure.

483
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm not sure.

484
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm not sure.

485
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm not sure.

486
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm not sure.

487
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm not sure.

488
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm not sure.

489
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm not sure.

490
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm not sure.

491
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
I'm not sure.

492
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm not sure.

493
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm not sure.

494
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm not sure.

495
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I'm not sure.

496
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm not sure.

497
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm not sure.

498
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm not sure.

499
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm not sure.

500
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm not sure.

501
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I'm not sure.

502
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm not sure.

503
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I'm not sure.

504
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm not sure.

505
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm not sure.

506
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm not sure.

507
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I'm not sure.

508
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm not sure.

509
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm not sure.

510
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm not sure.

511
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm not sure.

512
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm not sure.

513
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm not sure.

514
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm not sure.

515
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm not sure.

516
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I'm not sure.

517
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Are there stuntmen?

518
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
A car?

519
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Scrtncych.

520
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,940
Miss...

521
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,980
ushima

522
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,300
Jخa

523
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,820
That's total bullshit!

524
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,500
I surely have killed Ren Ying!

525
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,460
首-commissioned to AKA,

526
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,760
Ren Ying,

527
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,820
I'm Canica's evocative student.

528
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,620
Gu kosco,

529
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,940
I signed the date with Ren Ying?

530
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,380
I came by.

531
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Are you crazy?

532
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Don't touch me.

533
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
I know who you are!

534
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
Come here!

535
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Jin Li!

536
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,380
No!

537
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,380
Jin Li!

538
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Don't move!

539
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Don't move!

540
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,380
Don't move!

541
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,380
What's going on?

542
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,380
It's okay, brother.

543
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,380
We made a mistake.

544
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
It's okay. Go back.

545
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
Jin Li is looking for you.

546
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
I know. I'll be right there.

547
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
Hurry up!

548
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Uncle Huang, I'm sorry.

549
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Why are you here?

550
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Do you follow me every time?

551
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
Follow me.

552
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I'll go now.

553
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Where are you going?

554
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
I'll go wherever I want.

555
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,380
Hurry up!

556
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Jin Li, wait for me here.

557
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Wait for me.

558
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,380
I'll be right there.

559
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:35,380
This bar has been on the line

561
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,380
before Uncle Huang died.

562
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Captain Feng,

563
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,380
why is this place so familiar?

564
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Is Uncle Huang dancing?

565
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,380
Yes.

566
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
He came here ten years ago.

567
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
When Uncle Huang was dancing,

568
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,380
did any guests

569
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
treat him more normally?

570
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,380
No, they didn't.

571
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,380
Just a few people

572
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,380
gave him flowers.

573
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,380
The price is quite high.

574
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,380
Think about it.

575
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,380
He must have been a guest

576
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,380
for a long time.

577
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
I don't know.

578
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
He's been on the line for eight months.

579
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
Where's the old boss?

580
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,380
He's gone.

581
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,380
He went to Haizhen.

582
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Is there a tourist attraction?

583
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
Half a month.

584
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Why not?

585
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
No time.

586
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Why are you so polite?

587
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
I can't be bad.

588
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,380
He's bad.

589
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
Liu Piao,

590
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
call Feng Jun later.

591
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Let him come to check.

592
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
The flight is still on.

593
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
I understand.

594
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Don't go.

595
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
It's none of my business.

596
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
I didn't do anything.

597
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
Brother,

598
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,380
I'm going to find out who's who.

599
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Xiao Dong also wrote the notebook.

600
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,380
Uncle Huang is dancing here

601
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
during the school day.

602
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
The user may be

603
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,380
a guest of this bar.

604
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,380
He knows Uncle Huang and Zeng Yang.

605
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
Captain Feng,

606
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,380
why didn't you

607
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,380
check Xiao Dong's place?

608
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
Why didn't you come here?

609
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,380
That's where we've been.

610
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
I...

611
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,380
I didn't even mention the name.

612
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
How do you know

613
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
it's Uncle Huang?

614
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Yesterday,

615
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,380
I went to the police station.

616
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,380
I heard what you said.

617
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
Who did you hear?

618
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,380
This high-ranking police officer.

619
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
And a beautiful girl.

620
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
You're so sharp.

621
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Is that girl called Uncle Huang?

622
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
How do you know?

623
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
He's from the provincial school.

624
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
I'm working in the school.

625
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
I heard he's very bad.

626
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Okay.

627
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Don't talk nonsense.

628
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Do you hear me?

629
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
I know.

630
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Police officer.

631
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,380
Qin Tian.

632
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,380
It's obvious that Qin Tian did it.

633
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
What does it have to do with Qin Tian?

634
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,380
He's...

635
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
a little worker I hired.

636
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,380
I have two beds in the market.

637
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
One is pork.

638
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
The other is snacks.

639
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Probably...

640
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
it's just...

641
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
a year's worth of money.

642
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
I wanted to hire someone.

643
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,380
But Qin Tian came.

644
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,380
He should have...

645
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
just returned from the south.

646
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
He was very slow.

647
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380
He was very angry.

648
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
His hand was still injured.

649
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Is that okay?

650
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,380
I didn't want to help him.

651
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,380
I found out that he was working very hard...

652
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
after two days.

653
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,380
I didn't give him to you.

654
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
By the way,

655
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Chief Officer.

656
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,380
The car that sent the pig was always on Qin Tian.

657
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,380
It's the bread maker you hired.

658
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
How do you know Huang Shu?

659
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
I...

660
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
don't know him.

661
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,380
I just have a simple contact.

662
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,380
Compared to...

663
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
Stop!

664
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Don't be so stubborn!

665
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,380
You're here.

666
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
You're the one who's been dealing with you.

667
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
I know.

668
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
I know.

669
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,380
I know what you're doing.

670
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
I know.

671
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,380
I know.

672
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,380
Tell me.

673
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,380
Qin Tian has a brother named...

674
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Qin...

675
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
Qin Li.

676
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Yes, yes, yes.

677
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Qin Li.

678
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,380
When I first met Huang Shu,

679
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Qin Li took me there.

680
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
We...

681
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
didn't we have a place to stay...

682
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,380
behind the food cart?

683
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
We were supposed to go shopping.

684
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,380
But we didn't have a place to stay.

685
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
So many people...

686
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
were building houses...

687
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
and used them as a warehouse.

688
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I was also so tired.

689
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
But...

690
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
I didn't go there.

691
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
I was just letting Qin Tian handle it.

692
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
I remember one day,

693
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
I went to get something.

694
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
I found Qin Li...

695
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,380
was carrying this girl inside.

696
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
She was inside.

697
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Look.

698
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
She could help people inside.

699
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,380
She took me as her own home.

700
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,380
It's 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock on January 28th.

701
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
Home?

702
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
Who can prove it?

703
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,380
Mom.

704
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
I didn't think it was that day.

705
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
The mood was good.

706
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Did you make up your mind...

707
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,380
and wait for me?

708
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
No.

709
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
No?

710
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
I'm telling you.

711
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,380
Look at Uncle Huang's beauty.

712
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
Then he became a evil man.

713
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
On January 28th,

714
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,380
you killed him.

715
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Then you asked Qin Tian...

716
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
to help you.

717
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
But I...

718
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
It's Qin Tian.

719
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
Why didn't Qin Tian...

720
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
tell me that?

721
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
How could I report it?

722
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Mom, I was wrong.

723
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
You're afraid that...

724
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
Wan Yi is not Qin Tian.

725
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
He'll come back to revenge you.

726
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,380
Your arm is on his hand, right?

727
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
What's wrong?

728
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
You...

729
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,380
I've only seen you once.

730
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
I don't know why...

731
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
I only have a little bit of a headache...

732
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
in my head.

733
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,380
I don't know why...

734
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
I don't want to forget my son.

735
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,380
I just walk to him.

736
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
I really want to go back to my head that day.

737
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
But I suddenly found out...

738
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,380
that the door was locked.

739
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
When I went in,

740
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
I saw...

741
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,380
the face of the man I've been looking for.

742
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380
Don't do it.

743
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
Don't do it.

744
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Don't do it.

745
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Don't do it.

746
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,380
Don't do it.

747
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
Don't do it.

748
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,380
You're moving like a dog.

749
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I'll kill you.

750
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,380
I also...

751
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
I didn't know...

752
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
what I was going to say.

753
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Where did you come from?

754
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,380
I've never been there before.

755
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
I...

756
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm really a real police officer.

757
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,380
Trust me.

758
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,380
I'm not doing it.

759
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,380
Go to Qin Tian.

760
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Catch him.

761
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
You'll be so defeated.

762
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
By the way, comrade Qin Tian.

763
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,380
Qin Tian is that brother.

764
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,380
He's a mute.

765
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
A mute?

766
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Qin Tian.

767
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Qin Tian.

768
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,380
Are you okay?

769
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
It's just a small amount of water.

770
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,380
It seems that a year has passed since we started.

771
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,380
It's just a small amount of water.

772
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,380
We must start over.

773
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
I don't want it.

774
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
We must separate in college.

775
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
Even if we don't divide in the morning and the evening,

776
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
we can't do it alone.

777
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
You said the same when you lost the game.

778
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,380
I don't think you don't have feelings.

779
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
I'm not a bad person.

780
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,700
How about we

781
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,180
have a coffee together?

782
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
Don't ask him.

783
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,580
Wang Di.

784
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,980
Here.

785
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Come to my office with me.

786
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,780
You look so sad.

787
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,380
You thought I would clean up your mess.

788
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,980
You want to be a contestant.

789
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,780
Do you know that?

790
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,780
Yes.

791
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
Do you want to join?

792
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
What?

793
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,380
You want to join the contest?

794
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,580
You write a piece of paper

795
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,380
and write the words inside.

796
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,980
Are you willing or not?

797
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,980
What are you thinking about?

798
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,380
You must be willing.

799
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,780
You are willing to join?

800
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,780
You want to sign the words

801
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,580
and give me the words in the next week.

802
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,580
You are so ugly.

803
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
Do you want to join?

804
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
You are silly.

805
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
This is a good thing.

806
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,180
Mr. Fan is biased towards you.

807
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,180
Wang Di.

808
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,580
Do you think I will be mad at you?

809
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
You have a lot of power now.

810
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,980
You know nothing about the Jiangu.

811
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,180
If you can win,

812
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,780
you will be able to win.

813
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
What else do you want to say?

814
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,580
Nothing.

815
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,180
High 35, high 36.

816
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,780
How many boys are there?

817
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
What are you doing?

818
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,180
You didn't hear the owner shouting.

819
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,980
Move out.

820
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,980
This kid is so stubborn.

821
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,580
I hate him.

822
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,780
My head hurts.

823
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,380
You.

824
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,780
Don't be so selfish.

825
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
I can tell.

826
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,380
You like Wang Di the most.

827
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,580
You are not familiar with him.

828
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Actually,

829
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,980
I have the biggest advantage.

830
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
I love money.

831
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,580
I am afraid you will break your fat.

832
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Hurry up.

833
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,580
Look at you.

834
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,580
You are so aggressive.

835
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,380
Hurry up.

836
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,980
What's wrong with your face?

837
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,780
You are actually falling.

838
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,380
Enough.

839
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,980
Stop it.

840
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,180
Hurry up.

841
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
Why are you falling so seriously?

842
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,380
Are you calling Wang Shu again?

843
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,780
No.

844
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
Don't hit him.

845
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:07,980
Okay?

846
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,380
Gao Lei.

847
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,180
Come here.

848
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,580
I am leaving.

849
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,780
Let me help you.

850
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,980
Say it.

851
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
Have you finished the book?

852
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,180
Yes.

853
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,180
People leave in a while.

854
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
Turn off the lights.

855
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,980
Lock the door.

856
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
Put the key in my office.

857
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,380
I will go to the bathroom.

858
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
I will go to the bathroom.

859
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Hurry up.

860
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
I am going to the bathroom.

861
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Wang Di.

862
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
Wang Di.

863
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
Wang Di.

864
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
Wang Di.

865
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Wang Di.

866
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
Wang Di.

867
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,780
Wang Di.

868
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
Wang Di.

869
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Hello?

870
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,780
Hello, Jiao Jiao.

871
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Did you see Qin Li today?

872
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,780
No.

873
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I asked Wang Di

874
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
when he left without seeing Qin Li.

875
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
What's wrong?

876
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,780
Why are you looking for him?

877
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
It's okay.

878
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
I just want to give him back.

879
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Don't be anxious.

880
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
Maybe he hasn't gone home yet.

881
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
Where are you?

882
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,780
I am outside.

883
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
Then wait a little longer.

884
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Maybe he will be back soon.

885
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
Okay.

886
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Then I will eat.

887
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
Bye.

888
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
It's too long.

889
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Tell me directly.

890
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
What's the result of the discussion?

891
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
I am on the stage.

892
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Is the discussion good or bad?

893
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
Do you think you are good or bad?

894
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
I don't know.

895
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
At least it's bad.

896
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,780
If there are two words in the human nature,

897
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
it can be said clearly.

898
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,780
There will be no literature.

899
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Wang Di.

900
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,780
If you put one person in the underground room

901
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,780
for a night,

902
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
won't you be killed?

903
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Then we have to see how much space

904
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
and if it's enough.

905
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
What about you?

906
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
I am really...

907
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,780
I am really worried about you.

908
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
I am really...

909
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
I wrote a letter in the novel.

910
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
I am curious.

911
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
My mom is playing tea.

912
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,780
I will play by myself.

913
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,780
I am really worried about you.

914
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
I am really worried about you.

915
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
I am really worried about you.

916
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,780
I am really worried about you.

917
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,780
I am really worried about you.

918
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,780
I am really worried about you.

919
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
I am really worried about you.

920
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,780
I am really worried about you.

921
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
I am really worried about you.

922
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,780
I am really worried about you.

923
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
I am really worried about you.

924
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
I am really worried about you.

925
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,780
I am really worried about you.

926
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
I am really worried about you.

927
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
I am really worried about you.

928
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
I am really worried about you.

929
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
I am really worried about you.

930
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
I am really worried about you.

931
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,780
I am really worried about you.

932
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,780
I am really worried about you.

933
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
I am really worried about you.

934
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
I am really worried about you.

935
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
I am really worried about you.

936
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,780
I am really worried about you.

937
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,780
I am really worried about you.

938
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,780
I am really worried about you.

939
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,780
I am really worried about you.

940
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,780
I am really worried about you.

941
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
I am really worried about you.

942
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,780
I am really worried about you.

943
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
I am really worried about you.

944
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
I am really worried about you.

945
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,780
I am really worried about you.

946
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,780
I am really worried about you.

947
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,780
I am really worried about you.

948
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,780
I am really worried about you.

949
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
