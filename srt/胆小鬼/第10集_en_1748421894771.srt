No!

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why are you here?

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you here?

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you here?

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000

Why are you here?

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why did you come here?

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I didn't come here last night.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He didn't bring his bag last night.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How would I know?

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know why you're angry.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's because Qin Li and Uncle Huang are getting closer.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're jealous.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Fu Yuzheng, you can't do anything else

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
when you're in your head.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You still don't admit it?

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why did you

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
get angry on purpose?

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did I say I was wrong?

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're here.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Report!

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come in!

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Director.

Gao Lei.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's wrong?

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think I left my wallet

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
at the table last night.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're a teacher.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why didn't you put yourself in the way?

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In the future, be more careful.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's too much trouble.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The game is over.

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you, Director.

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Gao Lei!

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Gao Lei!

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
By the way,

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the last time your dad gave the building to the station,

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the school wanted to thank you.

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not too late.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll help you to get the building.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you, dad.

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is what I should do.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
My dad was a schoolgirl.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You don't know, right?

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Half of our school's red holes

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
were made by your dad.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Really?

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I've never heard from my dad.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Besides,

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll ask your dad later.

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The school wanted him to join the parent-child relationship.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Ask him if he's willing to join.

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, I'll ask him.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Go to the meeting.

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We'll talk later.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sister...

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Qing Li!

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you doing? You scared me!

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wang Ji's article is really good.

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Really good.

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It was written out in one night.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it really good?

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let me see.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
People's life is just a fight

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
between a soul and a world.

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There is no black or white place.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There is no gray place.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
One, two, three, four.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
One, two, three, four.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Qing Li!

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey!

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Which class are you in?

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Class 35.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why don't you wear school uniform?

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You...

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You didn't quit school before.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why did you come back?

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll see your classmates.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're not a student anymore.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't be so stubborn.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll see the teacher.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let the teacher call you!

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Qing Li!

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Qing Li!

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Help!

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Help!

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Qing Li!

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Qing Li!

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let go!

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Qing Li!

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Qing Li!

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go away!

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He just wanted to kill me!

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He wants to kill you!

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Gao Lei!

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're not a man anymore!

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why did you let me come here?

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm not done with you!

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Uncle Fang, what's wrong with this?

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You asked him!

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He left the house yesterday!

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Gao Lei, what's wrong with you?

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I didn't mean it!

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I didn't know he was still there!

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So you're the one who locked him up?

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're the one who locked him up!

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Stop it!

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You locked him up!

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Have you seen him?

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You were there, right?

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're not Yu Ying's student!

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You just dropped me!

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Qing Ling!

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't move!

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let go of me!

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Qing Ling!

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Qing Ling!

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Qing Ling!

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Qing Ling!

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Qing Ling!

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Uncle Fang, don't do this!

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Qing Ling!

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let go of me!

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let go of me!

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let go of me!

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Stop it!

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you Uncle Fang?

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No!

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you doing?

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Get out of here!

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What are you doing?

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Call an ambulance!

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wang Jie, are you still here?

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, I'm not!

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Go with them!

249
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They're your friends!

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Get out of here!

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Get out of here!

252
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Get out of here!

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't want to be with you!

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Uncle Fang,

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
what's going on?

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wang Jie, tell me first.

257
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know.

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What did you see?

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I didn't see anything because of my eyes.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay, okay.

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll go with you.

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll go with you.

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, okay.

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Qing Ling,

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
if you're willing to say it,

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
just say it.

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, okay.

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just do it!

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You two are good friends!

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well,

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
do we still have a class?

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just say it if you have any problem.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll clean up later.

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why didn't you hear me?

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Mr. Yu asked you two to say it!

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
How do you say it?

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Mr. Qin,

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
do you report the criticism

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
or do you remember it?

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then you have to make a big mistake.

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I guarantee it's fair.

282
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No one can guarantee it's fair.

283
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This world is not fair at all.

284
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What you can't do

285
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
is not to say it casually.

286
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Qing Ling,

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
how can you talk to Mr. Qin?

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Qing Ling, you're too much!

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Mr. Yu,

290
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He didn't mean it.

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I did it on purpose!

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're a child!

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Qing Ling, go back first.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll find you later!

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I told you to go!

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I told you to go!

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What's wrong with you?

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're really not good at this!

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're so naive!

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're going to see the fight with Mr. Chen?

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're going to be fired!

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're a chef!

305
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You don't know it!

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Besides,

307
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
can you be like Qin Ling?

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know why I'm different!

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't control Qing Ling!

310
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can control you!

311
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You wait for this.

312
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's talk about this first.

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Please thank me.

314
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Go back and do it again.

315
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Pay attention to your words.

316
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Write it well.

317
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Give me this afternoon.

318
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
By the way,

319
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
the payment is 80 yuan.

320
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You have a sister.

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why do you still want money?

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You didn't tell me yesterday.

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I forgot!

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll send you out this afternoon.

325
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll pay you the payment first.

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Hurry up!

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm so worried!

328
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mr. Fan,

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Qin Ling,

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you have to clean up your house.

331
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm just like her.

333
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll clean up her house.

334
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She'll clean up me soon.

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll treat you to a bowl of noodles.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You can go with her.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's go, Qin Ling.

338
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll go.

339
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Come on!

340
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm going to treat you to a meal.

341
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This is for you.

342
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You need to eat at the air-conditioner.

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm not hungry.

344
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm just thinking about my fear.

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know where to go.

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wang Di,

347
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
when you were at the gate of the high-rise building,

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
did you see it?

349
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't believe you.

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I believe you.

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like before.

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I didn't see it.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Wang Di can lie to you?

354
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why don't you tell your wife the truth?

355
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let her come in and sit down.

356
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You don't need to tell me.

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Wait!

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't you trust me also?

359
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But why do you get angry with teenage kids?

360
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've never met him.

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You all believe me and you're bad guys.

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Then I will.

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
There is no explanation.

364
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No matter what you say,

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you can't talk to Uncle Huang like that.

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You are too much.

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I was wronged.

368
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I feel bad too.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Fang Di,

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
can you take me as your buddy?

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If Yuli and Fa are in a relationship,

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
do you want to do something with me?

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't want to do anything.

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't worry.

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm not the kind of person they say.

376
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Then can you not be friends with your little brother?

377
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He has been friends with me.

378
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Can you just take care of me?

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
After all, Qin Li is my best buddy.

380
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I understand.

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
In your heart,

382
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I can never compare with Qin Li.

383
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm going to put my dad's wallet.

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll bring it every day.

386
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll just leave it here.

387
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll be a treasure in the future.

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll take it as my buddy.

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is the process of all the解體.

391
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Have you seen it clearly?

392
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll check it tomorrow.

393
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay, class is over.

394
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Qin Li.

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
See you, teacher.

396
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll give you a ride.

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll take you to the river.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I guess you'll be the sky.

399
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Unfortunately, Yun Duo only has the wings for me.

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'll be able to fly

401
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
to places where I can't even catch a single star.

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What are you writing?

403
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Not even me.

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Give it to me.

405
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why?

406
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Are you going to keep it?

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm going to keep it.

408
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll keep it.

409
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll keep it.

410
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm going to take it.

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm going to take it.

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm going to keep it.

413
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm going to keep it.

414
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why are you being so mean to me?

415
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Are you two crazy?

416
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm going to fly to places

417
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
where I can't even catch a single star.

418
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Guess

419
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
what's going on there.

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I guess

421
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
it's as beautiful as you.

422
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can't say anything.

423
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You have to be like this.

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Gao Lei has promised me

425
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
he won't tell the teacher about you.

426
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're so annoying.

427
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why are you like this?

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What's wrong with me?

429
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Qian Li!

430
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Qian Li!

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How much is it?

432
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's just a little bit.

433
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Do you want spicy?

434
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No.

435
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No?

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Here.

437
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's 7 yuan.

438
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
One more.

439
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Give me all of them.

440
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
How much is it?

441
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
80 yuan.

442
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
How much is it?

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
80 yuan.

444
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
80?

445
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's a lot.

446
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Take this and put it in the pocket.

447
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll take it for you.

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.

449
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's good that we're moving here.

450
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The business is going to be the same.

451
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Dad, I'll help you.

452
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, no.

453
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll give you a hand.

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't give me that.

455
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I think Mr. Fan

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is really good at this.

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's a good actor.

458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
How is it?

459
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's just like that.

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He's going to the competition.

461
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And he's giving you money.

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And he's the only one.

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can't say that.

464
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Give me a few plates.

465
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay.

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll take it.

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Boss, come here.

468
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Come on.

469
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Come on.

470
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you want some?

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
No, thanks.

472
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The sauce is not too sweet.

473
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's sweet in the heart.

474
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's sweet every time.

475
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know the heart the best.

476
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're so far away from me.

477
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What do you want me to say?

478
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Dad,

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Qin Li has always considered you

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
as his most important friend.

482
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He's more important than anyone else.

483
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Did he tell you that?

484
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He doesn't like to express.

485
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But you must understand.

486
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I know

487
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that since I left,

488
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
you two have been arguing.

489
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm the reason for this.

490
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Dad,

491
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It has nothing to do with you.

493
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Even if you don't want to admit it,

494
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I understand.

495
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But can you please take care of Qin Li?

496
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You know his personality the best.

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That night,

498
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
he walked around the whole night

499
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
alone in the air.

500
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I didn't even think about how scared he was.

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He didn't really like you.

502
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It was because of Gao Lei.

503
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Actually, he was scared.

504
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
He was afraid that he would walk away from you.

505
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Since I was little,

506
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I sent him to school

507
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to fight for him.

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I was afraid that

509
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I would be able to carry all the things for him.

510
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But people always want to learn

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to grow up by themselves.

512
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Do you think so?

513
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Because I was close to Gao Lei,

514
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
he was angry.

515
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Don't you think he is selfish?

516
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Qin Li is always my best friend.

517
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This will never change.

518
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But can't I have other friends

519
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and other lives?

520
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
People are destined to walk away from each other.

521
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That's how you grow up.

522
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Whether you accept it or not,

523
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that's all.

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Qin Li can't be so passionate anymore.

525
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Go back.

526
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Uncle Huang,

527
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
actually,

528
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
you are more important to Qin Li

529
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
than I am.

530
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Qin Li.

531
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Are you still angry with me?

532
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I saw you in the early morning

533
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and you were in school.

534
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I was worried about you doing stupid things.

535
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I just wanted to make you angry.

536
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I didn't think that much.

537
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's my fault.

538
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Don't be angry, okay?

540
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Don't be angry, okay?

544
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Can you

545
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
stop dancing in the future?

546
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Are you angry because of Gao Lin's words?

547
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Don't you think

548
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm very embarrassed about dancing?

549
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
No.

550
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I can't stand it.

551
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But I don't care.

552
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't care what kind of shame

553
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I have for Li Xiao's efforts.

554
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I remember someone told me

555
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
that you should never care

556
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
about others' eyes

557
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and you shouldn't be embarrassed.

558
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Didn't you say that?

559
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Didn't I promise you?

560
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll resign

561
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
after I pay the first year's tuition

562
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and living expenses

563
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
for my university.

564
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Have you forgotten?

565
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I haven't.

566
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm just angry with myself.

567
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I can't help you.

568
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If it wasn't for you,

569
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I wouldn't know

570
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
where I would be in the future.

571
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Anyway,

572
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll go wherever you go.

573
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Just say it like that.

574
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Don't regret it.

575
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Did you hear that?

576
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You said something.

577
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If you don't say anything,

578
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll leave.

579
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'll go.

580
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll go.

581
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Why are you back so late?

582
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Why didn't you go home?

583
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Huang Shui was looking for me in the school.

584
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I know.

585
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I know you're not angry.

586
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't believe you.

587
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But if something happens to you,

588
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll go.

589
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Huang Di.

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's take a solo.

591
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What?

592
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Take a solo.

593
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Play basketball.

594
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What's next?

595
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Go upstairs.

596
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll wait for you upstairs.

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What's the matter?

598
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Pass.

599
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll pass.

600
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Your room.

601
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay.

602
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Can you play basketball

603
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and play in the cabinet?

604
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll count on you.

605
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Here you go.

606
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Come on.

607
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Come on.

608
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'll let you go.

609
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You don't know who taught you to play basketball.

610
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I don't know where you're going.

611
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Get up.

612
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Come on.

613
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Come on.

614
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Are you crazy?

615
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Are you out of your mind?

616
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I won.

617
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Are you sick?

618
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I lost.

619
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You lost.

620
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Who wants to play basketball with you?

621
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's play basketball together.

622
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay.

623
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Let's play together.

624
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Let's play together.

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Okay.

626
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You won.

627
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You can count on me.

628
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay.

629
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sorry.

630
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The scarf looks good on you.

631
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I didn't bring it.

632
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I bought it first.

633
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We have an appointment.

634
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Where are you going?

635
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
To the toilet.

636
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Give me a small one.

637
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Who told you that?

638
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
No one told me.

639
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I can see the food.

640
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That girl is nice.

641
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I like her.

642
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Shiyuan.

643
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's the first time I've met a girl.

644
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Go there at night.

645
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Understand?

646
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I heard you.

647
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Go there at night.

648
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Don't let the door open.

649
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay.

650
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I knew it was the first time.

651
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Fuyuan.

652
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Hello.

653
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Can I help you?

654
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Can you call me?

655
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I can't.

656
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Ma Lu is calling me.

657
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The last call from Mr. Huang.

658
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's an IZI call.

659
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Mr. Huang, the car in front.

660
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hello.

661
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Do you need anything?

662
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Water.

663
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay.

664
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm going to the toilet.

665
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'll go with you.

666
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Okay.

667
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Okay.

668
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll see you later.

669
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Okay.

670
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'll see you later.

671
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Bye.

672
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Bye.

673
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Bye.

674
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Bye.

675
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Bye.

676
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Bye.

677
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Bye.

678
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Bye.

679
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Bye.

680
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Bye.

681
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Bye.

682
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Bye.

683
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Bye.

684
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Bye.

685
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Bye.

686
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Bye.

687
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Bye.

688
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Master, don't be so close.

689
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Be careful.

690
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You're a big idiot.

691
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I have to follow him.

692
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Little Hu.

693
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What are you doing?

694
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Police.

695
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Master, use your phone.

696
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't have a phone.

697
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Why don't you go down the car and find a place to fight?

698
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't dare to.

699
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Master, you go first.

700
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Nine, four, five, seven, five.

701
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm going to the toilet.

702
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm going to the toilet.

703
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm going to the toilet.

704
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm going to the toilet.

705
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm going to the toilet.

706
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm going to the toilet.

707
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm going to the toilet.

708
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm going to the toilet.

709
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm going to the toilet.

710
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm going to the toilet.

711
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm going to the toilet.

712
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm going to the toilet.

713
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm going to the toilet.

714
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm going to the toilet.

715
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm going to the toilet.

716
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Go...

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Brother.

718
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Where is this?

719
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:17,200
Master, my army is

720
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
Little bro, FGO, can't stay here!

721
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,720
When we get to the state of FGO,

722
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,720
we need to create courage and給 the priority.

723
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,360
Right now,

724
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,160
the sun is up and we're beautiful.

725
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,400
Still,

726
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,880
I want to chop my hands and eat.

727
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,880
I want to eat.

728
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,200
Hey you,

729
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,040
none of you can eat!

730
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,120
Come on!

731
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,080
Don't be Christmas.

732
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
I'm not a thief.

733
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm just a little old man.

734
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
I'm just a little old man.

735
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
Hold it.

736
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
It's right here.

737
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm not going anywhere.

738
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Do you hear me?

739
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
No, you said...

740
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
The case of the police is your duty.

741
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Do you know that?

742
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Fine.

743
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
I'll wait for you for ten minutes.

744
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
You haven't come back yet.

745
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
I really have to go.

746
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
By the way, do you have any tools?

747
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
I have.

748
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Here, take it.

749
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
I'm sorry.

750
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,200
So,

751
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,480
ハ

752
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,360
庭

753
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,200
Once the dogs recedes, go to the store and find all the譜

754
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,240
They will cover the slippery road

755
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,320
The city will not enjoy

756
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,760
reinforcements

757
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
hacen

758
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They have no family

759
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,840
Can we run away with Qin Jia

760

Qin Yu falls who on Earth

761
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,200
But Qin Jia will declare that

762
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
I do not have any evidence

763
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,520

764
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,760
In the high Lish adjusting room

765
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,480
They took him away.

766
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,040
There's only one way.

767
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,200
Find the luggage and go to the police station.

768
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,600
I just called Xiao Dong.

His phone is off.

770
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,000
He can't even call.

771
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
Don't bother.

772
