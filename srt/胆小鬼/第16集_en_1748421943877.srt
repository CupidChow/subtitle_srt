episode 16

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
I'll take you with me

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,600
and look forward to the new year.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
Please accept the new year.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,840
Now, let's share

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
the new year's message to the listeners.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,840
Can you hear it?

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,200
The message from Yu Xiaoxue,

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,840
who studied in Shendong.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,160
I hope that time will pass.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm trying to answer it.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,440
The happy time of year is coming.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,240
I wish that

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,040
we can have a bright future

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,680
in the new year.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,200
Now, from Xiaohui,

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,360
the rural girl from Shendong.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,240
I hope that the new year

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,560
can be more birthday-like.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,800
It's best to be here.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
It's okay.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,400
After I buy you

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,080
the best listening equipment,

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,560
you'll hear it.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
But don't worry.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,520
It's not a birthday gift

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,560
I said I'd give you.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm not that petty.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,280
You can guess it again.

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,360
What do I give you?

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,200
Can you guess it?

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,840
Yiyang,

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,040
Let me explain.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,440
I'll send you

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm sorry.

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Er.

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
You're prepared.

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
This order has agreed.

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,640
That's enough.

95
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,140
Don't worry.

96
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,140
Hurry up.

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,680
I still have this田.

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,680
I'm going to gather again.

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
You're afraid that I want to have a LAN play

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
on my Sznych.

101
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,440
What's the problem?

102
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,320
Just got on top of the ship.

103
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,800
How do you know?

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,000
My girI

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,640
trust

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,800
It's important for us to agree before anything.

107
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,720
Here.

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,200
Tea time here.

109
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,160
Here you go.

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,100
Last time

111
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,700
It's been three years.

112
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,500
Since you became a official,

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,300
the official family has been white.

114
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
White.

115
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,300
What?

116
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,500
You don't think so?

117
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm waiting for your pressure to be higher.

118
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
You'll understand.

119
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm not in the mood for it.

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,300
Okay. I'll leave.

121
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,300
Hey, tell me more.

122
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm just curious.

123
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,300
What?

124
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I didn't get the case of Qin Li.

125
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,100
Who did it?

126
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,300
Yin Peng.

127
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,500
As for Qin Li, he has only one life.

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,700
It's also Yin Peng.

129
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
For ten years,

130
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,100
Qin Li has been pretending to sell snakes online.

131
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,700
He's helping people to raise them.

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,700
But I don't know what method to design Yin Peng's set.

133
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
He's been contacting Yin Peng online.

134
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,900
Yin Peng really transferred the snake to him.

135
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,500
What Qin Li can do is wait for Yin Peng to come back.

136
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,300
But this is only ten years.

137
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
So it's not that you first find Yin Peng.

138
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,100
After Yin Peng returned to Shenzhen,

139
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,700
the first one found Qin Li and gave him back to him.

140
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,300
It's the first time Qin Li went to the Dutch village with Yin Peng.

141
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,500
He's just about to meet Yin Peng's master.

142
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,900
He killed the wild boar and buried the lion.

143
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,300
Qin Li should have been a temporary miracle.

144
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
He designed the following actions.

145
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,900
He dug out the body and took it to the big pit of the ghost building.

146
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,900
He wanted to re-enact the Royal Uncle case

147
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
and force us to do the same.

148
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,300
He wanted to give him a clear answer.

149
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Only I can give him a clear answer.

150
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,300
Today, when he wanted to bury the Royal Uncle,

151
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,700
he met the tea shopkeeper and asked for a clear answer.

152
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,900
He called Yin Peng and asked him to avenge the Royal Uncle.

153
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,500
The price of the tea shopkeeper was 50,000 yuan.

154
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,300
But no one thought of putting the little lantern in.

155
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,700
After Qin Li tied Yin Peng, I locked him up for a few days.

156
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,300
Why didn't he kill him directly?

157
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,300
Because Qin Li wanted to find the Lu Xiang Dan

158
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,700
and the Royal Uncle Lu Xiang Dan.

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,300
So, before the Royal Uncle's birthday,

160
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,500
Yin Peng couldn't die.

161
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Qin Li couldn't die either.

162
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,500
Did you find the Lu Xiang Dan?

163
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,700
Long'an…

164
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Are you done影?

165
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,980
No, only I saw you.

166
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,900
Secondly,

167
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,220
we have to have a bath day when we arrive.

168
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,060
Well.

169
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,180
We can drink wine and drink wine to celebrate the 1st of February.

170
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,020
How about the ceremony?

171
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,060
Yes.

172
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,420
I have a mother.

173
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,060
Can't you help me put down the cabinet?

174
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,540
Okay.

175
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,980
Thank you very much.

176
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,300
Thank you, uncle.

177
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,300
Hello?

178
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,300
I want to see the former monitor.

179
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,300
I found your phone number from the student's home.

180
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,300
I was wondering if it would change the number after so many years.

181
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,300
So I called and tried.

182
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,300
There are many people in this industry who don't change the number.

183
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Yes, I'm lucky.

184
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Otherwise, I don't know how to find you.

185
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Actually, I'm a little nervous to call this number.

186
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
The person who should be checked is me.

187
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
I've been in the high school for three years.

188
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I've never attended a family meeting.

189
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm a non-scientific father.

190
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Don't say that.

191
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Back then, there was a foreign bureau.

192
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,300
I understand your busyness.

193
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Teacher Ma, what's the matter?

194
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,300
I'm a mediateer.

195
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Right.

196
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Thank you.

197
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,300
This news is from my翅 hatte ID card.

198
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Is there anything else to report?

199
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,300
The Curry Master is leading security services in Yuying.

200
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
Director Chen gives the letter directly.

201
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Why?

202
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
I've already given the principal the money.

203
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
I want to give him a piece of material.

204
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
To the principal's leader.

205
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
You know many people, right?

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Please help me.

207
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Actually, now think about it.

208
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,300
What Yang Ju told me that year was really right.

209
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
What did Yang Ju tell you?

210
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
There's a person who belongs to me.

211
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,300
No matter how much you earn,

212
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,300
the child's birth is all a waste.

213
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Whether I'm a police officer in the family,

214
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
or an elder,

215
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
I can't be ashamed.

216
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Actually, if I could hear Yang Ju's voice that year,

217
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
I should be the one who woke up now.

218
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,300
I'm the one who should be the teacher.

219
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Although they're only 17 or 18,

220
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
they're all children.

221
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Because I'm a child,

222
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
I didn't look after them.

223
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
In these years,

224
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
I'm on the stage every day.

225
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
I don't dare to look at the face of those children.

226
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
I think I owe them.

227
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,300
I also owe them an apology.

228
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I know it's a little late to wake up now.

229
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Right?

230
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
It's not late.

232
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,300
There's always a child who needs to be looked after.

233
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Even if it's just looking after them,

234
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,300
don't let yourself regret it.

235
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
This dress,

236
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I bought it back from Guangzhou that year.

237
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,300
I remember that

238
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,300
it was already 1.7 meters long that year.

239
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
It's taller than me.

240
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
I'm so grateful to you.

241
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
I've been staying till now.

242
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Aunt, it's not me.

243
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
It's another good friend of ours.

244
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
He's been staying.

245
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Is he the boy named Qin Li?

246
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
You knew Qin Li long ago?

247
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
I've never seen him.

248
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,300
He's been listening to his name on Xiao Shu's phone.

249
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
And you and another boy,

250
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Wang Di.

251
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Xiao Shu said

252
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
you were his best friend.

253
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
I could hear it from the sound of the piano.

254
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Xiao Shu was very happy.

255
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,300
He seemed to be not so happy

256
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
since he was a child.

257
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
I think it's because

258
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
you good friends are good to him.

259
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
After so many years,

260
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
you're still young.

261
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
Xiao Shu will be there

262
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
to protect you.

263
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Aunt,

264
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
I won't forget.

265
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
I'll never forget.

266
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
I'm sorry, Uncle Wang.

267
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I don't deserve to be his friend.

268
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
You're so silly.

269
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Aunt,

270
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
thank you.

271
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Thank you, aunt.

272
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
The battery is out.

273
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Aunt, take good care of yourself.

274
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
I'll come often to see you.

275
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
I'll come to pick you up when you come back.

276
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Jiang, have you ever said

277
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
you look like Uncle Wang?

278
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
You were so confused.

279
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
I almost didn't tell you.

280
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Wang Ruh, you should go.

281
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Jiang,

282
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
you're a good boy.

283
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,300
You're all good kids.

284
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
This is imported from Germany.

287
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
It's the best.

288
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
This is the best.

289
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
This is the best.

290
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
Okay.

291
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Jiang.

292
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Drink a bottle, please.

293
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
I was a little Cross inside.

294
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
I didn't expect this.

295
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
I bought you one.

296
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,780
Lay down,

297
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,260
okay?

298
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
No, no.

299
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,500
At this size.

300
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,500
Men are screeches of fruit.

301
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,420
Yeah.

302
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,140
Every one of you is 3000.

303
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,140
My mother will kick you in the stomach.

304
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,860
Such a heart-chasing–

305
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,640
First love

306
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,460
First love

307
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,180
Zhenshan

308
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,620
only to understand my own feelings.

309
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,540
Become the best of me?

310
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,520
Director.

311
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,880
Do you want to deaf me?

312
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,280
What's wrong?

313
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
I know we're late.

315
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
I bought you a new machine.

316
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,180
But I don't have enough money.

317
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
If I have a boss,

318
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
I'll be blind.

319
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
But as long as I'm a big brother,

320
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,180
I'll give me ten thousand yuan for a meal.

321
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm sorry.

322
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't know.

323
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
He locked me up.

324
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
He took me.

325
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,180
I don't know how many people he has.

326
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
I'm so scared.

327
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,180
I can only treat this as a dream.

328
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
I closed my eyes.

329
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,180
I was like you.

330
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,180
I wanted to see you smile.

331
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,180
I thought you could hear me when you put on the headphones.

332
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,180
I can't lose anything.

333
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,180
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,180
I'm sorry.

335
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,180
I...

336
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,180
What's wrong?

337
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
I'm sorry.

338
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm begging you.

340
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
I don't want to cry.

342
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,180
I don't want to live.

343
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Qi Li.

344
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Qi Li.

345
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
Qi Li.

346
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Qi Li.

347
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
Qi Li.

348
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,180
I want to take you back to the mountain.

349
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,180
I want to take you back to the mountain.

350
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Qi Li.

351
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Qi Li.

352
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
Qi Li.

353
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Qi Li.

354
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
Let me go.

355
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Let me go.

356
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Qi Li.

357
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,180
I want you to remember

358
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
my last face.

359
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
My life.

360
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,180
I'm laughing at it.

361
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm telling you.

362
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,180
I want you to see it.

363
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Qi Li.

364
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,180
Qi Li.

365
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Qi Li.

366
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
Qi Li.

367
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
Qi Li.

368
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Qi Li.

369
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,180
Qi Li.

370
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
Qi Li.

371
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Qi Li.

372
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Do you still remember that poem?

373
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
If I could break a heart,

374
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
I wouldn't have a life.

375
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,180
If I could get rid of the pain,

376
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
or get rid of the sadness of being alone,

377
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,180
or help a stray bird

378
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,180
to return to its nest,

379
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
I wouldn't have to go to the end of the world.

380
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
I knew you didn't forget.

381
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Hello.

382
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
What's wrong with your hand?

383
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
Don't be nervous.

384
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
You won't have my arm.

385
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
It's just a memory.

386
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
No.

387
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,180
It should be said

388
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
that it's a memory.

389
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
You've drunk too much.

390
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
No.

391
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Fu Yu.

392
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
One more bottle of beer.

393
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Stop drinking.

394
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
Wait a minute.

395
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,180
I'll bring you a small bowl of wine.

396
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
I feel sad.

397
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,180
I'm not good.

398
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,180
I'm not as good as you.

399
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,180
I just feel

400
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
that I'm not good enough.

401
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
I feel

402
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,180
that I'm dead.

403
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
I'm buried by someone.

404
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
It's not right.

405
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,180
I buried them.

406
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
I don't know

407
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
where I'm buried.

408
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
I can't see

409
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
any place.

410
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
I dare not say it's painful

411
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
because I don't have a face like this.

412
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
I've been thinking

413
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
that the night that the city

414
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,180
was on the empty road

415
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
is it the same as my feeling now?

416
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
It must be different.

417
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
I'm not good enough for him.

418
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Do you think I look like

419
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Mr. Huang?

420
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,180
I don't think so.

421
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,180
Stop talking.

422
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
Not at all.

423
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
Stop talking.

424
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
He looks so pretty.

425
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
Come on.

426
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Let's drink.

427
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Feng Jiejiao.

428
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
From today on,

429
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,180
let's not contact each other anymore.

430
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
What do you mean?

431
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
I don't understand.

432
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
What I mean is

433
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
that

434
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,180
we should never contact each other again.

435
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,180
Then give me a reason.

436
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
What is the reason?

437
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
I know what you mean.

438
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
I'm your bastard!

439
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
I'm your bastard.

440
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,180
They are just a bastard.

441
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,180
They are just a bastard.

442
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
They are just a bastard.

443
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
They are just a bastard.

444
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,180
They are just a bastard.

445
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Come on, let's drink a toast to the two bastards.

446
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Let's go to Qingqing village.

447
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,180
Let's have a happy time in the summer.

448
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,180
Let's go to Qingqing village together.

449
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,180
Okay.

450
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,180
Qingqing village.

451
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Cheers.

452
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,180
Cheers.

453
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
Wang Di.

454
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Are we the best friends?

455
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Yes.

456
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Are we forever?

457
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Forever.

458
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
Then I'll tell you a secret.

459
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,180
Don't tell anyone else, okay?

460
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
Okay.

461
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Wang Di.

462
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,180
I'm sorry.

463
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
Wang Di.

464
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
I'm pregnant.

465
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm pregnant.

466
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
I'm pregnant.

467
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,180
Do you know why I married you to a beautiful woman?

468
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Because I hope you can have more white hair

469
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,180
after you grow up.

470
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
More white hair.

471
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180
Don't be buried by this world.

472
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
I promise you.

473
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
I will protect you well.

474
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,180
I won't give you many poems.

475
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Guess what I'm going to fly to?

476
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,180
I guess you will fly to the sky.

477
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,180
But Yun Duo is only my wings.

478
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
I'm going to fly to a place

479
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,180
that even Qingqing can't catch up with.

480
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Guess what the scene will be?

481
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,180
I guess it's like you.

482
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
How do you think?

483
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Do you think it's good?

484
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
I think it's good.

485
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,180
You will think it's good too.

486
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
I'm pregnant.

487
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,180
Why did you write all of these girls?

488
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
I don't like them.

489
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Don't look at her.

490
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
Because it's you who wrote them.

491
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
We also look at women.

492
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,180
It's up to you.

493
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,180
Okay.

494
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Come on.

495
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Don't look at them.

496
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Turn off the light.

497
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
And one more.

498
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Okay.

499
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
Okay.

500
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
I'm going to turn it off.

501
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
One more.

502
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
Hurry up, Uncle Hong.

503
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,180
Coming.

504
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Okay, you two take a shower. Hurry up.

505
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,180
Happy birthday to you.

506
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,180
Happy birthday to you.

507
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,180
Happy birthday to you.

508
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Happy birthday to you.

509
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,180
Happy birthday to you.

510
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Girl, girl, girl.

511
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Why is it all gone?

512
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Don't always be so serious.

513
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
This is a poor thing.

514
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
You have to pay for it.

515
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,180
This is too troublesome.

516
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,180
Don't you understand?

517
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
You should use it yourself.

518
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
I think my old phone is pretty good.

519
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Besides, my old phone

520
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
is too crowded on the way.

521
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
It's too troublesome to drive.

522
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
You know?

523
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,180
I'll help you to get it back later.

524
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Your old phone has been used for almost ten years.

525
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
It's not even for people who are popular.

526
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,180
I brought this back from abroad.

527
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
You should learn new things.

528
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,180
You should have ten generations.

529
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Didn't your mom buy it?

530
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
No way.

531
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
I bought it from my old classmates.

532
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,180
Really?

533
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,180
Why are you lying?

534
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
It's expensive.

535
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,180
You can't get it back.

536
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
You should use it.

537
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
You have to beg me for it.

538
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I'll put a WeChat on you later.

539
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Add my brother to the account.

540
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,180
Now everyone is talking about it.

541
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,180
It's convenient.

542
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,180
You can even put on a photo.

543
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
Let's eat.

544
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,180
What's WeChat?

545
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,180
QQ, you know?

546
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,180
It's like QQ with a high level.

547
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,180
I'll teach you later.

548
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,180
You'll know when you use it.

549
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,180
Simple.

550
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,180
Try my dish.

551
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Come on.

552
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,180
Hey.

553
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
You and Wang Di are good.

554
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,180
Yes.

555
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
You're a mother.

556
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
Be mature.

557
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Don't always be a child.

558
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,180
You know what I mean.

559
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,180
I just think that

560
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,180
this year,

561
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Wang Di has changed.

562
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,180
What do you mean?

563
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
I can't say it.

564
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,180
I'm just a little worried.

565
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,180
I'm just worried about you.

566
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,180
Dad.

567
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
My father used to say that

568
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,180
when you're alive,

569
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,180
you should be the one who's afraid of being hurt.

570
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,180
As long as you're alive,

571
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,180
you have to move forward.

572
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,180
You can let go.

573
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,180
You can't let go.

574
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,180
You're just a little worried.

575
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,180
You can't let go.

576
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
You have to force yourself to let go.

577
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
If you can't let go,

578
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,180
let's work together.

579
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,180
Let's eat.

580
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,180
How about Xiaobin?

581
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,180
Good.

582
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,180
Xiaobin.

583
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,180
Xiaobin.

584
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,180
What's wrong with you?

585
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,180
I'm sorry.

586
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
Xiaobin.

587
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,180
Xiaobin.

588
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,180
Brother,

589
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,180
will you fish?

590
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,180
It's been a while since we've met.

591
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
You always talk to me.

592
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,680
Honestly, it's not special at all to come in.

593
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:33,400
After all, I had a communication problem that night.

594
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,700
Director Ning you are so cold.

595
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,700
I've been with you for six years.

596
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,700
Don't delay your meeting.

597
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,700
I'll take care of you.

598
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,700
I'm planning to do it tomorrow.

599
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
I'll put some stuff on you.

600
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,700
I didn't let you know.

601
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Don't worry.

602
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,700
Who cares about it after a year?

603
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,700
You don't have to.

604
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,700
Are you worried?

605
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
I've been with you for more than ten years.

606
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
What are you afraid of?

607
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,700
Who would think

608
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,700
that I've been looking for ten years

609
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,700
in my own eyes?

610
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,700
I've been with you for ten years.

611
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,700
I haven't been seen by anyone.

612
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,700
He said that he was alive.

613
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Yes.

614
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,700
I've been with you for a long time.

615
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,700
What are the children like?

616
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,700
They are all children.

617
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,700
They are all a bunch of strangers.

618
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,700
I'm a bunch of strangers.

619
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Okay, I'll leave now.

620
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
I have a case in my hand.

621
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
Hurry up and move the house out of here.

622
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Okay.

623
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
Liu Ping.

624
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,700
Be steady.

625
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Don't worry.

626
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Brother.

627
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,700
Brother.

628
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,700
Brother.

629
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
Brother.

630
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,700
Uncle Feng.

631
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,700
I think I can call you this way too.

632
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,700
You have told me ten years ago

633
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,700
that we shouldn't have met in an pronounceable manner.

634
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,700
It must be more than ten years.

635
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,700
Mr. Fus.

636
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,700
Does it suit you?

637
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,700
No.

638
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,700
No, no.

639
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,700
Very right.

640
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,700
Remember that.

641
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:51,700
I chose to change the truth in my own way for ten years.

642
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,700
This is what I owe my brother.

643
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,700
But I still have to apologize to you.

644
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,700
Everyone should pay for what they have done for themselves.

645
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,700
And the proof that I have already done,

646
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,700
I admit that I have hated this world.

647
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,700
Later, I realized that

648
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,700
I am not the one who has hated this world.

649
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,700
But the beauty hidden in my life.

650
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,700
The beauty that reminds me of my life that I once had.

651
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,700
I once promised my most beloved to Chen Luo.

652
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,700
I will never forget those beauty.

653
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,700
Unfortunately,

654
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,700
now I am in this way to thank you.

655
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,700
Everything I have done

656
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,700
is just to keep a smile.

657
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
I don't allow those dirty,

658
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,700
despicable, evil eyes to stare at me again.

659
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,700
Ten years ago, you said that

660
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,700
it is a bad thing to do.

661
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Indeed,

662
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,700
everything should not be like this.

663
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,700
Now I have no hatred or resentment in my heart.

664
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
I just think differently.

665
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,700
Is the disease the most softest choice?

666
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,700
I believe that one day,

667
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,700
that little dragon will give me an answer.

668
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,700
The End

669
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Today,

670
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,700
I have to do it.

671
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,700
I am coming.

672
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,700
Liu,

673
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,700
Liu,

674
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
how long have you been here?

675
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,700
I have been here for a long time.

676
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
I haven't hugged you.

677
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
I haven't hugged you.

678
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,700
You are also here.

679
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,700
Liu, you should go to the hospital.

680
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,700
I am here.

681
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,700
I have hugged you.

682
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,700
Are you nervous?

683
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,700
A little.

684
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,700
I am not good.

685
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,700
It's okay.

686
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,700
It's normal.

687
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,700
I was still a kid when I was a father.

688
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,700
When I was two years old,

689
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,700
I was the one who was the one who was the father.

690
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
Life is completely different.

691
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,700
Dad,

692
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,700
are you still afraid of me?

693
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,700
Of course, I am.

694
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,700
I am afraid that I am not well-behaved.

695
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,700
I am afraid that I am in a bad mood.

696
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,700
I am afraid that I am not good enough.

697
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,700
I am afraid that I am out of control.

698
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,700
My courage suddenly became smaller.

699
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,700
Being a parent is the most difficult thing in human life.

700
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
Huang Di,

701
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,700
you are a smart child.

702
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Your heart is kind.

703
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,700
Otherwise,

704
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,700
I will not give you the head of uncle.

705
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
Understand?

706
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,700
I heard from uncle that

707
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,700
you are in a bad mood this year.

708
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,700
But you are now a father.

709
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,700
You must be careful.

710
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
Dad,

711
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,700
I want to ask you,

712
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,700
where are the people who will touch you every day?

713
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,700
The best brother.

714
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,700
Dad,

715
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,700
why are you hiding here?

716
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,700
I am waiting for you in the room.

717
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,700
Let's go.

718
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Dad.

719
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,700
Dad.

720
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,700
Dad.

721
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,700
Dad.

722
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Dad.

723
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
Dad.

724
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,700
Dad.

725
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,700
Dad.

726
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,700
Dad.

727
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,700
Dad.

728
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,700
Dad.

729
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Dad.

730
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
Dad.

731
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
Dad.

732
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,700
Dad.

733
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,700
Dad.

734
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,700
Dad.

735
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,700
Dad.

736
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,700
Dad.

737
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
Dad.

738
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,700
Dad.

739
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,700
Dad.

740
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
Dad.

741
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
Dad.

742
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,700
Dad.

743
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,700
Dad.

744
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,700
Dad.

745
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,700
Dad.

746
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,700
Dad.

747
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,700
Dad.

748
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,700
Dad.

749
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,700
Dad.

750
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,700
Dad.

751
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,700
Dad.

752
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
Dad.

753
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,700
Dad.

754
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,700
Dad.

755
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
Dad.

756
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,700
Dad.

757
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,700
Dad.

758
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,700
Dad.

759
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,700

You can go down.

847
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,660

You can leave.

858
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,100
Is there anything wrong or chip lunch?

859
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,980
You had lunch before you met Li Be Hypnotist?

860
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,620
Her treatment belongs to Hot Boy.

861
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,580
Fortunately, your gold recipe date was also auspicious.

862
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,260
Apply it to your body this year.

863
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,500
Don't buy us buddies hot boys like you.

864

Wang Dian

870
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,340
You look carefully

871
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:10,160
It seems to stand still

872
01:01:43,220 --> 01:02:06,580
Fl conocen

873
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,380

881
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,900
Hurry up.

882
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,900
Don't be cold.

883
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,900
My head.

884
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,900
Don't be cold.

885
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:21,900
Are you hungry?

886
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,900
I'm not hungry.

887
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,900
I'm just thinking about whether I should treat you to a meal.

888
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
Is it spicy pork or noodles?

889
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:27,900
You should treat us to a meal.

890
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,900
You must treat us to a meal.

891
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,900
Yes.

892
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,900
The Seven Flames Family is leaving.

893
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,900
Leaving.

894
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,900
The Seven Flames Family

895
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,900
If I can eat a piece of noodles and a bowl of noodles,

896
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
I won't have a meal.

897
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,900
If I can eliminate the pain of a person,

898
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,900
or calm down the sadness of a person,

899
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,900
or help a stray female,

900
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,900
and return to her court again,

901
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,900
I won't have

902
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,900
a life of humiliation.

903
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:11,900
The world is nothing to me.

904
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,900
I love coffee.

905
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,900
I feel like I'm falling.

906
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:39,900
The music of the sky and the hand-picked sea is very tiring.

907
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,900
The love is special.

908
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,900
Every little detail

909
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
is so symmetrical.

910
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,900
I'm afraid of the cold and the emotional mistakes.

911
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:04,900
I hate myself for being selfish and being careless.

912
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,900
I'm against the tears of love.

913
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,900
I'm more willing to be with you.

914
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,900
I like to see you smile and call me a little ghost.

915
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:24,900
Your expression is like a love between friends.

916
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,900
I'm lonely and I'm in love.

917
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,900
I'm lonely and I'm in love.

918
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,900
I like to see you smile and call me a little ghost.

919
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,900
My heart wants to be with you.

920
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,900
The weird finger is fixed on you.

921
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,900
I'm a little worried.

922
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,900
I like to see you smile and call me a little ghost.

923
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,900
Your expression is like a love between friends.

924
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,900
I'm lonely and I'm in love.

925
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,900
I'm lonely and I'm in love.

926
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,900
I like to see you smile and call me a little ghost.

927
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:19,900
My heart wants to be with you.

928
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,900
The weird finger is fixed on you.

929
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,900
I'm lonely and I'm in love.
