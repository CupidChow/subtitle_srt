00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The End

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Again, again, again.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's worth it.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Don't look at your feet.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Keep your hands steady.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're steady.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm steady.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Keep your hands steady.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Again.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't look at your feet.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're dirty.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll clean it.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll clean it.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll clean it.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll clean it.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you okay?

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're so stupid.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You broke your pants.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The car is okay.

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're stupid.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's expensive.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you okay?

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm fine.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How much is the car?

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
100 yuan.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I bought it for my uncle.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll pay for it.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, you'll pay for it.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
250 yuan.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why did you ride a bike

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and look at me like a monkey?

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You want me to throw you to the university?

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You want to be a face?

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Again.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're steady.

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're steady.

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm steady.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm steady.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm steady.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm steady.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm not going to go to the university.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to the university.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm going to the university.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to the university.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to the university.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to the university.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to the university.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to the university.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going to the university.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm going to the university.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to the university.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm going to the university.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going to the university.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going to the university.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to the university.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm going to the university.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm going to the university.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm going to the university.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to the university.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm going to the university.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm going to the university.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm going to the university.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm going to the university.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to the university.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to the university.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm going to the university.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm going to the university.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm going to the university.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm going to the university.

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm going to the university.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going to the university.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I can do the training now.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm going to the university.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to the university.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you still Exameding?

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go and Oracle.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come on.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Here, boost.

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,400
Stop drinking and you can't sleep?

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,500
Not going to?

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Hengshu is dead, can you stir up Fight Side?

87
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,000
Move

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,960
What's wrong?

89
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
What's wrong?

90
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
Go...

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
Wait a minute.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,560
What's wrong?

93
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
OK.

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,680
Gettingисő doesn't mean it's right.

95
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,800
We will be a close family.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I heard that my father's heart is not good.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He lives in the 13th hospital, right?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The hospital is not very good.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My father's heart is not very good.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will introduce you to a big person later.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you want to transfer the hospital, tell me.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We will try our best.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We have four people in one company.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I saw the news yesterday.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are really strong.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I told you earlier that you don't believe me.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
My father is a real person.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You...

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm telling you, Mr. Huang.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Uncle Huang, you are also a guest in the self-study class.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come to the office.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, right. Let me tell you.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The article you wrote last week is a beautiful future.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Most of the students wrote it.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not a big deal.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The highest score is Fang Liu.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's still a good one.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Keep it up.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The requirement is 600 words.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Someone only wrote 4 sentences.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know if you are too rich to write my article.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm still busy with writing.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wang Di, tell me.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What do you mean?

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I didn't write.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are you busy with?

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm busy with math.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't see you study math.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are so smart.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not good at math.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Read your article to your students.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You know how to make troubles.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Read it.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Read it.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Only children can make beautiful and future the same meaning.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And I'm no longer a child.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Beautiful is no longer my struggle.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Difficult is my eternal journey.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I've finished my article.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I feel like I can read it.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why didn't you write it?

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know why I didn't write it?

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because I had no way to do it.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I did it with you.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The other students wrote 600 words.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They felt it was unfair.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I wrote it personally.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll tell you.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you write it, I'll give you 0 points.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm telling you,

153
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
I'll give you zero points next time.

154
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,680
Sit down.

155
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,160
Take your driver

156
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,680
and drive him back.

157
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,400
I have some work to do.

158
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
What are you doing?

159
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,680
Xiaolian,

160
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,400
what did you just see?

161
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm so talented.

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,360
What did you see?

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm going to art club.

164
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,000
To design

165
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,340
all things

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
with Rowan.

167
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,200
Look at the blue ball accordingly.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
All of them.

169
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
Can you take a look at this?

170
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,040
This?

171
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Sibodin.

172
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,280
It's so good.

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,840
Here.

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,240
Take a look.

175
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,760
The color is good.

176
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Is this the best?

177
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,000
This must be the best.

178
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,920
How much?

179
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,760
Let me see.

180
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,360
This is 225 yuan.

181
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
You like this?

182
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,040
200 yuan.

183
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,640
I'll take this.

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,520
It's 20 yuan.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,600
You can take it.

186
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,920
It's so cheap.

187
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
It's cheaper.

188
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
It's not cheap.

189
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,520
It's the lowest price.

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,040
How about this?

191
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
Is it not enough?

192
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
Yes, I'll take this.

193
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,000
How much is it?

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's 20 yuan.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,640
You need to take two pieces.

196
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,840
I'll sell you.

197
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,920
How about this?

198
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,960
180 yuan is also a good price.

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,080
I'll take this.

200
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,040
It's cheaper.

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,000
Then come again tomorrow.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,680
Okay?

203
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,200
Here.

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,040
Okay.

205
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll get you some air.

206
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,280
Wait a minute.

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,760
Okay.

208
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Thank you.

209
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,160
I don't have money now.

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,440
I can only spend it slowly.

211
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,760
It's okay. Don't worry.

212
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,640
Do you like basketball?

213
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,880
No.

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,360
I bought it for Wang Di.

215
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,760
You're so reluctant.

216
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
Aren't you the best friend?

217
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,960
The best friend has to give the best.

218
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
I support you.

219
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,960
Your pants.

220
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Your pants are good.

221
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
My dad's pants.

222
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
He's really good.

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Wang Di.

224
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,960
Uncle Si.

225
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,880
Where did you get it?

226
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,760
I gave it to you.

227
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
Really?

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
You have over 200 yuan.

229
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,960
Where did you get the money?

230
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Your wallet.

231
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,160
You didn't steal it, did you?

232
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,560
You even cut the money in the big market?

233
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,560
My dad came back.

234
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,960
Thanks.

235
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
Do you have the right to keep your father safe?

236
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,780

Have some shoes, have you learned it?

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,840

What's this?

255
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Don't you know that I can dance?

256
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Xiao Yanlong,

257
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
you haven't danced for a long time.

258
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
You know the dance.

259
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
What?

260
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
You've almost forgotten the dance.

261
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
I haven't.

262
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900

263
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
tell me who's better than her.

264
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
At least she has the courage.

265
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Okay, go back.

266
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Go back.

267
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Didn't you send her to the class?

268
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Why did you have to go to the class?

269
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
No, I didn't.

270
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
We transferred a classmate to a new classmate.

271
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
She was a dancer in the first class.

272
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
What?

273
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
She doesn't look like her.

274
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,900
What?

275
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Come on.

276
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
This tall man.

277
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
What's his name?

278
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Uncle Huang.

279
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
He's been learning for years.

280
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Since he was young.

281
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Well,

282
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
let's appreciate a little bit.

283
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Whatever he dances,

284
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
it's okay.

285
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Can you dance?

286
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Okay.

287
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Okay.

288
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Come on.

289
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
Stop looking for me.

290
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
Xiaochun.

291
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Stop looking for me.

292
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Come here.

293
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Come here.

294
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
You don't know me.

295
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
You don't know me?

296
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I don't know you.

297
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
You're so funny.

298
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
I don't know you.

299
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Why do you say you don't know me?

300
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
I don't know you.

301
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Uncle Huang.

302
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Let go of me.

303
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
Wait.

304
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Okay, let me put it away.

305
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
Let's go out now.

306
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Let's go out.

307
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Who are you?

308
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
I want to eat with you.

309
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Like a rogue.

310
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Why do you still recognize me?

311
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Listen to me.

312
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
You can't go out.

313
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Don't move.

314
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
What are you looking at?

315
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Let's go.

316
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Let's go.

317
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
The condition of the competition is really very good.

318
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I got 12 points in 11 minutes.

319
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
9, 5, 6, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3,

320
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Wang Ding, stop filming.

321
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Because I found it in the lower part of the building.

322
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Is it a good ball?

323
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
It's a good ball.

324
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Why is your breath so hot?

325
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Is it a weather problem?

326
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
Sometimes it's windy and not stable.

327
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Don't film it.

328
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
My head hurts.

329
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
It's okay.

330
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
You should have told me earlier.

331
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Do you need to use this medicine?

332
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I don't feel anything.

333
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Why isn't your father back yet?

334
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
He left.

335
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
He probably won't come back.

336
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
He left again after a day?

337
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
I'm used to it.

338
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
I've been like this all these days.

339
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Seriously.

340
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Do you have feelings for your father?

341
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Who is it?

342
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Is it the owner of the building?

343
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
I told you not to film it.

344
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Who is it?

345
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
The owner of the building.

346
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Your father is running a water leak.

347
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Of course he's not here.

348
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
He's not here.

349
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
I'll go in and take a look.

350
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
He didn't leak anything.

351
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
No.

352
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Your wall was soaked.

353
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
It must have leaked somewhere.

354
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
My father is not here.

355
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
He went to my house with me.

356
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Where's your father?

357
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
He went out for a walk.

358
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Your brother.

359
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
Your classmate.

360
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
There's a.

361
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Follow him.

362
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,000
Go.

363
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
I was wrong.

364
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,700
Are you busy?

365
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,180
Tomorrow, you can find someoneやって tomorrow to set t around you

366
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,100
Why do you still haveivos?

367
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,860
But I got a mango

368
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
She...

369
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,260
Sauce and fiber.

370
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,380
Osmanthus Marladım.

371
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,080
Damn you.

372
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
This is Yun Ge, her apartment.

373
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,340
You are fit for your office.

374
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,520
You live with me now.

375
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,720
Let's go to the bathroom together.

376
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,420
I went through three stages of your problem and died.

377
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I just came out that year

378
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,420
You remember the cow friend who put it down

379
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
I put it down

380
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
You went and found it

381
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
You stay

382
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
understand

383
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,420
I finally said that the special police is the most important

384
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
This place is too cheap

385
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
The first place must not be exposed

386
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,420
If people are sent to the mountains, it's hard to find

387
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,420
Such a cheap place to split money

388
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Please be careful

389
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Four people were caught

390
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,420
The rest of these two must be trusted

391
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Come, let me take it

392
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,420
I witnessed a strangevelopment

393
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Of course to need help

394
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,180
T description

395
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,060
T belongs to P

396
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,420
Tp

397
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,300
Tp

398
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,340
Thirteen

399
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,300
Mr. постав钮

400
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,660
Don't move.

401
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,580
Vampire.

402
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,300
Don't move.

403
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,340
Don't move!

404
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,780
Move!

405
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,380
Go!

406
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,460
Go!

407
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,660
Go!

408
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,900
Go!

409
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,100
Go, get off the car.

410
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Get off the car!

411
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,900
Get off the car!

412
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,680
Go.

413
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,300
ger you

414
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,200
leave

415
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,460
It's so dark.

416
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,620
I am going register.

417
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Come on.

418
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Are you okay?

419
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,620
I'm fine.

420
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
I'm not afraid at all.

421
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
Stop it.

422
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,620
Teacher Xiang, I'll go with you.

423
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,620
What year are you in?

424
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,620
59.

425
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
We're soldiers.

426
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,620
The border is quite unique.

427
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
What kind of soldiers?

428
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,620
The gunman.

429
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
You're a gunman?

430
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Yes.

431
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,620
I was running on the railway for a year.

432
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I heard you two were shooting at the east.

433
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
It's like a thunder.

434
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
The railway is so good.

435
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
The war is over.

436
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
The war is over.

437
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Why?

438
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,620
I forgot.

439
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Do you have a child?

440
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,620
My daughter.

441
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
How old are you?

442
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,620
17.

443
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,620
He's half as old as my second son.

444
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
How many children do you have?

445
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Over a hundred.

446
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
I'm a disabled man.

447
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
I found a ID.

448
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,620
I might have another child.

449
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Don't say that.

450
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
I did all this for my child.

451
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
I found a way to treat her.

452
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I spent a lot of money.

453
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
I've heard a lot of these.

454
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,620
You and those stolen guns are not in a party.

455
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,620
You have a ID.

456
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,620
But it has nothing to do with that.

457
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
What does it have to do with that?

458
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,620
I'm doing this.

459
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
I'm doing it on my own.

460
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,620
How much money do you think

461
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
is enough for a person?

462
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
Not enough.

463
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,620
I'm not enough anyway.

464
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
I'm sorry.

465
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
I'm not.

466
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Hello?

467
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
It's me.

468
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
I don't have a son.

469
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,880
Why do you come to my house?

470
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
Don't you need to для me to eat tomorrow?

471
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,540
Understand?

472
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,400
The house is warm and I am always thanking you.

473
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,400
I take you to eat.

474
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,200
Master!

475
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,100
Father!

476
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,700
my son!

477
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
What?

478
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,700
Just tell me.

479
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,700
It's a sudden death.

480
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Fortunately, the emergency delivery was done.

481
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,100
People are safe.

482
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
But we have to do a big surgery.

483
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,100
We can't do it.

484
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
So it's not a small thing.

485
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,100
How can a child be able to do it?

486
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,700
The End

487
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,700
The End

488
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Okay.

489
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm coming with you.

490
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,700
Okay.

491
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
You go down and do it.

492
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
I found you don't like to fight with your classmate.

493
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,100
Shijing is so noisy.

494
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,100
I'm so tired.

495
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,100
I know it's a good thing.

496
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,900
I've been wanting to fight with you.

497
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll fight.

498
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,500
Come on.

499
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,300
Go, go, go.

500
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,500
Come on.

501
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,300
Fight.

502
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,300
Fight him.

503
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,100
Fight him.

504
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,900
Come on.

505
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,300
Come on.

506
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,700
Shijing, you didn't come in.

507
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
You're so weak.

508
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,300
Wang Di, you're back.

509
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,300
Wang Di, you can't get in.

510
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,700
Wang Di, you can't get in.

511
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,300
Wang Di, you can't get in.

512
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,100
You can't get in.

513
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,900
You can't get in.

514
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,700
You can't get in.

515
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,900
You can't get in.

516
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Go away.

517
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,500
Go away.

518
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,100
Go away.

519
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,500
You're so stubborn.

520
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,700
You're so stubborn.

521
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
What's wrong with you?

522
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,300
Wei Yu.

523
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,700
Wei Yu is behind you.

524
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
You're so stubborn.

525
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,100
You're back.

526
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,900
You're back.

527
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
You have to go to the medical room.

528
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,100
Go to the medical room.

529
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,500
Don't be so busy.

530
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,900
We're going to the medical room.

531
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Go on.

532
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
We'll have to go to the medical room today.

533
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,100
You have long legs.

534
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
You're so annoying.

535
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,900
Look.

536
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,100
You look good in it.

537
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,300
I changed my shoes yesterday.

538
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,700
I forgot to bring them home.

539
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
I want to say that

540
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
your jeans are so pretty.

541
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Where did you buy them?

542
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Under the stone.

543
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,100
It's cheap.

544
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Only 30 yuan.

545
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
Next time, bring me.

546
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,300
I won't be so stubborn.

547
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Fine. I'll be the most stubborn.

548
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
Give it to you.

549
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,900
You're laughing at me?

550
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,700
It's okay.

551
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,700
I'll wash it for you.

552
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
I'll wash it for you.

553
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,300
It's enough.

554
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Wash it yourself.

555
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,300
What should I do?

556
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,900
I was so embarrassed.

557
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,700
That boy is so annoying.

558
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,700
I saw it every time.

559
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,100
I saw it when I saw Wang Di.

560
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,700
Wang Di is kind.

561
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,700
I'll give you a red soup, okay?

562
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,300
Why do you have it?

563
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,700
Because I'm a chicken.

564
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,900
What should I do?

565
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,900
Your hair is so pretty.

566
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
It's natural.

567
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
I'm telling you a secret.

568
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,100
You can't tell me.

569
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,100
I'm not telling you.

570
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,700
The soup.

571
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,100
Really?

572
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,900
Really.

573
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,100
Why do I look so pretty?

574
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
It's so natural.

575
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,100
Where did you get it?

576
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,500
I'll take you with me.

577
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,500
Forget it.

578
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,300
If I were a soup,

579
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,900
I'd be beaten to death by my mom.

580
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
Your mom is so strict.

581
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,700
She never cares about the right place.

582
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,100
She's a annoying person anyway.

583
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,100
Your mom doesn't care about you.

584
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
My mom doesn't usually stay at home.

585
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,500
Where is she?

586
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
In the south.

587
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
I haven't seen her in three months.

588
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,700
What about your dad?

589
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,300
I heard he's in Hainan.

590
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,900
But they divorced when I was very young.

591
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,100
So I forgot what he looks like.

592
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
I'm sorry.

593
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,700
I shouldn't have.

594
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
It's okay.

595
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,700
We're both wearing the same pants.

596
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,300
Right?

597
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,300
That's right.

598
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Let me ask you a secret.

599
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,100
What secret?

600
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,100
Did you spray perfume?

601
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,300
No.

602
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,500
You still don't admit it?

603
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,900
No.

604
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,900
Did you spray perfume?

605
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,100
You're so mean.

606
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,700
It's the same smell as the one in the movie.

607
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,900
You're so sweet.

608
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
Why do you like perfume?

609
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,700
You can smell it every time you walk.

610
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,900
My mom bought it.

611
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,700
It's like a foreign brand.

612
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
I don't know her.

613
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,500
Uncle He, you're so pretty.

614
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,700
You're pretty too.

615
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,300
Let me tell you another secret.

616
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I won't tell you.

617
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,700
Today is my birthday.

618
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,100
Really?

619
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Happy birthday!

620
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Happy birthday!

621
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm older than you.

622
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Call me sister.

623
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
I'm older than you.

624
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,900
I'm 81 years old.

625
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm 18 today.

626
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,900
You're 18.

627
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
That's great.

628
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,100
I'll be your birthday tomorrow.

629
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,500
I didn't give you a gift today.

630
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
You're the biggest gift I received today.

631
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,900
No.

632
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
How about

633
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
tomorrow's Saturday?

634
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,300
You can go to my house.

635
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,100
You can take whatever you like.

636
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,300
It's a big gift.

637
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Do you want it?

638
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,300
You said it.

639
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm smarter than you.

640
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,700
This is better.

641
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,300
No.

642
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,700
How about I ask the prince

643
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,100
if I want to come with you?

644
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,700
I'm afraid it's boring.

645
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,500
Okay.

646
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
You and the prince have a good relationship.

647
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,900
Even if I'm with them,

648
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,300
it's different between you and the girl.

649
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,900
I feel so sorry

650
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,700
to see you three every time.

651
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
I don't care.

652
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,900
You can only be with me

653
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,100
when you're at work.

654
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Do you hear me?

655
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
It's so bad.

656
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
It's so bad.

657
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,300
Okay?

658
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,100
Okay.

659
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm not as tall as you.

660
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm not as tall as you.

661
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,900
What?

662
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Fan Hui.

663
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,700
How are they going to road?

664
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,500
Go together.

665
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,600
What's the girl's place like?

666
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
What's her pageantly?

667
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,500
She used to have a lot of stories.

668
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,900
Many guys moved in.

669
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,300
What stories?

670
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,900
I wonder what exactly.

671
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,000
I heard from someone

672
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,000
that I'm just an old man.

673
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
See you. Bye.

674
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Where's your house?

675
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,760
I'll give you a ride.

676
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,880
I'm too heavy.

677
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,680
You can't carry it.

678
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,000
How heavy can you be?

679
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,880
The car is here. I'll go first.

680
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,040
Wang Di.

681
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,880
The poem you wrote is so good.

682
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,160
See you tomorrow.

683
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,320
Goodbye.

684
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,080
Do you want to come to the mushroom or which one?

685
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,760
Mushroom.

686
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,320
Mushroom.

687
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,000
Dad, come with me.

688
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,680
Give me a few plates.

689
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,280
Look at your bag.

690
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
I'll give it to you and the luggage.

691
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,240
I'll give it to you.

692
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,960
What's wrong with you?

693
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,720
I'm in the hospital.

694
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm fine.

695
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
He's a grandpa.

696
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm in the hospital.

697
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,560
Come on.

698
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
I'm afraid of the fire.

699
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,320
It's still hot.

700
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,440
Have some.

701
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,560
Have some.

702
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,240
You haven't eaten for a day.

703
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,760
The

704
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,960
first time in front of the door was

705
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,640
the news you broke.

706
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,640
At advance

707
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,160
this is a new place to stay.

708
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,400
Zheng Li.

709
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,720
It's Go game.

710
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,840
You have to take advantage of it by default on your gig.

711
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,440
Alright.

712
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,920
Come on.

713
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,640
You said you didn't know how to comfort you

714
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,520
when you did such a big thing.

715
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,200
You've always been looking at people who you grew up with.

716
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,520
They're so heart-broken.

717
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,840
Don't be so sad. I'm fine.

718
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,320
Your dad is your dad, you are you.

719
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,000
You're a good kid.

720
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,160
You've never cared about you since you were a kid.

721
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,160
Let's start from now on.

722
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,040
Let's make a promise.

723
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,440
Forget about him.

724
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,760
It's not your fault.

725
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,640
You don't understand, kid.

726
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,760
Your parents can't choose.

727
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,800
You still can get tired of Bill He Ping.

728
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,760
I'm really stuck.

729
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,560
Take a break.

730
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,360
It's good that you could choose.

731
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,760
rios object like the tapy passion.

732
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
I'm just like that.

733
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
I'll take you to drink a toast.

734
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
You really have a word for it.

735
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
How's your health?

736
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
I'm fine.

737
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
I'm back from the hospital.

738
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
That's good.

739
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
You can relax too.

740
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,760
I just need to chat and talk to people.

741
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Do you want to go back to Beijing?

742
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
No.

743
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
I've already quit my job.

744
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
I'll stay and stay with my parents.

745
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
That's good.

746
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Let me ask you something.

747
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
If I don't call you,

748
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
will you ever see me again?

749
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Are you afraid of seeing me?

750
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
What about tomorrow night?

751
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
We had a lot of drinks that night.

752
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I don't remember anything.

753
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Take it back.

754
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
What do you mean?

755
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
You're not that rude.

756
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Who are we?

757
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
I woke up that morning.

758
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I saw the sign on the window and it was $5.

759
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
I thought I was selling my body.

760
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
You?

761
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,760
You're not selling your body.

762
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I've sent you a message.

763
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
I said I was giving you money.

764
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
I didn't want it.

765
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
I didn't want anything.

766
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Just take it back.

767
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
I'm leaving now.

768
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,760
You can't let me feel sad and eat something.

769
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
I haven't eaten anything.

770
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
You are so naughty.

771
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Are you going to start a business?

772
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:24,040
It's Letian's stock because I am

773
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
the father of your damn collection.

774
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Stop playing dice.

775
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Don't play dice.

776
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm thinking of that simple time.

777
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Don't say that I'm drunk.

778
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,760
What?

779
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Don't say that you're drunk.

780
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
What do you mean?

781
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Feng Yu Jing.

782
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Why did I find you?

783
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Don't you know?

784
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
We're sorry, Qin Li.

785
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I've never been to the same party for so many years.

786
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I just don't want to meet those people I used to be.

787
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,760
I don't want to go back to the past.

788
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,760
I know that day I met you.

789
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
I just want to meet you that day.

790
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Don't say that anymore.

791
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
We were so good then.

792
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
You know better than anyone else.

793
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
We were not good then.

794
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
We never had a good relationship.

795
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
We wouldn't have been together for this life.

796
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Don't say that anymore.

797
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Feng Yu Jing.

798
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Let's not meet again.

799
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
Feng Yu Jing, come on.

801
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Come on.

802
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Let me do it.

803
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
What are you doing?

804
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Let's go.

805
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Feng Yu Jing.

806
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
Let's go.

807
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
Let's go.

808
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Let's go.

809
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Let's go.

810
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Let's go.

811
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Let's go.

812
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Let's go.

813
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Let's go.

814
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Let's go.

815
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Let's go.

816
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Let's go.

817
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Let's go.

818
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Let's go.

819
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Let's go.

820
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Let's go.

821
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Let's go.

822
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
Feng Yu Jing.

823
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
Feng Yu Jing.

824
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Feng Yu Jing.

825
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,820
from now on, let's shout out for the world

826
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,020
a cup of iced coffee

827
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,160
with a sentimental feeling

828
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,920
with a cutting edge

829
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,560
I like to see you smile quietly, calling me a little turtle

830
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,120
Your expression is like the love of a friend

831
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,260
Lonely, sweet color

832
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,200
And unique, unique, and special

833
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,280
I like to see you smile quietly, calling me a little turtle

834
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,800
My heart wants to be with my lover

835
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,760
The weird fingers are not right

836
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,400
I like to see you smile quietly, calling me a little turtle

837
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,400
I like to see you smile quietly, calling me a little turtle

838
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Your expression is like the love of a friend

839
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,400
Lonely, sweet color

840
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,400
And unique, unique, and special

841
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,400
I like to see you smile quietly, calling me a little turtle

842
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I like to see you smile quietly, calling me a little turtle

843
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
My heart wants to be with my lover
