00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Where are you going?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Uncle Huang, right?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Where are you going? I'll send you.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know where to go.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why are you unhappy?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll take you around.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't worry.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't you know where to go?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll take you around.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm here.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
21.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you doing?

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not working.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Where are you going?

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
2-star hotel in the city of Shimao.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I know why I'm looking for you.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Uncle Huang.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Fine. Just say it if you have something to say.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tell me.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's avoiding me.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's calling me if I don't find him.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you doing?

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I thought...

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I thought...

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I could go back to the school.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm just like before.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You can't go.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You have to tell me why.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can't ignore me if you change your mind.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You want to be a good student.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But now you can't ignore me if you can't.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have to explain to me.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're too much.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What's wrong?

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you see a star when it's dark,

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
you don't need to be a star.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Uncle Huang.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What do you mean?

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You've talked to Uncle Huang.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Talked to him?

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's not a human being.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When did you talk about it?

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yu Yunqian.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
His mother just ran away.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where's he?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's transferred to the prison.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We've changed.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Be quiet. I'm not a corpse.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can I have your name?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Why is there no one in the team?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're so shameless.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You don't know what's going on today.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That guy just came back from the devil.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I saw him.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's been sent there.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If it wasn't for me,

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
he would have run away.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm going to blow you up.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why didn't you go home last night?

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was going to work.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm going home too late.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have to go to the dorm.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't get wet.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't touch me.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't touch me.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm going to wash my hands.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm going to wash my hands.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm going to wash my hands.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're going to wash your hands?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to wash my hands.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What are you looking at?

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Forget it.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not talking.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Shi'er.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think you should be doing makeup.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You don't have any love and respect for the family.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't care about you.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you angry?

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why are you even more angry than me?

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I just give you some little advice.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Who wants your advice?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm off work early.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Shi'er.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You've never been in a relationship, right?

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You haven't been in a relationship.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't pretend.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I heard from Wang Jian.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How about we try it out?

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go away.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's 1.28.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's 6 to 8 p.m.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where are you?

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I forgot.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Where is Uncle Huang?

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You called him here.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We just talked about it.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you know what?

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Uncle Huang is dead.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Your boyfriend...

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is his classmate.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's a good student.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He looks very lonely.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I saw him before.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He was in the car.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Later,

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I saw him in the car.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They were sitting in the water.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My son saw my book.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I said I was sitting there.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He was laughing.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He was laughing.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I've never seen him laugh.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm so happy.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm so happy.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm so happy.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm so happy.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm so happy.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm so happy.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm so happy.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm so happy.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm so happy.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm so happy.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm so happy.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm so happy.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm so happy.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm so happy.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm so happy.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm so happy.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm so happy.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm so happy.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Mr. Li

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mr. Li

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This?

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you sure?

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Does it hurt?

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can only be with Uncle Huang.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you know the name?

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is this the book?

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where is this?

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Take a look.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I've never seen it before.

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Tell me.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How did Uncle Huang die?

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Why are you sitting here again?

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let me do it.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Here.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What's your final exam?

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think this is my first time

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to remember.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I didn't write it.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What?

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You didn't write it?

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You didn't write it?

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why?

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The title is

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to write a letter to the past.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't want to write the title.

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't want to say anything

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to the past.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You think

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
other people can only write

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
when they write a letter?

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Isn't that a hard one?

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're going to the college entrance exam.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you meet someone

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
who doesn't like to write a title,

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you'll be a loser.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're talking about me?

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sorry.

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Didn't you write

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a letter to your husband?

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I should have done it.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
People can't be so tolerant.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think I can.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Idiot.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come here.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll give you a lot of things.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Open the drawer.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The old rule.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Exchange gifts.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Happy birthday.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's still in the password.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's old rule.

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's pure.

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I spent half a month to make money.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can write whatever you want.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can write it here.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Anyway, you're so thoughtful.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's good to hide.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll see if you can give me

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
my gift.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Where are the gifts?

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Help me put them in the room.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't know.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Where?

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Take them out.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean,

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I forgot about my birthday.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Do you have any conscience?

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Give me back the gift.

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Give me the gift.

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I want it.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Give me back the gift.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No.

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go left.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You want to be a fool?

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Go left.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can steal it.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't know

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
what's in the card.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I like to take the bill.

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I like it.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I like to put it in the wallet.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll carry it every day.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I've read it.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I put it in the wallet.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I only have one card.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll be a treasure in the future.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't lose it.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I can't lose it.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Did you come back?

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm almost there.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm going back.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
My mom wants to ask you

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
if you have any conscience.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I know.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do you hear me?

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Bye.

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wang Di.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Happy birthday.

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Happy birthday.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Happy birthday.

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Enjoy your life.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,580
You see

252
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,000
this card.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
My son.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My son.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,600
You're teaching your mom, right?

256
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Yes.

257
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,800
Hello, I'm Wang Di's mom.

258
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,400
Wang Di?

259
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,200
I heard that his father-in-law is always very busy.

260
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Hello.

261
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
We used to be in the Yang family for the first time.

262
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm usually too busy with my work.

264
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
My dad takes care of everything in my study.

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,400
I'm not sure if I'm the one who's in charge of the results.

266
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I can still get the first 20 years of my exams.

267
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm not in the best position this time.

268
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not in the best position.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,600
How's Wang Di doing? How many people have he passed?

270
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
13.

271
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
He's doing very well.

272
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
That's not good. I've been watching him every day.

273
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
He's so playful.

274
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Look at me. I have to find out.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I heard that he's good at writing.

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Usually, he needs to know more about our family.

277
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
That's great.

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,800
That's great.

279
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Then I'll thank you first.

280
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Hello, everyone.

281
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
Let's sit down.

282
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,000
This is the class.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,800
Let's go.

284
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
It's time for the meeting.

285
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,600
This is empty.

286
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Has your class president not come yet?

287
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm going to the meeting.

288
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Let's have a meeting.

289
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,800
I hope my mom will be a little more comfortable when she comes back.

290
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,200
Usually, your father will open a meeting for you.

291
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,000
My father has been feeling uncomfortable these days. He's at home.

292
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Uncle Feng, who's going to open a meeting for you today?

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Tell them.

294
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
What?

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I actually...

296
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm going to be rejected.

297
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Why?

298
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,000
This time, I'm not qualified to be in the fourth class.

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,600
The school said that I have a request for a student from the university.

300
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,200
I didn't get a certificate from last year to this year's college entrance exam.

301
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
So I'm going to be rejected.

302
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,000
You just turned around and didn't get a certificate.

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're going to be rejected.

304
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
At first, I agreed to move my mom in. It was just a matter of hard work.

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,400
Now, I'm taking the certificate and giving it away. It's a good excuse for my mom.

306
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,000
These people are so hypocritical.

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They're not hypocritical. I think it's bad.

308
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Actually, I don't really care.

309
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
I shouldn't have come at first.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,400
Don't say that.

311
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,600
If you don't come, we can't be friends.

312
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
That's true.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll come to the best thing in half a year to meet you.

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
What are you going to do in the future?

315
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,800
I can go back to school.

316
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Teacher Yi Xiao said that as long as I want to go back, I can go back anytime.

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I also got a little bit of a pass. I'm different from you two.

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Dancing is my thing.

319
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,000
I think it's pretty good.

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What's good?

321
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
Uncle Feng left and we're going to open a meeting.

322
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
It's not like we're in the same school.

323
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
It's not like we're in the same school.

324
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
You're right.

325
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,800
Don't be like this. I want to cry.

326
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,600
You'll often come out to play with me in the future.

327
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,200
Of course.

328
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,400
You'll also play with me in the game.

329
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Of course. I bought a new card.

330
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,800
To make the family happy, I'm the family.

331
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Okay, we won't discuss these things today.

332
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Let's just give them a good time to play, okay?

333
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,000
We'll never be separated.

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Never be separated!

335
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Xia Erru, I have a new free break.

336
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't have a fight.

337
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,600
Xia Erru, we can eliminate one person's suffering.

338
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Or we can help a girl with a poor heart.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Or we can help a girl with a poor heart.

340
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,000
I won't go to her court again.

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,200
I won't go to the court again.

342
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
What are you thinking about?

343
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,200
Did Xia Erru write this?

344
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,800
It's the same as the one she wrote.

345
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Look at that.

346
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
It's so romantic.

347
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
It's fine.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,600
We can write down the wish on this wall.

349
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,800
We'll keep it for you.

350
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,000
We have two people today. Can we give two?

351
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
Yes.

352
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,800
Sorry, I only have one.

353
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,600
It's fine. I'll look for it.

354
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,200
Thank you.

355
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
No need.

356
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
These are all for girls, right? I don't want to.

357
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Can you give it to me?

358
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
I don't want to.

359
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,800
You're so mean.

360
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,200
Qing Li, don't ignore her.

361
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't you have two pages? You can write one.

362
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Who writes first?

363
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't want her to see me.

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, because she can't see it.

365
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
It's your little heart.

366
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
I can guess it.

367
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
You can see it.

368
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,600
That's enough.

369
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
You can't see it.

370
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Qing Li, you're so smart.

371
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Qing Li, write it.

372
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Get up. Don't look.

373
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Don't look at Xia Erru.

374
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Get up.

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm looking at you.

376
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
We'll look at you if you write it.

377
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
Okay.

378
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Wang Jin, don't look.

379
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
You can't.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
Give it to me.

381
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Okay.

382
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm going to pull it.

383
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,600
There are two.

384
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
One is enough.

385
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Two.

386
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay, you two can write it.

387
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,600
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Happy birthday to you.

389
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Happy birthday to you.

390
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,200
Happy birthday to you.

391
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
Happy birthday to you.

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Happy birthday to you.

393
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Hurry up.

394
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
You two can write it.

395
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,600
It's so annoying.

396
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
It's so annoying.

397
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,400
You can write it.

398
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Eat cake.

399
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,000
Give me a gift.

400
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Give me a gift.

401
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Qing Li, this is for you.

402
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
Happy birthday to you.

403
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,600
What?

404
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Happy birthday to you.

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,400
I asked my mom to send me a gift

406
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
from my friend in the US.

407
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Thank you.

408
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
You're welcome.

409
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't lie to me.

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Don't forget.

411
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,400
I'll finish reading the gift.

412
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
I'm not ready.

413
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Don't forget.

414
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
I don't forget.

415
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,400
I'm thinking of waiting for the next year.

416
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Can I wait for you?

417
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, I can.

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,200
What gift do you want?

419
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,800
You want to be the winner?

420
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,600
No.

421
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Anyway, I can't lose now.

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You're getting more and more curious.

423
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Tell me.

424
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
Why are you so serious?

425
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
Don't be so curious.

426
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
You'll know tomorrow.

427
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
But I prepared it for Wang Di.

428
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,800
What's your name?

429
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,600
Wang Di.

430
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
Happy birthday to you.

431
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,400
Get up.

432
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Don't look at me.

433
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Don't look.

434
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
Just like you.

435
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,200
I wish you can write a better article.

436
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,600
I like it.

437
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Thank you.

438
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Don't you want me to send you something?

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Just call her.

440
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
Take it.

441
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Hurry up.

442
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
It's so delicate.

443
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Thank you.

444
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,800
Wang Di, happy birthday to you.

445
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
What's the matter with you?

446
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Don't...

447
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
Don't tear it.

448
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
You're so mean.

449
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Be careful.

450
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll tear the gift box.

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
What's this?

452
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,400
A different piece of iron?

453
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
It's a piece of iron.

454
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
It's a necklace.

455
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,400
It's a necklace.

456
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Who's wearing a necklace?

457
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
It's a picture necklace.

458
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
How much did it cost?

459
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Two of them can be together.

460
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,800
It's popular.

461
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
There's one more.

462
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
What?

463
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Wang Di.

464
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Wang Di.

465
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Wang Di.

466
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
You're so mean.

467
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
I said...

468
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Wang Di, you're wrong.

469
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
They prepared it for you.

470
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,800
You're so mean.

471
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Who's wearing a necklace?

472
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
How can I laugh at them?

473
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,400
Wang Di, show us.

474
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,800
I saw many boys wearing it.

475
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
It's so nice.

476
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Show us.

477
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll help you.

478
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay.

479
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I can't help it.

480
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,400
How nice.

481
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
How nice.

482
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
It's so nice.

483
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
You're a good girl.

484
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Get out.

485
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
If you don't like it, just take it off.

486
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
I threw it away.

487
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
I'm angry.

488
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Okay.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Thank you.

490
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
Do you like it?

491
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
I like it.

492
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,600
I like it.

493
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Brother Chitan.

494
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Brother Chitan.

495
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,600
It's ready.

496
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
Here, Brother Chitan.

497
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
That hurt me.

498
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,600
Mask, Happy birthday!

499
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,040
Who is it?

500
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,540
Happy birthday.

501
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,960
Let me see.

502
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,120
Eh?

503
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,860
Grandunt, go with us to make the meal.

504
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:14,120
Eat, I'm ordering for you today.

505
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,960
Are you leaving for work already?

506
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,900
Tell your parents to cook you some food,

507
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,620
or did the already prepare all of this for you by now?

508
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,180
Why are you asking my dad for that?

509
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,060
Hey, you guys, Mr. Fan,

510
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm going to praise you as a full-time classmate.

511
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,300
Praise me?

512
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,940
Praise you for your progress.

513
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,140
The highest score in the homework,

514
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,100
and the highest score in the math,

515
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,460
you can praise me.

516
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,220
You're really good.

517
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,260
My son is the best.

518
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,300
Why shouldn't he praise me?

519
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,820
Come on, come on.

520
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,540
Come on, come on.

521
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,220
Mom.

522
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,220
Can I drink that basketball?

523
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,100
Sure.

524
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,740
But you and mom promise

525
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,820
that you can't lose the money.

526
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,020
Do you hear me?

527
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,220
Sure.

528
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,140
And I've made a deal with your uncle.

529
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,740
We'll move to another place.

530
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
We'll move to Tianxi.

531
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,740
Why?

532
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,100
Well, your uncle

533
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,020
moved to Shenzhen this week.

534
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,980
I'll move to the other two neighborhoods

535
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,420
and you can move there.

536
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,340
You can move there.

537
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,260
You can move more houses.

538
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,940
And you can go to school.

539
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,340
The key is

540
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,500
to move to the night market in Tianxi.

541
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,780
I'm not in a good mood there.

542
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,740
You don't have to.

543
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,180
When are we moving?

544
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,260
I'll rent this house.

545
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,860
We can move out.

546
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,740
If someone rents it, we'll move out.

547
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,260
My uncle's brother

548
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,060
hasn't carried the whole scene away.

549
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,740
You haven't been dead yet.

550
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,020
Eat it.

551
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,420
Dare not eat it?

552
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,260
Mashed fried noodles.

553
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,700
Eat it.

554
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,580
One mistake later

555
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,340
if you can't eat it.

556
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,360
Are youHOtting him?

557
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
I want to keep my life.

558
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
I have to do the surgery.

559
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,300
Wei Qin.

560
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,900
Don't be so fast.

561
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
When mom wanted to take us away,

562
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,700
she didn't let me.

563
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
She insisted on keeping you.

564
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
You were three years old that time.

565
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,300
You were crying and shouting to go with mom.

566
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
If it weren't for her,

567
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,300
you wouldn't have told me anything.

568
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I'm asking you.

569
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,900
You said you didn't have a high position in the competition.

570
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
You can't stand it.

571
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Do you know why I have you?

572
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,900
Because I'm so useless.

573
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,500
But you're different.

574
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,100
You used to rely on yourself.

575
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
You used to rely on yourself.

576
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
You can go far away.

577
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
If I don't want to go,

578
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,500
you have to go.

579
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,500
Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

580
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Goodbye, Teacher Fan.

581
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Goodbye, students.

582
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Thank you.

583
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,300
You don't have to send me.

584
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,700
You have to learn from me from now on.

585
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,900
Especially Yu Wen.

586
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,100
You'll be a loyal person

587
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
no matter what you do.

588
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,100
I remember.

589
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Thank you, Teacher Fan.

590
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,500
No need.

591
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Okay, goodbye.

592
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,100
Go back.

593
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Get ready to class.

594
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Don't send me.

595
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,500
And...

596
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Don't be so mean.

597
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Did we agree to live together in class?

598
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Don't cry.

599
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,500
Shameful.

600
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,500
Okay.

601
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,500
I'm leaving.

602
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
I'll take you home.

603
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
You guys go back.

604
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
Go back to class.

605
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Bye.

606
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Bye.

607
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Go back.

608
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Go back.

609
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Go back.

610
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Go back.

611
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Go back.

612
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Go back.

613
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Go back.

614
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Uncle Wang, you really learned it?

615
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Yeah.

616
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I did not reply to his letter.

617
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
No, I did not reply.

618
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
You go back.

619
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Go back.

620
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
You can continue dancing.

621
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
What a pity.

622
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
What a pity?

623
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,900
You know how to compare.

624
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,300
We are both foreigners.

625
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,100
Right.

626
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,300
He is the dog that wears a hat.

627
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,300
You are so pessimistic.

628
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,900
Pregnancy is also a kind of talent.

629
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,700
Tao Sheng's talent is dancing.

630
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,700
He should dance for a lifetime.

631
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,300
Oh, right.

632
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,700
I didn't know you were born.

633
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,900
This card is considered a birthday gift.

634
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
This is too expensive.

635
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,100
How much is it?

636
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Take it as a gift.

637
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,900
Thank you.

638
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,300
Happy birthday.

639
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,700
Come on, hurry up.

640
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,500
My parents are all going out for a business trip.

641
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
We can just be free at home.

642
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,500
What do you want to drink?

643
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,300
What's the fun?

644
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,900
What do you want to drink?

645
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
What do I want to drink?

646
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Coke or orange?

647
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,500
Coke.

648
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Wenbin, what game do you usually play?

649
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,300
Red-nosed?

650
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,900
Or first-time?

651
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,700
Dibosha?

652
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,300
I've played it a couple of times.

653
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Do you play online?

654
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,900
What online?

655
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,900
Just money.

656
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,500
Go ahead.

657
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,900
You are still short of money.

658
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,300
I heard a girl say

659
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
they love to play and teach.

660
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,700
It's true.

661
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
You ask how much money they spend.

662
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,700
Isn't it a silly hat?

663
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
You can't lie to anyone.

664
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,900
My dad said so.

665
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,500
Sit down.

666
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,700
Your dad...

667
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,700
What did your dad do with your mom?

668
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,900
My dad is working as a defense officer.

669
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,900
My mom is a security guard.

670
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
You are so stubborn.

671
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Come on, hurry up.

672
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Are you okay today?

673
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm fine.

674
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,900
It's still hard to say, right?

675
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,500
To be honest, I'm fine.

676
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,700
But it's getting better soon.

677
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,700
I didn't know I'd never be forced

678
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
by you.

679
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm not sure.

680
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm not sure.

681
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
I'm not sure.

682
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
I'm not sure.

683
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,700
I didn't know I'd never be forced by you.

684
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
I can watch TV and play games.

685
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,900
I'm so happy.

686
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,300
It's so nice to have this.

687
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,900
But...

688
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
He doesn't like my gift card.

689
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,900
Why?

690
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,700
Because I can't afford to buy a more expensive gift.

691
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,500
Did the emperor tell you that?

692
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
He didn't.

693
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,500
But I can feel it.

694
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,700
That's what you think.

695
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,900
The emperor is not like that.

696
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Do you think

697
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
people will change?

698
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
I don't know.

699
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,700
Anyway, I know you won't change.

700
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,900
You won't.

701
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,100
Of course I won't.

702
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,900
Let's use this notebook to exchange the diary.

703
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
How?

704
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,300
You write your heart.

705
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,100
I write mine.

706
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
Let's exchange it.

707
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,300
You know my heart?

708
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
Of course I don't.

709
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,300
Anyway, you don't know my heart.

710
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
I'll write it.

711
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,900
I'll write it now.

712
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,100
You said you'd give me a gift next year.

713
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,900
What is it?

714
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,500
I told you I'd tell you tomorrow.

715
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,900
You'll know it tomorrow.

716
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Don't worry.

717
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,900
This is...

718
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Are you still not home?

719
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,500
Xin Li.

720
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,500
Please come home and check if I did it right.

721
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,100
I'll go first.

722
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
I'll send you off.

723
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,500
It's okay. I can do it myself.

724
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,500
Take care of yourself.

725
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
See you.

726
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Did you take the medicine?

727
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Yes.

728
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
What's this game?

729
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
It's so hard.

730
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
You can just pick it up.

731
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
I found you're a coward.

732
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
You'll get used to it after practicing.

733
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,900
What else?

734
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
I'm not afraid of getting jealous.

735
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
What's so good about this notebook?

736
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm afraid of being torn apart.

737
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
It's easy.

738
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
I'm not afraid of being torn apart.

739
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
I'm afraid of being torn apart.

740
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
It's simple.

741
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
It's so cheap.

742
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,900
What is this?

743
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
You don't even have a name.

744
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
Do you want to see it?

745
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Good stuff.

746
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,900
What is it?

747
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Come here.

748
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Sit down.

749
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
What are you doing?

750
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Sit down.

751
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
What are you doing?

752
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
What's your face?

753
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
What's your face?

754
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Open your eyes.

755
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
It's not convenient for me to be in this room.

756
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
I'll go out and look at it myself.

757
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
I'll look at it slowly.

758
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Why are you still not putting it in?

759
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
I'm sorry.

760
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Okay, okay.

761
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
Don't pretend.

762
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
Where's my mom?

763
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
She's gone again.

764
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
Then hurry up and sign me up.

765
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
I'll go to the office when she comes back.

766
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
Here.

767
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
You little girl.

768
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
You're all grown up and useless.

769
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
I...

770
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm not a good girl.

771
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
I'm not a good girl.

772
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,900
I...

773
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
shouldn't have bought you this computer.

774
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
You lied to me.

775
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
You used it for learning.

776
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
You spent more than ten thousand yuan.

777
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
You bought a game console.

778
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
I'm not afraid of learning.

779
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
I'm tired of relaxing.

780
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
What's wrong, master?

781
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
You're not feeling well now?

782
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm fine.

783
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Don't scare me.

784
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
I want to go to the hospital.

785
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Okay.

786
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Don't worry.

787
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Next month,

788
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
I'll go to the hospital

789
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
if the boss doesn't notice me.

790
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
You're not listening to me.

791
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Master,

792
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
if you have something to do,

793
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
I won't be alive.

794
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Hurry up.

795
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
Turn off the computer.

796
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Get a blanket.

797
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Get some sleep early.

798
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Yes.

799
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Listen to me.

800
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Don't be late.

801
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Be careful.

802
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
He's back.

803
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
He's back.

804
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
He's back.

805
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
I'll go.

806
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm going to go to the hospital.

807
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
See you.

808
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
See you.

809
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
See you.

810
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
See you.

811
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
See you.

812
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
He's back.

813
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
See you.

814
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
See you.

815
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
I'm leaving now, master.

816
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
See you.

817
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
See you.

818
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,420
She's moved.

819
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,620
Third Master she is okay all right,

820
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,860
Third Master is fine and has been rheumatized.

821
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,300
That's great!

822
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,420
Third Master

823
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,380
you think you're bad

824
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,540
and cannot rush things in maid?

825
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,660
Old Master

826
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,660
what's happening to her?

827
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:01,880
Hahaha

828
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
You

829
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,320
Honestly, I wouldn't choose this position Gulng Collected him

830
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,360
You two wanted to just способes

831
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,660
You said you didn't sellğl

832
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
But ran away

833
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,560
And dare you

834
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,160
I regret shortly

835
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,660
Why should I go

836
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,460
Until it was hard for me to Sanshan

837
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,160
You said I was going by the wage

838
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,280
Mystell take charge

839
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,900
Stars andapon damage

840
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,660
Give you the money

841
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,260
Dad, you really have a good conscience.

842
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,660
You just changed your mouth when my dad left.

843
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,460
Do you know that my dad didn't have money today?

844
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,860
Stop talking nonsense.

845
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,060
I'm telling you, who knows who's the best for your dad?

846
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,660
I know very well. I'm here for who, not for this family, not for the child.

847
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,860
Stop pulling the child in. The child is more sensible than you.

848
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,460
Fine. I finally understand.

849
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,460
In this family, only I am bad.

850
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,660
I am Bai Erlang. I am not filial. I am not good to this family.

851
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,860
Then what else can I do? divorce?

852
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,260
Who's the best for you?

853
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,660
Who's not good for you? Who's a bastard?

854
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,260
Dad,

855
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,260
this photo is for my grandpa.

856
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,860
I like how my grandpa doesn't wear a uniform.

857
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,060
Dad,

858
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,060
I'm sorry.

859
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,060
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm sorry.

861
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,060
I'm sorry.

862
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,060
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,060
I'm sorry.

864
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,060
I'm sorry.

865
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,060
I'm sorry.

866
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,460
I'm sorry.

867
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
Sixth Brother.

868
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,860
You said you came over, practicallyrew the passengers.

869
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,060
A'Gi, thank you.

870
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,260
It's alright, grandpa. I should clean up.

871
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,660
When I was not here, you didn't take care of me.

872
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,460
You are so polite.

873
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,060
You should be our old neighbor.

874
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,660
Be careful.

875
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,660
I'll get off.

876
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,060
Go. What are you looking at?

877
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,660
What are you looking at?

878
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,860
It's been 18 years.

879
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,460
You are living very fast. Hurry up.

880
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,260
Don't forget the door.

881
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,660
Lock the door.

882
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,660
You should take a good look.

883
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,860
I won't.

884
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Be careful.

885
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,460
You have to hold a big thing.

886
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,660
Yes.

887
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,460
Watch your step.

888
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,260
No, I won't.

889
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,060
I won't.

890
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,060
I'm leaving.

891
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,660
I'll take care of the things in the cabinet.

892
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,060
I know.

893
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,660
Right.

894
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,460
Take the key.

895
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,060
Keep it.

896
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,860
It's not that I won't come back.

897
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,260
That's right.

898
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,060
See you at school.

899
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,260
I'm leaving.

900
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,460
Okay.

901
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm leaving.

902
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,260
Wang, you've moved out?

903
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,060
I'm leaving.

904
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,260
You've been a neighbor for years.

905
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,260
You often come back to see us.

906
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Don't forget us.

907
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Can I forget?

908
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,060
I'm still holding your bag.

909
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,260
Yes.

910
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,860
Put it here.

911
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,060
Let's go, Wang.

912
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,260
Yes.

913
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,260
The End

914
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,660
Chen Chuan, I'm sorry.

915
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,260
I've been calling you for many years.

916
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,060
It's okay.

917
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,860
I'll cooperate with your work.

918
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:30,860
Right.

919
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,260
Teacher Fan brought the kids to Beijing to see the patient.

920
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,260
Do you want me to call them?

921
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,860
No.

922
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,860
Here, have some tea.

923
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,660
Thank you.

924
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,860
By the way,

925
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,660
about Uncle Huang,

926
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,460
try to control him in school.

927
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,060
Especially among the classmates.

928
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,260
Actually,

929
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,260
it has nothing to do with our school.

930
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,660
After all, Uncle Huang is not a student of Yu Ying.

931
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,460
Right.

932
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,660
Look at this.

933
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,860
How come there's Uncle Huang in this photo?

934
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,260
This is the first college in the bar.

935
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,660
This is the big picture.

936
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,460
Uncle Huang is a student of the second grade.

937
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,060
He hasn't come yet.

938
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,060
Yes, Chen Chuan.

939
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,660
This.

940
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,860
This is Qin Li, right?

941
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,660
Yes.

942
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,460
What's the situation with Qin Li in school?

943
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,660
Qin Li.

944
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,260
He was fired from the senior high school.

945
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,360
He was fired?

946
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,860
Why?

947
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,460
Fan Dian is wrong.

948
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,860
He's not very good at speaking.

949
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,260
Chen Chuan,

950
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,660
tell me.

951
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,260
This way.

952
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,660
Open the door.

953
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,260
Is it a long time ago?

954
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,660
Who is it?

955
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,260
Who is it?

956
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,660
Let me ask.

957
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,060
Is there anyone at the next door?

958
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,060
Is there anyone?

959
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,460
What are you doing?

960
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,860
I'm here to see his grandpa.

961
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,660
His grandpa is dead?

962
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,660
He's just left?

963
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,460
Is there anyone?

964
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,660
How would I know?

965
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,460
I've been wanting to move for years.

966
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,860
His dad is a murderer.

967
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,060
Everyone knows.

968
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,460
I can't even sell the house.

969
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,860
I'm so mad.

970
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,860
If you don't mention it, I won't be mad.

971
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,260
Where are you going?

972
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,260
Enough, mom. Don't cry.

973
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,660
I know.

974
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,060
Fine.

975
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,660
Just stay at home.

976
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,660
Okay.

977
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,660
Let me see. I'll move the case first.

978
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,060
Can you ask me to move in?

979
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,460
Okay. Don't worry.

980
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,860
What's wrong?

981
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,460
Something happened at my sister's house.

982
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,060
Are you okay?

983
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,860
I'm fine.

984
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,860
My sister-in-law and my sister-in-law were together yesterday.

985
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,060
That's too much.

986
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,860
We should go back and see.

987
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,660
I'll go now. I'll be back tonight.

988
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,660
Don't come back tonight.

989
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,060
I'll see you in half a day.

990
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,660
Really?

991
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,860
Are you the only one left?

992
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,860
Who said I can't?

993
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,660
Then thank you.

994
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,260
Tonight, if you have time,

995
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,860
you can have a meal with Xiaoshan.

996
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,860
Why?

997
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,460
My sister-in-law told me that Xiaoshan is kind to you.

998
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,660
You're a man. You should be more proactive.

999
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,060
I know.

1000
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,860
Isn't this our recent case?

1001
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,260
We don't have time.

1002
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,460
You must have a meal with her tonight.

1003
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,660
Fine. Consider it.

1004
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,260
What do you mean? What's wrong?

1005
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,260
Did you get the money? Tell me if you got the money.

1006
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,260
Who told you to get the money?

1007
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,460
How about this? I'll call her later.

1008
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,860
That's enough.

1009
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,460
Let's go.

1010
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,860
How much do you want?

1011
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,460
Brother, thank you.

1012
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,660
How much does he give you?

1013
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,460
I'll ask you for some money.

1014
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,260
I'll call you later.

1015
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,260
No, brother.

1016
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,860
You can call me.

1017
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,260
How much?

1018
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:31,860
Give me some.

1019
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
Wang Fu!

1020
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,260
Happy birthday.

1021
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,260
Let's talk.

1022
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,260
I'm so tired.

1023
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,260
I'm so tired.

1024
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,260
I'm so tired.

1025
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,260
I'm so tired.

1026
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
I'm so tired.

1027
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
I'm so tired.

1028
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,260
I'm so tired.

1029
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
I'm so tired.

1030
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm so tired.

1031
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,260
I'm so tired.

1032
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
I'm so tired.

1033
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,260
I'm so tired.

1034
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,260
I'm so tired.

1035
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,260
I'm so tired.

1036
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,260
I'm so tired.

1037
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,260
I'm so tired.

1038
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,260
I'm so tired.

1039
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,260
I'm so tired.

1040
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,260
I'm so tired.

1041
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,260
You're not cold-blooded.

1042
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,260
I often feel that's the least of your kind.

1043
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,260
I've tried so much.

1044
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,260
It takes me a lot.

1045
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,260
You continue.

1046
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,260
There is something else to talk about when I emerging.

1047
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,260
I'm so happy to see you

1048
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,260
I'm so happy to see you

1049
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,260
I'm so happy to see you

1050
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,260
I'm so happy to see you

1051
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,260
I'm so happy to see you

1052
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,260
I'm so happy to see you

1053
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,260
I'm so happy to see you

1054
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,260
I'm so happy to see you

1055
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,260
I'm so happy to see you

1056
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,260
I'm so happy to see you

1057
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,260
I'm so happy to see you

1058
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,260
I'm so happy to see you

1059
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,260
I'm so happy to see you

1060
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,260
I'm so happy to see you

1061
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,260
I'm so happy to see you

1062
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,260
I'm so happy to see you

1063
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,260
I'm a bit worried

1064
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,260
I like to see you

1065
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,260
A little bit afraid of me

1066
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,260
The expressions and love between your friends

1067
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,260
Out of the形

1068
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,260
The color is sweet

1069
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,260
And the unique

1070
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,260
exclusive

1071
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,260
I like to see you

1072
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,260
A little bit afraid of me

1073
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1074
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1075
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1076
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1077
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1078
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1079
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1080
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,260

00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1082
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1083
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1084
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1085
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,260
I'm not afraid of the world

1086
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,260
I'm not afraid of the world
