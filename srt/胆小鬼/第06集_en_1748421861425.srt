00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,900
Kneel

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,920
Kneel

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,560
Didn't you want to get lovelytables before

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,800
How did you write theμά

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who are you looking at?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not looking at anyone.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm just looking at you.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm asking you.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've been looking at you recently.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're not doing well.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's tight.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Go home.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Where are you going?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Come on.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yiling.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you looking at?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The prize for the weekly issue.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Just take it.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's so tight.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What did you get?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A new one.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I heard from the university that

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the recent machine is quite advanced.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Didn't you not see

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the performance of the weekly issue

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
before?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The recent issue is quite interesting.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's appropriate.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have to give other students some opportunities.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you're really good,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you can go to the US.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're smart.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You don't treat culture as a matter of fact.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you take the final exam,

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which leg you take,

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
it's all sick.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do you understand?

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I understand.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Go.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Goodbye, Mr. Hao.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000

You're kidding.

You're kidding me.

Don't be shocked.

148

Everything will be fine.

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't hear you.

151
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everyone's worried about me.

152
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now you have to be helpful,

153
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Even you can't be helpful.

154
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sorry to mess with you.

155
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There's nothing to worry about.

156
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay now.

157
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I know it.

158
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you don't believe me,

159
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you need to consider yourself better than ever.

160
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sure that you will have more efforts to get the whole world attention.

161
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go.

162
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Stand up!

163
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank God.

164
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank God.

165
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Be careful with yourhas boots

166
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,840
Just play

167
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Look at the difference

168
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
What?

169
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,280
Bro, team backup

170
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,280
Go

171
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,940

I'll teach you.

174
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,440
I'll teach you.

175
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Wang Di, are you tired?

176
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,940
I'm not. I'll go back to my room.

177
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,440
Come here!

178
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
You can't sit with me for a while.

179
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,440
Are you okay?

180
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,940
You're not dead.

181
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
What's wrong?

182
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
I asked your organization to come out and play.

183
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,440
You knew my feet were not good.

184
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,940
You still had to come to play.

185
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,440
Why don't you forget?

186
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Besides, why didn't you answer my phone?

187
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,940
Can you be nicer to me in the future?

188
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,440
Why did I do that to you?

189
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
You know how to pretend to be stupid.

190
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Enough.

191
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Let's have dinner tonight.

192
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
Let's play together.

193
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Let's play together.

194
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,940
You've lost your money.

195
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm afraid to give it to you.

196
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,940
Jin Li!

197
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,940
Are you okay? Where's Shuang Shuang?

198
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
He's lost his mind.

199
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
He's in pain again.

200
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
I'm fine.

201
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Put your butt down.

202
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Put your weight on the front.

203
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Put your knees on the inside.

204
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
You won't fall.

205
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,940
It's not because of this.

206
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,940
What?

207
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,940
I said it's not because of this that he fell.

208
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
That's my fault.

209
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,940
Let's go first.

210
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Let's play together.

211
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
You didn't fall, did you?

212
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
I'm fine.

213
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,940
Who was the one who just talked to you?

214
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Qi Shuai.

215
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,940
It seems to be the bodyguard of the team.

216
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,940
Gao Lei? Where is he?

217
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
I didn't see him.

218
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Who do you know?

219
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,940
Zhai Jiang, are you cold?

220
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Let's go.

221
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
Are you cold?

222
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Or do you feel bad for me?

223
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Wang Di said he wants to treat you.

224
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Let's go.

225
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Let's go.

226
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,940
Let's go.

227
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Let's go.

228
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
Wang Di, treat me.

229
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
Let's go.

230
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
Let's go.

231
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
It's so cold.

232
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,940
I told you not to go.

233
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,940
You're so cold.

234
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,940
My dad said he'd drink if it's cold.

235
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
He'd sing if it's not cold.

236
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Sing.

237
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Find the person who loves you the most.

238
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
The person who loves you the most.

239
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Come and say goodbye.

240
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Stop singing.

241
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
It's so hard to stop.

242
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
You sing.

243
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
I don't sing.

244
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
Wang Di, you can sing.

245
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Just like Qi Li.

246
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
I don't.

247
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,940
You can't.

248
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Wang Di, you can carry a stone.

249
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
I want to carry a stone for you.

250
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
Where?

251
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,940
The one on the table.

252
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
What's that?

253
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
The one on the table.

254
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
The one on the table.

255
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
Yes, the one on the table.

256
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I want to carry a stone for you.

257
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Hurry.

258
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
What are you saying?

259
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Hurry.

260
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
What are you saying?

261
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
I want to hear it too.

262
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Qi Li will carry a stone.

263
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Let her carry it.

264
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
You carry it together.

265
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
I'm not a man.

266
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
I'm just a man.

267
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Jia Ru.

268
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,940
I can break a heart.

269
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,940
I don't have a life.

270
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
Jia Ru.

271
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
I can remove the pain of a person.

272
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
Or the sorrow of a person.

273
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,760
Or the

274
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,940
torn-up bird.

275
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,940
And re-replay it.

276
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I don't have a life.

277
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Stop.

278
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
It's too early.

279
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
I like it.

280
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
One more time.

281
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Jia Ru.

282
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm just a man.

283
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm just a man.

284
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm just a man.

285
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
This is the place I grew up.

286
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,940
I'm going to the hospital with my cousin.

287
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
I'm leaving.

288
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
I'm leaving.

289
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Bye.

290
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,940
This book is from Wu Daoban.

291
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,940
It's famous.

292
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
What do you mean?

293
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,940
The most beautiful dance class?

294
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
You don't know it in the art school.

295
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,940
You even like to compare it.

296
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,940
After the New Year,

297
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Uncle Huang has been living in the dormitory?

298
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,940
It seems so.

299
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,940
I've been there for two days.

300
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
I've seen him.

301
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,940
There are still a few people who live in the dormitory after the New Year.

302
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,940
Do you have any registration records for the student dormitory?

303
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
Yes, I have. Let me see.

304
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
The writing on the top,

305
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,940
he has been living here since the vacation.

306
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,940
From when did you start reading?

307
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
The New Year's Eve.

308
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,940
No. 1 and No. 2.

309
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
No. 25 is here.

310
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
There are signs.

311
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,940
After No. 25,

312
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,940
he hasn't come back.

313
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Do you have a note?

314
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
There is a request on the top.

315
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Is this your signature?

316
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
It's not me.

317
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
Did someone else sign it?

318
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,940
You didn't even want to come back.

319
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,940
He was in the dormitory.

320
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,940
He said he would come back.

321
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,940
You mean Uncle Huang's dormitory?

322
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
No. 207.

323
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,940
No. 257.

324
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
No. 257.

325
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,940
No. 257.

326
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
No. 257.

327
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,940
No. 257.

328
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,940
No. 257.

329
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
No. 257.

330
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
No. 257.

331
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
No. 257.

332
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
Is there a note?

333
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
No.

334
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
It's private.

335
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
You can't do that.

336
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
What should I do if he comes back?

337
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
What happened to Uncle Huang?

338
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I need to talk to the school.

339
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,940
You heard it just now?

340
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
I didn't mean it.

341
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Do you have something to say?

342
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Uncle, can you promise not to tell me?

343
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
Yes.

344
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,940
There is a changing room under the second floor of the water room window.

345
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
After the dormitory is locked,

346
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,940
you can go out from the window to the changing room.

347
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Where did Uncle Huang go?

348
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,940
He went out to play in the bar.

349
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,940
When did you see him?

350
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,940
Two years ago.

351
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,940
He didn't go to the hospital yet.

352
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
At that time, there was a man who came to him.

353
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,940
He was riding a motorcycle waiting outside to pick him up and go out to play.

354
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Uncle Huang jumped out of there.

355
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,940
Then Uncle Huang returned.

356
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
The man continued to look for him.

357
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,940
But they were like a couple.

358
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,940
That man didn't look like a good person.

359
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
He came two days ago.

360
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Do you know what that man is called?

361
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
No.

362
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
I don't know those people outside.

363
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
In your class,

364
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,940
someone had a big fight with Uncle Huang.

365
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
A boy.

366
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,940
No.

367
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Uncle Huang is a good person.

368
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
He likes me.

369
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,940
All the boys like him.

370
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Is he like his mother?

371
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
He's missing.

372
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Brother, look at this.

373
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,940
Uncle Huang's time is on the 28th.

374
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
The missing time is on the 25th.

375
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
He went home with the school.

376
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Both of them are dead.

377
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,940
What can you do on the 25th and 28th days?

378
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
Find out who Uncle Huang's phone is.

379
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Who has been in contact with him these days?

380
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
Okay.

381
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Brother, the boy he said to Wang Hai Tao.

382
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
The girl said that little boy.

383
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,940
Can you be alone?

384
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
I don't know.

385
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
He wants this book.

386
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I think

387
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,940
if we can find out who sent this book to Uncle Huang,

388
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,940
we can't be so lucky.

389
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,940
I've read it.

390
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
I didn't write any name in the book.

391
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,940
I didn't leave any notes.

392
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,940
But this book is indeed a mystery.

393
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,940
You two haven't eaten yet.

394
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
It's a free meal.

395
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Don't you see that people eat too much?

396
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
You two are all too young.

397
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
I'll pay you.

398
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
This is your last account.

399
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Please have a free meal.

400
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
My dad gave me 100 yuan.

401
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
This is a free event.

402
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,940
It's easy for four people to be together.

403
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
I'm saving 16 yuan.

404
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
I want to drink beer.

405
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
What beer?

406
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
It's money.

407
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
You really want to drink?

408
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
Yes.

409
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
You want to drink it, I'll treat you.

410
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Drink it all.

411
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
I'll treat you.

412
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Fu Yuan.

413
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Okay, I'll treat you.

414
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Fu Yuan.

415
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Four beer.

416
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,940
Four beer, five stars.

417
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
I'll drink it.

418
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
I'm not sure about the fate.

419
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
It's all money.

420
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
I'll drink it all.

421
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
I'll drink it all.

422
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
Xiaoxiao.

423
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
You're not afraid that you'll be drunk.

424
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
Hu Xunxin will scold you.

425
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,940
My parents are all good.

426
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
I'm not afraid of anyone.

427
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Don't say that.

428
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
You'll be drunk later.

429
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
You won't be drinking beer.

430
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,940
You don't need to worry about drinking beer.

431
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
You don't need to be so shy.

432
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
What can you say in the morning?

433
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
He wants to call you the heart-wrenching soldier.

434
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
I don't like him.

435
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
He's a good person.

436
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
I don't like him either.

437
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Yes.

438
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Except for us,

439
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
he's never seen anyone else.

440
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
You're right.

441
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
What are we talking about?

442
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
We're here.

443
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
One and a half.

444
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Come on.

445
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Thank you.

446
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Cheers.

447
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Cheers.

448
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
What's in it?

449
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
What's in it?

450
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,940
It's the same word.

451
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,940
You're a genius.

452
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
You're a genius.

453
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,940
I'm a bad man.

454
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
I'm a good man.

455
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I'm a good man.

456
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
I'll try it again.

457
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
It's very serious.

458
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,940
The night sky is dark.

459
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,940
There must be stars.

460
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
I can hear it.

461
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
It's dark again.

462
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
It's a love story.

463
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,940
It's so funny.

464
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
It's funny.

465
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
It's so funny.

466
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
You're here for the rest of your life.

467
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
Don't think about it.

468
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,940
Don't think about it.

469
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Cheers.

470
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,940
Cheers.

471
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
It's so funny.

472
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
It's a little bitter.

473
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
Brother Shui,

474
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
order a menu.

475
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
It's money.

476
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,940
No.

477
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,940
Let's go.

478
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
How much is it?

479
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
It's a dollar.

480
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
It's ten dollars.

481
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Ten dollars.

482
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
It's so expensive.

483
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
It's not expensive.

484
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
It's a fixed price.

485
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
It's okay.

486
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
I'll pay for it.

487
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
I'll pay for it.

488
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
It's time for you to write it.

489
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,940
Okay.

490
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Let's listen to it.

491
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
Listen to it.

492
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
I want to listen to Dan Xiaogui.

493
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
Dan Xiaogui?

494
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
Dan Xiaogui.

495
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
I'm sorry.

496
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
I can't.

497
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
You can do it.

498
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
What can you do?

499
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
I can express my heart.

500
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
What?

501
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
I can express my heart.

502
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
What do you mean?

503
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Let's sing it by ourselves.

504
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Let's give him the money.

505
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
It's okay.

506
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
It's okay.

507
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
You can make money.

508
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
It's okay.

509
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
It's okay.

510
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Okay.

511
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
I'll write it.

512
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
It's okay.

513
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
It's okay.

514
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
You love coffee.

515
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
It's like a drop-off.

516
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
It's a beautiful music.

517
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
It's a beautiful music.

518
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,940
You are special.

519
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Every one is like a new one.

520
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Love, love, love, love.

521
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,940
Such a beautiful song.

522
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Let's sing it together.

523
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Xinlin, let's sing it together.

524
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
I like to see you smile.

525
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,940
You call me Dan Xiaogui.

526
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,940
Your expression is like a beautiful sea.

527
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,940
You are special.

528
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,940
I like to see you smile.

529
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
You call me Dan Xiaogui.

530
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Your expression is like a beautiful sea.

531
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Your lips are sweet.

532
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Your lips are sweet.

533
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
You are special.

534
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,940
I like to see you smile.

535
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,940
You call me Dan Xiaogui.

536
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,940
My heart is like a cup of wine.

537
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Love is drunk.

538
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
It's weird.

539
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
The wrong positioning.

540
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
Love you.

541
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Wang Di, faster.

542
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Faster.

543
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Faster.

544
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
Faster.

545
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,940
Faster.

546
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
Faster.

547
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Xiaojiao.

548
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
Why don't we send you off first?

549
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Master, go to the garden.

550
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Don't go too far.

551
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
We should send you off first.

552
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
I'm not worried.

553
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
What are you worried about?

554
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
You are smaller than me.

555
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Listen to me.

556
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Master, go to the garden.

557
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I have a question for you.

558
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Go ahead.

559
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
Wang Di and Qin Li.

560
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Who do you like more?

561
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
I like them all.

562
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940
What do you mean?

563
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,940
I mean, if there is only them in this world,

564
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
you can only choose one.

565
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Who do you choose?

566
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Can't you bring them together?

567
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
No.

568
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Then I choose you.

569
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Forget it.

570
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I know that you don't like me.

571
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
What are you trying to do?

572
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
Slow down.

573
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
You like Uncle Huang.

574
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
No.

575
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
You just like him.

576
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
No.

577
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
You like him.

578
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
No.

579
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
You like him.

580
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
You just like him.

581
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,940
No.

582
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,940
You like him.

583
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
No.

584
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
You like him.

585
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
You just like him.

586
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
No.

587
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,940
I just don't want to show you.

588
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,940
When time is right between you and the flavorful,

589
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
it's good.

590
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Just enjoy the food.

591
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,640
I think

592
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,940
maybe the details are interesting.

593
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
If one could look like mesoft,

594
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
I hope everyone could give it a try

595
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,100
I heard the gunshot yesterday.

596
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,700
I can't find it today.

597
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,180
How many times did I tell you?

598
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,580
You put it back.

599
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,100
Did you hear me?

600
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,980
Look.

601
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,500
How can he wear this new, head wig?

602
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,280
Wang Di,

603
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,940
did you promise a girl

604
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,720
to come out

605
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,060
but you didn't confirm

606
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,860
some customs of the addresses of the dating?

607
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,820
Are you used to it?

608
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,420
We don't have a date.

609
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Didn't you say you'd never see me again?

610
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

611
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,860
If you can't handle it,

612
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,620
I'll put this ice on your head.

613
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,100
Are you hungry?

614
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,620
I want to eat McDonald's.

615
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,300
Then let's go.

616
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
I want to sing.

617
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
Then you want to sing first?

618
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
Can you be like a man?

619
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,340
I'll be your girlfriend.

620
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
When I was in school,

621
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,860
I liked all kinds of boys.

622
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,860
High school,

623
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
love,

624
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
and those foreign boys.

625
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
Is it the most beautiful boy you've ever chosen?

626
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
What do you know at that time?

627
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
They were all kids.

628
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
You're all more than I am.

629
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
What do you know at that time?

630
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
They were all more than I am.

631
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Who was it at that time?

632
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
The most beautiful.

633
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
One day,

634
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,860
they were all covered in yellow and put on a blanket.

635
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
Huang Di,

636
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
I have a question.

637
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
What is it?

638
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Have you ever felt anything

639
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
from the beginning to the end?

640
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
No.

641
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Forget it.

642
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
No need to answer.

643
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
I always thought

644
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
the four of us

645
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
were the least afraid of me.

646
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I only understand now

647
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
that it was you.

648
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,860
I'll spend every weekend while dismissing two boys.

649
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Good.

650
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
I really want to be together.

651
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I want to be with you

652
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Why you ignore it

653
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
and still pretend to be easy?

654
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,880
Well,

655
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,680
Your expression is like the beauty of friendship

656
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,480
The lonely taste of the sweet side

657
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,480
It's unique and special

658
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,680
I like to see you quietly and quietly

659
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Call me a little turtle

660
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,480
My heart wants to be with my lover

661
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,880
Weird intuition, wrong positioning

662
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,480
I love you

663
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,280
I have a feeling

664
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Let's go, let's go to the questions

665
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
Just take the camera

666
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,880
We have been in the photo for a long time

667
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,080
I'm afraid I'll hit it

668
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
I'm afraid I'll hit it

669
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,280
Go in

670
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Go in

671
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,880
Go away, go away, go away

672
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I'm here

673
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
Huang Shun, don't listen to me

674
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Where is this photo?

675
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,680
Look at me like this

676
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
My left hand is three

677
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Look at me like this

678
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,480
Three, two, one

679
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,680
Tears

680
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm more willing to be with you

681
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,280
I like to see you quietly and quietly

682
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,080
Call me a little turtle

683
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Your expression is like the beauty of friendship

684
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,680
The lonely taste of the sweet side

685
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,080
It's unique and special

686
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,480
I like to see you quietly and quietly

687
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Call me a little turtle

688
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,680
My heart wants to be with my lover

689
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Weird intuition, wrong positioning

690
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I love you

691
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,680
I have a feeling

692
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,480
I like to see you quietly and quietly

693
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Call me a little turtle

694
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,680
Your expression is like the beauty of friendship

695
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,280
The lonely taste of the sweet side

696
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,280
It's unique and special

697
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
I like to see you quietly and quietly

698
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Call me a little turtle

699
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,280
My heart wants to be with my lover

700
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Weird intuition, wrong positioning

701
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
I love you

702
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
I have a feeling

703
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I have a feeling

704
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
I have a feeling

705
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
I have a feeling

706
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I have a feeling

707
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I have a feeling

708
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
I have a feeling

709
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I have a feeling

710
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
I have a feeling

711
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I have a feeling

712
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I have a feeling

713
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I have a feeling

714
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
I have a feeling

715
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I have a feeling

716
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
I have a feeling

717
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,880
I have a feeling

718
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,880
I have a feeling

719
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,880
I have a feeling

720
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Dad

721
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
Dad

722
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Hello

723
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
You're back

724
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,680
I woke you up

725
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
It's only 4.30 am

726
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
It's almost a bad day

727
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,280
Girl, why are you crying?

728
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm going to marry my master

729
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
What did he say to you?

730
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,680
He didn't say anything

731
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
He just laughed at me

732
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
He looks younger than before

733
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
He misses you

734
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Dad, do you still want to hurt?

735
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Your legs hurt in winter, right?

736
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
One year is more powerful than one year

737
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Don't talk about it when you're old

738
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Don't talk nonsense

739
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Say no

740
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Don't talk

741
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Okay

742
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
No

743
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Your hair is too soft

744
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
It's all white

745
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
It's dark

746
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
It's too dark

747
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
How about you dye it for me?

748
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
How many colors?

749
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
I don't know anything

750
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
These are the most popular colors

751
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
I think it's still black

752
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
It looks good

753
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
It's a little bit small

754
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
I don't laugh

755
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
You know it yourself

756
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,880
When will you be able to teach your boyfriend?

757
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I'll get you a plate tomorrow

758
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
You can pick it, okay?

759
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
You're so silly

760
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I'll go to the bathroom

761
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
I'll go to the bathroom

762
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
I'll go to the bathroom

763
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
I'll go to the bathroom

764
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I'll go to the bathroom

765
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
I'll go to the bathroom

766
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Dad, you're so silly

767
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
I'm not used to it

768
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm scared

769
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Okay, I just woke up

770
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
I'm here to accompany you

771
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I'll do whatever you say

772
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Really?

773
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Okay

774
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,880
the pointing

775
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,680
Unknown

776
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
I don't know

777
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
The body was dragged after death.

778
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,880
The knife and wound at the chest are the same as the devil's.

779
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
What is the devil's plan?

780
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
What is the soul-killer?

781
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Don't scare me.

782
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Enough.

783
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Let me tell you.

784
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
This case is really bad.

785
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Why didn't you call the team?

786
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Didn't the team ask for a leave?

787
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,880
I called them. They said they would be back soon.

788
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Why didn't you tell me first?

789
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Captain Cao, I want to talk to you.

790
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
Go ahead.

791
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,880
I was the one who was the most aware of the case.

792
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Liu Ping and Xiao Deng.

793
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,880
These two cases are obviously related to each other.

794
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
So I think we should call the team back.

795
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I said it.

796
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I don't want to be involved in this.

797
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I don't want to be involved in this.

798
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
But I think we should call the team back.

799
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I said it.

800
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I'll handle this case.

801
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Who is he fronting?

802
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I know he is in a state of disappointment.

803
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I'll come back to him later.

804
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,680

He and I are going to turn it off.

818
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,340

Change our relations.

824
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,700
If he wants to.

825
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:03,700

I'll be back soon.

827
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,380
What a beautiful picture.

828
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,100
The news around it.

829
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,820
I realized it.

830
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,140
You knew it too soon.

831
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,100
I'm just thinking,

832
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,820
she should do them anyway.

833
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,100
Stop a little boy.

834
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Who is Thorthof's Sin Chau?

835
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,180
Where's the Sin Chau?

836
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,620
He is in New Hampshire.

837
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,140
He has a certain task.

838
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,700
Tell you what.

839
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Why did he call Zhen Yang that night?

840
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
I found something.

841
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
What is it?

842
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Can you be so quick to call him?

843
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,700
One morning, a man called me.

844
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,700
He said he knew I paid 50,000 yuan in the first place.

845
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
He can help me.

846
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
As long as he asks someone to talk to the boss,

847
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,700
I don't need to pay.

848
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
What's the condition?

849
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
I want to pay for him.

850
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Are you sure?

851
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Yes, I'm on the way.

852
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
What brand of car?

853
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
I didn't come down when I was on my own.

854
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
It's a black car anyway.

855
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
I think you didn't come down.

856
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,700
After the hospital, which road did you go through?

857
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
This one.

858
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
You're sure now?

859
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Yes.

860
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,700
I'm on the way.

861
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I'll pay for the car.

862
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I'll pay for the car.

863
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
I'll pay for the car.

864
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I'll pay for the car.

865
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,700
I'll pay for the car.

866
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
I'll pay for the car.

867
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
The car is not stupid.

868
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,700
I'm always with you.

869
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,700
I heard that

870
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
I was chased by this guy.

871
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
So I asked him to go to the outside world.

872
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Where did he pick up my friend?

873
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,700
You haven't seen that person.

874
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
You should have taken him to the hospital.

875
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
If it's really not true...

876
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,700
In that person's phone call,

877
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,700
what else should I tell you?

878
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,700
He...

879
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
He...

880
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,700
He asked me twice.

881
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Did he ever have a daughter?

882
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
I'm lying.

883
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
Master, are you working here every day?

884
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Yes.

885
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
What time do you come here every day?

886
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I get up at 6 in the morning.

887
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I eat and drink.

888
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
I come here quickly.

889
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
I want to ask you something.

890
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
It's afternoon.

891
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get up early.

892
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I'm not sure.

893
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
I'm not sure.

894
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I'm not sure.

895
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
I'm not sure.

896
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
It's afternoon.

897
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Is there a black car on the way?

898
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Black car?

899
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,700
You can't get there in the middle of the day.

900
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
I can't remember.

901
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Master, this road is full of people.

902
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
There are people in the front and in the village.

903
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
If you go further,

904
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
you won't be able to get there.

905
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
You won't be able to get into the car.

906
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Is this a big place?

907
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
It's been a long time since I've been here.

908
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
Is there anything else on this road?

909
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
This is a big place.

910
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
Master, do you think you can get here in the end?

911
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Is this your car?

912
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
It should have been wasted long ago.

913
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
Captain Hong.

914
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
We have to go now.

915
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Are you okay?

916
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
I'm fine.

917
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
I'm fine.

918
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
I'm fine.

919
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
I'm fine.

920
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I'm fine.

921
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
I'm fine.

922
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
I'm fine.

923
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
I'm fine.

924
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
I'm fine.

925
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
I'm fine.

926
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
I'm fine.

927
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
I'm fine.

928
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
I'm fine.

929
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,700
I'm fine.

930
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
I'm fine.

931
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I can't return to the world I belong to.

932
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,700
You are in your world.

933
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:07,700
I don't care.

934
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Your company is for bright and bright.

935
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,700
Mr. on essay.

936
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Mr. on essay.

937
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,700
I watch them every day.

938
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,700
I've practiced before about this.

939
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,700
The same style in Chinese.

940
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:49,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

941
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

942
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

943
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

944
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

945
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

946
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

947
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

948
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

949
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
I'm afraid of being lost in emotions

950
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:37,500
It's nice to see you

951
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,500
I don't know why I'm so attached to you

952
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
I'm a little worried

953
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,500
I like to see you quietly looking at my little turtle

954
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Your expression is more than a friend's love

955
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,500
The lonely bed is sweet

956
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,500
And unique and unique

957
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,500
I like to see you quietly looking at my little turtle

958
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,500
My mood is like a pair of friends in a cave

959
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,500
The weird world, the so-called engagement

960
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I love you
