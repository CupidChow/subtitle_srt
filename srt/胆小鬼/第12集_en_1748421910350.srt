1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Where are you going?

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,160
The coffee Smell of you

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,400
The music of love is very beautiful.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,320
Xin Yue,

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,400
so many years,

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,640
what did you listen to?

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,480
You're thin again.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,760
I didn't see you.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,400
Do you always eat instant noodles?

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
I told you many times,

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,200
don't eat instant noodles.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,960
I don't have nutrition.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,520
I don't think

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,840
I can cook well.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,120
By the way,

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,720
I have a big surprise for you.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,120
Next week,

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,000
I can go to the theater.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,920
This time, I'll be alone.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,560
How about it?

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,480
Am I really good?

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,920
I also left you

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
the best place

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,320
in the middle of the street.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
Did Xiang Xiang grow up?

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,880
Don't you know me?

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
Xin Yue,

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,440
how about you?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,440
I have a big hiccup.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,120
How did you get married?

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,720
I was crazy about you.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,480
But I still have far more that I have.

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,080
But you sure I raise him very well.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
You look so pretty.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Even though I'm not pretty.

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
You're so annoying.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
Watch your hands.

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
Oh.

39
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
You look so grumpy.

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,600
No need to be nervous.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
Tomorrow is the first day of the game.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's play for a while.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,760
Just one hour.

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,880
Who can relax and play well?

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,560
Right?

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,880
You can just throw your ball out of the net.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,640
I really didn't expect that.

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,960
How can you enter the finals?

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,600
The coach is very important this time.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,080
Or else, he won't let me accompany you.

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,640
Right?

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,840
Mr. Fan.

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,400
If I don't think about it,

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
will you be disappointed?

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,360
If you are the most talented person in my team,

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,880
really.

57
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040

Why haven't you left yet?

161
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm at home.

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Didn't we say that we'd meet at 10 a.m.

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
and watch a movie together?

164
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
I forgot!

165
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
You're so good.

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
You're angry.

167
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
No, I forgot.

168
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Wang Di asked me to tell you.

169
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
He can't go today.

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
He's going to watch basketball match with Gao Lei.

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
He called me yesterday.

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
When did he forget?

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I'm sorry, Uncle Jiu.

174
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Don't leave.

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
How about this?

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Forget it. It's okay.

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Please say sorry to Qing Ling.

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Bye.

179
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Uncle Jiu said that Wang Di...

180
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
I heard it.

181
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
It's your turn.

182
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440

188
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Please say sorry to him.

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Why are you angry with him?

190
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Qing Ling.

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Don't be so rude.

192
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm here for you.

193
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm here for you.

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I won't let you call them.

195
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Next time, you can call them yourself.

196
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
He said you're angry.

197
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Before the class,

198
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
I'll announce two things.

199
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
The first thing is...

200
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
The new idea of the first season is to play the game.

201
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Everyone knows that

202
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I personally led Wang Di to the first Beijing Championship.

203
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Right?

204
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
The other members of the group

205
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
called us and informed us.

206
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Wang Di won the prize.

207
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Wang Di,

208
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
guess the first prize.

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I don't know.

210
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Let's give the first prize to the national team.

211
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Come on.

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
You don't have to say anything.

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Come on.

214
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Say something.

215
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Come on.

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Thank you, everyone.

217
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Thank you, teacher.

218
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Oh, no.

219
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Xi Zi is not your style now.

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay.

221
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Next class,

222
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
come to my office.

223
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
You tell me alone.

224
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Wang Di, I'm so proud of you.

225
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
You...

226
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
You have to celebrate this time.

227
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Tell me the second big thing.

228
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
You can't go crazy.

229
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
The school leader decided

230
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,440
to restore the autumn oil for our senior year.

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Wow.

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Wow.

233
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Wow.

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Wow.

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Wow.

236
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Wow.

237
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Wow.

238
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
What's the second prize?

239
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
This time,

240
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
it's for the senior year.

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
The prize is the water fountain.

242
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Yes.

243
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Hey, what are you doing?

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,440
It's not bad to have fun in the senior year.

245
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
The old rule is

246
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
to be free and willing.

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
The beauty will be free.

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
If you want to go,

249
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
go to Fang Liu's place to report your name.

250
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
I'll go.

251
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I want to go back

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
and discuss with the parents.

253
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Don't report your name.

254
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
If the parents don't agree,

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
go to my place.

256
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Teacher, I don't care about that.

257
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Qiu You, you must go.

258
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Qing Li, Qiu You, let's go together.

259
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
If uncle Huang is here,

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
we won't have fun together.

261
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Right?

262
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Are you going?

263
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Okay, no more discussion.

264
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm done.

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I'll talk to you later.

266
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
One more big thing.

267
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Today afternoon,

268
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
the principal of the school will come to our school to check.

269
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
You guys are all old.

270
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
The school uniform is all dressed up.

271
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Who's going to do the thing?

272
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Do you hear me?

273
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Yes.

274
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,660
Coach Chang,

275
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,280
Don't think much about that.

276
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,260
Meow.

277
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Meow.

278
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,940
Don't run.

279
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,820
Go.

280
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,380
What rubbish is this?

281
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,780
Just pick it up and sweep it.

282
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,420
Mr. Chen,

283
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,260
the leader is not fit to go to the safe zone.

284
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,060
What if?

285
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,740
Don't be careless.

286
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,180
Hurry up.

287
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,820
Hurry up.

288
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,460
Go.

289
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,100
Where are you from?

290
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Isn't he a wild cat?

291
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Is he here?

292
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,300
Manager,

293
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
why are you here again?

294
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
Who asked you to pick up the cat?

295
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,700
Hurry up.

296
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm talking to you.

297
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,700
Do you hear me?

298
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,500
Hurry up.

299
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,300
I'm...

300
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,100
I heard...

301
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,300
I heard...

302
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
What's wrong?

303
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
You still want to hit me?

304
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,300
Mr. Chen,

305
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
the leader is coming.

306
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,300
If you let me hear the cat,

307
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
you'll be dead.

308
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Hurry up.

309
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Hurry up.

310
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Hurry up.

311
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Hurry up.

312
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Hurry up.

313
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Hurry up.

314
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Did you hear that?

315
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
What is going on?

316
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Did you hear that?

317
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Did you hear that?

318
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Did you hear that?

319
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
What's the situation?

320
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
The sound of the sound is so loud.

321
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Meow.

322
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Meow.

323
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Meow.

324
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Meow.

325
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Meow.

326
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Meow.

327
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Meow.

328
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
What are you looking at?

329
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Here.

330
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Meow.

331
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Move aside.

332
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
Meow.

333
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Meow.

334
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Qing Ling.

335
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Open the door.

336
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Qing Ling.

337
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Qing Ling.

338
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Here.

339
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Meow.

340
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
You scared me.

341
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Qing Ling, be careful.

342
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
You...

343
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Get down.

344
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Get down.

345
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
The owner is here.

346
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
What are you looking at?

347
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Get down.

348
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Move aside.

349
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Look at him.

350
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
You have a good influence.

351
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
You listen to the owner.

352
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Get down.

353
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Fang Di.

354
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Fang Di.

355
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Go.

356
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Get the key.

357
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
I'll go.

358
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Go if you want.

359
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
I won't.

360
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
You still want to go, right?

361
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Go.

362
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Go.

363
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Qing Ling.

364
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Come down.

365
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Go.

366
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Go.

367
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Go.

368
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Go.

369
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Go.

370
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Go.

371
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Go.

372
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Go.

373
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Go.

374
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Go.

375
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Go.

376
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Go.

377
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Fang Di.

378
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
What are you looking at?

379
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Go.

380
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Go.

381
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Go.

382
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Go.

383
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Go.

384
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Go.

385
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Go.

386
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Let's go.

387
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Go.

388
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,620
Is there

389
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,540
She's scaring you

390
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,540
Why are you letting go

391
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,220
Cover my face

392
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,300
Qi Ling, what are you doing?

393
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,700
Don't try to change seats!

394
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,100
If you do this, I'll tell Teacher Fan.

395
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
I'm sorry.

396
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,900
I'm sorry.

397
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
I'm sorry.

398
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm sorry.

401
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm sorry.

403
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I'm sorry.

404
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,300
I'm sorry.

405
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,900
He wants to interview you!

406
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Teacher Fan, you're his classmate.

407
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,100
You have to recommend him.

408
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,500
Yes.

409
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,700
Do you know how much he needs to use now?

410
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,300
Don't be angry.

411
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,100
But I heard that he's a teaching leader.

412
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,300
What do you mean? I thought too much.

413
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,100
No, that's not what I meant.

414
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,700
Then what do you mean?

415
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
Don't be angry.

416
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,700
This kid in the group, he has a problem.

417
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,100
But based on my understanding of this kid,

418
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,700
if no one makes him like that,

419
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,500
he won't be like this.

420
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,100
You mean I'm making him like that?

421
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,300
No, no, no.

422
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,500
I didn't mean that.

423
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,100
I just think that you're a kid.

424
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,300
You're a cat in the group.

425
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,500
You're not worthy of your title.

426
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,100
Your school doesn't have a name.

427
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
I've seen that.

428
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,400
You're pitiful.

429
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,100
You just let him go, right?

430
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,500
No wonder he's like this today.

431
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,700
Teacher Fan,

432
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
I just want to remind you.

433
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,100
You're his classmate.

434
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,200
If he makes any mistakes in the future, you won't be responsible.

435
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,500
For him, whether it's worth it or not, you should think about it.

436
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,700
If you keep following Aik's orders,

437
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,500
even if you're being held responsible, can you still make it?

438
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,200
Let me tell you,

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,900
even if you don't care about him,

440
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
I'll tell him sooner or later.

441
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Qing Ling.

442
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,100
Teacher Fan is calling you to work.

443
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,300
I've already asked the head of the math team.

444
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,100
There are five famous students in the competition this time.

445
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,300
I have to help you to win this competition.

446
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
What can I do?

447
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Who told you to play two games last time?

448
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,100
I thought that if you didn't go to the Olympics,

449
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,100
you would only have to make it.

450
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
If you keep doing this,

451
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,500
who will be the best for you?

452
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,100
Right? You're not the best.

453
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,900
Can you not laugh? Be serious.

454
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,100
I'm talking to you. What's wrong with you?

455
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I know that you've suffered a lot this year.

456
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
I've suffered a lot of grievances.

457
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I can manage some of those. I can't manage some of those.

458
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm still saying that I'm doing this for your own good.

459
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,100
I can't just watch you destroy yourself.

460
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Do you understand what I mean?

461
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,700
If you feel uncomfortable,

462
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
don't be uncomfortable.

463
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,700
If you want to talk to me, I can go to work.

464
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,900
If you don't want to talk to me,

465
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,300
you can talk to a friend who can speak.

466
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,500
You can't do anything.

467
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,300
You're uncomfortable.

468
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
You'll be hurt.

469
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
You're so old.

470
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
You're so young.

471
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
You're so cute.

472
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
I wanted to have a cat when I was young.

473
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
My mom didn't let me have it.

474
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,300
She's really so cute.

475
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Is it good?

476
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
It's good.

477
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
It's good.

478
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
It's good.

479
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Is it good?

480
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
It's good.

481
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,300
By the way, I heard that you're going to have a fall trip.

482
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
You'll go there too.

483
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
No.

484
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Go. It's great to play with everyone.

485
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Professor Jiang and Wang Di will go there.

486
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
I won't.

487
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
It's because you're going to pay. I'll go too.

488
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
I don't want you to pay.

489
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,300
You want to know so clearly about me?

490
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Fine.

491
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
This isn't my place.

492
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
I'll go.

493
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Why can't you go?

494
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,300
What's the point of going there?

495
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Why are you yourself?

496
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Don't you go to the play with Wang Di?

497
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,300
It's good to stay for two days.

498
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
It's not good.

499
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Are you still not good with Wang Di?

500
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I think it's different from before.

501
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
You're talking to Wang Di now.

502
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I think it's the same.

503
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Do you think

504
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,300
people really want to separate?

505
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Wang Di said that.

506
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I've always wanted to say that I don't agree with him.

507
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Maybe people can separate.

508
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
But they can't.

509
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
They can't even recall.

510
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Because people can't control themselves.

511
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Really?

512
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Yes.

513
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Because we're all the same.

514
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
It's noodles.

515
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
What are you looking at?

516
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
My son wrote it.

517
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
I got it.

518
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm back.

519
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Do you need help?

520
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,300
No need.

521
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
I'll take your order.

522
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
I'm so angry.

523
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I'm really angry with my parents.

524
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
What's wrong?

525
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Why are you crying?

526
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I'm happy.

527
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Fine.

528
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Your mom is so angry.

529
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Who said that

530
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
we should learn to be polite

531
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
and be polite.

532
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
You know that.

533
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm not afraid of being rude.

534
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm not afraid of being rude.

535
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
I'm not afraid of being rude.

536
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
You're not being polite.

537
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm not.

538
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
How can I be polite?

539
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
This is my son's

540
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
national award-winning work.

541
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I can do it.

542
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
I'll show it to my sister-in-law.

543
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Right?

544
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
Dad.

545
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
You're in the competition.

546
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
It's not my award.

547
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Hurry up.

548
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
You should win the award.

549
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
You should win the award.

550
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
I'll put it there.

551
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Pull me.

552
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Don't put it there.

553
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
You should put it there.

554
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Yes.

555
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Put it on.

556
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
I'm happy.

557
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I can do it.

558
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
I'm sorry.

559
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
I'll give you the award

561
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
if you need something.

562
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Mom.

563
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
I want to go out with my classmates

564
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
for 300 yuan.

565
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
300?

566
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Okay.

567
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Is that enough?

568
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Yes.

569
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
How much do you want?

570
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
I'll give you.

571
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
If I give you,

572
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I'll give you 500.

573
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Then you can give me 200.

574
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
People's eternal life.

575
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
But

576
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
because

577
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,800
the fight between the soul

578
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,300
with a experiments

579
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
has taken places

580
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,020
которой

581
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,300
in the times past.

582
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
It happens.

583
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
People who ever witnessed like this

584
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
are human

585
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
since the day

586
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
the живites

587
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,800
came to life.

588
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,260
Zhengcla Enc prototypes

589
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,660
Whether that's true...

590
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,060
I can't take all your blaming down on me.

591
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,880
But I still have killing concern.

592
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,600
I didn't want Kuning.

593
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,040
This is what I want.

594
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,400
Do you want to get done this.

595
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
Sorry, I'm a little clumsy.

596
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,560
It's okay.

597
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
We're just sleeping at home.

598
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,720
Fang Di.

599
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,400
I want to tell you something.

600
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,280
What is it?

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,840
Feng Xue Xiao?

602
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,600
Wang Di?

603
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,840
Gao Lei.

604
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,880
Why are you here?

605
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,600
My wife is on the upstairs.

606
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,080
It's dad.

607
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,840
I don't dare to admit it.

608
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,560
Why are you two together?

609
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,320
Are you...

610
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
No, no, no.

611
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,160
My dad is in the hospital.

612
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm here to get a job.

613
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
I thought you two...

614
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,360
Wang Di, you're so nice.

615
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,680
You've been in the school for years.

616
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,800
You never attend the school.

617
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,560
You don't have to ask anyone to call you.

618
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Come on.

619
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,440
Just let me know.

620
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,840
How many years has it been?

621
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,160
Last week, Fang Liu said

622
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,880
he wanted to hold a big gathering.

623
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
I'll tell you when the time comes.

624
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,800
Okay.

625
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm here.

626
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,080
I'll tell you when the time comes.

627
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,400
Call me.

628
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Call me when you get back.

629
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,120
What a coincidence.

630
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,520
What did you just tell me?

631
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,200
Just tell me when you get back.

632
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Your doctor asked me to stay at home for a few more days.

633
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,800
Your dad is in a hurry.

634
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,520
What's wrong with him?

635
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,840
He's so nice.

636
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
He's in a fresh air.

637
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
He's almost going to kill me.

638
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,000
Sit here for a while.

639
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,720
Okay.

640
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,360
Just sit here.

641
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I'll push you.

642
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,160
Help me.

643
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Slowly.

644
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,320
Are you okay?

645
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm a little bit sleepy.

646
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
Jiajia,

647
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
thank you for coming to see me.

648
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,200
It's my pleasure.

649
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,280
I'm glad to have you.

650
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,120
I can't live for long.

651
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,680
I'll be happy.

652
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
You're a good boy.

653
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,720
I can't live for long.

654
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
I just hope

655
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,840
I can leave them alone.

656
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,320
I can get a baby

657
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,040
as long as I can marry Wang Di.

658
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,480
Dad, what are you talking about?

659
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,520
Your dad is...

660
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
Can you talk?

661
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
Did you hear me, Wang Di?

662
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,080
Hurry up.

663
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,320
Uncle is in a hurry.

664
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
What are you doing?

665
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,360
You take Jiajia to the playground.

666
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,080
Go to the ice.

667
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,760
Yes.

668
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,280
I'm fine.

669
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,080
You two go to the ice.

670
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
You see so many people.

671
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,920
Go.

672
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,480
Go.

673
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
I'll sit here with your dad.

674
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,480
Go.

675
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
We'll stay here for a while.

676
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,920
Okay.

677
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,080
We'll go first.

678
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,920
Okay.

679
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,040
Where's your mom?

680
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,640
She's in the U.S.

681
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,960
I was in the second year.

682
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,040
Li Wangsun passed away.

683
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,000
Do you know what I thought

684
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
at that time?

685
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,400
I thought I could finally understand

686
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,040
Huang Shiyu and Qin Yi.

687
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,040
But it's too late.

688
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
I never used to be a good friend.

689
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
I remember you came to my house

690
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
and said something to me.

691
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,120
Uncle Huang said something.

692
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,600
He said

693
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,160
I was the happiest person.

694
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,760
I didn't understand.

695
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Wang Di.

696
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,360
Do you think we are bad people?

697
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Do you think there are

698
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
people who are not selfish in this world?

699
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,600
If there are,

700
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
we are all bad people.

701
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,600
If there are no,

702
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,000
we are just ordinary people.

703
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Really?

704
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
What did you say?

705
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,000
We found the reason for ourselves.

706
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,360
How are they?

707
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,600
As if you just want to cooperate with me.

708
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
It's not fun to play.

709
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
You will regret it.

710
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,760
Why don't you get something

711
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,600
from Phuong Dian?

712
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,800
You should care about him.

713
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Did you say that you're wronged again?

714
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,400
Why should I care about him?

715
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,200
Do I have this kind of obligation?

716
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,400
It's not just him who's wronged.

717
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
What's wrong with you?

718
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
You two are not normal these days.

719
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,400
I am me. He is him.

720
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Let's talk less later.

721
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,800
Is this the one?

722
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,200
No.

723
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Go and get this one.

724
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,000
Go and care about him.

725
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yes.

726
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,000
Is there a car?

727
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
Let's go.

728
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,000
No need. Thank you.

729
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,800
You're still so considerate.

730
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,200
Can we be like before?

731
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,800
You said before.

732
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,800
What did you say?

733
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
Before you met Gao Li?

734
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Before you met Uncle Hong?

735
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
Are you not impressed by me?

736
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
Your bloomingotive?

737
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,400
Impossible.

738
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,560
You can't even see it.

739
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,720
Who are you talking about?

740
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm talking about you.

741
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,440
You're a coward.

742
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,840
The Chief Chen scared you.

743
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,160
So you're relieved.

744
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,120
Qilin.

745
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
I owe you.

746
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,760
Do you think the whole world owes you?

747
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,160
You're the one who's in the wrong.

748
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,320
You're the one who's in trouble.

749
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,960
The thing that happened to your family

750
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,640
is not someone who's lying on your head.

751
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,440
It's not like no one's going to force your father to kill him.

752
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
You think it's unfair.

753
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,520
You can't just leave.

754
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,600
You had a chance to take the exam.

755
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,280
You didn't hold back.

756
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,440
You can't blame others.

757
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,560
You can't blame me either.

758
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,360
You'll be angry at me.

759
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,400
Why do I have to endure you every time?

760
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,360
Because no one can bear you.

761
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,560
No.

762
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,200
You have Uncle Huang.

763
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
If you have Uncle Huang, you don't need others.

764
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,000
You don't need me either.

765
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,320
Fine. It's good.

766
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
Now I'm completely relieved.

767
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,840
Do you know how much pressure I put on you as a friend?

768
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,240
You think I'm willing to do it?

769
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,080
Qilin.

770
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,480
You're so selfish.

771
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,080
You'll have to apologize to him.

772
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,680
It's okay.

773
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,640
I promise.

774
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,440
You really have better know how I feel about you.

775
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,320
Everyone is exposed to the mist.

776
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
So you think too much?

777
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes.

778
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,520
Posted...

779
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Take it out.

780
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
What?

781
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Take it out. I'll take a look.

782
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Take out the wallet.

783
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Take out the wallet.

784
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Take it out.

785
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Is it this?

786
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Is it this?

787
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
This is the one.

788
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
This is the one.

789
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Are you satisfied with this?

790
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Are you satisfied?

791
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
It's late, Wang Di.

792
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
It's late!

793
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
You lost your pride.

794
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
You're a despicable man.

795
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
You're always despicable.

796
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
You're going to die for me!

797
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
I'm sorry.

798
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm sorry.

799
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
I'm sorry.

800
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Wang Di!

801
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Where's Qin Li?

802
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I don't know.

803
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I heard that no one wants to be with him.

804
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
It's your fault.

805
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
What did you say?

806
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
It's none of your business.

807
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Come here.

808
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
What's this?

809
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Take a look.

810
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
No, Teacher Fan is a dog.

811
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
I'll just take this and look.

812
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Okay?

813
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
You owe me a lot.

814
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
This is my house.

815
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
This is good.

816
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
It's none of your business.

817
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Okay.

818
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Don't talk about money.

819
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Okay, okay, okay.

820
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
What are you doing?

821
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Let him look at it.

822
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I don't have anything to eat.

823
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Let's go.

824
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
I don't understand.

825
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Are you afraid that you won't be able to eat?

826
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I don't know if you have any complaints.

827
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
I know.

828
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Do you want to hear the truth?

829
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Nonsense.

830
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
My mom is on business with everyone.

831
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Just because of this?

832
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
No way.

833
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
My mom asked me

834
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
to ask her dad for a business.

835
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I don't know.

836
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
I don't know.

837
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I don't know.

838
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
I don't know.

839
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I don't know.

840
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
I have to ask her dad for a business.

841
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
We often eat together.

842
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Brother Rong,

843
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
do you want to scold me?

844
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I'm not scolding you.

845
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
I just remembered

846
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
that my mom told me a story.

847
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
What story?

848
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
People can't be poor.

849
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
People

850
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
can't be poor.

851
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
You're talking about me?

852
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
You're talking about yourself?

853
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Boss,

854
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm coming to the wedding.

855
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Okay.

856
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Okay.

857
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Is it good?

858
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
It's okay.

859
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
My father said

860
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
that we should eat less.

861
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Then you should eat less.

862
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm not eating.

863
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
I'm not eating.

864
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
You want to order?

865
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
I'll eat with you.

866
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
It's not interesting

867
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
to use this time.

868
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
It's not fun at all.

869
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
I won't come here in the morning.

870
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Is it because of

871
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Boss Gao that he's playing with me?

872
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Maybe.

873
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
He won't come again.

874
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Your wonton.

875
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Thank you.

876
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Try it.

877
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Is it good?

878
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
It's good.

879
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Sir,

880
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
what's wrong with Wang Di lately?

881
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
You should ask Wang Di later.

882
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
You let me ask him.

883
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
He let me ask you.

884
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
You two are the same.

885
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
What's wrong with you?

886
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
I can't say it.

887
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
You're not good at it.

888
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
You think you can't read

889
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
the words

890
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
on the paper?

891
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
I've read them.

892
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Do you know

893
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
which one is the most similar to Wang Di?

894
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
The heart is different.

895
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
The mouth is different.

896
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
The heart is different.

897
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
It's not uncomfortable to write it yourself.

898
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Eat something and don't talk.

899
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
It's good.

900
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Sir,

901
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
do you think

902
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
you can be a good friend

903
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
without Wang Di?

904
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
It's not meaningful.

905
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
By the way,

906
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
in two months,

907
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
it's your birthday.

908
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
You're 18 years old.

909
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
You should live well.

910
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
It's nonsense.

911
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
You have to live with me.

912
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
You can't live alone.

913
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
You have to come.

914
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I'll go wherever I want.

915
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I'll eat whatever I want.

916
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
You have to buy the bill.

917
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Do you hear me?

918
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Okay.

919
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
You can't finish it.

920
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I'll reward you two.

921
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Stop playing.

922
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Get some rest.

923
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Okay, I'll sleep right away.

924
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
What time is it?

925
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
I'm also...

926
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Close the door.

927
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Go to bed early.

928
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Okay, sir.

929
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Okay.

930
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Who's there?

931
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Who's there?

932
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Open the door.

933
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
What's wrong, Mr. Chen?

934
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
I don't know who's running away.

935
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
This...

936
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
He's...

937
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
He's too unreasonable.

938
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Who is he?

939
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Who is he?

940
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Mr. Chen,

941
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
why don't you take a rest?

942
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
I'll handle this.

943
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I'll see who it is.

944
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
You're back.

945
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
You ran quite fast.

946
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Whose is this yellow sticker?

947
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
It's not mine.

948
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
It wasn't you who ran from the window just now.

949
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
It's not me.

950
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I said it's okay.

951
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
It's just your mouth, right?

952
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
Come in.

953
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
You're all back.

954
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Why are you two here again?

955
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,600
You really don't have any surprises or surprises.

956
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
You two live in this room, right?

957
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
The one who ran from the window just now

958
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
wasn't you.

959
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
It was him.

960
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm sure it's him.

961
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Tell me.

962
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Who?

963
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Say something.

964
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
You two are still in the same room.

965
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
What's the matter?

966
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Do you have any evidence?

967
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Isn't this evidence?

968
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Get out. I'm going to sleep.

969
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Qin Li,

970
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
how can you talk to me?

971
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I told you to get out.

972
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Say it again.

973
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Qin Li.

974
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Qin Li, you can't do this to Mr. Chen.

975
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
You can't do this to me.

976
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
No.

977
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Qin Li.

978
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Qin Li.

979
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Go to sleep.

980
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Go to sleep, Qin Li.

981
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
You have to go back to school.

982
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
I'll talk to you properly.

983
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
You're so annoying.

984
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
You can't go to sleep.

985
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Have a rest.

986
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
You're annoying.

987
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
No.

988
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Wait.

989
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Let them think about it.

990
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Let them think about it.

991
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Yes.

992
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Mr. Chen.

993
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Hello.

994
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Okay.

995
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Okay.

996
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Don't worry.

997
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Okay.

998
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Wang Di.

999
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Your dad called.

1000
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
He said you'll go to the hospital

1001
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
after you arrive.

1002
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
What happened to my mom?

1003
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
No, it's your mom.

1004
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
She said she was hit by a car.

1005
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Don't worry.

1006
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Don't worry.

1007
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
She'll be fine.

1008
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
What's wrong?

1009
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Wang Di.

1010
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
What's wrong with your mom?

1011
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Does it hurt?

1012
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
It's okay.

1013
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
It doesn't hurt.

1014
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
It doesn't hurt.

1015
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
My mom hit him on the road

1016
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
in the morning.

1017
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
She was lucky.

1018
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
She didn't have a big accident.

1019
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
She was a little stubborn.

1020
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
The doctor said she should be fine.

1021
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Where's my mom?

1022
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
She ran away.

1023
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
She didn't have a bright day.

1024
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
She didn't see the car.

1025
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
What's so funny?

1026
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
What's so funny?

1027
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
What's this?

1028
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
What are you doing?

1029
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
You're sleeping.

1030
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
When did my mom lie down?

1031
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
The doctor said

1032
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
she had to lie down for half a month

1033
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
before she could be cured.

1034
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
She had to be cured after she was cured.

1035
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
It's okay, son.

1036
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Look at you.

1037
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Why are you so anxious?

1038
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
I just...

1039
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I just wanted to be a part of the family.

1040
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
I was making money.

1041
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Mom,

1042
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
don't worry about money.

1043
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I won a prize

1044
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
for the competition.

1045
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
I gave you a prize money.

1046
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
You gave me a gift in the house.

1047
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
If you have the news,

1048
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I'll be satisfied.

1049
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
This is the first gift you made.

1050
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
I'll keep it for you.

1051
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
I'll give it to you.

1052
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
You should study hard.

1053
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Don't be upset.

1054
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,600
It'll be delicious.

1055
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,600
You know?

1056
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Go back now.

1057
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,600
You're going to school tomorrow.

1058
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
I'll go to school tomorrow.

1059
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
I'll stay here with you.

1060
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Hello?

1061
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm Wang Di.

1062
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Wait a minute.

1063
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Tell me.

1064
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I'll call your boss.

1065
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Tell him the truth.

1066
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Mom, I'm begging you.

1067
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
You can't call him.

1068
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
My parents know

1069
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
I'm going to be beaten to death.

1070
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
And the school

1071
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
has to give me a hard time.

1072
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Maybe you'll be fired.

1073
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
What do you mean?

1074
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,600
You want me

1075
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
to be fired from the front line, right?

1076
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
That's not what I mean.

1077
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
As long as you don't admit it,

1078
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
there's only one result.

1079
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
I can't be beaten for you.

1080
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Don't say nonsense.

1081
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Wang Di, don't worry.

1082
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
How about this?

1083
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Give me a few days.

1084
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Let me think about it.

1085
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
I'll think of a good one.

1086
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm begging you, Wang Di.

1087
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
I'll give you two days.

1088
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
I'll call my boss

1089
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
when I have time.

1090
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
I'm begging you.

1091
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I'll call my boss.

1092
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
I'll be fired from the front line, right?

1093
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I'll call my boss.

1094
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600

00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
it's OK. Come in.

1147
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,420
Hetoo

1148
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,140
You guys are not hot water again.

1149
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,700
I haven't washed my hair for two days.

1150
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,780
It's dirty.

1151
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,020
But you should wash your hair.

1152
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,900
Let me do it.

1153
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,700
I'll help you.

1154
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,500
Okay.

1155
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,540
Can I use the water temperature?

1156
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,380
Yes.

1157
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,220
The water temperature is right.

1158
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,020
By the way,

1159
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,100
how are you guys playing in the autumn?

1160
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,140
Are you happy?

1161
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,420
I shouldn't go.

1162
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,740
It's not a big deal.

1163
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,700
It's boring.

1164
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,460
I regret it anyway.

1165
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,220
Okay.

1166
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,140
Thank you.

1167
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,940
Hello, Xiao Xiao.

1168
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,540
I'm still in the dorm. What are you doing?

1169
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,140
I'm fine.

1170
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,940
I'm staying here.

1171
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,020
I called Wang Di and Qing Li.

1172
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,660
They haven't been home since morning.

1173
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:24,940
What's wrong?

1174
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,820
Are you with Qing Li?

1175
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,260
I need to talk to her.

1176
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,660
I saw Qing Li.

1177
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,540
I'll call her.

1178
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,220
Call her.

1179
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:38,940
Hello?

1180
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,980
Qing Li, did you see Wang Di?

1181
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:42,780
No.

1182
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,860
I'm begging you.

1183
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,220
What's wrong?

1184
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,660
I'm the one who's been on the line.

1185
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,180
But I'm really in a bad mood today.

1186
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,500
I can't stand up.

1187
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,340
I didn't call Wang Di and Qing Li.

1188
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,380
I don't know if you can help me.

1189
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,740
I'll go with you.

1190
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,660
Qing Li, you're so nice.

1191
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,700
Thank you.

1192
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,140
We'll have fun together in a few days.

1193
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,420
I'll treat you to a meal.

1194
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,060
Okay.

1195
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,140
I'll hang up now.

1196
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,940
Bye.

1197
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,740
Bye.

1198
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,180
Bye, Uncle Huang.

1199
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:15,940

1200
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,700

00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,140
Alright.

1202
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,460
I am off with a clean week at the dorm.

1203
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,860
Guess it's a tough job for you.

1204
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,100
Qing Li.

1205
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,860
Yell to the living room.

1206
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,300
Sure.

1207
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,020
Sure.

1208
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,580
Baozi, take the way.

1209
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,260
Okay.

00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,180

Bai歡迎 a matchmaker's wife at Top 3 MIE.

1214
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,500
Did the teacher tell you that?

1215
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:25,940
No.

1216
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,380
Wait a minute.

1217
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,060
Let me show you what row he's worth.

1218
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,420
You go up to the main building first.

1219
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,780
Then, you should go to the rock tower.

1220
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,380
At last, you go to the chariot.

1221
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,940
Then sign here.

1222
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,620
Okay.

Had a short trip to N qia şen and got back in love with her.

1227
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,720
I watched all of those worlds of sea lights and Par ruthes and aren't nice combination.

1228
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,020
It was a fifteen year old gang of stairs to The world

1229
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,020
it was like I was,

1230
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,060
to find out about the story

1231
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,060
I'm afraid the Gibro

1232
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,040

1233
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
