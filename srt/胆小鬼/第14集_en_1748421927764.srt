Episode 1

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Give me a sentence.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sell a box of cigarettes again.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sell a few cigarettes.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Feng Yuxiu.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who's talking nonsense?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Who said you're talking nonsense?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You're the one who said it.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't say it was me.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's me.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's the same.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're a good speaker.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I won't show it to you.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll show it to Huang Shun.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll show it to you.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Do you want to see it?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll show it to you.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it good?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is it good?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll show it to you.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
She's my father.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You want to be my father?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're blind.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't you have a husband?

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She's my father.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She's my husband.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why are you so disgusting?

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Qinglin, look carefully.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You said you're my father.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I said it.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Your house is like this.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're a circle.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Super-like, understand?

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why don't you show it to me?

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll show it to you.

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have to change it today.

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't want to cut it.

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're drawing better than the top today.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's the use?

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can find it.

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I said it's our house.

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll use it when I'm back.

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Where are you going?

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can still be a tattoo.

48
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Where's the tattoo?

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is the tattoo so troublesome?

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not a question.

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's hard to understand.

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Aren't those foreign women tattooing?

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There's a little tattoo here.

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's a tattoo on the foot.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you two doing?

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm looking for it.

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm looking for it.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm looking for it.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Episode 1

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Jin Li.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Jin Li.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm Feng Xuejiao.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Jin Li.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can't you hear me?

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Jin Li.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Jin Li.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Jin Li.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Jin Li.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Jin Li.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Jin Li.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Jin Li.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's me, Feng Xuejiao.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm here to see you.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll be back.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We're going to meet at the hotel.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then we'll meet at the back of the building.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is it good?

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm here to see you.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm here to see you.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm here to see you.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm here to see you.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Jin Li.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm here to see you.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Jin Li.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Jin Li.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Jin Li.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Jin Li.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Jin Li.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Jin Li.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Jingling.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Jingling, look at me.

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Jingling, look at me. I beg you.

95
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
What happened to your hand?

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Jingling, what happened to your hand?

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,200
Jingling, do you still remember this?

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm not here to give Jingzhuang a life.

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Can you help me become a uncle?

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Do I want to ask you for help?

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,200
You still remember the case of the ten years ago?

102
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
If you have anything to say, you can tell me.

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
If I can prove that your brother was wronged,

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I will bear all the responsibilities.

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Jingling, look at him.

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
How could you not remember us?

107
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
This is our family meeting.

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Jingling, what is he like?

109
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Why is he so good at speaking?

110
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Jingling, don't be like this.

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Jingling, don't be like this.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Jingling, I beg you.

113
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Jingling.

114
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Jingling, I'm sorry.

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
I should have been hurt at the beginning.

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I was so hurt.

119
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
My father said that it was none of your business.

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
You believe me?

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
It must have nothing to do with the death of my father.

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Jingling's favorite is Uncle Huang.

123
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Jingling, he doesn't want to say it.

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
He has no other choice.

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
You kids are so old.

126
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
You are so old.

127
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
You are so old.

128
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Besides the big deal in the past,

129
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
you...

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,200
and your mother shouldn't lie to me.

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,200
What happened after Jingling's death?

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Remember,

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Jingling's business has nothing to do with you.

134
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm alive.

135
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
It's because this kid is not good.

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
It has nothing to do with you.

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
You can't admit it.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
It's your fault.

139
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I know.

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
If he had their family to rely on,

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
he would have been so unlucky.

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm not unlucky.

143
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
But who said that he had a family to rely on?

144
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
You know the best about his family's murder.

145
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Mom.

146
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Did you see his girlfriend?

147
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
How did he do?

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
He didn't let me see her.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I wanted to send him the money

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
and ask him to sign it.

151
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
But he didn't agree.

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I think

153
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
he wanted to ask more.

154
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
But he didn't say it directly.

155
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It's okay.

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
No matter what they want,

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
you don't have to worry about it.

158
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
You have your mother.

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
But you have to guarantee me that

160
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
this matter will end here.

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Don't worry.

162
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Don't go to the police.

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't go to the police.

164
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Don't care about it.

165
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Don't go to the police.

166
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Can you promise me?

167
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
My baby.

168
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay.

169
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Your father can't know about this.

170
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
He can't know about it.

171
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
He's still in the belly.

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Understand?

173
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
You're here.

174
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm here.

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Go back to the car.

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm here.

177
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm here.

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Okay.

179
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm here.

180
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Hi, Mom.

181
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm here.

182
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
What's wrong?

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm here.

184
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm here.

185
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I'm here.

186
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,400
Boom

187
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,580
Sorry dignity

188
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,960
Let's go

189
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Dad, I can't think of anything for ten years.

190
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Help me.

191
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Give me a hand.

192
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Dad, I can't think of anything for ten years.

193
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Dad, I can't think of anything for ten years.

194
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Help me.

195
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Give me a hand.

196
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Dad, I can't think of anything for ten years.

197
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Dad, I can't think of anything for ten years.

198
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Dad, if you had listened to me earlier,

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
you would have understood it.

200
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
I should have listened to you earlier.

201
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
It's been ten years since I died.

202
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Why did you take another one?

203
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I didn't know he did it alone.

204
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Who else would it be?

205
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Zhang Xi died.

206
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
There was Qin Li and Yin Peng.

207
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
They didn't have time to make money back then.

208
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
They didn't have time to make money back then.

209
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Brother, do you believe I will follow the car?

210
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I don't believe it.

211
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Have you seen the surveillance camera of the收費 station?

212
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
I have never seen it.

213
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
If there is still a gang member,

214
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
then the gang member will be in the bus stop that night.

215
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I have also investigated Yin Peng.

216
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
He was in the bus stop that night.

217
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
He didn't go to the outside.

218
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
He was the one who followed the car.

219
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
He would make mistakes.

220
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
He couldn't even control himself.

221
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
You saw it yourself?

222
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Yes.

223
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,960
It means Qin Tian and Qin Li.

224
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Qin Tian and Qin Li are together.

225
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
There was a suspect who was alive.

226
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
There was Qin Li and Yin Peng.

227
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
It's possible that one of them

228
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
killed the murderer.

229
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Boss, two wontons.

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
As for why they were in charge of the scene,

231
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
that's another problem.

232
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Do you remember?

233
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
In the small hole in the house,

234
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
the DNA found in the house

235
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
was not match with Qin Tian's.

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
I have asked Qi.

237
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
He said that

238
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Yin Peng had never appeared in Shen Dong's society

239
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,960
in the last year.

240
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Maybe he left Shen Dong long ago.

241
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Why is the time so short?

242
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Boss, you let me travel.

243
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
What should I buy?

244
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
What should I buy next time?

245
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
This is your second wonton.

246
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Yes.

247
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Thank you.

248
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Enjoy.

249
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
The night Xiao Deng was in the car,

250
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,960
that person was either in the car or Qin Tian's car.

251
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Then this person must have

252
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
been in the car in the car.

253
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
The problem is here.

254
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Didn't Cao Mao check the surveillance?

255
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
You mean Cao Mao?

256
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Yes.

257
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
I dare not say now.

258
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
But I have to make it clear

259
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
how Yin Peng escaped.

260
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
You used to be the manager of the hotel in Peng Xiang.

261
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes.

262
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
How many years have you been with Yin Peng?

263
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
About five or six years.

264
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Why didn't you do it?

265
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Yin Peng sold the company in 2001.

266
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I rented it out and bought it myself.

267
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
He is a big company.

268
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
He said he wouldn't do it.

269
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
I heard he owed some money.

270
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
He said he was short.

271
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I am a big company.

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I don't know anything else.

273
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,960
You haven't contacted Yin Peng since 2001?

274
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
No.

275
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Do you think we have investigated

276
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
your company?

277
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
We can't tell the truth now.

278
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Otherwise,

279
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
we will lose our good fruit.

280
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Do you understand?

281
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
After 2001,

282
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
I have never met Yin Peng.

283
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
But

284
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
I have a contact.

285
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
How?

286
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Through this company,

287
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I made a contract with Shenzhen's financial company.

288
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
They transferred money to the US

289
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
through Hong Kong.

290
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
What is the company called?

291
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
It's called Qili Financial.

292
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
It's called Qifar.

293
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
It's a good company.

294
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
It's a good company.

295
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Who is the legal person?

296
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Yan Li.

297
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Yan Peng's brother.

298
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,960
What is the name of the driver you met before?

299
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
It's called Jinhu.

300
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Yes, Jinhu.

301
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
The foreign name is Guai.

302
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Qili Financial.

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
He was the owner of Shenzhen in 1998.

304
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
The owner of the company went to Shenzhen a dozen years ago.

305
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
There is nothing illegal in the company business.

306
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
It's just a meeting.

307
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
But he has no employees.

308
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
He is involved in the murder case.

309
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
This person's name is Zhang Qiang.

310
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
He was in the nightclub in September of this year.

311
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
He was killed by someone.

312
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
He was still a worker.

313
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
His name is Zhang Xu.

314
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
This Zhang Qiang

315
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
is likely to be used as a fake name

316
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
after Jinhu ran away.

317
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
We have a big circle around us.

318
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
What should we do now?

319
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
There is only one way.

320
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Qili.

321
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Wang Lin.

322
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Can I trust you?

323
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Yes, Captain Feng.

324
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Captain Feng.

325
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
What can we do?

326
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
What can we do?

327
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I want to do something.

328
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
It's very likely that you will make a mistake.

329
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Dare?

330
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I dare not.

331
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Jin.

332
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Come back.

333
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Come here. Sit down.

334
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
I have something to do.

335
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
My order has arrived.

336
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
My order is here.

337
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Here.

338
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Ready?

339
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Yang Yuan is not worth spent.

340
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Yang Yuan is not so bad.

341
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
He spends so many years spending money.

342
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
After I send the MP out,

343
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
he will take the time to zuide.

344
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm here to get a job.

345
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,520
Someone used to give me a birthday wish.

346
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
I didn't take it.

347
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,960
You know

348
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the person who gave me the wish.

349
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,960
Who?

350
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Lin Peng.

351
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,440
Really?

352
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,280
When did you see him?

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,840
I didn't expect

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,560
you would be the one.

355
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,120
It's been ten years.

356
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,640
Can you sleep well?

357
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,760
Guo Jian.

358
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,920
What do you mean?

359
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,600
Ten years ago,

360
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
you were the one who found out the missing person.

361
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Guo Jian.

362
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,600
I know

363
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,200
Xiaodong can't let you go.

364
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,920
I understand.

365
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
I go to Jun arrows,

366
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,480
but it's the same for me.

367
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,640
Only time has passed.

368
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,480
What do you mean?

369
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,560
I encourage you.

370
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,280
Guo Jian.

371
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
If you can suggest...

372
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
I will give you

373
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,920
two options.

374
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,160
First.

375
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I'll take the road out.

376
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
I'll take you as a co-worker.

377
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
When it's over,

378
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I'll explain to the leader

379
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
and try to deal with it again.

380
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Second,

381
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
if you don't take it,

382
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
I can still break the case.

383
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Xiao Deng's death

384
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
is a life for you.

385
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I won't let you in.

386
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I won't let you down.

387
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
You choose.

388
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
I have something to say.

390
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I'll talk when I get back.

391
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
You can't go anywhere today.

392
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I told them to watch you for 24 hours

393
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
until you're willing to take it.

394
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Feng Wojie,

395
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
do you know how much you'll regret?

396
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Don't you think of Xiao Deng?

397
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Don't call.

398
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Hello.

399
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Hello.

400
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
That must be...

401
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Who's here?

402
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Wang Di.

403
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
He's here.

404
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Don't look at me like that.

405
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Wang Di.

406
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Uncle, how old are you?

407
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
I'm only going back to my hometown.

408
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Come here.

409
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Come here.

410
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Thank you.

411
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
By the way,

412
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
I heard that you're at

413
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
a magazine in Beijing.

414
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Do you work at the editor's office?

415
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Xiao Po.

416
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
He's an cultural director.

417
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
A cultural director?

418
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Right?

419
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
I remember

420
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
he wrote a good thing

421
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
when he was in school.

422
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
What did he get?

423
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
He got a prize.

424
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Right.

425
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
I was so jealous.

426
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
I got more than 20 points.

427
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I would have joined the magazine in the past.

428
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
You're the best.

429
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
You're the best.

430
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm the best.

431
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
My mom's classmate.

432
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
She's a good student.

433
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
I just said

434
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
that this is a rumor.

435
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
The third and fourth.

436
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,160
How much money can you earn in a year?

437
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Come to my company.

438
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
We're old classmates.

439
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
We can't save you money.

440
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Come here.

441
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Come here.

442
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Come here.

443
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Wang Di, come here.

444
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Let's go.

445
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Remember this.

446
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
How many years have passed?

447
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
It's a small matter.

448
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Your brain is going crazy.

449
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Look at my hand.

450
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Isn't it also crazy?

451
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Why are you so serious?

452
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Everyone is so young.

453
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
They don't know anything.

454
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Wang Di doesn't know

455
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
the people who are careful.

456
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Come here.

457
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Come here.

458
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
I just heard

459
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,160
that you're in the magazine.

460
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
I just heard Gao Lei say that.

461
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
He's quite famous.

462
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
I have an idea.

463
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,160
You also interviewed me.

464
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
What's the newspaper

465
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
for our young family?

466
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
It's not embarrassing, right?

467
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
What's the newspaper?

468
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
I quit.

469
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Don't talk.

470
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on.

471
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Let's move to the topic.

472
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I...

473
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Come here.

474
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Come here.

475
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Come here.

476
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Come here.

477
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Come here.

478
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Come here.

479
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Come here.

480
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Come here.

481
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Where's Wang Wei-jiao?

482
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Why didn't he come?

483
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
He's right.

484
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
He's the one who saved

485
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
his favorite food

486
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
when he was in school.

487
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
He's the one who saved his favorite food.

488
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I suddenly want to ask a question.

489
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Who?

490
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Guess who.

491
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Who?

492
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Who?

493
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Who's the one who sold the food?

494
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Qin Li.

495
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,160
What is he doing now?

496
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Wang Di.

497
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Isn't your school

498
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
the best for him?

499
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
What's he doing?

500
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Come on, Da Zhi.

501
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
This person is

502
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
a character.

503
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
He's too lonely.

504
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
And his song.

505
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
You all don't know, right?

506
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Kill the royal uncle first.

507
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Really?

508
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Kill him first?

509
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
That's great.

510
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
He's too cow.

511
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
That's right.

512
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
The royal uncle.

513
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
What a pity.

514
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
You said the royal uncle

515
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
was so beautiful.

516
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
When he was in school,

517
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
he was like a chef.

518
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
At that time,

519
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I really wanted to be with the royal uncle.

520
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
What are you doing?

521
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
What are you doing?

522
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
What are you doing?

523
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
What are you doing?

524
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
What are you doing?

525
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
What are you doing?

526
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
What are you doing?

527
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Be careful.

528
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
What are you doing?

529
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
What are you doing?

530
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
You're so smart.

531
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
You deserve it.

532
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Wang Di.

533
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I know that you're so smart.

534
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
I know that you're so smart.

535
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
But you don't know

536
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
what's going on in his family.

537
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
They're so social.

538
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
How can you let them come?

539
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I'll find him tomorrow.

540
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
It's a matter of time.

541
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Wang Di.

542
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Wang Di.

543
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Let's go.

544
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
We're going out.

545
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Come on.

546
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Ying Peng called me that day.

547
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I was on the way to the provincial office.

548
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
He ran away when he met the enemy.

549
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
He even opened a special office.

550
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
He said that if he was stopped by a place,

551
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
he would be forced to help him.

552
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I thought he'd agreed to it.

553
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I really didn't know that he was chasing him.

554
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I was dreaming about something.

555
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I just wanted to get Lu Xing back.

556
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Did you take Ying Peng

557
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
in Lu Xiang's car?

558
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
No.

559
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I only took his driver's license.

560
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
I also took his car today.

561
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Where's Lu Xing?

562
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
No.

563
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I don't believe it.

564
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Do you think he's good to me?

565
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Why?

566
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Why?

567
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Can you tell me?

568
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
My mom was seriously ill.

569
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Her hospitalization was wrong.

570
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Only a protein pill could help.

571
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
It was a sign of her death.

572
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
We couldn't buy it.

573
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
We just bought it.

574
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
We couldn't even buy the child.

575
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
How much did he spend on you?

576
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
He also took my mom away.

577
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
He's been gone for four months.

578
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Did Ying Peng go back to Shendong?

579
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
I really don't know.

580
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
He's gone back to his private life.

581
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
The old monster who called you just now.

582
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Why did he come back?

583
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
He was going to continue his journey.

584
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
He needed money.

585
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
He wanted to get a medical treatment.

586
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Call him now.

587
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Ask him to meet you.

588
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Gao Jian,

589
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
can you understand?

590
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Why?

591
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Why?

592
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Do you want to wait for me?

593
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Hello?

594
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
You want to talk to me?

595
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Go ahead.

596
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I don't have time for six o'clock.

597
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I'll be there in a minute.

598
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Two hours.

599
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Can you stay for a minute?

600
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Okay.

601
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Six o'clock tomorrow morning.

602
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
The center of the South Station.

603
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Liu Ping,

604
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
please make some arrangements.

605
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
You lead the team.

606
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
I have other things to do.

607
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Don't worry.

608
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Do you want to take a photo with someone?

609
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
I'll do it myself.

610
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
You two take care of him.

611
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Don't let him get out of this room

612
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
before six o'clock tomorrow morning.

613
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Understood?

614
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Gao Jian.

615
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I don't want to hear you talk anymore.

616
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
You're right.

617
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
I'm just a general.

618
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Hello, Mr. Fang?

619
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
You have something urgent to do?

620
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
It must have been a hard night.

621
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
It must have been a hard night.

622
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
How do you usually eat?

623
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
You cook by yourself.

624
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Of course, the adults are not here.

625
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Who taught you?

626
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
But you're not young.

627
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
You're almost 30.

628
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
You're almost 30.

629
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
You're so lazy.

630
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Other than the state,

631
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
you're forced to cook by yourself.

632
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
But the first day is still long.

633
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
You can go home and have a taste.

634
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
If you're willing to forgive him,

635
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
do you think the daughter of a praying master

636
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
could be of any help soon?

637
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Yes.

638
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,160
All the enemies have dance means.

639
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,120
But everything is confused by the effort to win this war

640
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,160
when people take advantage of Xia emple.

641
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
When you fight and lose,

642
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
why do you have to give up all this till your Dark- ego disappears?

643
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Damn.

644
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,360
Why?

645
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,960
Let me tell you why.

646
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,960
Because your brother is not a bad person today.

647
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,160
He will never do that to uncle Huang.

648
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,160
You know that.

649
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,560
You hate me not because your brother died in my hands,

650
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,760
but because I caught the wrong person.

651
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,560
If you are willing to tell me about this,

652
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,760
I will definitely try to help you.

653
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,560
But if you really want to do something stupid,

654
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I will definitely fulfill my duty.

655
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,360
Qingli,

656
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,760
if I don't want to see you,

657
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,960
I will also leave like your brother,

658
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,560
and end up with your father.

659
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,360
I will definitely do it.

660
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,160
What are you doing?

661
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,160
You have been resting for a week.

662
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
Are you resting?

663
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,160
Resting.

664
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,560
Qingli,

665
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,160
not yet.

666
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
If you want to come to me,

667
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,760
I will wait for you.

668
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
Go.

669
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
Say something.

670
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,560
Say something.

671
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,760
I will.

672
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,360
Don't.

673
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,160
Go.

674
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,760
Go.

675
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,560
Zhang Xiaofeng.

676
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,160
He died two years ago.

677
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
Why?

678
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,360
When I found out about Ruxiang, I was late.

679
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,760
Mr. Luo, I need to ask you something.

680
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,960
At the end of January 2001,

681
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,360
there was a 18-year-old child in a church.

682
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,760
He was poisoned by food and was living in your yard for a few days.

683
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,760
Look, it's him.

684
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,360
You can still remember him.

685
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,560
It has an impact.

686
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,560
His brother was the one who killed people.

687
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,560
This child lived here for a few days.

688
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,560
Right.

689
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,160
Or the one that Zhang Daifu gave him.

690
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,960
When did he come here?

691
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,760
On the 10th.

692
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,560
Can you find the record?

693
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
It's been ten years.

694
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,560
You are in the hospital.

695
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,360
You can't find it.

696
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Then,

697
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,560
you saw him?

698
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,560
You said so?

699
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
I saw him.

700
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,560
That day, when Zhang Daifu was sick,

701
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,760
he stood there far away.

702
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,160
He stood there far away.

703
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,160
I didn't see him wrong.

704
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,360
It must be him.

705
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,160
Is there anyone in Zhang Daifu's house?

706
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,560
I don't know.

707
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,760
He got divorced when he was young.

708
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,160
He didn't have a child.

709
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,160
It's not easy.

710
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,560
Zhang Xinhua Feng and this child,

711
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,160
do you have anything to do with it?

712
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,960
It's a life-saving grace.

713
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,560
What else?

714
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,160
You are so funny.

715
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Is this your house?

716
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
Of course.

717
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,560
I broke the record last night.

718
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,960
I can't send you to the hotel anymore.

719
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,160
Where is your dad?

720
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,760
He didn't come back for a while.

721
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
He said your little boy was scared.

722
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,560
I cooked porridge for you.

723
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,760
Go get your clothes.

724
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
I'll take it with me.

725
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,920
This is for Wang Meiqing.

726
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,760
We even saved these files.

727
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,960
He has a KendongPu.

728
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,960
This is his brother's family model.

729
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I didn't forget.

730
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,800
We were on the market.

731
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,960
I remember

732
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,200
this is the only contract

733
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,520
we have.

734
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,120
We have one contract.

735
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,640
Are you still here?

736
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,640
I'm not here.

737
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,320
What are you thinking about?

738
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,440
You're here.

739
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,840
You want to tell me

740
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,880
what you want to say?

741
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,600
You broke up last night.

742
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,120
I didn't have time to tell you.

743
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,560
What did you say?

744
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,320
My dad

745
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,800
suspected Uncle Huang

746
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,320
of murdering him.

747
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,840
I'm here.

748
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,040
I'm here.

749
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,240
I'm here.

750
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,280
I'm here.

751
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,480
I'm here.

752
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
I'm here.

753
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
I'm here.

754
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,480
I'm here.

755
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm here.

756
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
I'm here.

757
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
I'm here.

You know, my parents and you, we are different.

I was just a fool.

804

Cui Ling, say something.

823
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,440
Cui Ling, what are you doing?

824
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Don't...

825
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,440
What are you doing, Cui Ling?

826

You owe me.

827
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,440
If I didn't fight for you,

828
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
I wouldn't have been in danger for them.

829
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
I am a human being.

830
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
I can't protect you forever.

831
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,440
Cui Ling, look carefully.

832
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
Look at where I wrote it.

833
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
I will change it.

834
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
Okay?

835
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,440
Cui Ling, what are you doing?

836
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
What are you doing?

837
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
Don't do this.

838
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Cui Ling, don't do this.

839
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Don't do this.
