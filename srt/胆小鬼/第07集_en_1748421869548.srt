00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,460
Episode 19

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,880
あ mesh

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Why are you here?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll give you a scarf.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It looks pretty.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a bit like a neck-pick.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You don't need to wear a big one.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I would've used a thinner scarf.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You made this yourself.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm good.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've made it for half a month.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You'll feel warm this time.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I specially checked the new book.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The blue is the blue of the double-colour.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you want to test it again today,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll bring you a good one.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's go.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's still early.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll stay for a while.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll stay with Mr. Xiaoxin for a while.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's start.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll push you.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,400
港岸

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:21,300
our

28
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,500
exam ends stop the beating

29
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,340
Get archers

30
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,400
Get archers

31
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,860
These guys eavesdropping

32
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,540
Time is suspended

33
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,880
students

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,840
I said, time's up.

35
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,040
Stop the fight.

36
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,040
Let go.

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,040
If you don't stop,

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,960
cancel your qualification exam.

39
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Happy Yuanyang

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,740
Commander

41
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,700
citoyen

42
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,700
Be careful

43
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
I'll go.

44
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,080
Old Fan, where's the seat?

45
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Here.

46
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
Here, put it here.

47
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
You said this is a holiday.

48
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,680
It's like a small island missing a movie.

49
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
It's not easy to write this.

50
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
What's this?

51
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,280
What's the article again?

52
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm reading half of it.

53
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Let me see it first.

54
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm his Chinese teacher.

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Look at this kid.

56
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
He doesn't copy the article every day.

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Writing the article is really interesting.

58
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,680
We both teach Yuwen.

59
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,880
You still don't understand?

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,680
There's no teaching in this article.

61
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,880
It's all about the day.

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
Life is a village.

63
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,680
It's a good thing to write this name.

64
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,680
Only the bitter and hard-working are the same person.

65
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,480
Who can't be compared to the one who's good at writing?

66
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
It's really good.

67
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Speaking of which, I like that couple.

68
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
There's another one.

69
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,880
By the way, did he get a promotion for the contest?

70
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Don't mention him.

71
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
He's my stomach ache.

72
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
What's wrong?

73
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
I don't know what's wrong.

74
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
He suddenly got a headache that day.

75
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,080
He was just on the exam.

76
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,680
What's wrong with the paper?

77
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
He's just writing two choices.

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,480
What a poor kid.

79
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
Poor kid?

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Did he waste the only one?

81
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't know.

82
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
How can I explain this to the school?

83
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
That's right.

84
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
I don't remember this time.

85
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
It's not as good as me.

86
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,480
What's wrong?

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
You scared me.

88
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
What's wrong?

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
The car is ready.

90
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
You're so clumsy.

91
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Get out of the car.

92
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm so clumsy.

93
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,480
I'll give you the math class.

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm Dong.

95
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,480
We'll talk about it later.

96
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,080
Who's the representative of the math class?

97
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
What's your name?

98
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Qin Li.

99
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,280
You're Qin Li?

100
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,480
Did you close your homework?

101
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
No.

102
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,080
The class is closed.

103
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
No one wrote it.

104
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,280
You can go out now.

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
Be more active.

106
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
Don't make me drag you.

107
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I didn't write it.

108
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Li You?

109
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,280
No.

110
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Qin Li?

111
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
You're a good student.

112
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,680
You're talented in math.

113
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,280
I didn't care about you

114
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,480
when I was in the class.

115
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,280
You're not good at math.

116
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Who are you talking about?

117
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Qin Li.

118
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Do you think you're good?

119
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,680
You're good.

120
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,680
You wrote two choices in the contest.

121
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
You wasted the opportunity of the school's reputation

122
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,680
and others.

123
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
You're so shameless.

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Go to the door.

125
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Go to class.

126
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Qin Li.

127
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Good morning, teacher.

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Please sit.

129
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
After class three,

130
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,880
I'll review all the content of the contest.

131
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,880
Go to class.

132
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,480
Good morning, teacher.

133
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,480
You can't use it.

134
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Why are you hiding from the teacher?

135
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
What?

136
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,280
I think something happened.

137
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Where are you going?

138
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
What's wrong with you?

139
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm not a student.

140
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Today, I'm going to

141
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
get beaten.

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,280
Wow.

143
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,480
The ticket for the bill.

144
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,480
It's still signed.

145
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Is it real?

146
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
My dad didn't give me a ride.

147
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
It should be real.

148
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
You have to pay hundreds of dollars for this.

149
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Cheers.

150
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,480
If you like it, take it.

151
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
I don't like the bill anyway.

152
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
As long as you don't tell me,

153
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
I'll just get the bill.

154
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,280
The bill is not the opponent of the bill.

155
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
It's too late.

156
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,880
How about it?

157
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Drink it.

158
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
I don't drink.

159
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,280
I always drink with you.

160
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,480
You're being polite with me.

162
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,880
Fang Di.

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Please help me.

164
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,280
What?

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,280
Give me this.

166
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
What's this?

167
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,680
A letter.

168
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Don't let anyone see it.

169
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Can't you see anyone?

170
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
No.

171
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,680
I just said,

172
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,280
why are you so annoying?

173
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,680
I've found the song this time.

174
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Look at you.

175
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
But I'm not annoying.

176
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,880
You're a good friend.

177
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,080
We grew up together.

178
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,280
We're still classmates.

179
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,480
You're a bad guy.

180
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
How do I feel I'm being betrayed?

181
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,080
Not at all.

182
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080
Just help my brother.

183
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Go back to my house and play games.

184
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
You are minority anyway.

185
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Except you!

186
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
Seven!

187
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
The therefore such movement nowadays.

188
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
Sanshu79

189
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Thank you.

190
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,580
Come in.

191
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,480
To what place?

192
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,380
There is a restaurant on the other side of the road.

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,480
Your private account no longer皮avul수,

194
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,480
someone will disturb you from now on.

195
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,600
The place is really nice.

197
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,320
Hello, who is it?

198
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,000
Hello, it's me.

199
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,280
Don't listen to me.

200
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,920
You think you're a double-decker?

201
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
Can the whole people hear it?

202
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,920
Tomorrow is Saturday.

203
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,240
We'll have fun in the four places.

204
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
No, I have something to do.

205
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,760
What is it?

206
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you have anything?

207
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,120
Let me ask you.

208
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,240
Did you play the game

209
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
in Uncle Huang's table today?

210
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,080
No.

211
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,560
You're lying.

212
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
I saw it.

213
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
It's not mine.

214
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,160
It's not yours.

215
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,080
It's a love letter.

216
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,040
Do you have anything?

217
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll hang up.

218
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,000
Take it seriously.

219
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,400
No.

220
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I can't think of it.

221
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,760
Think about it.

222
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
I'm a little patient.

223
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,480
I can't think of it no matter what.

224
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,000
Xiaoxing, take a break.

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
No.

226
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
I can't follow you.

227
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,880
You can't...

228
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Your phone.

229
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,800
I can't follow you.

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I can't follow you.

231
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,280
Hello?

232
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,480
It's me.

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
Jiajiao, what's wrong?

234
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,040
What are you calling?

235
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,080
I'm at home.

236
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,280
Are you really at home?

237
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,400
Yes.

238
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
What's wrong?

239
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm bored at home.

240
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,440
Let's go out for fun tomorrow.

241
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
Forget it.

242
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,360
Wang Di said she has something to do tomorrow.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,160
What is it?

244
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,560
It's nothing.

245
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,320
Bye.

246
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,000
Bye.

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,560
Bye.

248
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,480
Bye.

249
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
Are you lying?

250
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,880
I can't tell him

251
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm with you.

252
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,800
Why not?

253
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,360
It's not good anyway.

254
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,240
He dumped her on purpose.

255
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
Xiaoxing is unhappy.

256
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
Didn't you tell others

257
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,240
at first?

258
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,680
Did you tell Wang Di?

259
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,400
No.

260
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
Then you lied to me first.

261
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,520
He didn't ask me.

262
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,840
It's not a lie.

263
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,320
You can change your mind.

264
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,680
Fine, don't be angry.

265
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,160
You teach me to be a body.

266
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,320
No.

267
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,480
I can't teach you.

268
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,280
Idiot.

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
What did you say?

270
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,520
Idiot.

271
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,320
Say it again.

272
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,800
Idiot.

273
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,440
Idiot.

274
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,960
Idiot.

275
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,640
Idiot.

276
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,280
Say it again.

277
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,760
Idiot.

278
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,240
Idiot.

279
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,560
Idiot.

280
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:33,920
Idiot.

281
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,760
You bullied me, didn't you?

282
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,200
Idiot.

283
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,760
Xiaoxing.

284
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,320
Idiot.

285
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Idiot.

286
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,840
Idiot.

287
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,640
Son.

288
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,080
Son.

289
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,720
Let me tell you.

290
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,320
What are you hiding?

291
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,840
You just read the book.

292
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,240
No.

293
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,840
I read the book.

294
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
Just read it.

295
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
You are so blind.

296
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
You should read the book.

297
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,920
Mom, look at this.

298
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Look.

299
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,600
Look at this.

300
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
What is this?

301
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,760
The famous

302
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,840
math professor in the country,

303
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
Dr. Wu,

304
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,200
is coming to our office to do a lecture.

305
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Look at the book.

306
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,960
Especially for the poor students,

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,800
who are filial.

308
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,000
After two days,

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,280
after two days,

310
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,120
when you play the violin,

311
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
you will be so mad.

312
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,320
From the outside, you will be so mad.

313
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,840
You are so mad.

314
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,600
You are so stupid.

315
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,040
What are you talking about?

316
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,720
You are so stupid.

317
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,960
You are so stupid.

318
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,800
Really.

319
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,000
What is this newspaper?

320
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,640
Is it Ding Ding's bag?

321
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,080
It is also a newspaper.

322
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,160
Do you know?

323
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,600
The newspaper won't lie to people.

324
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,720
Look at this.

325
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,400
Dad is so stupid.

326
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,040
Last year, the advertisement was so bad.

327
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,320
He was so angry that he got caught.

328
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,840
You...

329
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,640
You...

330
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,840
Are you just doing this to me?

331
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,120
Playing the piano?

332
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm telling you,

333
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm telling you,

334
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,600
I'm telling you the newspaper.

335
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,480
The money is also paid.

336
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,560
How much is it?

337
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,280
400 yuan.

338
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,760
What?

339
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,360
400 yuan.

340
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,240
Why don't you feel bad at this time?

341
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,240
You are so stupid.

342
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
When did mom feel bad?

343
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,320
I...

344
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,120
Mom,

345
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,480
we are in the same school.

346
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
Can we go and retire?

347
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,680
We are retired.

348
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,720
You said it.

349
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,920
I won't go.

350
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,960
You...

351
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,280
You...

352
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
I'm telling you, Wang Di.

353
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,920
If you dare not go with me,

354
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,880
I'll give you all the money.

355
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,120
Brother.

356
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm here to find the manager.

357
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,040
He's not here.

358
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
Do you know where he went?

359
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know.

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,080
Anything else?

361
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,840
Nothing.

362
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,700
disso

363
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,800
Brother.

364
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,480
Guilou'skke.

365
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
It's fine for you to be here

366
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,880
but we even have the picture.

367
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,200
Okay, okay.

368
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
We came to know about it.

369
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,280
At the jeepney bridge on the 28th night,

370
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,000
detrimental accidents took place in a few cars

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
and a car stopped when they were next to us.

372
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,080
And it ran away when the car stopped.

373
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,200
It was a foresight.

374
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,800
I asked residents about that.

375
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,920
The last time I heard about this is long ago.

376
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,880
They said.

377
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
it's the owner breached the building.

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,120
Plus this duct door

379
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,360
This big door in the back door

380
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,920
is where the two of us went to the hospital.

381
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,960
Hey, ask you.

382
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,760
If you want to leave the body in the hospital,

383
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,680
where will you go?

384
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,120
It must be from this hole.

385
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,360
The door is blocked.

386
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
People are looking for it.

387
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,480
This is a dead corner.

388
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
It's usually very hot.

389
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,520
Where is the car?

390
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
It's right here.

391
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,640
Then?

392
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,400
Then, drive down the body from the car.

393
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,480
Then, pull it in from the hole.

394
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,520
It's high enough for a iron stick.

395
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes, just that sandstone.

396
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,920
Why do you use a stick?

397
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,320
What do you say?

398
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,160
Because you can't pull it.

399
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,360
A dead person can't reach 100kg.

400
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
How can a sandstone be so big?

401
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,920
What if it's not as big as your imagination?

402
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,360
Or it's him.

403
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,120
He's an old man.

404
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,720
Or a younger kid.

405
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,400
Why does he need to take the clothes of the dead body

406
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,720
and throw the stick together?

407
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,120
The blood pressure is not good.

408
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,920
It's the same thing as the stick.

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
Who's who?

410
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,760
You're an old man.

411
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,400
Are you from Jiangjia?

412
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,120
Director?

413
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
What?

414
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
I think...

415
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,600
we can't see either.

416
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,680
The restaurant is opposite.

417
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,920
If we don't ed.

418
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,800
We will lose the strategy.

419
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Then...

420
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,000
It's going too far.

421
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,360
Someone is yoga finally.

422
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
It's Lin Shiqi.

423
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
After the car was installed on the 28th night,

424
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
the car was taken over by the construction site.

425
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
And we also checked the new road of the front door.

426
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
We had to find the right road.

427
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Right. Where's the communication record?

428
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
I just checked it.

429
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
The last call was from the last one.

430
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
It was a public call from IZK.

431
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Then there was a call from Ye Hao.

432
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
He called him and said he didn't know the phone number.

433
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Now he's already on the phone.

434
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Wang Haitao confirmed that the clothes were from Uncle Huang.

435
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Right. I wanted to see you.

436
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Uncle Huang went back to school that noon.

437
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
He met someone with me.

438
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Who?

439
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,360
The boss of Yinpeng, Jia Ju Cheng.

440
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
What's the relationship between you two?

441
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Why did he find Uncle Huang?

442
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,360
I met him once with Yinpeng.

443
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
I knew him as Si Ji.

444
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
His nickname is Lao Guai.

445
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I took two cars with him at the freight station.

446
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Sometimes Lao Guai sent me a message.

447
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,360
That day, I called him on the phone that noon.

448
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
He was drunk.

449
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
He asked me to go with him.

450
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I met Yinpeng.

451
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I just arrived.

452
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Uncle Huang called to pay for his life.

453
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
He was very close.

454
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
I asked him to come to me.

455
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Uncle Huang didn't make it in two minutes.

456
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
I took 500 yuan from him.

457
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
He left.

458
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Then Yinpeng left first.

459
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
When I was with Lao Guai,

460
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
he called me.

461
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Why did he call you?

462
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,360
He said Yinpeng was missing a secretary.

463
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
He wanted to see you.

464
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
You want to see him?

465
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Uncle Huang graduated from the university.

466
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
He couldn't get into college.

467
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
He didn't know where to find him.

468
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
So I gave him a call.

469
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,360
You don't want to see him or you don't want to tell him?

470
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,360
He went to a dance school in the big day.

471
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
He came out for a dance for four years.

472
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Yinpeng has a big business.

473
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,360
He is a good secretary.

474
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
He is my uncle.

475
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I can't help him.

476
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
Why didn't you tell me before?

477
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,360
I was confused when you came.

478
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,360
I saw some clothes.

479
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
I was just a girl.

480
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Guai Tao,

481
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
what have you done these years?

482
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Don't know anything.

483
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
If you really care about uncle Huang,

484
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,360
you won't even leave a single room for him.

485
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Hurry.

486
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Unluckily,

487
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
your uncle is here.

488
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Come on, come out.

489
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Yang Xiao won't get used to it.

490
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Do you know Wang Haitao?

491
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
It's very familiar.

492
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Who?

493
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Wang Laize.

494
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
He's a famous man.

495
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Have you visited him for dinner?

496
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Wang Laize?

497
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
He doesn't know anything but Wang Haitao.

498
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah.

499
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
I know him.

500
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
What's his name?

501
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,400
What day did you hear it?

502
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
Well, I can't remember.

503
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,800
Anyway, just a little bit ahead.

504
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,320
You know that he's usually busy.

505
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,880
Think about it again.

506
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,840
Is there a week left?

507
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,960
I don't know.

508
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Almost a week.

509
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
Except for Wang Haitao that day,

510
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
did you see him?

511
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,080
Yes.

512
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,960
He's like a leader of the tax office.

513
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
Let me remind you.

514
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,040
He's a foreigner.

515
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,320
Yes, he's a little bit more influential.

516
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,120
He's also...

517
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,320
He's a little yellow, right?

518
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,800
Yes.

519
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,360
He's looking for Wang Laizi.

520
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,920
Take it.

521
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,520
Look, don't look at me.

522
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm a driver.

523
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,320
I drive.

524
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,680
I'm just a model.

525
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,160
Did you find Wang Haitao that day?

526
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,160
You called Uncle Huang.

527
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,320
What did I ask him?

528
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,200
Why?

529
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,120
It was just a meal.

530
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,200
That day,

531
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,840
Wang Laizi told me

532
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,800
that his niece is a graduate.

533
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,640
She's unemployed.

534
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
I think that girl

535
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,840
is a good girl.

536
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,680
She might be good at doing art.

537
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,120
Plus, I don't drink.

538
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,600
I just drink when I go to the hall.

539
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,360
Did you call Uncle Huang later?

540
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,600
I just did.

541
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,200
Then, who was in charge of that?

542
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,120
From 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on June 28th.

543
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,920
Where's he?

544
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,360
On the 7th.

545
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,160
On the 28th.

546
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,120
28th?

547
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,040
What time is it?

548
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,960
Can you remember?

549
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,640
We went to Guangzhou in the afternoon.

550
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
We didn't have time to pick up the vegetables the next day.

551
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,680
Then, we had dinner with the leader.

552
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,320
Yes.

553
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,040
How do you remember it?

554
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,480
I took the money to the finance department this morning.

555
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,920
I went to the school with Ying.

556
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,080
Just in Guangzhou?

557
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,640
The next day, the newspaper was all lit.

558
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,880
I went to the theater with the leader.

559
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
You can take a look.

560
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Brother, Ä¾ of famous spiritual people

561
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480
gathers people at the TAO Festival.

562
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,920
I discovered more than 10 other Famine Martial Arts.

563
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,040
I think the process behind all these places

564
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
was for her to go to my father here.

565
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,120
I don't know if I hold it right?

566
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,480
Look.

567
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,680
To La la la,

568
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,480
you need to focus on fordiou alone.

569
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,920
PIang Ping I still haven't noticed any worr administration issue.

570
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,280
Anyway.

571
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,040
Sister Feng has accepted,

572
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,080
so I'll go try it on myself.

573
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,180
Fine

574
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,580
We'll pick another member of their room and then I'll pick her up.

575
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,280
Alright

576
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,600
I'll leave immediately

577
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,800
to talk to Feng

578
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,120
Director Feng

579
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,880
I hear that the band is →

580
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,460
prés mem

581
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,920
with Wang Lei

582
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,620
scolded them

583
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,840
about some nice stranger

584
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,660
Huang Chu is dead

585
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I was looking at their reaction.

586
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,520
I think they really don't know about my experience.

587
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,840
If they really don't know,

588
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,040
they will suspect it.

589
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,000
Right.

590
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
You know why I was afraid of snakes.

591
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,040
Why?

592
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,600
I was in the war.

593
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
I fell on the tree

594
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,400
and fell on my chest.

595
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,760
I bit my tongue and I was bitten.

596
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,880
I was poisonous.

597
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
I almost lost my arm.

598
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,240
Really?

599
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,160
I was afraid of snakes since I was a kid.

600
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,080
But I was afraid of snakes.

601
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,240
Let me think about it.

602
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,720
Now, the suspect can't be easily found out.

603
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
Yin Pang?

604
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,560
He's from Jiaju City?

605
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,280
Yes.

606
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,640
He fought with me once.

607
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,520
Changshun.

608
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
He was in Guangzhou last year.

609
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,840
He came back from business.

610
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,160
He came to Shenzhou.

611
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,920
He came to my place to take a bath.

612
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,960
He drank too much.

613
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,880
He beat up a lady.

614
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
She beat up a neighbor.

615
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
I was in Shenzhou.

616
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,040
Later, the chief wanted to kill him.

617
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,120
So he stopped him.

618
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
He was sober the next day.

619
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
He called me to apologize.

620
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
He paid the lady some money.

621
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,880
He asked her to collect the money.

622
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,160
I was drunk.

623
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,000
I let him go.

624
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,720
I got him.

625
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,720
Sit.

626
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,560
What's going on?

627
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,160
There are too many people.

628
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,280
The lady is unhappy.

629
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
What's the matter with your lady?

630
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,320
Brother.

631
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,320
Who's crazy here?

632
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,480
I went to find her.

633
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,240
She's all green now.

634
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,160
How can I bring you in?

635
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,360
Really?

636
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,160
Why lie to you?

637
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
You can't believe what you're doing now.

638
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,280
I'm not that good.

639
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,640
Sit.

640
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,040
Slow down, brother.

641
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,560
No.

642
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,240
He's a big guy.

643
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,520
He's a good guy.

644
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,440
Brother.

645
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,800
Who?

646
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,800
What are you talking about?

647
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
I was the chief of the army.

648
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,200
It's a good job.

649
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,200
You've done good job.

650
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,560
You're so good.

651
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,840
How many of you of you

652
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,880
checked the private contract?

653
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,360
Okay.

654
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,800
Who Two subsidy funds

655
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
are used as a pledge to be injured?

656
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,680
Miss

657
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,800
Why?

658
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm not letting you go.

659
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,560
You see.

660
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Let's go to the school!

661
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Let's go to the school!

662
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Let's keep going!

663
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Let's keep going!

664
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Brother, can we cancel the ticket?

665
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
No.

666
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,560
I only got half the ticket. Can you cancel half of it?

667
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
What a nice lesson!

668
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
You can leave.

669
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
I can't cancel the ticket.

670
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
I wrote it clearly.

671
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Okay, okay.

672
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
I'll leave it to you.

673
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Okay.

674
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Okay.

675
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Okay.

676
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Okay.

677
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Okay.

678
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Okay.

679
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Okay.

680
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Okay.

681
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Okay.

682
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Okay.

683
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Okay.

684
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Okay.

685
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Hello?

686
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Where did you go last time?

687
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
I went out.

688
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
You'll be here soon.

689
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
I'll wait for you outside.

690
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
What's the matter?

691
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Don't ask.

692
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
I'll tell you later.

693
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Okay.

694
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Are you all willing to go?

695
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Yes!

696
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I'll do my best!

697
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,560
I'll do my best!

698
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Let the eyes become the camera!

699
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Let the eyes become the camera!

700
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,560
You only got the secret of the number.

701
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
What's the matter?

702
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
The number is one.

703
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Your eyes are no longer your eyes.

704
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
What's the matter?

705
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
The camera!

706
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,560
So, we've solved the problem of the two days.

707
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,560
What's the number?

708
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
The number is one.

709
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
It's not a lie.

710
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
I just checked it.

711
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Later, they'll ask the police to come to the stage.

712
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
They'll find out that you're all soil.

713
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
We'll go up later.

714
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Then, we'll pay the money back.

715
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,560
You'll be different from the world's observation.

716
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
What do you think of?

717
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I've thought of a way.

718
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Why should I ask you to come?

719
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
For example,

720
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
when you walk up the road,

721
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
you'll see flowers.

722
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
They're not flowers.

723
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
They're the training of numbers.

724
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
The grass you see is also a training of numbers

725
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,560
that can be found in the forest.

726
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
The two days ago, the forest was washed.

727
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
This is the most important thing.

728
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
You're a soldier.

729
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Listen to me.

730
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
This is the basic training.

731
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
You're a little bit stubborn.

732
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Next,

733
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,560
I'll ask my friends to come up.

734
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Write down the numbers of the 20 members.

735
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,560
I'll look at them for five seconds.

736
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
If I get one wrong number,

737
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,560
I'll give them 10 people's tuition.

738
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Okay?

739
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Which one of you is willing to come up?

740
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Yes.

741
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,560
You.

742
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Fatty.

743
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Okay.

744
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Hurry up.

745
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Okay.

746
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Let's go next time.

747
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Let's go.

748
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
You five,

749
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,560
write down the numbers on your notebook.

750
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Then put it on the headboard.

751
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Let everyone see.

752
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Okay. Thank you.

753
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
It's still the old rule.

754
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I'll start the training later.

755
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Then,

756
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
everyone,

757
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
write down the numbers for me.

758
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I'll look at them for five seconds.

759
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Five.

760
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Four.

761
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Five.

762
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Five.

763
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Two.

764
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
I'll kill them.

765
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Okay.

766
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Professor Wu,

767
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
we want to compare them with you.

768
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Let's change the rule.

769
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
What does it mean?

770
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
There are five numbers on each notebook.

771
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Each one has a number.

772
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
We'll write down the numbers.

773
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
For fairness,

774
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
we'll write down this one.

775
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
What are you doing?

776
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Li Li.

777
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
What do you mean?

778
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Don't do it.

779
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Why are you making trouble?

780
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
What are you doing?

781
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Professor Wu, please allow me.

782
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Thank you.

783
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Let's start.

784
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:32,560
693056346001

785
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
I'll write down the numbers.

786
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Okay.

787
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Okay.

788
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Okay.

789
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Okay.

790
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Okay.

791
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
Okay.

792
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Okay.

793
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Okay.

794
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Okay.

795
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Okay.

796
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Okay.

797
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
Okay.

798
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Okay.

799
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Okay.

800
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Okay.

801
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Okay.

802
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Okay.

803
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Okay.

804
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Okay.

805
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Okay.

806
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Okay.

807
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Okay.

808
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Okay.

809
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Okay.

810
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Okay.

811
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Now,

812
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
go.

813
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Okay.

814
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Okay.

815
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
Okay.

816
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Okay.

817
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
I'm the winner

818
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Go

819
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
They are all liars

820
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
You are all liars

821
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
I'm the winner

822
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:52,560
I'm sorry

823
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm sorry

824
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I'm sorry

825
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
I'm sorry

826
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
I'm sorry

827
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm sorry

828
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
You know

829
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
how much this affects

830
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
our institution

831
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
and Professor Wu

832
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Yes

833
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I'm also sorry

834
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
for Professor Wu

835
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Professor Wu

836
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
You are all liars

837
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
You are liars

838
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm sorry

839
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm sorry

840
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I'm sorry

841
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm sorry

842
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
to Professor Wu

843
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Mom, they are liars

844
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Don't be sorry

845
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Shut up

846
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
You are not over yet, right?

847
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
You are being rude

848
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
What are you talking about?

849
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
You shouldn't let them

850
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
hurt us

851
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
I, I

852
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
They are liars

853
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Don't apologize

854
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
You know what to do

855
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
OK

856
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
I have something to say

857
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Don't hit the kid

858
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Aunt

859
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Hit me

860
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
I'm the one who made the decision

861
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Manager

862
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
You even don't understand

863
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
You are also a fan of him

864
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
You cry, cry for me.

865
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
How can you promise me?

866
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
How can you promise me?

867
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,560
You said you would study hard and work hard.

868
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
You told me to spend a good life with your dad.

869
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Did you say that?

870
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
You are so stubborn, right?

871
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
You let mom down so much.

872
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
You are so ungrateful.

873
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,560
It's not easy to get married to your dad.

874
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Big sister, we are still in a good situation.

875
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
We are still in a good situation.

876
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
If there is a problem, we will definitely solve it.

877
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Don't worry about it.

878
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,560
Thank you, Big sister.

879
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,560
I'm sorry for the trouble you guys caused.

880
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Eat more.

881
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
What are you eating?

882
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Do you have a job?

883
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
What are you doing? You are still eating.

884
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Get up.

885
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Who are you throwing at?

886
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Who are you throwing at?

887
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Who are you throwing at?

888
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I tell you, from today on,

889
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
you can't go to your family.

890
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
You are not going anywhere.

891
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
You are not going to the city.

892
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
You are in a bad mood.

893
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
What are you doing?

894
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
You are so stubborn.

895
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I tell you, don't take it from me.

896
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
From today on,

897
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
you can't get a job.

898
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Don't play with it.

899
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
You are so stubborn.

900
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
It's a bit too much.

901
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,560
You can't let the child break the chain.

902
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
What do you mean?

903
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
What?

904
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
You break the chain yourself.

905
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Have time to take care of the child.

906
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
What's wrong with you?

907
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Which gold is wrong?

908
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
You are a piece of cake.

909
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
You are a little bit stubborn.

910
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,560
You are making me tired.

911
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Mr. Feng,

912
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
look at this.

913
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Hello?

914
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Hello, is it Uncle Fang?

915
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Yes.

916
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I am the one

917
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
who is a schoolmate of Uncle Fang.

918
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
What's the matter?

919
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Is Qin Mo's boyfriend coming again?

920
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
No, I am not.

921
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
What's the matter?

922
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
Your boyfriend is here?

923
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
What's the matter?

924
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Aren't you chasing after him?

925
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I don't follow him.

926
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Are you a kid?

927
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
You are so stubborn.

928
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
I didn't take care of the boy.

929
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
I didn't take care of the boy.

930
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
You are so stubborn.

931
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
I'm not talking about you.

932
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
I like Big Head.

933
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
You...

934
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Come with me.

935
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Grab him.

936
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Come here.

937
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
Come on.

938
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

939
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

940
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

941
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

942
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

943
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

944
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

945
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

946
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

947
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

948
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

949
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

950
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

951
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

952
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
It doesn't matter.

953
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
It doesn't matter.

954
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
It doesn't matter.

955
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,560
The feeling of being in love with coffee.

956
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,560
The music of the sky and the handphone.

957
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,560
The music is very cheerful.

958
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
You are very special.

959
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Every little detail.

960
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Such a contrast.

961
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

962
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

963
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

964
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,560
I'm afraid I'll be able to get away from this.

965
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,560
I'm very opposed to falling in love with tears.

966
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
I'm more willing to be with you.

967
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I like to see you quietly,

968
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
calling me a little turtle.

969
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Your expression is too much.

970
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
The love between friends.

971
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
The lonely taste.

972
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
The sweet color.

973
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,560
The unique and unique.

974
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
I like to see you quietly,

975
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
calling me a little turtle.

976
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,560
My mood is like a lover.

977
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,560
The strange intuition.

978
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
The wrong positioning.

979
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm a little worried about you.

980
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
I like to see you quietly,

981
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
calling me a little turtle.

982
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
Your expression is too much.

983
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,560
The love between friends.

984
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
The lonely taste.

985
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,560
The sweet color.

986
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
The unique and unique.

987
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,560
I like to see you quietly,

988
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
calling me a little turtle.

989
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,560
My mood is like a lover.

990
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,560
The strange intuition.

991
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
The wrong positioning.

992
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm a little worried about you.
