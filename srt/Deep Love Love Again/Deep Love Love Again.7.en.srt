(Sink Together)

3
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,083
I didn't even know

4
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,458
that you could play the piano.

5
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,291
I must have learned the piano
when I was young.

6
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,625
But I don't remember much.

7
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,041
It's just a reflex.

8
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:11,625
Why?

9
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,000
Well,

10
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,416
something happened.

11
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,291
So,

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,791
I don't remember it well.

13
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,375
You're awake?

14
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,625
My dear brother-in-law.

15
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,416
Why is it you?

16
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,000
Manqing did it all for my family.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,416
You know it all?

18
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,958
You set me up
in the whole Xixing Project thing.

19
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,333
Why?

20
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,750
When Qingqing had a car accident,

21
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,083
what did you do?

22
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,333
Do you think I don't know?

23
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,708
And Liu Yanyan.

24
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,666
I won't let her off.

25
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,333
My dear brother-in-law.

26
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,666
Starting from today,

27
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,291
you'll be a living dead person

28
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,375
surviving on liquid nutrition

29
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,000
and wearing the catheter

30
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:39,875
all the time.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,250
If you feel bored,

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,291
I can find you something fun.

33
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,875
Do you know there are many people

34
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,666
with peculiar hobbies in this world?

35
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,458
Quite many.

36
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,125
Qiyan.

37
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,833
I have something to tell you.

38
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,291
What?

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:08,916
I...

40
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,708
To us. We got rid of Ji Anyang together.

41
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,625
Mr. Pei.

42
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,166
To thank you, it's my treat.

43
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,666
Well, in that case,

44
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,416
I'm the one who should thank you.

45
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,008
(Marital Property
Distribution Agreement)

46
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,500
Ji Anyang was too eager
for quick success.

47
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,416
If he knew I was Gu Qingqing,

48
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,583
what would his look be?

49
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,250
It depends on how you feel about it.

50
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,583
Of course, I feel great.

51
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,708
Gu Qingqing, the love-struck fool,
lost everything.

52
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,333
But Manqing wins it all back for her.

53
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,166
Hello.

54
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,750
Get her a cup of hot milk.

55
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,750
You got drunk.

56
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,208
When I was vulnerable and helpless,

57
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
you forcefully took control of my life.

58
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,708
You told me you had to control me.

59
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,541
But as I finally got used to it,

60
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,916
you asked me to stop

61
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,750
and say the safe word.

62
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,500
Pei Jinqing, what do you really want?

63
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,291
Waiter.

64
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,541
Get me a suite here.

65
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,666
Is this the only way you'll obey?

66
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,833
Do you know
why I don't want hot milk today?

67
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,666
I want to spend a night with you.

68
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,416
Perhaps when your wish is fulfilled,

69
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,083
I might consider rewarding you once.

70
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,916
I have to finish my revenge
as soon as possible.

71
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,333
We agreed no kissing.

72
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,208
Hello, Manqing.

73
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,250
I am Gu Qiyan of Gu Group.

74
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,083
Mr. Gu.

75
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,500
Hello, I know you.

76
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,333
Where to?

77
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,250
I'll drop you off.

78
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,875
I was looking for an opportunity

79
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,291
to get to know you.

80
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,083
Did you come to see me for Mr. Ji?

81
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,333
As I said,

82
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,416
I just want to meet you.

83
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,666
It's not about anyone else.

84
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,166
Is that so?

85
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,166
What do you want to know?

86
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,833
You seem to have many secrets.

87
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,458
You're elusive.

88
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,500
Everyone has secrets.

89
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,291
Don't you have any secrets?

90
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,458
Mr. Gu, I've arrived.

91
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,416
Pull over.

92
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,500
Mr. Gu.

93
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,708
Give me today's meeting minutes.

94
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,500
One more thing.

95
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,791
Ji Anyang doesn't live
in Gu Qingqing's house,

96
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,666
so take it back and clean it up.

97
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,500
You may leave.

98
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,333
I see, Mr. Gu.

99
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:19,833
Why are you here?

100
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,708
After taking over Mercury, I...

101
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,583
You don't have to

102
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,750
tell me about it.

103
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,083
It's a job you assigned to me.

104
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,541
I must report to you.

105
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:35,541
Oh, right.

106
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,375
Why is Manqing

107
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,375
shown on your computer screen?

108
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,375
Do you know her?

109
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,083
Don't ask questions that you shouldn't.

110
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,458
Don't be curious about things
you shouldn't know.

111
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,083
I...

112
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:57,833
Alright.

113
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,250
You may leave.

114
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,541
You went to see Gu Qiyan?

115
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,125
He came to see me.

116
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,458
Come here.

117
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,625
Do you know why I punish you?

118
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
That's because you
violated our contract.

119
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,875
I won't allow you to use your beauty
to deal with Gu Qiyan.

120
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,541
Pei Jinqing, you care about me.
You are jealous.

121
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,375
You've become better

122
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,708
at seducing men now.

123
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,750
You also wanna be one of them?

124
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,250
I've roped you into this.

125
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,333
So I need to be punished?

126
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,041
So Gu Qiyan is your next target?

127
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,250
You're so smart.

128
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,041
Why not take a guess?
