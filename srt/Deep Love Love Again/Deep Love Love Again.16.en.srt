00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:21,458
Mr. Gu,

2
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,416
why are you here?

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,666
Come in.

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,291
It's okay.

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,333
I'm here to take you shopping.

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:28,458
Right now?

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,166
Yes.

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:31,958
Okay.

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:32,625
Well...

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,416
Just a moment.

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,666
Okay, I'll wait.

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:52,916
I'm exhausted.

13
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:54,541
How's it?

14
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:55,916
Anything you like?

15
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,708
Pack all that she tried on.

16
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,541
If you had a few more girlfriends,

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,041
you could empty this store.

18
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,041
You are the only one.

19
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:15,094
=Deep Love Love Again=

20
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,064
=Episode 16=
I've prepared a necklace for you.

21
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,125
(Contradiction)
See if you like it.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,083
Let me.

23
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,250
Does it look good?

24
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:57,916
Yes.

25
00:01:58,875 --> 00:01:59,833
Then take this one.

26
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,083
This strap is too old.

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,083
I'll find you a new one.

28
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,416
I'll dine with Mom.

29
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:18,541
Join us.

30
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:19,875
Sure.

31
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:20,875
Then

32
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:21,541
see you.

33
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,083
Mrs. Gu,

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,958
it's her.

35
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,708
She killed Qingqing.

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,916
She also wants to kill me.

37
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,333
Do you know what you're saying?

38
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,708
Of course I do.

39
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,375
Manqing is a murderer.

40
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,583
The day Qingqing got killed,

41
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,166
Ji Anyang and I were at the scene.

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,166
Now she's trying to kill me too.

43
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:04,958
Take a look.

44
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,041
She did this to me.

45
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,166
Miss Liu, where is your evidence?

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,166
I haven't held you accountable
for kidnapping me the other day.

47
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,708
But you have come to me today.

48
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,500
Mrs. Gu,

49
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,875
please stand up for me.

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Call the police.

51
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,708
Okay.

52
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,041
Call them.

53
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:28,958
No way.

54
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:29,791
Don't do it.

55
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,666
I'm here today.

56
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,500
No one can do that.

57
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:36,791
Manqing,

58
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,041
it's tough for me.

59
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,916
Let's put everything

60
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,541
on Pei Jinqing's plate today.

61
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,708
Get through it first.

62
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,541
Why should I?

63
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,125
Gu Qiyan!

64
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,833
Could you stay away from her?

65
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,458
Mom,

66
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,125
give me three days.

67
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,791
I will investigate the matter.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,791
As for Manqing,

69
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,666
I'll keep an eye on her.

70
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,541
She won't run off.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,083
Haven't you found out yet?

72
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,500
Two surveillance cameras

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,708
are at different regions.

74
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,666
We're trying to establish a connection.

75
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:43,583
Mom,

76
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,958
how can you fall for Liu Yanyan's words?

77
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,750
What if Manqing is innocent?

78
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,875
I don't care about Liu Yanyan
or Gu Qingqing at all.

79
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,916
You're my son.

80
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,916
If you insist on marrying that wench,

81
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,083
she must disappear from this world.

82
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,083
Have you ever thought

83
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,458
that Pei Jinqing would seek revenge?

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,875
Do you think you can
keep her locked up for life?

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,264
If you want to marry her,

86
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
then I can lock her up for a lifetime.

87
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,333
Hello?

88
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:10,958
Mr. Pei,

89
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,375
the other one is connected.

90
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,708
Send it again.

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
If Pei Jinqing were here,

92
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,583
he would definitely laugh at me

93
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,291
for falling into a trap so easily.

94
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,166
Well done.

95
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,291
Once Pei Jinqing is dead,

96
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,083
I'll set you free.

97
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,125
Didn't you say

98
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,333
you would release me after I play along?

99
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:36,916
People

100
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,500
are too greedy.

101
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,708
I've given you too much freedom.

102
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,291
Then you want to leave me.

103
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,583
Starting from now,

104
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,083
no more.

105
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:20,288
(Manqing's personal information)

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,291
Are you sure?

107
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,250
Mrs. Gu,

108
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,541
I looked into her experiences

109
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,666
from her birthplace to here.

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Only one thing is a bit weird.

111
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,708
Ever since Song Ling died,

112
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,083
she disappeared for years.

113
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,708
When she reappeared,

114
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,541
she was Pei Jinqing's special assistant.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,791
Song Ling?

116
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,250
You may go now.

117
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,958
Manqing came for me.

118
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,708
She must die.

119
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,708
The room is dark.

120
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,458
Aren't you afraid?

121
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,791
I've been in the morgue.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,291
This is not terrifying at all.

123
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,375
Oh, right,

124
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,541
how's your investigation going?

125
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,250
Can I go out now?

126
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,750
This time, Liu Yanyan

127
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:56,833
came prepared.

128
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,083
I'm afraid it'll take some time.

129
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,250
But if you need anything,

130
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I'll definitely help you.

131
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,375
Can I have my phone then?

132
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,875
It's really boring here.

133
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:13,875
Okay.

134
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,375
Tomorrow.

135
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,958
Later tomorrow evening.

136
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,291
I have a reception tomorrow.

137
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

138
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,708
Your work matters.

139
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,083
Forget about Pei Jinqing.

140
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,291
He gets close to
Mr. Xu's daughter recently.

141
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,583
Perhaps they'll get married.

142
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:40,166
Mmm.

143
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:09,750
Mr. Pei,

144
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,000
Mr. Gu came in without an...

145
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,500
Long time no see.

146
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,000
Mr. Pei.

147
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,666
I've heard

148
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,625
you've been missing me lately.

149
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,708
That's not true.

150
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,333
We just happen to have a connection.

151
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,666
I came here today to

152
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,041
run an errand for Manqing.

153
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,083
She asked me to give

154
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,208
this to you.

155
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,416
It's worthless.

156
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,500
Just throw it away.

157
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,583
I'm thinking about the past.

158
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,500
When Manqing came to our house

159
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,458
to teach Qingqing piano,

160
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:34,916
she was gorgeous,

161
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,375
gentle,

162
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,541
earnest,

163
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,000
and responsible.

164
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,208
What a pity!

165
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:47,583
Probably.

166
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,791
It's been too long.

167
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,166
I don't remember.

168
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,083
Awesome.

169
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,291
Bye.
