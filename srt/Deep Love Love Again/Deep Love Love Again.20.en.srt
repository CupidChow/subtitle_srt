1
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,916
You don't have to
take all the blame.

2
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,916
But you are my son.

3
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,583
My kind, filial, and hard-working child.

4
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,416
=Deep Love Love Again=
So in your eyes, whatever I do is right,

5
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,625
even if it means murder.

6
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,104
=Episode 20=
You did nothing wrong.

7
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,166
(The Cruel Truth)
You are so outstanding.

8
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,541
That's why you

9
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,750
end up being imperfect.

10
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,833
Just kill her.

11
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,291
Everything will be over.

12
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,666
She must not die!

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,208
I won't let anyone

14
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,916
hurt her.

15
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,541
If she doesn't die,

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,541
everything you've ever done

17
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,333
will be found out by her.

18
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,333
Everyone will know.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,016
I can't bear to do it.

20
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,458
I can't.

21
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,291
Fine.

22
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,496
You can't bear to do it.

23
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:36,708
If you can't,

24
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,958
then I'll do it.

25
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:42,875
Give me!

26
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,166
Let go!

27
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:44,958
No!

28
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,625
Let go!

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,791
My son,

30
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,541
you've grown up.

31
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,500
I can't be with you anymore.

32
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,750
The police found the body and

33
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,208
suicide note of Gu Qiyan's mother.

34
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,541
The suicide note clearly states

35
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,166
that she killed Gu Qingqing's mother and

36
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,875
caused the car accident
that killed Gu Qingqing.

37
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,958
Suicide for fear of punishment?

38
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,250
All evidence points to her suicide.

39
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
Where is Manqing then?

40
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,083
And where is Gu Qiyan?

41
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,166
I can't find her either.

42
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,041
Do you know any of her other plans?

43
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,375
I don't know.

44
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,166
She only told me
that you would come to save me.

45
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:26,125
I beg you. kidnapping you was my fault.

46
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,456
Deceiving you was also my fault.

47
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,250
But I was forced by Gu Qiyan.

48
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,125
I'm going to be your scapegoat anyway.

49
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,541
I beg you to kill me.

50
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,541
Make it quick.

51
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,541
I'm begging you.

52
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:39,958
Rest assured.

53
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,541
You won't die.

54
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,333
What?

55
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,958
It all depends on yourself.

56
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,208
It depends on your attitude.

57
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,250
I'm willing.

58
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,166
I'm willing to do anything
as long as it keeps me alive.

59
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,375
Deceive Gu Qiyan.

60
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,750
Everything is up to you now.

61
00:06:59,333 --> 00:06:59,916
Okay.

62
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,583
I deceived Gu Qiyan.

63
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,958
He dumped my body into the sea.

64
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,333
And those people arranged

65
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,916
by her rescued me.

66
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,541
She never told me her plan.

67
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,583
But I think

68
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,875
that she will
deal with Gu Qiyan on her own.

69
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,791
That was how we first met.

70
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,875
How happy we were back then!

71
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,791
Now you're back by my side again,

72
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:43,750
even if you've changed appearance.

73
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:57,291
Are you awake?

74
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,041
I was just about to play a game.

75
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,708
You mean

76
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,458
a game before my death?

77
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,291
How could that be?

78
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,541
I will always be with you

79
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,583
and look after you

80
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,583
till we're old.

81
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you saying

82
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,958
that in my world from now on,

83
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,000
there will only be you?

84
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,333
Don't be like this.

85
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,000
Qingqing.

86
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,625
Don't make me angry.

87
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:12,768
Play it.

88
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,375
Didn't you love

89
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,958
playing this game when you were little?

90
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,000
Play it.

91
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,166
Why did you become like this?

92
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,000
I have always been like this.

93
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,166
You should congratulate me.

94
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,666
From now on,

95
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,458
I can finally show my true self.

96
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,583
Are you hungry?

97
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,791
To celebrate our reunion,

98
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,833
I bought your favorite strawberry cake.

99
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,541
Here.

100
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,458
Why do you...

101
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:59,250
Why do you treat me this way?

102
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,232
Do you know how much I have
sacrificed to have you by my side?

103
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:07,000
What do you mean?

104
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,000
Your mom didn't commit suicide.

105
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,000
I killed her.

106
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,375
You're a lunatic!

107
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,375
I was born this way.

108
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,166
Everyone

109
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,208
is different.

110
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,666
I want to crush it to death.

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,875
Am I not like the others?

112
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,458
Just do

113
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,875
what you want to do.

114
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,375
It's not my fault.

115
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,125
I particularly enjoy

116
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,208
watching life

117
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,625
fade away

118
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,125
little by little.

119
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,291
But it has

120
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,666
nothing to do with you.

121
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,791
You are a gift from heaven to me.

122
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,583
You make my life not

123
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,625
just about killing,

124
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,875
but also love.
