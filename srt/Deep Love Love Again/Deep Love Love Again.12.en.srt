1
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,500
Actually,

2
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,750
in my heart,

3
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,208
she's no longer you.

4
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,583
I am very clear about that.

5
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,083
She is Gu Qingqing.

6
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,083
Now,

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,833
I kind of like her.

8
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,272
=Deep Love Love Again=

9
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:46,272
=Episode 12=
(Conflict)

10
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,000
Mr. Pei.

11
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,166
Did you sleep well?

12
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,208
Yeah.

13
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Is anyone there?

14
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,833
Is anyone there?

15
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,416
Is anyone there?

16
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,125
Help!

17
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,541
Mr. Pei.

18
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,708
What's wrong?

19
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,333
Do you remember your promise to me?

20
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,166
What is it?

21
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,166
After handling Liu Yanyan and Ji Anyang,

22
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,916
you will reward me.

23
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,916
Reward?

24
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,416
Sure.

25
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,583
What reward do you want?

26
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,333
Is this the reward you want?

27
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,458
I'm just imitating,

28
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,750
So it's sensitive here.

29
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,916
Come closer.

30
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,250
I have something to tell you.

31
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,708
What is it?

32
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,541
Untie me.

33
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,083
No way.

34
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,250
I want to hug you.

35
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,458
Release me.

36
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,250
I don't believe it.

37
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,250
I really want to hug you.

38
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,958
I especially want you right now.

39
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,875
I will never let you go.

40
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,333
Okay.

41
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,791
Let's be entangled for a lifetime.

42
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,416
Didn't I give you a few days off?

43
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,500
I can't take it.

44
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,666
After a few days of absence,

45
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,458
my pay has been docked.

46
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Spit it out. What is it?

47
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,541
I've returned to the factory.

48
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,583
Liu Yanyan is missing.

49
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,083
Did you take her away?

50
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,208
I don't know where she is.

51
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,458
So

52
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,916
neither Liu Yanyan
nor Ji Anyang admitted

53
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:22,916
they caused the car accident.

54
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,500
And Liu Yanyan has gone missing.

55
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,666
It proves

56
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,458
that someone else is behind them.

57
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,333
Therefore, my next target is Gu Qiyan.

58
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,041
Once he knows my identity,

59
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,291
he will definitely let me return home.

60
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,708
I think...

61
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,083
Gu Qiyan knew Manqing before,

62
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,250
but he pretended that he didn't know you

63
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,041
and tested you.

64
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:45,625
This man

65
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,458
is very dangerous.

66
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,250
And his house is an abyss of suffering.

67
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,208
You wanna go back?

68
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,166
I bet you'll suffer a lot.

69
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,500
I advise you not to go.

70
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,416
That is just your advice.

71
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,583
I decide for myself.

72
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,041
Fine.

73
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,916
So you just informed me.

74
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,500
Okay.

75
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,208
Manqing?

76
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,916
Please have a seat.

77
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,250
If Mr. Gu is not here,

78
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,416
I'll come another time.

79
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,125
I am Qiyan's mom.

80
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,583
I know you,

81
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,541
Mrs. Gu.

82
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
Qiyan is in a meeting.

83
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,583
I receive a call from the front desk

84
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,416
and let you come up.

85
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,666
I see.

86
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,625
Since Mr. Gu is in a meeting,

87
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,875
I'll take my leave.

88
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:49,916
Manqing.

89
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,416
I've heard

90
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,000
that you've been close
to Qiyan recently.

91
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,666
You'd better

92
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,750
ask Mr. Gu about it personally.

93
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:03,875
Why?

94
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,916
You're about to be my daughter-in-law.

95
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,666
I ask you a question,

96
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,000
but you refuse to answer?

97
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:23,833
Mrs. Gu.

98
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:25,833
Without telling me,

99
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,541
you talked to my assistant in private.

100
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,083
It seems inappropriate.

101
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,625
What are you looking at?

102
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,583
Get out!
