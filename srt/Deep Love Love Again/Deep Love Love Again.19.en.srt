Forgive you?

You think I don't know
someone came here?

6
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,291
You lied to me.

7
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,125
It's not true.

8
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,083
I did not.

9
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:53,708
You did not?

10
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,958
Do you want that person to come again

11
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:58,916

It's almost the end.

20

Now you hesitate?

21
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:14,791
No.

22
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,125
I don't agree.

23
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,458

27

don't you want to avenge Manqing?

28
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:49,625
Fine then.

29
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,166
I'd like to ask for your help.

30
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:56,916
Say it.

Mr. Pei.

It's 10 AM. Should we
send out the video?

33
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,875
Don't do that.

34
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,041
I don't have to go that far.

35
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,666
There must be other ways.

36
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,833
Mr. Pei, Manqing has sent it out.

Hello?

Why don't you

46
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,291
discuss it with me?

47
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,666
The video is fake.

48
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,750
It doesn't matter at all.

49
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,750
I don't care if it's real or fake.

50
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,750
I didn't agree to it,

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,958
because I have better
and more thorough plans.

52

Do you know?

Can you trust me once?

54
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,083
I have never doubted you.

55
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,916
You've waited for years.

56
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,875
I know

57
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,541
you won't give up this opportunity.

58
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,291
But you should know

59
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,500
our goals are the same.

60
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,708
I've changed my appearance
to live in this world.

61
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,500
It's not

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,958
for helping you seek revenge.

63
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,541
I must make them
pay the price on my own.

64
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:54,666
I gotta go.

65
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,208
I'm going out.

66
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,041
Where?

67
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,750
My stepmom asked me to meet her.

68
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll go with you.

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,375
I can't let you take the risk alone.

70
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,750
Without you, I would've died.

71
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't worry.

72
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,666
I asked you to come

73
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,958
just to tell you the truth back then.

74
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,375
What truth?

75
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,208
Right over there.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,958
I strangled your mother to death

77
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,375
with such a long rope.

78
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,208
I wrapped it around her neck.

79
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,208
When she was about to die,

80
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,083
then I hanged her up.

81
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,791
Why did you do that?

82
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,541
When your mother was carrying you

83
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,125
and seduced my husband,

84
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,166
she should've known

85
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,458
she would end up like that.

86
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,250
Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,625
My mother and I have never done

88
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,083
anything to hurt you.

89
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,833
Your very existence

90
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,750
is the biggest mistake.

91
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,791
You're not related
to Gu family by blood.

92
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,708
But that old man

93
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,916
insisted on splitting
the shares with you.

94
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,333
Tell me.

95
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,666
Shouldn't you die?

96
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,750
So you tampered with my car?

97
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,833
Did you cause that car accident?

98
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:07,875
Yes.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,083
I did it.

100
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,208
I wanted you to be reunited
with your mother

101
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,541
in another world.
