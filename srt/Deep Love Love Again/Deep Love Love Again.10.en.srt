00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,250
Manqing?

3
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,416
It truly surprised me

4
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,750
to see you here.

5
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,083
Miss Gu used to help me.

6
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,958
I should come at her deathday.

7
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,750
In your eyes,

8
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,666
what kind of person is your sister?

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,083
She's innocent,

10
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,500
kind-hearted,

11
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,250
and pure,

12
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,375
just like

13
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,625
a little white bunny.

14
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:18,833
Little white bunny?

(I Am Her)

17
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,750
The Manqing I knew

18
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,166
disappeared two years ago.

19
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,666
I met Gu Qiyan today.

20
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,125
What?

21
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,708
You've recognized each other?

22
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,166
You're making me think you're jealous.

23
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,083
The way you spoke

24
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,625
is just to make me ask you that, right?

25
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,875
He said some very strange things.

26
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,750
He seems to know the real Manqing.

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,208
He still remembers Manqing.

28
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,375
He must have also guessed

29
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,750
why Manqing came to find him.

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,083
Manqing is my fiancee.

31
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,500
But the police said
they couldn't find her.

32
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,458
She's missing.

33
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,250
Is she still alive?

34
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,458
I can't find her,

35
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,208
which means she might still be alive.

36
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,166
And perhaps she's hiding
and doesn't want to see me.

37
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,916
I made you look like her.

38
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,750
Anyway, I can see the same face as her.

39
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,250
It's better than never seeing her
for the rest of my life.

40
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,083
Pei Jinqing.

41
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:48,583
And you.

42
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,291
You need a new face,

43
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,041
don't you?

44
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,500
You got drunk.

45
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,375
I'm not your...

46
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,750
I'm not your fiancee.

47
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,666
Pei Jinqing.

48
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,875
Manqing?

49
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,458
Mr. Gu?

50
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,583
What a coincidence.

51
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,833
Do you often come here for coffee?

52
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,458
Yes.

53
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,916
I particularly like lattes.

54
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,750
The lemon cheesecake is also delicious.

55
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,875
Would you like to try it?

56
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:19,666
Really?

57
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:20,833
Sure.

58
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:42,708
So?

59
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,458
Is it tasty?

60
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,625
So delicious.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,375
Why do you like cheese so much?

62
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,291
I have an older brother.

63
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,166
He's been lactose intolerant
since he was little.

64
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,250
However,

65
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,375
he often ate it with me.

66
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,041
Even if

67
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,166
he didn't feel well,

68
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,333
he still joined me.

69
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,541
But later on,
I stopped eating cheese much.

70
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,375
You must love your brother, right?

71
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,750
Yes, I do.

72
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,458
He loves me too.

73
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,750
When we were kids,

74
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,750
I always teased him
for being a smiling tiger.

75
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:28,958
Why?

76
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,958
He

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,416
looked friendly,

78
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,750
but no matter who bullied me,

79
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,458
he would never let them off easily.

80
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,708
I suddenly feel

81
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,500
that you and the Manqing I know

82
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,708
are nothing alike.

83
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,500
You look like someone else

84
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,041
very much.

85
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,458
Really?

86
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,708
Manqing.

87
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,875
Mr. Gu has given

88
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,833
this house to you.

89
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,083
Why are you here?

90
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:56,833
Miss Liu.

91
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:57,875
You can't come in.

92
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,500
I am asking you why you are here.

93
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,875
This is my house.

94
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,333
Didn't you know?

95
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,458
How could that be?

96
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,458
This house belongs to the Gu family.

97
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,666
And it has nothing

98
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,333
to do with you and Ji Anyang.

99
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,916
Guess what?

100
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,875
Qiyan has given this house

101
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:20,875
to me.

102
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,041
Nonsense.

103
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,166
No way.

104
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,083
Miss Liu.

105
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,791
Mr. Gu has indeed given this house

106
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,125
to Manqing.

107
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,333
After deceiving Ji Anyang,

108
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,958
you started to fool Gu Qiyan, right?

109
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,458
Shame on you.

110
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,500
What?

111
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:42,791
Yeah.

112
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,958
You seduced your best friend

113
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,291
Gu Qingqing's husband.

114
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,041
It's indeed quite shameless.

115
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,250
Ignoring Gu Qingqing in a car accident,
leaving her to die,

116
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,833
you are a monster.

117
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,500
How did you know

118
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,041
Ji Anyang and I left her to die?

119
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,666
That's because

120
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,458
Gu Qingqing is not yet dead.

121
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,875
I saw her lying in the mortuary
with my own eyes.

122
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,625
She's dead.

123
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,708
Mortuary?

124
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,083
Is it where you and Ji Anyang made out?

125
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,541
You're a lunatic.

126
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,875
I am not.

127
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,166
I am Gu Qingqing.

128
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,375
I have already met Gu Qiyan.

129
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,250
However, he showed no reaction.

130
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,458
Do you think
the Gu family will let you go?

131
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,500
It's just a matter of time.

132
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,125
Are you worried about me?

133
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,458
I'm just worried about your face.

134
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,083
Rest assured.

135
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,916
I will surely not let the face you love

136
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:53,708
get hurt.

137
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,458
What's wrong with you?

138
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,083
Hello?
