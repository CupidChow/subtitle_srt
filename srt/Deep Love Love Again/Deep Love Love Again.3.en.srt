(Stepping into the Trap)

3
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,375
Good morning, Manqing.

4
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,291
Mr. Ji.

5
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,708
Looks like you had a good time
with Mr. Lin.

6
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,791
Please have a seat, Mr. Ji.

7
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,000
This is what you wanted.

8
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,833
After signing it,
deliver it to Mr. Lin's company.

9
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:25,824
(Xixing Land Development
Transfer Agreement)

10
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,083
Manqing.

11
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,125
You are my lucky star.

12
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,541
You have promised me.

13
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,791
If I help you get the Xixing Project,

14
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,166
you will reward me, right?

15
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,875
Of course.

16
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,333
But before that,

17
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,250
I hope you take a look at this.

18
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,666
I didn't expect

19
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,250
that you pretended
to be innocent at the party.

20
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,708
You're so wild in private.

21
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,583
How did you get these photos?

22
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,250
If these photos are released,

23
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,083
will Mr. Pei get angry?

24
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,416
Can you keep your job?

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,291
Don't release these photos.

26
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,208
Sure.

27
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,500
No problem.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,458
But...

29
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,500
Mr. Ji, I'll do whatever you say.

30
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,458
Deal.

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,625
But not today.

32
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,458
Understood.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,875
Another time then.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Take care, Mr. Ji.

35
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,416
Manqing.

36
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,291
This gesture reminds me
of someone I know.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,875
Really?

38
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,583
Congratulations.

39
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,208
The fish has taken the bait.

40
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,083
If you hadn't generously
dropped the bait,

41
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,833
I wouldn't have succeeded.

42
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,625
So thank you for your help.

43
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,166
Just lip service?

44
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,541
As I said,

45
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,250
everything has a price.

46
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,125
Words are worth nothing.

47
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,750
As long as it's done,

48
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,833
I'm willing to fulfill any
of your wishes.

49
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,666
But I'll always remember who I am.

50
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,541
Don't talk to me in that tone.

51
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,375
What's the matter?

52
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,250
Seeing this face of mine,

53
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,333
you can't be hard on me?

54
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,666
Alright.

55
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,375
You'll know if I can do that.

56
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,666
You have a chance now.

57
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,750
If you say the words, hot milk,

58
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,541
I can let you go.

59
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,791
Remember.

60
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,625
Anytime you say the words, hot milk,

61
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,708
I will stop.

62
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:35,708
I don't want to.

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,083
I must remember

64
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,333
every bit of pain I've suffered today.

65
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,708
Understand now?

66
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,500
Have you had enough fun?

67
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,125
Before you try to seduce me,

68
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,708
use your brain,

69
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,125
and you won't have to suffer so much.

70
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,166
Manqing.

71
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,916
Thanks to you, I start a connection

72
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,458
with Mr. Lin

73
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,916
and Mr. Pei.

74
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,541
Don't mention it.

75
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,791
Just don't forget about me

76
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,625
when you make a fortune.

77
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,541
That's all.

78
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,375
How could I forget?

79
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,791
You've done me such a big favor.

80
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,416
I'm indebted to you.

81
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,833
So, Mr. Ji,

82
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,625
how do you plan to thank me?

83
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:41,958
What's the matter, Mr. Ji?

84
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:57,666
Nothing.

85
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,916
That gesture you just made

86
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,625
reminded me of my ex-wife, Gu Qingqing.

87
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,875
Perhaps

88
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,208
I am Gu Qingqing.

89
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,291
You?

90
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:37,708
It means our relationship holds weight

91
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,708
in your heart.

92
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,291
I didn't expect you to be humorous.

93
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,916
Your house is so big.

94
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,416
Manqing.

95
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,833
Manqing.

96
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,958
Where are you?
