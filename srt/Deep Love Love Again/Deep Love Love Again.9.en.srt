1
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:29,583
Mr. Pei.

2
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:30,583
Welcome back.

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,000
Just tell me what you want.

4
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,750
You're so smart.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,541
I need you to do me a favor.

6
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,536
(Invitation to Guquan Group's
15th Anniversary Gala)

7
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,041
Can I go?

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:55,541
As you wish.

9
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,458
But if anything happens,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,041
I won't help you out.

11
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:08,375
=Deep Love Love Again=

12
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,166
Mr. Gu has a private party this week.

13
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,416
I hear that Mr. Pei

14
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,250
and his assistant Manqing
will also be there.

15
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,833
=Episode 9 =
I know Manqing.

16
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,500
(Divergence)
She's famously sociable.

17
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,208
Isn't she just an assistant?

18
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,250
Who cares about her?

19
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,958
She's Mr.Pei's assistant.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,250
She has a thing with her boss.

21
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,125
Why, Mr. Gu?

22
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,333
Just a minor injury.

23
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,750
I can continue working.

24
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,208
I let you take a vacation.

25
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,541
On the one hand,
you have time to recover.

26
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,416
After all, your face is hurt.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,541
It does have an impact on your image.

28
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,208
On the other hand,

29
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:42,750
I heard

30
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,458
your family found you.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,625
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,208
I don't...

33
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,500
The issue on Ji Anyang

34
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,458
just ended.

35
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,666
I don't want the company

36
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,708
to have any issues.

37
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:54,750
I see.

38
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,583
I'll take the vacation as you said.

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,500
Well,

40
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:58,500
if allowed,

41
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,208
I have to go.

42
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,291
Yanyan.

43
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,416
Have you ever thought

44
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,208
about who leaked the news
of you being here?

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,333
I don't think

46
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,375
he invited me over just for a party.

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,583
Gu Qiyan is sophisticated.

48
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,708
His purpose is not simple.

49
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:33,416
Excuse me.

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:33,916
See you.

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,250
Manqing.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,333
May I dance with you?

53
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:42,541
Mr. Pei.

54
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,708
You won't mind, right?

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,041
Okay.

56
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:46,333
Go ahead.

57
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,458
When did you join Pei Group?

58
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,000
I studied abroad for two years

59
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,125
and just started working.

60
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,500
Manqing.

61
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you know Gu Qingqing?

62
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,375
Why did you ask me that?

63
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:11,791
You don't know her?

64
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,000
I thought you had a connection

65
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,166
with Qingqing.

66
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,208
Just a coincidence.

67
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:49,791
Car key.

68
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Sir, are you driving?

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,500
You may leave.

70
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,291
Will you drive sometimes?

71
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,750
Do you think you know me well?

72
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,500
I was just saying.

73
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,125
Yeah, you were.

74
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,333
You're capable of seducing Gu Qiyan.

75
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:14,750
Get in.

76
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,791
We need to talk.

77
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:28,500
Speak.

78
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,916
Isn't it what you taught me?

79
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,125
Gu Qingqing is already dead.

80
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,875
Manqing and Gu Qiyan

81
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:35,791
have no relation.

82
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,375
Why can't I seduce him?

83
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,875
Didn't I tell you

84
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,083
not to get too close to Gu Qiyan?

85
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,291
You have to cross a line

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,583
to do the right thing.

87
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Don't get on my bad side.

88
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,583
I have to get close to Gu Qiyan

89
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,875
to find out the truth.

90
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,000
Sometimes,

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
the truth means danger.

92
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,375
Understand?

93
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,291
Someone is watching.

94
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,750
Work with me.

95
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,291
We're faking it.

96
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,750
Stretch out your legs.

97
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,250
Do it.

98
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:13,760
(Mr. Pei and Mr. Gu vied to dance with
Mr. Pei's assistant at Gu Group's gala.)

99
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,666
I remember you should work today.

100
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,625
I wanna go back to the Gu's.

101
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,208
No way.

102
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,750
But I am sure that the car accident

103
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,208
is related to the Gu family.

104
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,750
I can't give up.

105
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,208
It's a gift from Gu Qiyan?

106
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,708
If you continue to act recklessly
and affect my plan,

107
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,083
I'll end our cooperation.

108
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,000
You promised not to meddle
with my revenge.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I have told you

110
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,666
that I don't like pointless stupidity.

111
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:50,958
Remember that.

112
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,958
Whatever.
