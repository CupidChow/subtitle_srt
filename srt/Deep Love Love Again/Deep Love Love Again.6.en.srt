00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,958
This villa looks nice.

2
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,375
It should sell for a good price,

3
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,166
so you can pay off your debts.

4
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,041
Pei Jinqing.

5
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,666
Cancel the contract.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,541
You should talk to Mr. Lin about it.

I'll give you ten more minutes.

9
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,041
(Evil Leads to Evil)
Either you cancel the contract

10
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,291
or give me your life.

11
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,166
Calm down.

12
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,791
I'm a businessman. We can make a deal.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,000
I can end the contract.

14
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,791
But you must delete the video
about Manqing.

15
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,291
Who are you to negotiate with me?

16
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,458
Aren't you self-righteous?

17
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,833
Aren't you a big shot?

18
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,000
Now you negotiate with me?

19
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:45,625
Don't say that.

20
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,791
I've always had great respect
for my business partners.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,208
Partners?

22
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,416
You teamed up and set me up,

23
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,583
treating me like a dog.

24
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:06,875
Get up.

25
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,291
Get up!

26
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,125
Are you satisfied?

27
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,708
Manqing has a really good figure.

28
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,250
I'm going to spread this video
all over the internet.

29
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,708
Aren't you trying
to give me a hard time?

30
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,541
I will make you suffer too.

31
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,250
If you post this video online,

32
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,708
I'll make you disappear
from this world completely.

33
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,166
Then you disappear as well.

34
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,500
Mr. Pei.

35
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,666
Help.

36
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,041
Help.

37
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,375
I...

38
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,541
Don't you hit him to vent your anger?

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,541
If I really killed him,

40
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,208
I would have to go to prison.

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,250
How did you know I'm here?

42
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,166
I have my ways.

43
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:45,791
Thank you

44
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,000
for your help.

45
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,833
Actually,

46
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,125
you don't have to.

47
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,083
Ji Anyang is also my enemy.

48
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,625
Whatever I do is not for you.

49
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:08,125
Sure.

50
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,833
You are right.

51
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,083
Are you cold?

52
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,541
Do you feel comfortable like this?

53
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,375
It's okay.

54
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,291
Come close.

55
00:05:59,166 --> 00:05:59,916
Come on.

56
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,166
Is your stomach feeling better?

57
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,541
It doesn't hurt.

58
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,500
Where has Ji Anyang gone now?

59
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,708
I guess

60
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,791
he's at the Baoli Hotel.

61
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,708
Where are you gonna run?

62
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,041
Buddy.

63
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,333
Guys.

64
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,125
Please give your boss a message.

65
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,083
Can I pay back the money later?

66
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,666
We have a contract in black and white.

67
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,208
Today is the repayment date.

68
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,500
Do you want to lose your hand or foot?

69
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,458
Make your decision.

70
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,208
No, don't.

71
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,458
Tell your boss

72
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,291
I am the manager of the Gu Group.

73
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,791
I will definitely repay the money.

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,750
Please.

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,166
Look at yourself now.

76
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,500
Will my boss believe you?

77
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:05,833
Boss.

78
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:18,958
Mr. Ji.

79
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,041
We meet again.

80
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,416
Manqing?

81
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,833
You planned it all?

82
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,083
Why?

83
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,625
Why did you do this?

84
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,166
You might as well kill me.

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,041
That's too good for you.

86
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,375
I did it all for Gu Qingqing.

87
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,583
Gu Qingqing?

88
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,916
Aren't you clear
about what you have done yourself?

89
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,333
What have I done?

90
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,875
What have I done?

91
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:54,833
I just...

92
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,583
You betrayed her

93
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,750
and let her die helplessly.

94
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,041
I didn't.

95
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,125
I still have feelings for her.

96
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,708
Chop off his hand.

97
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,500
Sir.

98
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:25,916
Don't!

99
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:26,833
Sir.

100
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,791
No!

101
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,916
Don't!

102
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:35,958
Don't.

103
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,375
Manqing.

104
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,458
Stop.

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,666
Save me.

106
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,708
Manqing.

107
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:43,875
Manqing.

108
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:45,625
Don't!

109
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,375
Gu Qingqing.

110
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,166
Honey.

111
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,083
Honey.

112
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,625
Please let me go.

113
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,583
I'm so scared.

114
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,375
Why do you keep chasing me?

115
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,000
Why do you keep chasing me?

116
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,708
Haven't I suffered enough?

117
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,833
I've lost my home

118
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,291
and my money.

119
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,041
I've lost everything.

120
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,458
Aren't you satisfied?

121
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,333
What do you want from me?

122
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,000
What more do you want from me?

123
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,791
What do you need to be satisfied?

124
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,625
Do you want me to keep you company?

125
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,916
I'll kill myself.
