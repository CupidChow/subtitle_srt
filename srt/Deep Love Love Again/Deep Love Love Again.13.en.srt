1
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,541
Is this the method you have in mind?

2
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,541
Enter Gu Group single-handed?

3
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,416
Video footage shows

4
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,958
Liu Yanyan was taken away by a van,

5
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,541
but at that location,

6
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,916
I saw Gu Qiyan's car.

7
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,625
So what?

8
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,541
Do you think he will tell you the truth?

9
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,708
Where does your confidence come from?

10
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:11,712
=Deep Love Love Again=

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,833
Or are you planning

12
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,291
to deal with Gu Qiyan
the same way you dealt with me?

13
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,040
=Episode 13=
(Who Are You)

14
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,375
I...

15
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:26,500
Hold on.

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,583
How do you know I'm here?

17
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,625
This hexagram

18
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,125
allows me to know
your location at any time.

19
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,541
I won't allow anyone to harm you.

20
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,000
Mom,

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,833
why are you here?

22
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,208
What's the matter?

23
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:34,750
Can't I come here?

24
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:36,791
Or is there

25
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,750
a hussy hidden in your office

26
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,125
that you don't want me to know?

27
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,375
The girl named Manqing

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,541
is really something.

29
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,916
In just a few words,

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,416
she managed to deceive Ji Anyang.

31
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,125
What does she want with you now?

32
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:57,958
Don't you think she

33
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,250
looks familiar?

34
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,083
What?

35
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,833
I should be going.

36
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:38,916
Pour it away.

37
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,083
Understood.

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,833
Contact Manqing.

39
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,541
I want to meet her on Saturday.

40
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,500
Got it, Mr. Gu.

41
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm sorry

42
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,541
for asking you to come here.

43
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,458
It's okay.

44
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,791
This is the key to Gu Qingqing's villa.

45
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,416
I should return it to you.

46
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,500
Her belongings

47
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,333
should not become gifts.

48
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:21,376
(Tomb of Gu Qingqing)

49
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,083
I have never seen you as anyone else.

50
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,458
You look too much like Qingqing.

51
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,416
She is the princess of the Gu family.

52
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,750
She has always lived a carefree life.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,291
But what she doesn't know is

54
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,291
she has always lived in
other people's scripts.

55
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,291
If she

56
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,916
could have a chance to start over,

57
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,541
what kind of choices would she make?

58
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,791
Who are you really?

59
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,083
You are Qingqing, right?

60
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,750
You are my sister, Gu Qingqing?

61
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:16,916
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:18,958
It's my fault.

63
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,041
I didn't protect you well.

64
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,375
(Gu Qingqing)
This is Gu Qingqing's fate.

65
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,500
None of this is on you.

66
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:32,916
Your face...

67
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,500
How did it become like this?

68
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,500
The owner

69
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,708
of this face is Pei Jinqing's fiancée.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,333
He's sick.

71
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,708
Qingqing.

72
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,583
If you return home
in the name of my fiancée,

73
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,000
would you be willing?

74
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,250
You know it.

75
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,500
We're not related by blood.

76
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,083
So what?

77
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,708
Give me another chance.

78
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,166
I will definitely protect you.

79
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,250
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

80
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm cold.

81
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,041
Get in the car.

82
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,000
Gu Qiyan said

83
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,541
he wanted me to be his girlfriend.

84
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,083
You also know

85
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,375
Gu Qingqing and Gu Qiyan

86
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,708
are not related by blood, right?

87
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,708
With your understanding of them,

88
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,791
you should know better.

89
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:49,958
As for me,

90
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,666
I've longed for a home since young.

91
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,958
This is a house Gu Qiyan
gave to Gu Qingqing.

92
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,125
It's also my first home.

93
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,500
Now, I'm going to lose this home too.

94
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,375
So you've decided to go back there?

95
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,083
I'm thinking about

96
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,833
moving out

97
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:16,666
in a few days.

98
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,875
I won't allow it.

99
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,000
Mr. Pei,

100
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,333
if I'm going to pretend,

101
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,666
I should act more convincingly.

102
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,833
If I want to be

103
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,166
Gu Qiyan's girlfriend,

104
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,083
how can I live in another man's house?

105
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,333
Right?
