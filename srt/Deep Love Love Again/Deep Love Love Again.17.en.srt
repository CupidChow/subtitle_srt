1
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:22,833
Qiyan.

2
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:23,791
Quick!

3
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,750
What's wrong, Mom?

4
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:27,833
Remember?

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,291
Qingqing had a piano teacher
when she was little.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,541
What was her name?

7
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,416
I can't remember.

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,833
That female college student?

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,333
Right!

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:36,666
Where did she go?

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:37,583
Her?

12
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,541
It was Manqing.

13
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:08,356
=Deep Love Love Again=

14
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:15,008
=Episode 17=
(Who Is Manqing)

15
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:35,416
Here you are.

16
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:39,750
Thank you.

17
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,875
I met Pei Jinqing.

18
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,458
Oh.

19
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:53,500
Okay.

20
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,833
How is he?

21
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,166
I'm just a bit curious.

22
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,875
Pei Jinqing

23
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,750
is just a fling of mine.

24
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,916
He turned me into his ex-girlfriend

25
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,541
just for this face.

26
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,041
As for me, I was after

27
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,541
his power and influence.

28
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,083
He could help me

29
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,291
kill Ji Anyang.

30
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,875
There's nothing worth holding onto.

31
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,541
It's good that you let it go.

32
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,291
It's not easy to have you back.

33
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,250
I can't let you get hurt again.

34
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:38,958
But

35
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,291
do you know

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,125
who the real Manqing is?

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,625
I know.

38
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,083
Isn't she Pei Jinqing's ex-girlfriend?

39
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,125
The real Manqing

40
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,541
is your former piano teacher.

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Do you still remember?

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,500
Why can't I remember the piano teacher?

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,666
After your mom committed suicide,

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,125
you were in a coma.

45
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,625
I once thought

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,625
you would never wake up.

47
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,500
Luckily, you slowly recovered.

48
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,958
But you can't remember

49
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,458
the past.

50
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,083
Is that why Dad took me back home

51
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,833
and took me in?

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,541
That memory

53
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,166
must be very painful.

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,333
So you still can't remember up to now.

55
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:21,875
Qiyan.

56
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:22,625
Qiyan.

57
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,125
Qiyan.

58
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,500
Can you let me out?

59
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,458
Let me out.

60
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,291
You want to see him?

61
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,291
No.

62
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,958
I don't want to fight with Mrs. Gu.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,208
I'm tired of this prison game.

64
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,291
If she thinks I'm guilty,

65
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,333
just call the police.

66
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,291
No.

67
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,083
You're not guilty.

68
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,625
How could you possibly be?

69
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,000
Please.

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,750
She's at the Buddhist Hall now.

71
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:57,833
Just go.

72
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,458
Thank you, Qiyan.

73
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:56,352
(Recipient: Mr. Pei. I want to see you.)

74
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:42,708
Mom.

75
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,333
Mom.

76
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,500
Is that Mom?

77
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:50,916
She committed suicide.

78
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,375
She has left us forever.

79
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:53,791
It's okay.

80
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,416
I'm here with you.

81
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,708
Mom.

82
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,166
Mom.

83
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,750
Mom.

84
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,541
Mom!

85
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,666
Mom!

86
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,291
Mom!

87
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,625
Mom!

88
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,041
Mom!

89
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,125
Manqing.

90
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,375
Manqing.

91
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,208
Don't call me Manqing.

92
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,083
I'm not Manqing.

93
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not her.

94
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,666
What's wrong?

95
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,916
You said you would let me

96
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,083
live in agony.

97
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,208
You weren't joking,

98
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,041
were you?

99
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,250
You didn't save

100
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,500
and help me because you wanted

101
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,416
their business.

102
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,250
You're playing a game.

103
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,208
I'm your pawn.

104
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,500
An abandoned piece.

105
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm one of your targets
for revenge, right?

106
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,791
No!

107
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,625
What's wrong?

108
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not like that.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,791
It's not like that.

110
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
That car accident...

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,625
You did it?

112
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't do it!

113
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,000
It had nothing to do with me.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,791
That accident was purely accidental.

115
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,500
I remember everything now.

116
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,791
This abandoned theater
was where my mother met her end.

117
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,000
She committed suicide there.

118
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,208
By the time I arrived,

119
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,875
there was only a body left.

120
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,875
I don't know

121
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,958
where Manqing went.

122
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,791
I really don't know.

123
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,416
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,291
I was wrong.

125
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,833
I was wrong.

126
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:34,750
Pei Jinqing.

127
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,500
We are over.

128
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,250
Manqing and I

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,833
were ready to get married
right after college.

130
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,000
What's this?

131
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,080
(Manqing's Internship Plan:
Guquan Group)

132
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,708
You can come to Pei Group.

133
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,416
I don't want to rely on anyone.

134
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,416
Especially you.

135
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,833
The position is called
special assistant.

136
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,666
Actually, they just want you
to teach Qingqing

137
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,000
how to play piano.

138
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,500
It doesn't matter.

139
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,250
An assistant

140
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,375
is supposed to do lots of tasks.

141
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,625
All right.

142
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,791
Give it a try for a month.

143
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,166
Actually, you're really outstanding.

144
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,791
You don't need so many work experiences
to prove yourself.

145
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,791
I have a present for you.

146
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,625
Is it nice?

147
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,041
It's nice.

148
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,333
I'll put it on.

149
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,833
I'm just afraid you're too good

150
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,000
and that you'll dump me.

151
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,000
So from this day forward,

152
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,625
I'll tie you down.

153
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,592
(Manqing)

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,458
Hey.

155
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,625
You off work?

156
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,250
I'll pick you up.

157
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,666
Jinqing,

158
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,250
something's off here.

159
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:32,708
Miss Manqing,

160
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,416
why are you here?

161
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,250
Hello?

162
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,625
Manqing?
