1
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,708
Qiyan, where are you taking me exactly?

2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,333
Over here.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,750
We're almost there.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,375
Okay.

5
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,541
Will there be any surprise?

6
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,125
Forward. Come on.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,083
Okay.

8
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,625
This place is so big.

9
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,083
It's so beautiful.

10
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,541
=Deep Love Love Again=
Your wedding gift.

11
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,568
=Episode 8 =
I thought you would forbid my marriage

12
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:15,083
(Reap What You Sow)
as our parents did.

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,583
No need

14
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,125
to take my opinion.

15
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,750
But I must

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,625
give you a rich dowry.

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,291
Qiyan.

18
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,208
What a coincidence, Mr. Gu.

19
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,750
Manqing, what are you doing here?

20
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,250
Thanks to Manqing,

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,708
Qingqing's house wasn't mortgaged
or auctioned off.

22
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,541
Don't mention it, Mr. Gu.

23
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,583
I merely did a small favor.

24
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,291
Oh, right.

25
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,166
Why are you here, Manqing?

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,916
I happened to pass by

27
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,666
and wanted to confirm if this house

28
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,166
has been returned to its owner.

29
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,666
When you're free,

30
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,125
let me invite you to dinner.

31
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,458
Sure.

32
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,416
I have to go.

33
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:26,875
Bye.

34
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,125
You went to see Gu Qiyan?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Mr. Pei, you followed me.

36
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,541
Can I think

37
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,083
that you're targeting the Gu Group?

38
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,250
Your desire for the Gu Group

39
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,833
should be even stronger than mine.

40
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,500
I guessed right?

41
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,666
My lipstick came off. I need touch-ups.

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,666
Without me,

43
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,333
you would have a long way

44
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,166
to go to acquire the Gu Group.

45
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,166
So you're getting close to Gu Qiyan

46
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,916
to provoke Liu Yanyan?

47
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,666
It's obvious
that Liu Yanyan has a crush on Gu Qiyan.

48
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,458
She stopped Ji Anyang

49
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,833
from calling the police.

50
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,458
I have to suspect her.

51
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
Have you ever suspected the man
behind her?

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,500
Gu Qiyan?

53
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,250
Impossible. He's my brother.

54
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,125
He is Gu Qingqing's brother,

55
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,250
not yours.

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,208
Anyway,

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,791
my next target

58
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,291
will be Liu Yanyan.

59
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,708
Haven't you always been curious

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,583
about where Liu Yanyan's parents
have gone?

61
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,291
Her father owes money
because of gambling debts

62
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,083
and is on the run.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,208
That's why you can't find him.

64
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,375
But I have their news.

65
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,750
Offer me a deal.

66
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,250
Stay away from Gu Qiyan.

67
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:43,880
(Mercury)

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,750
Come, honey.

69
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,416
Come.

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,833
Where's the door?

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,291
Not here.

72
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,791
Aren't these all mirrors?

73
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,541
Where's the door here?

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,916
Where is it?

75
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,166
- I came from here.
- Yeah.

76
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,541
Why is there a gourd here?

77
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,625
Hello. Can I help you?

78
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,916
We haven't opened yet.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,333
My daughter is the boss here.

80
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,541
My boss is not here.

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,250
Jiao.

82
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,250
Jiao.

83
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,416
No, you can't go in.

84
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:37,875
Stop.

85
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,166
Jiao.

86
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,666
Jiao.

87
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,166
Jiao.

88
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,750
See, our daughter is the boss now.

89
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah, that's true.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,958
Why are you here?

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,166
What do you think?

92
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,666
You're living a good life.

93
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,416
So how could your mom and I not come?

94
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,333
How did you find this place?

95
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,875
It wasn't easy.

96
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,625
I'm sweating all over.

97
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:58,916
Jiao.

98
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,750
I have to tell you.

99
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,416
You can't just disappear
without saying anything.

100
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,791
You've made us so worried.

101
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,000
Your mom

102
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,375
tossed and turned all night,

103
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,125
driving hair loss.

104
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,708
Yes, Meijiao.

105
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,458
When you left,

106
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,958
you should have told me.

107
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,416
You got thinner.

108
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,708
I hardly recognize you.

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,625
How much is this bag?

110
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,375
Don't take my things.

111
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,083
Meijiao.

112
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,083
Your things are our things.

113
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,041
How hurtful your words are.

114
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,375
There's no money inside.

115
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,375
You'll be back, anyway.

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,625
Pour me a glass

117
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,208
of the most expensive wine.

118
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,208
Do you think
this place is worth four million yuan?

119
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,541
I hear she doesn't own this place.

120
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,083
Water?

121
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,500
You guess.

122
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,541
If she and Ji Anyang knew

123
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,458
you were behind this,

124
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,625
would she regret betraying you?

125
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,416
No rush.

126
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,125
It's only the beginning now.

127
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,416
I'll make her regret it.

128
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:31,541
She's here.

129
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:32,916
Jiao.

130
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:33,916
Jiao.

131
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:34,541
Jiao.

132
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,208
Jiao.

133
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,416
Jiao.

134
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,166
Jiao.

135
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,208
Why have you come again?

136
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,458
Why not?

137
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,208
You're our daughter.

138
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,166
Wherever you are, we must be there.

139
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,666
Why do you always
drive your mom and me away?

140
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,708
Exactly.

141
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,125
Wait.

142
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,625
Well...

143
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,416
Jiao.

144
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,250
Jiao.

145
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:00,916
Jiao.

146
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,458
Jiao, listen to me.

147
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,416
Let go.

148
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,958
I know you're here for money.

149
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,708
Spit it out.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,791
How much?

151
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:14,916
Jiao.

152
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,958
Will you help me pay the debt?

153
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,416
How much do you owe?

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,708
Four million yuan. It's not much.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,458
Four million?

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,708
Where can I get that much money for you?

157
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,083
You don't need to.

158
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,958
What are you all looking at?

159
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,916
I'm talking to my daughter.

160
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,250
Jiao, please.

161
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:37,958
Jiao.

162
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,333
Jiao.

163
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,666
Please.

164
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,500
Do me one favor.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,333
If you agree,

166
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,000
I will

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,791
leave immediately

168
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,041
and never bother you again.

169
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,333
What is it?

170
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,750
I have a friend.

171
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,875
He wants to invite you for a meal.

172
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,416
If you accept,

173
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,416
he will write off my debt,

174
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,458
and I'll owe nothing to him.

175
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,041
After it's done,

176
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,416
I'll leave you alone.

177
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you gonna...?

178
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,083
Are you gonna sell me again?

179
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,333
It's the last time.

180
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,583
The last time.

181
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,916
The last time.

182
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,666
Seeing as your daughter is pretty,

183
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,833
I will give you more.

184
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,166
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

185
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,666
I have to go.

186
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:33,583
Go ahead.

187
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,416
Jiao.

188
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,041
Mr. Chen is a friend of mine.

189
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,375
You keep him company.

190
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,708
I have to go.

191
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,125
Dad!

192
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,000
Dad!

193
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,083
Mr. Chen.

194
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,958
It's him again?

195
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,333
No way.

196
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
He'll make me die.

197
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,375
Jiao.

198
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,333
Jiao.

199
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,541
Mr. Chen is already here.

200
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,833
You have a meal with him.

201
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,333
Is it really just a meal?

202
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,958
Don't I know what you want to do?

203
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,250
You want money, right?

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,291
I give it to you.

205
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,000
Let me go.

206
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,458
Jiao.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,541
I've taken his money.

208
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,875
If you leave now,

209
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,083
I will be in trouble.

210
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,375
Please help me out.

211
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,208
I have money.

212
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,208
I can even borrow money.

213
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,125
I also have Mercury.

214
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,458
I can sell Mercury.

215
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,083
Meijiao.

216
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,916
He is your dad.

217
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,041
You must save him.

218
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,166
No way.

219
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,375
It's all my fault.

220
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,666
I'm a bad dad.

221
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,958
I'm worse than a beast.

222
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,916
I am a monster.

223
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,708
I even treated my daughter...

224
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,333
So...

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,666
I am a monster.

226
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,375
Jiao.

227
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,750
Don't worry.

228
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,625
I'll talk to Mr. Chen right now

229
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,958
and let him get out of here.

230
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,375
It's alright now.

231
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,458
Don't be scared.

232
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,791
Drink some juice to relax.
