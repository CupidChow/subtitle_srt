1
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,083
On the day Manqing disappeared,

2
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,875
my mom committed suicide at the theater.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,833
I was in a coma for a long time.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,291
Do you know I have

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,458
severe PTSD?

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,625
That's why I've forgotten
a lot of things.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,500
But now that I think about it,
on the day of the incident,

8
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,000
I did not see Manqing.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,833
Why was her necklace there?

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,984
Only one possibility.

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,291
She went to find my mom.

12
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,666
So there's more to your mom's suicide.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,250
Manqing went there

14
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,166
and was killed.

15
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:47,416
Is that so?

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,875
Then since we share the same goal,

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,500
I hope

18
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,875
we can work together.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,375
Only temporarily.

20
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,952
=Deep Love Love Again=
After I uncover the truth,

21
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,291
you can punish me as you wish.

22
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:11,708

(Seeking the Truth Together)

23
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,750
Today, at the theater,

24
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,333
I saw someone
who shouldn't have been there.

25
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,291
Mr. Gu?

26
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,208
Mr. Gu, is it you?

27
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,375
Mr. Gu.

28
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,125
Qiyan.

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,458
Mr. Gu.

30
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:41,958
Qiyan.

31
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,875
Is it Qiyan?

32
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:53,708
Qiyan.

33
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,583
I've set up Manqing

34
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,541
as you said.

35
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,875
I'm begging you to let me go.

36
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,083
I beg you!

37
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,041
Don't keep me locked up here!

38
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,291
I'm begging you.

39
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,041
Can't you just come back with me?

40
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,250
In Gu Qiyan's opinion,

41
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,458
we have already fallen out.

42
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,916
Then rather than going back with you,

43
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,750
I might as well stay here

44
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,458
for a while.

45
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,708
Put it on.

46
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,833
Then I won't worry about you.

Actually, from long ago,

62
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,500
I have stopped seeing you
as Manqing's replacement.

63
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,833
Can you trust me once?

64
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,875
Yes.

65
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,458
You are Gu Qingqing,

66
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:25,833
not Manqing.

67
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,500

No.

Mr. Gu,

77
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,750
when can I

78
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,708
go out?

79
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,666
Soon.

80
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,000
Hello, Qiyan.

81
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,250
Where are you?

82
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,250
You didn't check your phone.

83
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,208
Do you know I was worried
and called you dozens of times a day?

84
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,666
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,500
My phone is broken.

86
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,750
You've had fun.

87
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,458
Tell me when you're coming home.

88
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,666
I'll pick you up.

89
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,083
Okay.

90
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,291
Rest early.

91
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:29,750
Good night.

92
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,708
Qiyan.

93
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,333
Let me see your true face.

94
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,291
Mrs. Gu,

95
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,208
this is a present for you.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
You went out to have fun.

97
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,125
Why bring me a present?

98
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,041
It's nothing expensive.

99
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,458
Just a small present.

100
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,125
It's all because of Liu Yanyan.

101
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,833
After she complained to me,

102
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,250
she borrowed some money,

103
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,666
and then disappeared.

104
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,833
Liu Yanyan

105
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,666
had a grudge against me at work.

106
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,333
So in fact,

107
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,541
it's my fault I got you into trouble.

108
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:36,916
Miss Manqing,

109
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
I heard

110
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,625
Qiyan said

111
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,125
that you went to university abroad.

112
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,666
Which university was it?

113
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,291
I studied philosophy at Princeton.

114
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,416
It has nothing to do with
finance and economics.

115
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,458
Then where is your hometown?

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,666
I'm a local.

117
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,416
After moving away since I was little,

118
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,666
I still have some
faint memories of this place.

119
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,750
What memories?

120
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,250
Sometimes I have a dream,

121
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,541
in which I am drifting in the ocean.

122
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,916
Through the seawater,

123
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,333
I vaguely

124
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,708
see an abandoned theater.

125
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,291
What theater?

126
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,416
I don't know what you're talking about.

127
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,958
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:35,791
My fault.

129
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,208
Thank you.

130
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,000
Manqing,

131
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,083
don't bring up the theater

132
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,916
in front of Mom anymore.

133
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:22,666
Oh.

134
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:23,791
Got it.

135
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,291
Have you thought it over?

136
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,791
Are you willing to accept me?

137
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,541
You're right.

138
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,125
Since we're not siblings now,

139
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,625
why can't we

140
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,041
be together?

141
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,750
Manqing.

142
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,958
I'll go back now.

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,083
You should also rest early.

144
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,666
Here's your jacket.

145
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,500
Hello?

146
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,791
Pei Jinqing is probably using
Manqing to investigate

147
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,958
what we did back then.

148
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
How do you know?

149
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,500
You just bide your time.

150
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,083
Okay, I got it.
