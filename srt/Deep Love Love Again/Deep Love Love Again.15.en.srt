1
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:21,750
Mr. Gu,

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,458
where are we?

3
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:28,791
Mr. Gu...

4
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,750
I can do anything.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,500
I beg you, please!

6
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,500
Give me one more chance.

7
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,666
Yanyan,

8
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,458
do you know why I saved you?

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,083
I...

10
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,666
I arranged for you
to be by Ji Anyang's side.

11
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,541
I wanted you to keep an eye on him.

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,166
What did you do?

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,333
You hooked up with him.

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,833
No. It's not true.

15
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,083
I approached Ji Anyang

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,291
to help you get the evidence

17
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,291
that he had killed Gu Qingqing.

18
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,833
Why didn't you help Gu Qingqing?

19
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,166
=Deep Love Love Again=
You clearly knew

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,666
how important Qingqing was to me.

21
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,666
And now,

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,041
you know how much I value Manqing.

23
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,416
How could you kidnap her?

24
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,708
=Episode 15=
(The Best Actress)

25
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,458
Yanyan,

26
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:25,500
you know it.

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,458
I don't keep disobedient dogs.

28
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,500
I was wrong.

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,833
I beg you to give me one more chance.

30
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,416
Act along with me once more.

31
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,375
If you perform well,

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,083
I might consider letting you off.

33
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:07,875
Okay.

34
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:35,875
Manqing.

35
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,704
What's up?

36
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,541
I resigned.

37
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,541
That's good.

38
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,541
Just do what you used to do.

39
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,000
Enjoy your life.

40
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:45,833
Don't worry.

41
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,416
I'll look after you.

42
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:49,958
As your sister,

43
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,000
I could be an innocent girl,

44
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,000
but not as your fiancée.

45
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,750
I'll arrange a position for you.

46
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,250
But you don't have to work.

47
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,500
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

48
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,375
You're my fiancée now.

49
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,083
Care to join me for dinner?

50
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:06,541
Sure.

51
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:07,916
Bye.

52
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,041
Mr. Gu.

53
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,976
Miss Manqing.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,666
Mrs. Gu wants to talk with him.

55
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,750
Please wait for a while.

56
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:00,833
Just a moment.

57
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,208
Please.

58
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,584
Mom.

59
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,291
What's so good about this hussy?

60
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,416
If you marry her,

61
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,083
everyone knows

62
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,666
you're with Pei Jinqing's ex.

63
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,291
Do you want your father to faint again

64
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,291
after he wakes up?

65
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:36,583
Qiyan,

66
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,083
if you hook up with her,

67
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,875
I'm okay with that.

68
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,166
But you must not marry...

69
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:44,625
Enough!

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,750
I've told you

71
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,083
if it's not her,

72
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:49,666
I won't marry.

73
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:28,458
You're late.

74
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,375
Look below.

75
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:31,916
Not in the mood.

76
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,291
Play along with me.

77
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,750
Just for the person below.

78
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,750
So this is the surprise you give me.

79
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,041
Acting, huh?

80
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,875
If that old lady is provoked,

81
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,875
she'll give herself away.

82
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,666
I'm willing to be used.

83
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,000
But not with feelings.

84
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,375
Manqing,

85
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:45,958
get in the car.

86
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:46,916
Let's go see Qiyan.

87
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:56,666
Look.

88
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,541
Take a look.

89
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,708
I've told you

90
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,916
she's not suitable to be your wife.

91
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,250
Manqing,

92
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,083
how come?

93
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,916
The evidence is clear.

94
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,208
It's true.

95
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,333
You like him?

96
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,791
I suppose so.

97
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,250
I live in his house.

98
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:30,750
So shameless!

99
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,375
How can you even say that?

100
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:35,833
Mom,

101
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,000
who she likes is up to her.

102
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,916
Why are you so foolish?

103
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,791
She is your fiancée.

104
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,458
You okay with her sleeping with others?

105
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,500
Give us a moment.

106
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,125
Fine.

107
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,375
I thought

108
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,625
you just experienced a failure,

109
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,500
so you wouldn't
go into a relationship soon.

110
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,916
I used to think that too.

111
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:46,958
I guess

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,375
this must be PTSD.

113
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,458
He saved me.

114
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,708
(I turned from a walking dead)

115
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,083
(to a human being.)

116
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,041
Someone help.

117
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,333
(You saved me.)

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,416
(I am yours.)

119
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,291
(She is mine.)

120
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,958
(Whoever touches her will die.)

121
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,125
(You're safe.)

122
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,500
(Have you forgotten)

123
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,875
(our previous agreement?)

124
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,416
(You said)

125
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,125
(you would be with me forever
in her stead.)

126
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,583
(I am responsible for every decision)

127
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:09,875
(I make.)

128
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,750
(Can you?)

129
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,916
(I can.)

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,875
When I try to forget him,

131
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,375
I find

132
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,666
that he has taken root
and sprouted in my heart.

133
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,541
He can't be erased now.

134
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,166
Can you tell me

135
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,458
what you've been through?

136
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,833
I'm just

137
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,208
in love with another wrong person.
