1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,041
You are wrong again.

2
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:52,992
=Deep Love Love Again=

3
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:02,496
=Episode 1=
(I'm Dead)

4
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,666
Administer another small dose.

5
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,583
I hope when her family
is here to see her,

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,958
she cannot move.

7
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:15,833
Okay.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,458
She should look like a dead person.

9
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,041
Let me in.

10
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,750
My sister can't die like this.

11
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:47,958
Let me see her.

12
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,833
It's a serious car accident.

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,666
The mortician is doing touch-ups.

14
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,291
To avoid causing discomfort...

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,041
You cannot go in.

16
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,708
Doctor.

17
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,500
I am her husband.

18
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,625
Please let me see her one last time.

19
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,208
Please.

20
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:01,958
You can't go in.

21
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,083
I'm begging you.

22
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,166
I'm begging you.

23
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:05,583
Stop it.

24
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,500
Doctor.

25
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,000
Qingqing loved to dress up.

26
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,958
Please make her look decent.

27
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,166
Thank you.

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,625
I'm so sorry for your loss.

29
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,240
(Mortuary)

30
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,083
Is she really dead?

31
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,250
Go take a look.

32
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,791
I won't go.

33
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,250
I'm scared.

34
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,125
It's okay.

35
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,041
It's okay.

36
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,208
It's just a ring.

37
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,666
It's okay.

38
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,291
But I'm very happy.

39
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,041
Do you think I'm a bad woman?

40
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,375
How could you be?

41
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,625
You are the best woman I've ever met.

42
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,666
So now,

43
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,458
you finally belong to me.

44
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,916
Mr. Pei.

45
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,666
Thank you for being here.

46
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,041
Qingqing.

47
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,833
I can't take this.

48
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:38,708
Mr. Pei.

49
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,166
Let me say my final farewell
to Qingqing.

50
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,250
Enough.

51
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,291
Drop the act.

52
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,541
I was her husband.

53
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,583
I still have feelings for her.

54
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,375
That was close.

55
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,708
You almost wake up.

56
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,250
Why cry?

57
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,000
You should be happy to have survived.

58
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,875
The plastic surgery was very successful.

59
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,458
This is the start of our cooperation.

60
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,125
I hope you like your new face.

61
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,333
Check it out.

62
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,541
You can't do that.

63
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,083
Looks like she is hit hard.

64
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,458
We should call the police.

65
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,500
Don't be silly.

66
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,333
How are we gonna explain it
to the police?

67
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,541
Save me.

68
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,708
Help.

69
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,250
Help.

70
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,083
You're so beautiful.

71
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,416
This isn't me.

72
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,791
Then who are you?

73
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,125
Why can't I remember?

74
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,625
Am I Gu Qingqing?

75
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,708
Gu Qingqing is already dead.

76
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,916
You are now Manqing.

77
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,000
So many identical white dresses.

78
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,625
Are you a freak?

79
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,458
Is it time for an injection?

80
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,625
An injection?

81
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,208
I'm not getting it.

82
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,958
I am Manqing.

83
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,291
I am not Gu Qingqing.

84
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,041
No injection.

85
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,333
Three days
after Gu Qingqing got in a car accident,

86
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,458
her family took her to be cremated.

87
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,333
From then on,
Gu Qingqing didn't exist in this world.

88
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,541
So you are not Gu Qingqing.

89
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,791
I don't want to hear that name again.

90
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,291
You are Manqing.

91
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,416
Remember that.

92
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:31,958
Manqing.

93
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,000
Today,

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,166
Manqing is reborn.

95
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,750
I don't want to live
under someone else's identity.

96
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,375
Have you forgotten the deal between us?

97
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,625
No, I haven't.

98
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,791
You saved me.

99
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,833
Yeah, I saved you.

100
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,166
I gave you a new life.

101
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,583
You promised me

102
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,416
to bestow upon me your soul and body.

103
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,208
I think it's fair.

104
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,041
But I'd rather die now.

105
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,583
You don't have the right to die.

106
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,916
From now on,

107
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,500
without my consent,

108
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,500
you can't do anything.

109
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,000
Why do you do this?

110
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,833
Do you think you died from an accident?

111
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,000
That was a meticulously planned murder.

112
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,125
Don't you want Ji Anyang to be punished?

113
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,083
And Liu Yanyan.

114
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,500
None of them will get away with it.
