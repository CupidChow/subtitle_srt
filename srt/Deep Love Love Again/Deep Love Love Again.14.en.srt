1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,583
Mrs. Gu.

2
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,125
Miss Manqing.

3
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,875
Cinderella meets the prince.

4
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,333
That's just a fairy tale.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,916
Do you know

6
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,750
how Qiyan's sister died?

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,166
Mom.

8
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,041
How did she die?

9
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,375
She died because of a "phoenix man."

10
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,416
Mrs. Gu, are you saying

11
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,750
Cinderella will get the prince killed?

12
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,708
I brought Manqing here
just to inform you

13
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,416
Manqing is a member
of the Gu family from now on.

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,291
I'm not seeking your opinion.

15
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:12,500
Let's go.

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,784
=Deep Love Love Again=

17
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:26,221
=Episode 14=
(The Hard Choice)

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,333
You always

19
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,416
brought Qingqing to play on this lake.

20
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,208
You remember.

21
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,916
Those are all memories of Gu Qingqing.

22
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,333
For me now,

23
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,208
they don't matter anymore.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,250
Are you willing

25
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,500
to visit Dad

26
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:55,750
in her stead?

27
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,750
Sure.

28
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,375
Where's Da...

29
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,458
Where's Mr. Gu now?

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,875
You need to be prepared.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,125
Dad's condition now

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,583
isn't good.

33
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,333
(I don't want to get an injection.)

34
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,041
Then how can you get better?

35
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,166
If you're better,

36
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,291
I'll buy you ice cream.

37
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:44,791
Okay?

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,333
No.

39
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,916
How about I get an injection too?

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,250
Come.

41
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,500
Give me one.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,916
Mr. Gu.

43
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,458
You...

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,916
It's okay.

45
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:53,875
Do it.

46
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:55,833
Do it together.

47
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,333
Okay?

48
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,291
Mmm.

49
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,458
What did the doctor say?

50
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:03,916
Food poisoning.

51
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,541
Food poisoning?

52
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,833
How could that lead to a coma?

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,916
If he

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,333
knew you're visiting him,

55
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,458
he might wake up.

56
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,291
Qingqing.

57
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,083
Call me Manqing from now on

58
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,958
to avoid misunderstandings.

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Manqing,

60
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,500
about my suggestion,

61
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,333
what do you think?

62
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,125
I don't want to return to Gu Group.

63
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,833
Then

64
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,500
when will you...

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,375
In the future.

66
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,041
Please take good care of

67
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,750
Mr. Gu first.

68
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:54,916
Dad.

69
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,125
Dad, wake up.

70
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:56,458
Dad.

71
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,375
Qingqing has come to see you.

72
00:03:59,416 --> 00:03:59,708
Dad.

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,416
Open your eyes.

74
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:03,916
Look, Qingqing is here.

75
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,958
Can you wait at the door?

76
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,041
I want to be here

77
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,541
with Dad alone.

78
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:40,708
Dad.

79
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,208
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,166
Don't wake up.

81
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,000
If you wake up,

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,500
Manqing will leave here.

83
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,666
Are you going back?

84
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,500
Did you drink?

85
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,833
Have you forgotten

86
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,125
our previous agreement?

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,875
You said

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,250
you would be with me forever
in her stead.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Rest assured.

90
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,500
I'll be back after I finish.

91
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,625
Shut up!

92
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,916
Pei Jinqing, what are you doing?

93
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,916
Are you crazy?

94
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,333
I

95
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,000
am responsible for every decision

96
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,291
I make.

97
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,291
What about you?

98
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:52,708
Can you?

99
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,375
I can.

100
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,125
You did come.

101
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,666
You're quite bold.

102
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,666
You are an elder.

103
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:13,875
Qiyan said

104
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,500
he only wants you.

105
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,833
I have no other choice.

106
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,125
I can only agree
to let you enter the Gu family.

107
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,708
Miss Manqing.

108
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,416
You've decided to be with Qiyan.

109
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,833
No matter what your purpose is,

110
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,750
I have only one request.

111
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,416
You must agree to it.

112
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:39,625
What is it?

113
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,125
Resign immediately.

114
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,500
Make a clean break

115
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,833
with Pei Jinqing.

116
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,333
What if I refuse?

117
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,333
Then don't even think about
entering the Gu family.

118
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,208
You are late.

119
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,088
(Resignation Letter)

120
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
If you resign now,

121
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,833
you won't get paid.

122
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,416
It's okay.

123
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:01,458
All right.

124
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,416
Since you've

125
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,666
already written the resignation letter,

126
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,250
let's have a meal.

127
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,375
Okay.

128
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,500
Miss Manqing,

129
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,500
Mr. Pei, please.

130
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,083
Come on.

131
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,041
I hope that after you leave,

132
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,416
you will fulfill your wishes.

133
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,250
Mr. Pei,

134
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,250
does this mean
we are going separate ways?

135
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,375
What about Manqing?

136
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,625
I will investigate it myself.

137
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:12,833
Put it on me.

138
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,500
No.

139
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,708
Then why did you pierce my left ear?

140
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,041
Still no?

141
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,708
I'll put it on.

142
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:33,875
I'm putting it on.

143
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,125
I'm really going to put it on.

144
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,208
Wait a moment.

145
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,791
Don't you fear my punishment?

146
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,916
You can't bear to do it

147
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,208
to me now?

148
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:34,750
Pei Jinqing,

149
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,291
you have to trust me.
