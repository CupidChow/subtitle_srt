1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,041
Ever since then, I knew

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,791
not all mental illnesses can be cured.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:15,666
Surely,

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,583
it's because I can't form
a bond with them.

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,791
But I've been grateful

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,541
for having you in my life.

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,958
From the moment I met you,

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,166
I came to know

9
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,083
there was someone I didn't want to kill.

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,291
Why are you still living in our place?

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,333
Do you know

12
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,583
we're working on
final round of financing

13
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,875
for a public offering?

14
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,250
If the person in charge
gets involved in some scandal,

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,375
it'll have a big impact.

16
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,375
Do you understand?

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,583
You'd better get out of here.

18
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,250
I didn't hook up with Mr. Gu.

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,875
He just pities me and my daughter.

20
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,875
That's why he lent us a place to stay.

21
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,250
Isn't she your illegitimate child?

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,625
You gave birth to her

23
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,583
and came to my place.

24
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,458
What do you want?

25
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,625
Get out of here immediately!

26
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:57,541
Get lost!

27
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,083
You're a hussy.

28
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,125
You're shameless.

29
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,833
Get out!

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,875
Get out!

31
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,000
The farther, the better.

32
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,000
I hate seeing you.

33
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,291
=Deep Love Love Again=

34
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,083
From the day

35
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,041
I fabricated a story
about your mother's suicide,

36
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:18,291
=Episode 21=
(The Bloody Wedding)

37
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,291
you became my

38
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,125
most precious

39
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:27,666
exclusive pet.

40
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,583
So you killed so many people

41
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,541
just for this.

42
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:37,875
Therefore,

43
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,958
I can become your only one.

44
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,458
No one can stop me.

45
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,666
Even if the one is your mother.

46
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,875
Death

47
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,083
is her best destiny.

48
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,125
She indulged me.

49
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,666
She would do anything

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,083
to cover up my true nature.

51
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,458
She even used her death

52
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,041
to take the blame.

53
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:14,875
So...

54
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:17,625
So,

55
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,500
death might be

56
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,083
a relief for her.

57
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,120
Qingqing,

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,250
she attempted to

59
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,958
kill you by causing an accident.

60
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,333
I can't forgive her.

61
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,916
She is your mother!

62
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,916
If she truly loved me,

63
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,750
she shouldn't have set you up.

64
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,291
And Manqing.

65
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,583
I didn't want to kill her.

66
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,376
She was aware of my secret.

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,083
She must die.

68
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,708
Miss Song.

69
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:10,875
Miss Song.

70
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:20,916
It's not lost.

71
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:17,888
Jinqing,

72
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,640
there's something wrong here.

73
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,166
Manqing,

74
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:25,916
what's up?

75
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,541
I threw her

76
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,250
into the sea

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
and hanged your mom at the theater.

78
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:38,916
I fabricated

79
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:40,916
her depression

80
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,750
as the reason of suicide.

81
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,791
Why didn't you kill me as well?

82
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,291
You are my bunny.

83
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,541
How could I bear to kill you?

84
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,875
I have given you too much freedom.

85
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,666
From now on,

86
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,541
I will be stricter.

87
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:33,625
Come on.

88
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,083
Come on.

89
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,208
The dress is for you.

90
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:43,958
It suits you well.

91
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,048
Come on.

92
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,458
Isn't it nice?

93
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,160
Come on.

94
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,496
Try it on.

95
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,083
After tonight,
we'll be together forever.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,666
Mr. Pei,

97
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,500
Manqing is at the abandoned theater
owned by the Gu family.

98
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,500
Qingqing.

99
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,125
I'm coming.

100
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,416
Welcome to attend

101
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,833
my wedding with Manqing.

102
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,708
Want to see her?

103
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:06,791
Come.
